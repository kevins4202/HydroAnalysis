11700,most of the water systems that sustain the ecosystems and feed the growing human population are decreasing or stressed day by day groundwater is considered a reliable source of fresh water and its availability is usually regulated by aquifer characteristics topography sub surface activities climate and several geochemical processes the major emerging contaminants ecs come from antibiotics fire retardants pesticides sunscreens disinfection byproducts sediments organic carbon pathogens metals surfactants and drug residues the ecs can enter the environment and cause adverse human health or ecological effects the contaminants leached to groundwater from livestock farming industrial wastewater and through the application of fertilizer pesticides and slurries to agricultural land are also responsible for groundwater pollution the adjoining areas nearby landfills have a greater probability of groundwater contamination of heavy metals originating from the neighboring dumping sites knowledge about the concentration behavior and cycling of contaminants and their degradation pathways is essential to remediate these contaminants from different sources to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination the following measures like limiting and optimizing the organic and inorganic fertilizer application timing to crops disposal of pesticide waste and discarding empty containers should be as per safety guidelines effective irrigation systems will significantly reduce the passage of pesticides and fertilizers to aquatic ecosystems this paper aims o describe the occurrence and fate of emerging groundwater contaminants egcs and their possible remediation graphical abstract image 1 keywords contaminants groundwater health hazard heavy metal pesticides remediation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction clean water is essential for life however getting clean water for drinking purposes and other human needs is a major concern nowadays water quality gets polluted in many ways various anthropogenic activities such as deforestation farming urbanization ecosystem degradation and over extraction of groundwater affect different components of the hydrological cycle natural precipitation evaporation and runoff population growth and rising living standards are leading to the depletion of existing water resources chowdhury 2013 groundwater is considered a dependable source of fresh water that can be easily accessible for different human needs like irrigation and domestic as well as industrial uses singh et al 2011 gude and maganti 2021 about 3 6 billion people worldwide do not get adequate water for at least one month a year boretti and rosa 2019 the major driver of groundwater depletion is irrigation which accounts for 70 of the total water available and the increment of groundwater extractions is estimated to be 1100 km3 per year by 2050 as compared to 800 km3 per year as of 2010 wada et al 2016 boretti and rosa 2019 dalin 2021 contamination of groundwater is a major global challenge and concern in recent decades mukherjee et al 2020 in developing countries poor sanitary conditions due to population growth are affecting groundwater pollution in rural areas of developed countries groundwater contamination is primarily attributed to the application of fertilizer use of pesticides and indiscriminate use of groundwater by pumping for irrigation whereas in urban areas chemical pollutants and harmful microorganisms originating from urban development domestic and industrial wastes are the prime cause of groundwater contamination the sources of groundwater contamination are numerous and diverse the major sources of contamination are chemicals used in agriculture industrial waste discharges heavy metal pollution through mining operations the aquifer in contact with polluted streams household and municipal waste discharge and laboratory waste disposal the main routes by which contaminants enter groundwater are through seepage from shallow subsoil or surface direct entry from wells cross contamination of wells open to many aquifers and pumping mediated flow of contaminated water into freshwater aquifers and interaction with arsenic and radon as natural pollutants in geological strata and groundwater the different parameters that affect groundwater quality are the types of rocks and soils temperature pressure and hydrogeochemical processes influenced by the solubility of the soil santos et al 2008 de giglio et al 2015 the groundwater chemistry in an aquifer is mainly governed by hydro geochemical progressions along with water sediment interactions involving hydrolysis oxidation reduction adsorption cation exchange etc chakraborty et al 2021 a schematic diagram depicting the graphical summary of different emerging contaminants ecs their sources of occurrence different pathways of the entrance to groundwater and the health consequences for human beings are shown in fig 1 the contaminants from industrial hazardous waste through improper handling and accidental spilling infiltrate groundwater gw and surface water sw bodies the agricultural contaminant such as indiscriminate use of high doses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides through leaching and percolation enter subsurface soil and eventually reach groundwater as well as through groundwater surface water gw sw exchange the household wastes carrying mostly pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcs can contaminate groundwater either through municipality landfill solid wastes or through wastewater treatment plants wwtps of sewage water liquid wastes the biomedical wastes from laboratory and healthcare facilities either through liquid or solid waste enter municipal landfills and wwtps the leachates from municipal landfills pollute the nearby surface water bodies through surface runoff and even pollute groundwater through seepage and percolation the wastewaters from wwtps directly enter nearby surface water bodies from surface water bodies groundwater pollution occurs through ground water surface water gw sw exchange the retentionof contaminants from wwtps effluent in the soil through physical methods such as impaction interception diffusion and sedimentation process may subsequently leache to the groundwater the drugs and hormones used in animal husbandry activities and fish cultures such as 17 beta oestradiol progesterone testosterone zeranol trenbolone melengestrol acetate etc also contribute significantly to groundwater contamination through seepage and percolation of the excretory products contaminated groundwater affecting the soil plant animal continuum leads to severe health consequences in humans and aquatic animals groundwater contamination throughout the globe is a major challenge for the sustainability of ecosystems rapid industrialization urbanization and economic growth mediated huge contaminants generation are one of the major contributors to groundwater contamination there is scanty information on the presence of contaminants in groundwater at a level that is harmful to human health keeping this in view the present paper describes the sources of contaminants and their transport through the soil systems to contaminate the groundwater and its remediation technologies 2 emerging groundwater contaminants the occurrence of newly identified compounds from the wastes of varied origins such as industrial agricultural household and municipal hospital and biomedicals from the groundwater which previously remained unmonitored and undetected can be regarded as emerging groundwater contaminants egcs kapelewska et al 2018 sharma et al 2019 rout et al 2020 broadly these are fungicides insecticides pesticides drugs from the pharmaceutical industry personal care products pcps microplastics artificial sweeteners ass endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs uv filters manufactured nanomaterials perfluorinated chemicals pfcs per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass disinfection byproducts dbps etc gogoi et al 2018 tran et al 2018 nawaz and sengupta 2019 the household and municipal wastes also include electronic waste e waste e waste is generated due to a tremendous increase in electronic equipment usage along with their shorter life span which eventually adds more electronic equipment to the user the improper disposal of old used and discarded products poses a serious threat to human health as they contain many hazardous substances including heavy metals such as lead mercury and cadmium joon et al 2017 houessionon et al 2021 the detection of contaminants even in trace amounts is possible due to the development of advanced analytical methods snow et al 2019 the various egcs are categorically divided into agriculture contaminants geogenic contaminants industrial waste and landfill contaminants household and municipal waste contaminants and bio medical waste contaminants including wastes from hospitals pathological laboratories and different research institutes carrying out modern biology research these egcs originating from different routes are summarized in table 1 the acceptable limits of these contaminants in the drinking water from india and the global data are included in table 1 from the bureau of indian standards bis department of water supply and sanitation government of punjab india the united states environmental protection agency epa world health organization who that could give a comparative data between india and world as a whole 3 agriculture contaminant the various emerging agricultural contaminants in groundwater are nutrients nitrates phosphates and pesticides insecticides herbicides and fungicides 3 1 nitrate 3 1 1 occurrence and fate of nitrate in groundwater the nitrogen fertilizers release nitrates no3 upon application to soil for crop production nitrogen is the major nutrient and is applied extensively in agriculture to enhance crop production however the excess application can cause soil water and air pollution lee et al 2021 the excess nitrates which are not taken by the plant percolate along with irrigation water and rainfall through the soil profile below the root zone to contaminate the groundwater the groundwater contamination with nitrate has become a severe problem in many parts of india the threshold value of nitrate contamination from agricultural sources in the groundwater is 50 mg l as per european union eu directive 91 676 efc ayyasamy et al 2009 observed nitrate contamination from 40 to 1000 mg l in most parts of rajasthan bhilwara rajsamand udaipur and dungarpur intensive agriculture areas like punjab andhra pradesh west bengal haryana and uttar pradesh receive an extensive dose of nitrogenous fertilizer have also been reported to have nitrate contamination kundu et al 2008 3 1 1 1 health hazard the nitrate concentration of more than 10 mg l in groundwater for drinking is harmful as per epa environmental protection agency usa nitrate is highly soluble in water and it can be reduced to a highly toxic and carcinogenic form n nitroso via nitrite form in animal bodies through drinking water ghaeminia and mokhtarani 2018 rout et al 2021a high concentrations of nitrate in water cause blue baby syndrome or methemoglobinemia morales suarez varela et al 1995 observed prostate and gastrointestinal cancer due to the intake of nitrate contaminated water grant et al 1996 observed abortion in pregnant women due to a deficiency of oxygen for the developing fetus 3 1 2 remediation of nitrate contamination nitrate is readily soluble in water due to which it is highly challenging to remove from contaminated water sources efficiently many chemical physical and biological approaches have been implemented to remove nitrate from contaminated waters including adsorption ion exchange electrodialysis reverse osmosis catalytic reduction denitrification and bio chemical denitrification processes rout et al 2017a in the adsorption ion exchange process the nitrate containing water is passed through a resin bed containing chloride or bicarbonate ions where the nitrate ions were exchanged till the resin was exhausted whereas in the electrodialysis process the nitrate ion is separated from contaminated water sources by the use of cation anion exchange membranes reverse osmosis at a pressure varied from 300 to 1500 psi was also used to remediate the nitrate contamination bioremediation by denitrifying bacteria and microbes efficiently reduce nitrate content in water and these are extensively used due to their cost effective treatment processes winkler and straka 2019 rout et al 2018 geng et al 2007 observed that the successful reduction of nitrate in groundwater through catalytic reduction using sodium formate over the catalyst and the removal efficiency was 87 permeable reactive barrier prb is an in situ method for the treatment of contaminated groundwater in which reactive materials such as activated carbon zero valence iron zeolite steel slag wood cheeps sponge iron scrap rubber and medical stone are used to alter the property of contaminants by reversible absorption and irreversible redox reactions ye et al 2019 these innovative methods integrated with other technologies can also be effective enough to remove nitrate contamination ghaeminia and mokhtarani 2018 showed that prb combined with the application of direct current such as electrokinetic ek technology improved nitrate removal as high as 90 efficiency contaminate water containing nitrates lacking organic compounds can also be effectively made pollution free by using an h2 based autotrophic denitrification process by controlling the ph of the water source xing et al 2020 recently liang et al 2021 proposed an innovative method named microbial electrolysis cell integrated with gas diffusion membrane mmec to remediate nitrate contamination with more than 90 efficiency 3 2 phosphates 3 2 1 occurrence and fate of phosphates in groundwater phosphorus is the second major nutrient needed by plants for their growth and proliferation the phosphatic fertilizer releases different forms of phosphate like h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 to the soil predominantly phosphorous in the form of orthophosphates h2po4 hpo4 2 is preferred by the plants as a nutrient rout et al 2014 2016a the soluble phosphates which are excess and or not absorbed by the plant can contaminate the groundwater causing eutrophication phosphate contaminates the groundwater through point and non point sources rout et al 2017c the point sources of phosphate contamination include industrial discharges effluents from wastewater treatment plants etc while non point sources include agricultural runoff weathering of phosphate rocks direct input by animals erosion and sedimentation 3 2 1 1 health hazard the phosphate concentration of 5 mg l in drinking water is the permissible limit according to epa vorland et al 2017 observed that the continuous use of groundwater beyond the permissible limit caused kidney damage and osteoporosis to prevent eutrophication usepa 1986 has set the limit of discharge of phosphate to water bodies at 0 05 mg l while to prevent algal growth the limit is between 0 01 and 0 03 mg l accumulation of phosphorous in waterbodies favors the growth of toxin producing algae and cyanobacteria which cause affect human health and are also not suitable for irrigation akpor 2011 excess phosphate intake may adversely affect the balance of macro and micronutrients in humans and is also usually related to kidney disease and cardiovascular health smith et al 2010 bellasi et al 2011 bird and eskin 2021 3 2 2 remediation of phosphate contamination the soil microflora plays a major role in the remediation of phosphates in groundwater bacteria like pseudomonas aeromonas coliform proteobacteria and bacillus cereus are used for the removal of phosphate from wastewater ahemad 2015 ying and wei 2019 rout et al 2017b bacteria use phosphates during the aerobic phase and accumulate them as polyphosphate reserves rout et al 2021b further a bacterial consortium of pseudomonas sp bacillus sp and enterobacter sp in the presence of lactose can reduce the phosphate in the water below the permissible limit within 72 h krishnaswamy et al 2009 the inorganic form of phosphate can be removed by the addition of coagulants the multivalent metal ions like calcium aluminum and iron are generally used for the removal of phosphates altaf et al 2021 3 3 pesticides 3 3 1 occurrence and fate of pesticides in groundwater pesticides are used in agriculture to control weeds insect pests and diseases the pesticides are classified as herbicides insecticides nematicides and fungicides pesticides like ddt dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane with a half life of 10 15 years have extremely low solubility and leach to groundwater gupta et al 2006 priyadarshini et al 2021 the leaching of pesticides to groundwater through the soil profile occurs due to a movement of pesticides along with water through macropores root channels and cracks known as preferential flow and b slow movement of pesticide water through small pores of the soil known as matrix flow 3 3 1 1 health hazard long exposure to high doses of pesticides can cause cancer birth defects and damage to the nervous system the harmful effects of pesticides are systemic poisoning skin and eye irritation dizziness headaches nausea vomiting fatigue and abdominal pain 3 3 2 remediation of pesticide contamination a number of remediation technologies are available either in situ in contaminated soils or by treating contaminated wastewater depending on the type and concentration of pesticides and many other factors such as the extent of contamination soil and climatic conditions etc the treatment technologies are adopted biochar charcoal produced from solid wastes and other biomass through pyrolysis under oxygen free conditions is very effective in adsorbing organic contaminants and heavy metals biochar has been demonstrated to reduce the organic contaminants from soils and is very effective in the sorption of the herbicide isoproturon sopeña et al 2012 many advanced technologies such as immobilization ex situ soil washing and in situ soil flushing to separate pesticides from soils application of solvents surfactants and biosurfactants could be utilized morillo and villaverde 2017 villa et al 2010 successfully remediated soil contaminated by ddt and dde dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and contaminated wastewater by using non ionic surfactant tx 100 through a solar photo fenton process manickam et al 2012 studied the effect of several biosurfactants sophorolipid rhamnolipid etc on biodegradation and solubilization of hexa chloro cyclo hexane and observed that sophorolipid exhibited the maximum degradation and superior solubilization chemical oxidation reduction methods and bioremediation methods are other viable alternatives to deal with the removal of pesticides mostly from contaminated soil sites morillo and villaverde 2017 phytoremediation growing plants to absorb and detoxify chemicals and microbial use of bacteria fungus cyanobacteria etc remediation technologies are gaining importance due to their low cost and eco friendly nature over the conventional physical chemical methods bhat et al 2020 by following the recommended application practices such as applying pesticides at an economic threshold limit to insect pest damage determining the soil types and leaching index before pesticide application applying at the required target site avoiding wells and surface water streams delaying irrigation 1 2 days after pesticide application and maintaining a record of pesticide application to prevent the overuse in subsequent spray applications can minimize the pesticide contamination from groundwater 4 geogenic contaminant 4 1 fluoride 4 1 1 occurrence and fate of fluoride in groundwater the fluoride contamination of groundwater around the globe is a major problem the fluorite caf2 and apatite ca5 cl f oh po4 3 present in igneous and sedimentary rocks are the most common mineral of fluoride and have low water solubility the geogenic source such as weathering of fluoride containing minerals exists in rock and sediments and releases fluoride to groundwater yadav et al 2018 and fluoride mobility in soil is highly dependent on soil ph and the presence of clay minerals and their sorption properties the high rate of applications of fluoride based pesticides like fludioxonil deflufenican etc leads to fluride leaching to subsurface soil and adsorbed on clay minerals that eventually reach groundwater mukherjee and singh 2018 yadav et al 2019 people from asia and africa are liable to suffer from fluorosis and other health defects by consuming fluoride contaminated water kut et al 2016 sikdar 2019 yadav et al 2019 the asian countries for instance india pakistan china japan mongolia saudi arabia and yemen are highly affected by fluoride contamination with 5 0 mg l and within india the states like punjab haryana rajasthan madhya pradesh assam and west bengal reported higher concentrations of fluoride in groundwater 9 0 mg l with states like bihar jharkhand chhattisgarh and jammu and kashmir have less fluoride 1 5 3 0 mg l contamination than other states yadav et al 2019 4 1 1 1 health hazard the continuous use of groundwater having high fluoride content 1 5 mg l leads to fluorosis the fluorosis may be of skeletal dental and non skeletal types non skeletal fluorosis results in ill effects on skeletal muscle gastrointestinal system erythrocytes ligaments or combined effect on all the mentioned organ and organ systems guissouma et al 2017 yadav et al 2018 4 1 2 remediation of fluoride contamination different methods can be adopted for the removal of fluoride from contaminated water sources such as coagulation precipitation ion exchange adsorption nanofiltration reverse osmosis dialysis electrodialysis electrocoagulation etc yadav et al 2019 in the coagulation precipitation method the removal of fluoride is carried out by coagulation followed by precipitation using chemicals such as alum poly aluminum chloride lime poly aluminum hydroxy sulfate and brushite nanoparticles have a wider application and are potentially effective in reducing pollutants level from varied sources nano hydroxyapatite nhap has been used for the immobilization of heavy metals due to its large specific surface area low water solubility and biocompatibility as nhap can retain fluoride anions with the oh ion present on them it can potentially alleviate soil fluoride contamination by increasing the soil fluoride bioavailability to crop plants and simultaneously reducing groundwater contamination gan et al 2021 4 2 salinity 4 2 1 occurrence and fate of salinity in groundwater the salinity is a global issue and becomes more havoc in water scarce semi arid and arid regions where groundwater is the chief water source in the punjab region of india the groundwater salinity was found to surpass the allowable electrical conductivity ec limit of 1500 μs cm1 at least in 14 locations out of the 21 locations analyzed krishan et al 2017 and the groundwater salt concentration is about 19 32 g l in australia which is having highest salt affected soils in the world castaño sánchez et al 2020 the increasing salinity resulting from depletion of the water table following the over pumping of groundwater does not cause any harmful health impacts as associated with other geogenic contaminants the major cause of salinity in groundwater depends on several factors like the downward movement of superficial saline water upward movement of deep saline water dissolution of vaporite and fossil seawater the groundwater salinity in the coastal areas is caused by the intrusion of seawater and sea spray overexploitation of groundwater in coastal areas causes seawater intrusion resulting in deterioration of groundwater quality for future use kim et al 2005 4 2 1 1 health hazard high chloride concentrations in the groundwater causes the water unsuitable for human consumption and industrial uses excessive concentration of chlorine in groundwater for irrigation causes toxicity problems in crop plants leaf burning and defoliation in sensitive crops however high sodium ion concentration can lead to high blood pressure and certain heart disease predominantly in vulnerable individuals 4 2 2 remediation of salinity contamination growing halophytic plants that can accumulate salts in the saline contaminated soils is a highly promising approach due to their specific mechanism to exclude salts through phytostabilization carpobrutus rossii phytoextraction tamarix sp phytovolatilization poplar sp phytohydraulics salix alba and phytodegradation sarcobatus vermiculatus processes nouri et al 2017 the remediation of salinity from water sources can be undertaken by practicing different distillation methods such as solar humidification multi stage flash membrane distillation vapor compression and using membrane technologies the membrane technology involves the passing of salinity contaminated water through a semi permeable membrane to filter out unwanted non dissolved or dissolved constituents the various membrane processes are microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis forward osmosis electrodialysis etc which are engaged in the selective removal of different contaminants ingiaimo 2014 shahid et al 2020 4 3 iron and manganese 4 3 1 occurrence and fate of iron and manganese in groundwater 4 3 1 1 iron iron is a vital mineral element required during the metabolism of animals and plants the high concentrations of iron in groundwater form red oxyhydroxide precipitates and cause staining in laundry and plumbing fixtures thus iron in high concentration is an undesirable impurity in the supply of water for domestic and industrial use the solubility of iron in groundwater is controlled by the presence of dissolved oxygen and its degree of acidity i e its ph iron can occur in two forms fe2 and fe3 depending on the dissolved oxygen status of groundwater at higher dissolved oxygen concentration 1 2 mg l fe3 form exists while the fe2 form prevails in lower concentration although fe2 is soluble at the normal ph of water fe3 is insoluble the presence of organic matter in groundwater increases the solubility of fe2 ions due to the depletion of oxygen concentration following the decomposition of organic matter on pumping the water to the surface the dissolved iron gets oxidized to fe3 in the presence of atmospheric oxygen and forms rust colored iron minerals 4 3 1 1 1 health hazard the safe level of iron in groundwater for drinking is 0 3 mg l who continuous intake of excessive amounts of iron causes iron overload iron overload can lead to haemochromatosis which damages the organs and organ systems early indications include weight loss fatigue and joint pain but it can lead to liver problems heart disease and diabetes in severe cases 4 3 1 2 manganese manganese is present in the soil water sediment and biological materials the manganese concentrations in groundwater through the natural leaching process depend largely on the existing mineral types in the aquifer manganese is more commonly found in deeper wells where the water generally remains in contact with rock for a longer period the manganese concentration in groundwater is comparatively less than iron and it often occurs together with iron manganese mobility in soils largely depends on the acidity of the soil wetness soil organic matter biological activity in the soil etc the availability and solubility of manganese are low in soil with high ph and organic matter while the availability is more in acid soils with low organic matter content further the solubility of manganese under anaerobic conditions is high at ph above 6 0 and decreases in aerobic conditions at ph below 5 5 4 3 1 2 1 health hazard the safe level of manganese in groundwater for drinking according to who is 0 4 mg l and as per bis the safe level is 0 1 mg l high intake of manganese causes irreversible neurological conditions comparable to parkinson s disease and is accumulated in the brain especially in the basal ganglia relatively high doses of manganese cause mutations in mammalian cells and microorganisms and affect dna replication 4 3 2 remediation of iron and manganese contamination the different methods to remove iron and manganese from contaminated waters are oxidation and filtration ion exchange sequestration and phosphate treatment to avert the oxidation of iron and manganese krishnakumari et al 2018 during the filtration and oxidation process the manganese and iron are oxidized to form insoluble complexes the common chemical oxidizing agents used are chlorine dioxide chlorine ozone and potassium permanganate khadse et al 2015 as a low cost alternative oxygen in the air can also be used as an oxidizing agent for the removal of small quantities of iron and manganese from water the ion exchange method is used because high levels of manganese and iron in water may cause rapid clogging in this process sodium saturated synthetic resins solid phase are used for the exchange of unwanted ions in water in the sequestration process the added chemicals to groundwater at the pump intake or the wellhead come in contact with chlorine or air adding polyphosphates before chlorination is one of the most inexpensive and effective methods for lessening manganese and iron problems if the water contains less than 1 0 0 3 mg l of iron and manganese respectively metaphosphate tripolyphosphate pyrophosphate etc can be used for the sequestration process simultaneous application of chlorine and sodium silicate has also been explored to sequester manganese and iron 4 4 heavy metal heavy metals are metallic chemical elements with a high specific density of more than 5 g ml and are generally toxic at low concentrations the various heavy metals comprise arsenic as chromium cr cadmium cd nickel ni lead pb and antimony sb heavy metals are natural elements on the earth s surface and resistant to degradation or destruction the heavy metals enter the human and animal bodies through the air drinking water and food the impact of heavy metal pollution on plant health and the soil ecosystem cannot be avoided although a few metals such as mn zn cu and mo in trace amounts contribute to plant nutrition the soil microflora fauna and plant growth are severely affected due to significant toxicity srivastava et al 2017 4 4 1 arsenic 4 4 1 1 occurrence and fate of arsenic in groundwater arsenic being a metalloid is one of the most harmful inorganic contaminants present in groundwater around 70 4 million people in india are in the risk zone of groundwater arsenic toxicity chakraborti et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2021 groundwater arsenic contamination is endemic to countries like india china mexico argentina and bangladesh singh 2006 reported the incidence of high arsenic contamination in groundwater in different indian states of bihar chhattisgarh north eastern states uttar pradesh and west bengal the arsenic concentration in groundwater of 79 blocks in the eight districts of west bengal has a high arsenic level beyond the allowable limit of 0 01 mg l world health organization 2021 and the maximum contaminant level mcl for drinking water to limit the concentration below 10 μg l nath et al 2019 in the groundwater a high concentration of arsenic is due to its presence in the weathered volcanic rocks sedimentary rocks fossil fuels and geothermal areas the mobility of arsenic in groundwater depends on various factors like adsorption oxidation reduction dissolution precipitation and co precipitation halim et al 2009 naik et al 2010 4 4 1 1 1 health hazard the high concentration of arsenic in groundwater causes various health problems like heart failure myocardial depolarization gastrointestinal effects abdominal colic and respiratory distress because of irritation of mucous membranes resulting in rhinitis or laryngitis bronchitis etc skin disorders caused by long term arsenic ingestion include hypopigmentation in the face neck and back generalized hyperkeratosis and warts or corns on the palms and soles 4 4 1 2 remediation of arsenic contamination arsenic elimination from water by various physicochemical methods such as precipitation adsorption ion exchange electrocoagulation membrane processes and biological methods such as microbial treatment and phytoremediation has been widely used nath et al 2019 kumar et al 2019 the multivalent metal ions like al3 and fe3 adsorb arsenic from groundwater followed by co precipitation which is the most common practice for the removal of arsenic from water the precipitated arsenic is separated by sedimentation followed by sand filtration or microfiltration the best and most effective treatment involves coagulation of arsenic with aluminum and iron salts and lime softening the electrostatically held ions on a solid phase surface are exchanged for dissolved ions of a similar charge in the liquid phase the anion exchange resin is generally used as a solid the negatively charged as v species can be removed in the ion exchange process while for the removal of as iii it is necessary to oxidize it to as v for its complete removal the membrane techniques include reverse osmosis ultrafiltration electro dialysis and nano filtration where synthetic membranes are used to remove arsenic these processes remove arsenic through filtration electrostatic repulsion size exclusion and adsorption of arsenic bearing compounds in the adsorptive process water is passed through a contact bed containing multivalent metal ions where arsenic is adsorbed and removed by chemical reactions in india and bangladesh activated alumina based sorptive media are being used for the elimination of arsenite arsenate and phosphorous from water ferric hydroxide granules are highly effective adsorbents kumar et al 2019 bioremediation through biomethylation of as in contaminated soils and aquatic sources is an effective ecofriendly approach to remediation ranjan et al 2020 aquatic plants like azolla and spirodella duckweed species are generally used to remove arsenic from the water rahman and ravenscroft 2003 observed arsenic accumulation of 175 g day by duckweed plants from the pond of a 1 ha area in situ microbial remediation is another promising approach to arsenic remediation gupta et al 2021 4 4 2 lead 4 4 2 1 occurrence and fate of lead in groundwater the major lead pb contamination of groundwater occurs through industrial sources such as chemical manufacturing battery manufacturing metal smelting and processing secondary metals production and lead contaminated waste processing lead enters water bodies and land typically in the form of elemental lead oxides and hydroxides of lead and lead metal oxy anion complexes smith et al 1995 the solubility of lead in groundwater depends on ph dissolved salts concentrations and mineral types a major part of the lead in groundwater occurs as undissolved precipitates of pbco3 pb oh 2 pb2o and pbso4 or as sorbed ions or mineral surface coatings or as suspended organic matter 4 4 2 1 1 health hazard according to the who the permissible limit of lead in drinking water is 10 μg l ppb world health organization 2021 lead has adverse effects on human health like reproductive impairment kidney problems high blood pressure and mental illness thereby considered a heavy metal of major public health concern ho et al 2002 potthoff 1991 4 4 2 2 remediation of lead contamination sorption mobility reduction of the metals by oxidation or immobilization prb and various biological methods can be utilized for achieving higher removal efficiency of lead from groundwater sources the sorption processes depend on the ph ionic strength metal concentration type of ion adsorbent dosage temperature time surface area and nature of the adsorbent biela and šopíková 2017 observed that lead could be removed from water by the use of sorption material like bayoxide e33 ramdani et al 2020 observed that the use of synthetic hydroxyapatite sy hap for 15 min completely adsorbed pb2 with removal efficiencies of 90 91 from wastewater of industrial effluents the pumice perlite mixture and pumice lime perlite mixture in the ratios of 1 1 and 2 2 1 respectively can be used as effective reactive media in prb for lead removal from water ranjbar et al 2017 the mobility of lead in groundwater can be reduced by immobilization or by performing chemical reactions such as oxidation reduction and neutralization reactions dai et al 2018 reported that biochar and phosphate added soils were very effective in eliminating lead from polluted groundwater with corresponding removal efficiencies of 94 2 and 84 5 through immobilization technology yucca decipiens extracts were used as biosurfactants to remove lead from groundwater of a mining community using the spherical agglomeration technique sat plants and microbes having bioaccumulation phytoextraction phytostabilization rhizofiltration and bio leaching characteristics are also widely used as bioremediation methods to ameliorate the metal contaminations including lead from groundwater resources nouri et al 2017 sharma and reddy 2004 4 4 3 chromium 4 4 3 1 occurrence and fate of chromium in groundwater chromium cr occurs naturally only in compound form but not in elemental form and the major sources of chromium contamination are the electroplating processes and chromium containing wastes disposal smith et al 2010 under aerobic conditions cr vi is the dominant form in shallow aquifers key cr vi species comprise chromate cro4 2 and dichromate cr2o7 2 that get precipitated in reacting with metal cations ba2 ag and pb2 cr vi is the most toxic form and is also more mobile the non adsorbed and soluble chromium complexes can leach into groundwater from the soil the higher the soil ph the more the leachability of cr vi 4 4 3 1 1 health hazard the allowable limit of cr vi in drinking water according to the who is 0 05 ppm world health organization 2020 whereas as per epa it is 100 parts per billion ppb or 0 1 mg l of total chromium cr vi causes health issues including nose irritations and nosebleeds skin rash allergic reactions ulcers kidney and liver damage weakened immune system genetic material alteration and even in the worst condition chromium poisoning leads to the death of the individual 4 4 3 2 remediation of chromium contamination activated carbon is found to be very effective in removing cr vi a prb using a 1 1 mass ratio of activated carbon and cast iron as reactive media showed a higher chromium removal rate of 3 806 mg g than that of the individual media and resulted in no secondary pollution of groundwater huang et al 2017 the pyrolysis of eucalyptus bark at 500 c under an oxygen free atmosphere produces a carbonaceous black porous material called eucalyptus bark biochar ebb has the potential to remove all cr vi from chromium contaminated groundwater and chrome tanning wastewater choudhary et al 2017 ion exchange filtration methods can also effectively remove cr vi ions from aqueous mixtures the resin used in ion exchange filtration depends on the adsorbent dose the initial cr vi ion concentration the solution ph and the contact time adsorption efficiency as high as 99 was observed when ceralite ira 400 anion exchange resin was used and 100 mg l of initial cr vi ion concentration was maintained kumar et al 2008 the nanoscopic zero valent iron nzvi shows great reactivity for the removal of chromium from water which has been successfully utilized to remove cr vi by iron nanoparticles supported on mgo grains mgo nzvi siciliano 2016 microorganisms such as algae fungi and phyto and zoo planktons bacteria can also be effective approaches in reducing the toxic concentration of cr vi to its less toxic state cr iii mtimunye et al 2017 reported that using cultures of bacillus cereus and enterococcus sp in the presence of natural carbon sources they removed 93 removal of cr vi from a continuous feed of contaminated water with a chromium content of 40 60 mg l 4 4 4 cadmium 4 4 4 1 occurrence and fate of cadmium in groundwater cadmium cd occurs in nature generally in the form of cds or cdco3 the most usual forms of cadmium are cd2 cd oh 2 and cadmium cyanide complexes smith et al 1995 hu et al 2015 at high ph the dominant forms of cadmium are carbonate cdco3 solids and hydroxide cd oh 2 while at lower ph 8 cd2 and aqueous sulfate species are the prevailing forms the mining of sulfide ores from zinc copper and lead contributed a significant amount of cadmium as a by product cadmium contamination occurs through the dumping of cadmium containing wastes such as ni cd batteries the colouration of plastic and various discarded electronic products as well as through phosphate fertilizers which leach into the soil and further to groundwater idrees et al 2018 4 4 4 1 1 health hazard as per epa the maximum contaminant level mcl of cadmium in drinking water should be 0 005 mg l cadmium being a powerful neurotoxic metal the government of india has set a maximum permissible limit of 0 003 mg l in drinking water bis is10500 2012 the cadmium at very low concentrations is extremely toxic cadmium can enter the human body through contaminated water and has an extensive half life of 10 33 years in the human body the long standing exposure to cadmium causes disturbed calcium metabolism in the body as it can replace calcium due to similar ionic properties kubier et al 2019 also cause other adverse health effects in humans such as renal damage lung cancer and prostate cancer the chronic cadmium poisoning causing itai itai disease was first discovered in japan in the early 20th century 4 4 4 2 remediation of cadmium contamination the cadmium from soil and water is effectively adsorbed in biochar made from vinegar residue at 700 c li et al 2018 observed that the application of 10 biochar was most effective for the soil having cadmium contamination levels of 1 0 or 2 5 mg kg 1 while 5 biochar application was effective for the soils with cadmium levels of 0 5 mg cd kg 1 therefore biochar could be explored as a promising alternative for cadmium remediation in soil and water prb using replaceable semi permanent or permanent reactive media can be applied at the sub surface level through the flow path of a contaminated groundwater plume to reduce the cadmium contamination effectively the water is permitted to move through its natural gradient thus making a passive treatment system the use of nano metal oxides like zinc oxide zno titanium oxides tio2 magnesium oxide mgo hydrous manganese dioxide mno2 and iron oxides through the process of adsorption is another viable option to remove cadmium from groundwater mahdavi et al 2013 bioremediation by biosorbent calotropis procera giant milkweed is effectively utilized to treat industrial effluents or groundwater contaminated with cadmium the cadmium biosorption capacity of leached biomass of calotropis procera was reported to be 51 5 mg g against 40 mg g by the unleached biomass pandey et al 2008 4 4 5 nickel 4 4 5 1 occurrence and fate of nickel in groundwater nickel ni is extensively disseminated in the environment and present in the air water and soil in different forms it is essential for the plants at low concentrations while it is toxic at high concentrations the typical content of nickel in the earth s crust is around 0 008 the nickel goes into the groundwater through leaching and dissolution of nickel ore bearing rocks which are in contact with the downward flow of water different anthropogenic activities like metal mining fossil fuel burning smelting disposal of municipal and industrial wastes and application of fertilizers and manures significantly contribute to nickel contamination to groundwater acid rain has the propensity to mobilize nickel present in the soil and increase its concentrations in the groundwater 4 4 5 1 1 health hazard the allowable limit of nickel in drinking water is 0 1 mg l as per epa while the safe limit according to bis is 0 02 mg l a very frequently observed harmful health impact of nickel in human beings is an allergic reaction the other detrimental health effects observed in individuals who have breathed nickel containing dust while working in nickel processing plants include reduced lung function chronic bronchitis lung cancer and nasal sinus 4 4 5 2 remediation of nickel contamination the nickel from the soil and water is removed by the use of zero valent iron nanoparticles jin et al 2006 observed that the metal to solution ratio of 20 g l of commercial iron powder effectively removed ni2 from the contaminated water in 60 min at room temperature coagulation reduces zeta potential resulting in a reduction of repulsive forces between colloidal particles and granulated lime was used as a coagulant to achieve higher nickel removal efficiency 98 from contaminated water lee et al 2007 hussain et al 2010 used eichhornia crassipes water hyacinth for phytoremediation of ni2 contaminated soil and water and that could remove 24 23 μg ni per gram dry weight of the plants 4 4 6 antimony 4 4 6 1 occurrence and fate of antimony in groundwater antimony sb is a metal and the natural sources are soil water and rocks stibnite sb2s3 and jamesonite pb4fesb6s14 are the two major ores of antimony antimony has mostly industrial applications such as antimony oxides are used as flame retardants in plastics other industrial applications include lead acid batteries polyethylene terephthalate pet production as polycondensation catalyst and pump sealants nishad and bhaskarapillai 2021 antimony contamination in groundwaters is mostly due to weathering of rocks containing antimony and anthropogenic sources and a concentration of 0 005 mg l antimony sb is widely distributed especially in the mine areas of many countries hao et al 2020 4 4 6 1 1 health hazard the allowable limits of antimony varies from 0 020 mg l who to 0 006 mg l epa hao et al 2020 antimony has similar toxicity to arsenic and excess antimony level may lead to health issues such as skin problems neurological disorders cancer etc wang et al 2018 xu et al 2019 hao et al 2020 4 4 6 2 remediation of antimony contamination antimony from groundwater and other water sources can be removed by various technologies utilizing hybrid membrane technologies such as coagulation flocculation ultrafiltration cf uf coagulation flocculation sedimentation cfs electrocoagulation sorption phytoremediation and bioremediation utilizing microbes du et al 2014 guo et al 2018 long et al 2018 cao et al 2020 hao et al 2020 aster subulatus accumulated 410 mg kg 1 of antimony in an antimony mining area and could be utilized as a promising phytoremediation species long et al 2018 many sulfate reducing bacteria are known which are effective in the removal of antimony wang et al 2013 5 household and municipal waste contaminant 5 1 occurrence and fate of household and municipal waste contaminants in groundwater modernization and rapid urbanization contribute to increased waste production globally the household waste from these urban areas is collected by municipal corporations with proper management practices whereas rural household waste management is strictly unregulated or does not undergo treatment procedures this in the long run could impose significant environmental concerns in rural areas plastics are most popular in various sectors due to their low cost ease of availability and adaptability high strength and many other advantages however they are also becoming a major concern due to their poor biodegradable property which pollute the environment das et al 2022 vaid et al 2021 plastics with less than 5 mm in size are considered microplastics and also treated as emerging contaminants due to the frequent occurrence in groundwater as well as the cause of many ill effects on humans rout et al 2022 koelmans et al 2019 ren et al 2021 the typical household waste and municipal wastes broadly consist of organic and inorganic materials and specifically food wastes leathers plastics paper metals cardboard textiles glass batteries unused and expired medicines and even a few other ecs that enter into the sewage systems such as detergents and pcps jouhara et al 2017 drugs hormones used in animal husbandry practices such as 17 beta oestradiol progesterone testosterone zeranol trenbolone melengestrol acetate etc are other sources of ecs kumar et al 2019 priyanka and mohapatra 2020 the residual drugs hormones from animal bodies through their excretion and fecal matter enter subsurface soils that can be leached into the groundwater nawaz and sengupta 2019 pcps such as antidandruff shampoo fluoride containing toothpaste skin moisturizers deodorants face and body cleansers hair removal creams and other cosmetics etc contain chemicals and drugs which can also have a significant impact on water pollution when mixed with environments from discarded containers for example the antidandruff shampoo contains many organic and inorganic compounds including some drugs to inhibit fungal growth such as miconazole nitrate this drug has been detected in biosolids from wastewater treatment plants wwtp and sewage sludge peysson and vulliet 2013 tran et al 2018 in indian wwtps pcps have been detected as high as 537 μg l in the influent waters mohapatra et al 2016 sucralose aspartame and much other ass are used as sugar substitutes in many dietary products and used for human consumption through human excretion these enter the wastewater and sewage system saucedo vence et al 2017 the solid wastes which are otherwise known as municipal solid wastes msw are dumped in the municipal landfills which could be a major source of pharmaceuticals due to the presence of expired drugs and many other pharmaceuticals disposed of from diverse sources another type of contaminant found in msw is hazardous substances in the form of paints batteries mercury containing waste such as broken thermometers and many other household wastes rout et al 2016b these household hazardous wastes are highly unregulated unlike the industrial hazardous wastes and from the landfills along with the transformed products of pharmaceuticals and pcps these can reach groundwater via subsurface soil percolation and eventually leads to groundwater pollution slack et al 2005 these wastes in the landfills undergo physical chemical and biological transformation and when mixed with rainwater or other moisture carrying wastes can develop different toxic nontoxic by products samadder et al 2017 these aqueous liquid products thus can add more ecs to pollute groundwater the sewage and wastewaters are usually undergone some pre treatment procedures in wwtps to remove organic and toxic compounds toxic compounds may be degraded through chemical and biological using microbes means but due to the varied chemical nature of ecs incomplete degradation or bio transformation may occur which also contributes to its presence in natural aquatic systems the sucralose was detected in a higher concentration 62 000 ng l in the wwtp influents and the effluent concentration was 44 640 ng l which was not efficiently removed during the treatment processes du et al 2014 mohapatra et al 2016 the major sources of water for drinking and various other human consumption are surface water and groundwater but the water quality of these natural systems is polluted by mixing of sewage waters with natural surface water bodies and also through surface water ground water exchange buerge et al 2009 lapworth et al 2012 li 2014 gogoi et al 2018 extrinsic and intrinsic physicochemical properties of ecs in a given environment determine the fate of these contaminants the intrinsic factors of contaminants such as hydrophilic hydrophobic nature chemical reactivity with water and accessory contaminants ionic nature etc contribute to their retention in the environment and also determine their bioavailability and toxicity on the other hand extrinsic factors such as temperature ph redox conditions microbial population etc in the sewage landfill site wwtp and the aquatic environment can also affect their retention time or biochemical degradation lapworth et al 2012 li w 2014 the landfill leachate analysis showed these are mostly composed of dissolved organic and inorganic salt metal ions ammonia and specifically chloride fluoride iron and toxic heavy metals jhamnani and singh 2009 samadder et al 2017 although there is less chance of accumulation of pcps in landfills these are frequently available in sewage and wwtps however landfills occupied with heavy metals can pose serious leaching and percolation to the nearby aquatic environment through rainfall and surface water groundwater exchange 5 1 1 health hazard ecs can have several ill effects on human and aquatic animal health for example in humans pfass can induce cancer and many other pathophysiological conditions such as developmental retardation of the reproductive organ endometriosis infertility immunotoxicity bioaccumulation ulcer based diseases thyroid abnormality and colitis dbps can induce birth defects and bladder cancer and the precursor of microplastics such as bisphenol a can trigger breast cancer development by binding to estrogen receptors microplastics can also block the digestive tract of marine animals and ass such as sucralose can be toxic to fishes and aquatic animals tadda et al 2021 sucralose can be deleterious to gills muscles and the brain of cyprinus carpio through the production of oxygen derived free radicals from cellular oxidative metabolism saucedo vence et al 2017 nawaz and sengupta 2019 5 2 remediation of household and municipal waste contaminant depending on the type of waste remediation technologies differ due to the heterogeneous nature of household and msw several different remediation technologies have been developed for their amendment for example organic wastes can be reused and recycled by using composting and anaerobic digestion methods mohanty et al 2022 sridhar et al 2021 there are many other novel technologies such as prbs ek technology micro and nanobubbles mnbs solubilizing agents biologically enhanced degradation etc available to remediate a variety of waste materials from solid wastes ghaeminia and mokhtarani 2018 ye et al 2019 prbs can be used in contaminated soils such as in the vicinity of landfills for the removal of heavy metals ek remediation technology can be used in contaminated soils which produce strong oxidizing hydroxyl radicals using electrical current through pairs of electrodes biological enhanced degradation such as the use of fungi bacteria and actinomycetes on contaminated soils and landfill leachates is another viable remediation technology solubilizing agents such as surfactant and cosolvent can be used to decontaminate non polar organic compounds mostly the liquids such as benzene toluene xylene petroleum products etc the presence of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in these contaminants makes them suitable for removal these are widely used for the remediation of industrial pollutants and can also be employed in wwtps another advanced remediation technology for liquid wastes such as wwtp and contaminated groundwater is mnbs these are minute bubbles with a diameter of 0 10 μm 50 μm having high surface charge large specific surface area higher residual time in the water high gas liquid mass transfer rate and high charge density near the water air interface strong oxidizing hydroxyl radical generation of these mnbs with ozone can be a better remediation option for the mixture of organic compounds such as ecs in groundwater and wwtps ye et al 2019 msw in the form of compost can be utilized in agricultural land to provide nutrition to the growing plants and also it improves the soil texture and structure srivastava et al 2016 6 healthcare and laboratory waste contaminant healthcare units with modern infrastructure facilities are emerging worldwide and routine use of sophisticated instruments and bio medical accessories for diagnosis as well as therapeutics purposes increase waste generation the wastes generated from different animal and human healthcare units and research laboratories including ayush hospitals clinical establishments etc are mostly comprised of surgical needles scalpels blades surgical cotton expired drugs body fluids blood animal tissues and organs are termed as bio medical wastes radha et al 2009 according to bio medical wastes management and handling rules 1998 and successive modifications made by the ministry of environment forest and climate change government of india bio medical waste is defined as any waste which is generated during the diagnosis treatment or immunization of human beings or animals or in research activities pertaining thereto or in the production or testing of biologicals as of 2018 19 india only accounts for the generation of 557 metric tons of bio medical waste per day of which 92 undergoes safe disposal with treatments annual report 2019 it can be speculated that even 8 of biomedical waste can contribute to significant health concerns and ecotoxicological effects due to improper disposal a major portion of these bio medical wastes are non hazardous or general bio medical wastes comprising up to 85 and the rest contain hazardous chemical radioactive waste and infectious wastes chartier 2014 the hazardous wastes which are otherwise known as regulated bio medical waste undergo strict regulations and proper handling and management whereas those coming under non hazardous categories are disposed of according to municipal regulations like those of household wastes this creates a burden on municipal landfill sites the leachates from municipal landfills and improper disposal of hazardous waste have the potential to contaminate groundwater anitha and jayraaj 2012 hospital and laboratory waste contaminants including wastes that originated from wwtp have been found in many aquatic sources such as groundwater and surface water gogoi et al 2018 apart from these poor management and handling of wastes generated by many laboratories and institutions carrying out modern biology and genetic modification research which are not included in bio medical waste but contain genetically engineered microbes and cells can pose a significant impact on health and the environment as they contain toxic substances and even contribute in developing infectious microbes rajor et al 2012 these wastes are placed under the manufacture export import use and storage of hazardous micro organisms genetically engineered micro organisms or cells rules 1989 act for instance ethidium bromide a chemical used to visualize nucleic acids is routinely used and thrown into waste bins and it is known to possess carcinogenic properties a major diagnostic instrument in hospitals and diagnostic centers including a few modern biology research centers use radioactive substances for the detection of diseases such as cancer diagnosis many imaging techniques using x rays etc and these wastes are covered under the provisions of the atomic energy act 1962 33 of 1962 and rules central pollution control board 2016 efficient management of bio medical waste is needed and it would be possible by avoiding waste generation and simultaneously recovering more by reusing and recycling as much waste as possible datta et al 2018 6 1 occurrence and fate of biomedical waste contaminant in groundwater an increase in the per capita waste generation due to the rise in advanced healthcare facilities is a major concern that additionally build up contaminants in wwtp due to improper disposal the contaminants might pose a serious environmental risk to aquatic organisms as well as humans when mixed into aquatic systems based on the available information from the developed countries major healthcare contaminants are pharmaceuticals antibiotics antifungal antimicrobial medicines nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids anticonvulsant antidepressant drugs ass high blood pressure treating drugs such as β blockers steroidal hormones lipid cholesterol lowering drugs x ray contrast agents uv filters nerve stimulants anti pruritic drugs plasticizers insect repellents etc are the major contaminants found in wwtp and aquatic bodies tran et al 2018 mohapatra et al 2018 developed nations have strict regulations for proper disposition management and availability of information on contaminants in environmental samples but the information is lacking or scanty in many developing countries including india and even there is poor management of these wastes tran et al 2018 drugs such as ciprofloxacin cetirizine and fluconazole are detected in higher concentrations in different water sources such as surface water groundwater and wastewater sources in india gani and kazmi 2017 kuroda and kobayashi 2021 sengar and arya 2019 in groundwater 28 μg l cetirizine and 14 μg l ciprofloxacin were observed and in river water the concentrations were 530 μg l and 2500 μg l respectively kuroda and kobayashi 2021 when detected in the wastewaters extremely high concentrations of ciprofloxacin and fluconazole were observed 31 mg l and 236 mg l respectively sengar and arya 2019 pharmaceutical compounds are also widely consumed by humans to inhibit microbial growth for many medical reasons intensive farming due to increased demand for animal proteins and modernization in agriculture and allied activities improved healthcare facilities etc also results in higher antibiotic use that eventually leads to antibiotic resistance manyi loh et al 2018 these antimicrobial compounds are also classified as micropollutants of emerging concern as they impact eco toxicological effects even at low concentrations antibiotics such as tetracyclines penicillins β lactams sulfonamides and trimethoprim macrolides lincosamides and streptogramins quinolones including many other groups are frequently detected in wwtps which facilitates the development of antimicrobial resistance due to continuous exposure of bacteria to these compounds nappier et al 2020 mutuku et al 2022 the favorable climatic condition for the growth of antibiotic resistance microbial population intensive farming and use of antibiotics and agrochemicals particularly antibiotics and pharmaceutical drugs in animal husbandry and pisciculture along with the increased incidence of drug resistance malarial parasites is a major concern menon et al 2020 the occurrence of these emerging health care waste contaminants particularly antibiotics and few pharmaceutical products is largely possible due to their easy availability in pharmaceutical shops without any prescription residual pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics and hormones through urines and feces and the improper disposition of expired drugs from healthcare centers these were eventually introduced to the sewage system giger et al 2003 lapworth et al 2012 mohapatra et al 2016 gogoi et al 2018 sewage systems and wwtp are the major sources of biomedical contaminants that in the long run worsened the quality of groundwater and surface water lapworth et al 2012 mohapatra et al 2016 another possible contamination of groundwater is heavy metals which are used in medicines photographic x ray films and also in various medical instruments the x ray contrast media iopamidol and diatrizoic acid were detected at 24 94 ng l in the groundwater sources of switzerland ens et al 2014 sui et al 2015 the incineration treatment of these wastes produces ash containing a higher concentration of heavy metals which are buried in the municipal landfills and when leached to the surface and groundwater can have serious health hazards to humans and aquatic animals zhao et al 2009 anitha and jayraaj 2012 despite regulatory mechanisms for waste treatments at the source and different treatment facilities still the contaminants are not effectively removed the concentration of ecs is detected in quantities much higher than expected in the water discharged from the sewage treatment plants and sludge samples kapelewska et al 2018 this would otherwise cause an increment of toxic substances in various aquatic resources li 2014 healthcare and biomedical waste contaminants detected in the wastewaters mostly consist of antibiotics used for human and animal husbandry practices steroid hormones and edcs and many pcps lapworth et al 2012 gogoi et al 2018 in the groundwater the higher level of ecs observed are mostly antibiotics and pcps the different concentration levels are lipid regulators 7 5 μg l antibiotics 0 2 μg l antiepileptic drugs 1 1 μg l 17β estradiol 13 80 ng l and the plasticizer bisphenol a 0 5 44 ng l gogoi et al 2018 indiscriminate use of antibiotics is the leading cause of the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb which is a serious health concern quinolones sulfonamides tetracycline and their corresponding genes are most prevalent in the groundwater zainab et al 2020 bacteria consuming a higher amount of antibiotics from the contaminated environment makes them resistant and on the other hand antibiotic resistance genes args may easily be transferred among the bacteria through horizontal gene transfer developing arb through sw gw exchange and many other processes groundwater may also be contaminated with args and arb harb et al 2019 zainab et al 2020 rout et al 2021a the effect of edcs has been shown to elicit adverse impact on egg development and hormonal imbalance sex change particularly in aquatic animals which is a serious concern as the feminization of male fish has been observed due to the androgenic or estrogenic activities of edcs li 2014 gogoi et al 2018 major treatment protocols in wwtp are carried out to remove organic substances and suspended solids but are not effective in removing organic pharmaceuticals and other related biomedical wastes particularly if they are hydrophilic many other treatment operations followed to reduce the egcs include biodegradation photo degradation chemical degradation and sorption among these photo degradation and photo transformation are the most promising and ecofriendly natural attenuation processes which can degrade pharmaceutical compounds in surface waters exposed to sunlight mohapatra et al 2021 all these primary treatments and other secondary treatments are not adequate to completely remove the pharmaceutical wastes from wwtp this necessitates another tertiary treatment process that would significantly lower the concentration of the biomedical waste contaminants so that there will be less chance of accumulation in the surface water and groundwater resources mohapatra et al 2016 sorption is the adsorption of the contaminants to the soil surface and other substances in the surface and subsurface zone which is influenced by the ionic condition of the contaminants and the ph of the medium for example atenolol is the β blocker a drug used to treat hypertension and it can readily dissolve in water with a higher retention time due to the presence of the amine group atenolol contamination from groundwater natural aquifers and sewage water or wwtp can be removed by a chemical degradation process through cation exchange or competitive sorption in the subsurface soil zone this way the accumulation of the drug would be reduced in the groundwater schaffer et al 2012 lapworth et al 2012 fona 2013 schaffer and licha 2014 on the other hand negatively charged drugs such as diclofenac and ibuprofen are resistant to sorption onto negatively charged subsurface matrices or weakly bind to the neutral surface which poses a serious problem from removal from groundwater sources lapworth et al 2012 degradation of antibiotics from the drinking water supply and wwtp is a cumbersome process due to the unavailability of simple and cost effective methods recently an ecofriendly method has been utilized to see the antibiotics degradation process using horseradish peroxidase enzyme in contaminated water containing tetracycline liang et al 2021 apart from this the biodegradation by microorganisms or biotransformation to a less toxic form photo degradation by light induced mechanism and interaction with other extrinsic factors in the soil matrices such as aerobic and anaerobic conditions greatly affect the fate of contaminants mohapatra et al 2021 for instance the aerobic condition favors the growth of microorganisms in the subsurface soil zone which can be positively correlated with the microbial biotransformation of residual pharmaceutical compounds dissolved in the water whereas in the anaerobic condition biodegradation may not be possible or even if possible it takes longer time buerge et al 2006 kujawa roeleveld et al 2008 de mes et al 2008 li 2014 another pretreatment procedure followed in the case of biomedical wastes is incineration technology due to high temperature treatments hazardous substances containing infectious microorganisms are destroyed and converted to ash containing a few elemental forms including heavy metals called incinerated bio medical waste ash ibwa rajor et al 2012 the ibwa can finally be disposed of in the municipal landfills which could be the source of heavy metal contaminants to groundwater through leaching and percolation parameswari et al 2012 6 1 1 health hazard ecs in healthcare and laboratory wastes that contains mostly pharmaceutical compounds such as antibiotics nsaids and edc can pose serious health hazards and ecotoxicological effect on humans and aquatic animals estrone 17 β estradiol and 17 α ethynylestradiol etc are the medicines used for birth control that can induce sex change such as the feminization of male fish gogoi et al 2018 li 2014 kidney and gills of fishes can be affected by nsaids as observed in the case of diclofenac treatment in brown trout fish salmo trutta f fario hoeger et al 2005 the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the natural environment due to unhygienic and unsafe drinking water consumption such as urinary tract infection might occur due to carbapenem resistance klebsiella pneumoniae infection diarrhea and dysentery due to ciprofloxacin resistant shigella spp infection world health organization 2017 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 6 2 remediation of healthcare and laboratory waste contaminant the hospital and laboratory wastes containing hazardous materials should follow strict guidelines for safe disposal after pre treatment of the wastes the following major treatment technologies at source points such as hospitals and laboratories using chemical physical or biological means can be undertaken for safe remediation a disinfection treatment with chemicals such as sodium hypochlorite ozone or alkaline hydrolysis b thermal treatments such as low temperature treatment 100 180 c using autoclave microwave or high temperature treatment 200 1000 c using an incinerator combustion infrared heat etc c irradiation treatments such as the use of uv rays and electron beams d encapsulation treatment in which hazardous waste materials are sealed in high density plastic or metallic containers with some immobilized materials e biological treatments such as the use of microbes and enzymes for the degradation of non toxic substances f finally buried in the landfills after treating in all possible ways and by reducing reusing and recycling where ever possible world health organization 2017 7 conclusions and future scope of research the socio economic development of the country largely depends on groundwater resources the groundwater quality is a major apprehension as it is the backbone of the potable water supply in urban as well as rural areas the chemical composition of groundwater depends on the extent and nature of rock water interaction and is also affected by diverse geological formations and varying climatic in recent years groundwater contamination worldwide has become an emerging concern due to the improvement in detection methods and availability of information a large number of egcs are arising from anthropogenic activities and poor sanitation management dearth of awareness among the people indiscriminate use of high doses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides household wastes biomedical wastes containing pharmaceuticals and ppcs are contaminating groundwater either through municipality landfill leachates or through wwtps contaminated groundwater leads to severe health consequences for humans and aquatic animals information on many of the egcs is even not detected due to the lack of knowledge in situ and ex situ remediation technologies are available to eliminate the risk of egcs to human health and the ecosystem as a whole but more research ought to be undertaken to see the ecotoxicological effects that are unforeseeable due to the mixed chemical nature of the egcs the environmental interactions of these egcs need to be studied and future research should be undertaken on the development of advanced treatment techniques along with combinatorial treatment methods for efficient removal of egcs declaration of competing interest the authors

11700,most of the water systems that sustain the ecosystems and feed the growing human population are decreasing or stressed day by day groundwater is considered a reliable source of fresh water and its availability is usually regulated by aquifer characteristics topography sub surface activities climate and several geochemical processes the major emerging contaminants ecs come from antibiotics fire retardants pesticides sunscreens disinfection byproducts sediments organic carbon pathogens metals surfactants and drug residues the ecs can enter the environment and cause adverse human health or ecological effects the contaminants leached to groundwater from livestock farming industrial wastewater and through the application of fertilizer pesticides and slurries to agricultural land are also responsible for groundwater pollution the adjoining areas nearby landfills have a greater probability of groundwater contamination of heavy metals originating from the neighboring dumping sites knowledge about the concentration behavior and cycling of contaminants and their degradation pathways is essential to remediate these contaminants from different sources to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination the following measures like limiting and optimizing the organic and inorganic fertilizer application timing to crops disposal of pesticide waste and discarding empty containers should be as per safety guidelines effective irrigation systems will significantly reduce the passage of pesticides and fertilizers to aquatic ecosystems this paper aims o describe the occurrence and fate of emerging groundwater contaminants egcs and their possible remediation graphical abstract image 1 keywords contaminants groundwater health hazard heavy metal pesticides remediation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction clean water is essential for life however getting clean water for drinking purposes and other human needs is a major concern nowadays water quality gets polluted in many ways various anthropogenic activities such as deforestation farming urbanization ecosystem degradation and over extraction of groundwater affect different components of the hydrological cycle natural precipitation evaporation and runoff population growth and rising living standards are leading to the depletion of existing water resources chowdhury 2013 groundwater is considered a dependable source of fresh water that can be easily accessible for different human needs like irrigation and domestic as well as industrial uses singh et al 2011 gude and maganti 2021 about 3 6 billion people worldwide do not get adequate water for at least one month a year boretti and rosa 2019 the major driver of groundwater depletion is irrigation which accounts for 70 of the total water available and the increment of groundwater extractions is estimated to be 1100 km3 per year by 2050 as compared to 800 km3 per year as of 2010 wada et al 2016 boretti and rosa 2019 dalin 2021 contamination of groundwater is a major global challenge and concern in recent decades mukherjee et al 2020 in developing countries poor sanitary conditions due to population growth are affecting groundwater pollution in rural areas of developed countries groundwater contamination is primarily attributed to the application of fertilizer use of pesticides and indiscriminate use of groundwater by pumping for irrigation whereas in urban areas chemical pollutants and harmful microorganisms originating from urban development domestic and industrial wastes are the prime cause of groundwater contamination the sources of groundwater contamination are numerous and diverse the major sources of contamination are chemicals used in agriculture industrial waste discharges heavy metal pollution through mining operations the aquifer in contact with polluted streams household and municipal waste discharge and laboratory waste disposal the main routes by which contaminants enter groundwater are through seepage from shallow subsoil or surface direct entry from wells cross contamination of wells open to many aquifers and pumping mediated flow of contaminated water into freshwater aquifers and interaction with arsenic and radon as natural pollutants in geological strata and groundwater the different parameters that affect groundwater quality are the types of rocks and soils temperature pressure and hydrogeochemical processes influenced by the solubility of the soil santos et al 2008 de giglio et al 2015 the groundwater chemistry in an aquifer is mainly governed by hydro geochemical progressions along with water sediment interactions involving hydrolysis oxidation reduction adsorption cation exchange etc chakraborty et al 2021 a schematic diagram depicting the graphical summary of different emerging contaminants ecs their sources of occurrence different pathways of the entrance to groundwater and the health consequences for human beings are shown in fig 1 the contaminants from industrial hazardous waste through improper handling and accidental spilling infiltrate groundwater gw and surface water sw bodies the agricultural contaminant such as indiscriminate use of high doses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides through leaching and percolation enter subsurface soil and eventually reach groundwater as well as through groundwater surface water gw sw exchange the household wastes carrying mostly pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcs can contaminate groundwater either through municipality landfill solid wastes or through wastewater treatment plants wwtps of sewage water liquid wastes the biomedical wastes from laboratory and healthcare facilities either through liquid or solid waste enter municipal landfills and wwtps the leachates from municipal landfills pollute the nearby surface water bodies through surface runoff and even pollute groundwater through seepage and percolation the wastewaters from wwtps directly enter nearby surface water bodies from surface water bodies groundwater pollution occurs through ground water surface water gw sw exchange the retentionof contaminants from wwtps effluent in the soil through physical methods such as impaction interception diffusion and sedimentation process may subsequently leache to the groundwater the drugs and hormones used in animal husbandry activities and fish cultures such as 17 beta oestradiol progesterone testosterone zeranol trenbolone melengestrol acetate etc also contribute significantly to groundwater contamination through seepage and percolation of the excretory products contaminated groundwater affecting the soil plant animal continuum leads to severe health consequences in humans and aquatic animals groundwater contamination throughout the globe is a major challenge for the sustainability of ecosystems rapid industrialization urbanization and economic growth mediated huge contaminants generation are one of the major contributors to groundwater contamination there is scanty information on the presence of contaminants in groundwater at a level that is harmful to human health keeping this in view the present paper describes the sources of contaminants and their transport through the soil systems to contaminate the groundwater and its remediation technologies 2 emerging groundwater contaminants the occurrence of newly identified compounds from the wastes of varied origins such as industrial agricultural household and municipal hospital and biomedicals from the groundwater which previously remained unmonitored and undetected can be regarded as emerging groundwater contaminants egcs kapelewska et al 2018 sharma et al 2019 rout et al 2020 broadly these are fungicides insecticides pesticides drugs from the pharmaceutical industry personal care products pcps microplastics artificial sweeteners ass endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs uv filters manufactured nanomaterials perfluorinated chemicals pfcs per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass disinfection byproducts dbps etc gogoi et al 2018 tran et al 2018 nawaz and sengupta 2019 the household and municipal wastes also include electronic waste e waste e waste is generated due to a tremendous increase in electronic equipment usage along with their shorter life span which eventually adds more electronic equipment to the user the improper disposal of old used and discarded products poses a serious threat to human health as they contain many hazardous substances including heavy metals such as lead mercury and cadmium joon et al 2017 houessionon et al 2021 the detection of contaminants even in trace amounts is possible due to the development of advanced analytical methods snow et al 2019 the various egcs are categorically divided into agriculture contaminants geogenic contaminants industrial waste and landfill contaminants household and municipal waste contaminants and bio medical waste contaminants including wastes from hospitals pathological laboratories and different research institutes carrying out modern biology research these egcs originating from different routes are summarized in table 1 the acceptable limits of these contaminants in the drinking water from india and the global data are included in table 1 from the bureau of indian standards bis department of water supply and sanitation government of punjab india the united states environmental protection agency epa world health organization who that could give a comparative data between india and world as a whole 3 agriculture contaminant the various emerging agricultural contaminants in groundwater are nutrients nitrates phosphates and pesticides insecticides herbicides and fungicides 3 1 nitrate 3 1 1 occurrence and fate of nitrate in groundwater the nitrogen fertilizers release nitrates no3 upon application to soil for crop production nitrogen is the major nutrient and is applied extensively in agriculture to enhance crop production however the excess application can cause soil water and air pollution lee et al 2021 the excess nitrates which are not taken by the plant percolate along with irrigation water and rainfall through the soil profile below the root zone to contaminate the groundwater the groundwater contamination with nitrate has become a severe problem in many parts of india the threshold value of nitrate contamination from agricultural sources in the groundwater is 50 mg l as per european union eu directive 91 676 efc ayyasamy et al 2009 observed nitrate contamination from 40 to 1000 mg l in most parts of rajasthan bhilwara rajsamand udaipur and dungarpur intensive agriculture areas like punjab andhra pradesh west bengal haryana and uttar pradesh receive an extensive dose of nitrogenous fertilizer have also been reported to have nitrate contamination kundu et al 2008 3 1 1 1 health hazard the nitrate concentration of more than 10 mg l in groundwater for drinking is harmful as per epa environmental protection agency usa nitrate is highly soluble in water and it can be reduced to a highly toxic and carcinogenic form n nitroso via nitrite form in animal bodies through drinking water ghaeminia and mokhtarani 2018 rout et al 2021a high concentrations of nitrate in water cause blue baby syndrome or methemoglobinemia morales suarez varela et al 1995 observed prostate and gastrointestinal cancer due to the intake of nitrate contaminated water grant et al 1996 observed abortion in pregnant women due to a deficiency of oxygen for the developing fetus 3 1 2 remediation of nitrate contamination nitrate is readily soluble in water due to which it is highly challenging to remove from contaminated water sources efficiently many chemical physical and biological approaches have been implemented to remove nitrate from contaminated waters including adsorption ion exchange electrodialysis reverse osmosis catalytic reduction denitrification and bio chemical denitrification processes rout et al 2017a in the adsorption ion exchange process the nitrate containing water is passed through a resin bed containing chloride or bicarbonate ions where the nitrate ions were exchanged till the resin was exhausted whereas in the electrodialysis process the nitrate ion is separated from contaminated water sources by the use of cation anion exchange membranes reverse osmosis at a pressure varied from 300 to 1500 psi was also used to remediate the nitrate contamination bioremediation by denitrifying bacteria and microbes efficiently reduce nitrate content in water and these are extensively used due to their cost effective treatment processes winkler and straka 2019 rout et al 2018 geng et al 2007 observed that the successful reduction of nitrate in groundwater through catalytic reduction using sodium formate over the catalyst and the removal efficiency was 87 permeable reactive barrier prb is an in situ method for the treatment of contaminated groundwater in which reactive materials such as activated carbon zero valence iron zeolite steel slag wood cheeps sponge iron scrap rubber and medical stone are used to alter the property of contaminants by reversible absorption and irreversible redox reactions ye et al 2019 these innovative methods integrated with other technologies can also be effective enough to remove nitrate contamination ghaeminia and mokhtarani 2018 showed that prb combined with the application of direct current such as electrokinetic ek technology improved nitrate removal as high as 90 efficiency contaminate water containing nitrates lacking organic compounds can also be effectively made pollution free by using an h2 based autotrophic denitrification process by controlling the ph of the water source xing et al 2020 recently liang et al 2021 proposed an innovative method named microbial electrolysis cell integrated with gas diffusion membrane mmec to remediate nitrate contamination with more than 90 efficiency 3 2 phosphates 3 2 1 occurrence and fate of phosphates in groundwater phosphorus is the second major nutrient needed by plants for their growth and proliferation the phosphatic fertilizer releases different forms of phosphate like h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 to the soil predominantly phosphorous in the form of orthophosphates h2po4 hpo4 2 is preferred by the plants as a nutrient rout et al 2014 2016a the soluble phosphates which are excess and or not absorbed by the plant can contaminate the groundwater causing eutrophication phosphate contaminates the groundwater through point and non point sources rout et al 2017c the point sources of phosphate contamination include industrial discharges effluents from wastewater treatment plants etc while non point sources include agricultural runoff weathering of phosphate rocks direct input by animals erosion and sedimentation 3 2 1 1 health hazard the phosphate concentration of 5 mg l in drinking water is the permissible limit according to epa vorland et al 2017 observed that the continuous use of groundwater beyond the permissible limit caused kidney damage and osteoporosis to prevent eutrophication usepa 1986 has set the limit of discharge of phosphate to water bodies at 0 05 mg l while to prevent algal growth the limit is between 0 01 and 0 03 mg l accumulation of phosphorous in waterbodies favors the growth of toxin producing algae and cyanobacteria which cause affect human health and are also not suitable for irrigation akpor 2011 excess phosphate intake may adversely affect the balance of macro and micronutrients in humans and is also usually related to kidney disease and cardiovascular health smith et al 2010 bellasi et al 2011 bird and eskin 2021 3 2 2 remediation of phosphate contamination the soil microflora plays a major role in the remediation of phosphates in groundwater bacteria like pseudomonas aeromonas coliform proteobacteria and bacillus cereus are used for the removal of phosphate from wastewater ahemad 2015 ying and wei 2019 rout et al 2017b bacteria use phosphates during the aerobic phase and accumulate them as polyphosphate reserves rout et al 2021b further a bacterial consortium of pseudomonas sp bacillus sp and enterobacter sp in the presence of lactose can reduce the phosphate in the water below the permissible limit within 72 h krishnaswamy et al 2009 the inorganic form of phosphate can be removed by the addition of coagulants the multivalent metal ions like calcium aluminum and iron are generally used for the removal of phosphates altaf et al 2021 3 3 pesticides 3 3 1 occurrence and fate of pesticides in groundwater pesticides are used in agriculture to control weeds insect pests and diseases the pesticides are classified as herbicides insecticides nematicides and fungicides pesticides like ddt dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane with a half life of 10 15 years have extremely low solubility and leach to groundwater gupta et al 2006 priyadarshini et al 2021 the leaching of pesticides to groundwater through the soil profile occurs due to a movement of pesticides along with water through macropores root channels and cracks known as preferential flow and b slow movement of pesticide water through small pores of the soil known as matrix flow 3 3 1 1 health hazard long exposure to high doses of pesticides can cause cancer birth defects and damage to the nervous system the harmful effects of pesticides are systemic poisoning skin and eye irritation dizziness headaches nausea vomiting fatigue and abdominal pain 3 3 2 remediation of pesticide contamination a number of remediation technologies are available either in situ in contaminated soils or by treating contaminated wastewater depending on the type and concentration of pesticides and many other factors such as the extent of contamination soil and climatic conditions etc the treatment technologies are adopted biochar charcoal produced from solid wastes and other biomass through pyrolysis under oxygen free conditions is very effective in adsorbing organic contaminants and heavy metals biochar has been demonstrated to reduce the organic contaminants from soils and is very effective in the sorption of the herbicide isoproturon sopeña et al 2012 many advanced technologies such as immobilization ex situ soil washing and in situ soil flushing to separate pesticides from soils application of solvents surfactants and biosurfactants could be utilized morillo and villaverde 2017 villa et al 2010 successfully remediated soil contaminated by ddt and dde dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and contaminated wastewater by using non ionic surfactant tx 100 through a solar photo fenton process manickam et al 2012 studied the effect of several biosurfactants sophorolipid rhamnolipid etc on biodegradation and solubilization of hexa chloro cyclo hexane and observed that sophorolipid exhibited the maximum degradation and superior solubilization chemical oxidation reduction methods and bioremediation methods are other viable alternatives to deal with the removal of pesticides mostly from contaminated soil sites morillo and villaverde 2017 phytoremediation growing plants to absorb and detoxify chemicals and microbial use of bacteria fungus cyanobacteria etc remediation technologies are gaining importance due to their low cost and eco friendly nature over the conventional physical chemical methods bhat et al 2020 by following the recommended application practices such as applying pesticides at an economic threshold limit to insect pest damage determining the soil types and leaching index before pesticide application applying at the required target site avoiding wells and surface water streams delaying irrigation 1 2 days after pesticide application and maintaining a record of pesticide application to prevent the overuse in subsequent spray applications can minimize the pesticide contamination from groundwater 4 geogenic contaminant 4 1 fluoride 4 1 1 occurrence and fate of fluoride in groundwater the fluoride contamination of groundwater around the globe is a major problem the fluorite caf2 and apatite ca5 cl f oh po4 3 present in igneous and sedimentary rocks are the most common mineral of fluoride and have low water solubility the geogenic source such as weathering of fluoride containing minerals exists in rock and sediments and releases fluoride to groundwater yadav et al 2018 and fluoride mobility in soil is highly dependent on soil ph and the presence of clay minerals and their sorption properties the high rate of applications of fluoride based pesticides like fludioxonil deflufenican etc leads to fluride leaching to subsurface soil and adsorbed on clay minerals that eventually reach groundwater mukherjee and singh 2018 yadav et al 2019 people from asia and africa are liable to suffer from fluorosis and other health defects by consuming fluoride contaminated water kut et al 2016 sikdar 2019 yadav et al 2019 the asian countries for instance india pakistan china japan mongolia saudi arabia and yemen are highly affected by fluoride contamination with 5 0 mg l and within india the states like punjab haryana rajasthan madhya pradesh assam and west bengal reported higher concentrations of fluoride in groundwater 9 0 mg l with states like bihar jharkhand chhattisgarh and jammu and kashmir have less fluoride 1 5 3 0 mg l contamination than other states yadav et al 2019 4 1 1 1 health hazard the continuous use of groundwater having high fluoride content 1 5 mg l leads to fluorosis the fluorosis may be of skeletal dental and non skeletal types non skeletal fluorosis results in ill effects on skeletal muscle gastrointestinal system erythrocytes ligaments or combined effect on all the mentioned organ and organ systems guissouma et al 2017 yadav et al 2018 4 1 2 remediation of fluoride contamination different methods can be adopted for the removal of fluoride from contaminated water sources such as coagulation precipitation ion exchange adsorption nanofiltration reverse osmosis dialysis electrodialysis electrocoagulation etc yadav et al 2019 in the coagulation precipitation method the removal of fluoride is carried out by coagulation followed by precipitation using chemicals such as alum poly aluminum chloride lime poly aluminum hydroxy sulfate and brushite nanoparticles have a wider application and are potentially effective in reducing pollutants level from varied sources nano hydroxyapatite nhap has been used for the immobilization of heavy metals due to its large specific surface area low water solubility and biocompatibility as nhap can retain fluoride anions with the oh ion present on them it can potentially alleviate soil fluoride contamination by increasing the soil fluoride bioavailability to crop plants and simultaneously reducing groundwater contamination gan et al 2021 4 2 salinity 4 2 1 occurrence and fate of salinity in groundwater the salinity is a global issue and becomes more havoc in water scarce semi arid and arid regions where groundwater is the chief water source in the punjab region of india the groundwater salinity was found to surpass the allowable electrical conductivity ec limit of 1500 μs cm1 at least in 14 locations out of the 21 locations analyzed krishan et al 2017 and the groundwater salt concentration is about 19 32 g l in australia which is having highest salt affected soils in the world castaño sánchez et al 2020 the increasing salinity resulting from depletion of the water table following the over pumping of groundwater does not cause any harmful health impacts as associated with other geogenic contaminants the major cause of salinity in groundwater depends on several factors like the downward movement of superficial saline water upward movement of deep saline water dissolution of vaporite and fossil seawater the groundwater salinity in the coastal areas is caused by the intrusion of seawater and sea spray overexploitation of groundwater in coastal areas causes seawater intrusion resulting in deterioration of groundwater quality for future use kim et al 2005 4 2 1 1 health hazard high chloride concentrations in the groundwater causes the water unsuitable for human consumption and industrial uses excessive concentration of chlorine in groundwater for irrigation causes toxicity problems in crop plants leaf burning and defoliation in sensitive crops however high sodium ion concentration can lead to high blood pressure and certain heart disease predominantly in vulnerable individuals 4 2 2 remediation of salinity contamination growing halophytic plants that can accumulate salts in the saline contaminated soils is a highly promising approach due to their specific mechanism to exclude salts through phytostabilization carpobrutus rossii phytoextraction tamarix sp phytovolatilization poplar sp phytohydraulics salix alba and phytodegradation sarcobatus vermiculatus processes nouri et al 2017 the remediation of salinity from water sources can be undertaken by practicing different distillation methods such as solar humidification multi stage flash membrane distillation vapor compression and using membrane technologies the membrane technology involves the passing of salinity contaminated water through a semi permeable membrane to filter out unwanted non dissolved or dissolved constituents the various membrane processes are microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis forward osmosis electrodialysis etc which are engaged in the selective removal of different contaminants ingiaimo 2014 shahid et al 2020 4 3 iron and manganese 4 3 1 occurrence and fate of iron and manganese in groundwater 4 3 1 1 iron iron is a vital mineral element required during the metabolism of animals and plants the high concentrations of iron in groundwater form red oxyhydroxide precipitates and cause staining in laundry and plumbing fixtures thus iron in high concentration is an undesirable impurity in the supply of water for domestic and industrial use the solubility of iron in groundwater is controlled by the presence of dissolved oxygen and its degree of acidity i e its ph iron can occur in two forms fe2 and fe3 depending on the dissolved oxygen status of groundwater at higher dissolved oxygen concentration 1 2 mg l fe3 form exists while the fe2 form prevails in lower concentration although fe2 is soluble at the normal ph of water fe3 is insoluble the presence of organic matter in groundwater increases the solubility of fe2 ions due to the depletion of oxygen concentration following the decomposition of organic matter on pumping the water to the surface the dissolved iron gets oxidized to fe3 in the presence of atmospheric oxygen and forms rust colored iron minerals 4 3 1 1 1 health hazard the safe level of iron in groundwater for drinking is 0 3 mg l who continuous intake of excessive amounts of iron causes iron overload iron overload can lead to haemochromatosis which damages the organs and organ systems early indications include weight loss fatigue and joint pain but it can lead to liver problems heart disease and diabetes in severe cases 4 3 1 2 manganese manganese is present in the soil water sediment and biological materials the manganese concentrations in groundwater through the natural leaching process depend largely on the existing mineral types in the aquifer manganese is more commonly found in deeper wells where the water generally remains in contact with rock for a longer period the manganese concentration in groundwater is comparatively less than iron and it often occurs together with iron manganese mobility in soils largely depends on the acidity of the soil wetness soil organic matter biological activity in the soil etc the availability and solubility of manganese are low in soil with high ph and organic matter while the availability is more in acid soils with low organic matter content further the solubility of manganese under anaerobic conditions is high at ph above 6 0 and decreases in aerobic conditions at ph below 5 5 4 3 1 2 1 health hazard the safe level of manganese in groundwater for drinking according to who is 0 4 mg l and as per bis the safe level is 0 1 mg l high intake of manganese causes irreversible neurological conditions comparable to parkinson s disease and is accumulated in the brain especially in the basal ganglia relatively high doses of manganese cause mutations in mammalian cells and microorganisms and affect dna replication 4 3 2 remediation of iron and manganese contamination the different methods to remove iron and manganese from contaminated waters are oxidation and filtration ion exchange sequestration and phosphate treatment to avert the oxidation of iron and manganese krishnakumari et al 2018 during the filtration and oxidation process the manganese and iron are oxidized to form insoluble complexes the common chemical oxidizing agents used are chlorine dioxide chlorine ozone and potassium permanganate khadse et al 2015 as a low cost alternative oxygen in the air can also be used as an oxidizing agent for the removal of small quantities of iron and manganese from water the ion exchange method is used because high levels of manganese and iron in water may cause rapid clogging in this process sodium saturated synthetic resins solid phase are used for the exchange of unwanted ions in water in the sequestration process the added chemicals to groundwater at the pump intake or the wellhead come in contact with chlorine or air adding polyphosphates before chlorination is one of the most inexpensive and effective methods for lessening manganese and iron problems if the water contains less than 1 0 0 3 mg l of iron and manganese respectively metaphosphate tripolyphosphate pyrophosphate etc can be used for the sequestration process simultaneous application of chlorine and sodium silicate has also been explored to sequester manganese and iron 4 4 heavy metal heavy metals are metallic chemical elements with a high specific density of more than 5 g ml and are generally toxic at low concentrations the various heavy metals comprise arsenic as chromium cr cadmium cd nickel ni lead pb and antimony sb heavy metals are natural elements on the earth s surface and resistant to degradation or destruction the heavy metals enter the human and animal bodies through the air drinking water and food the impact of heavy metal pollution on plant health and the soil ecosystem cannot be avoided although a few metals such as mn zn cu and mo in trace amounts contribute to plant nutrition the soil microflora fauna and plant growth are severely affected due to significant toxicity srivastava et al 2017 4 4 1 arsenic 4 4 1 1 occurrence and fate of arsenic in groundwater arsenic being a metalloid is one of the most harmful inorganic contaminants present in groundwater around 70 4 million people in india are in the risk zone of groundwater arsenic toxicity chakraborti et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2021 groundwater arsenic contamination is endemic to countries like india china mexico argentina and bangladesh singh 2006 reported the incidence of high arsenic contamination in groundwater in different indian states of bihar chhattisgarh north eastern states uttar pradesh and west bengal the arsenic concentration in groundwater of 79 blocks in the eight districts of west bengal has a high arsenic level beyond the allowable limit of 0 01 mg l world health organization 2021 and the maximum contaminant level mcl for drinking water to limit the concentration below 10 μg l nath et al 2019 in the groundwater a high concentration of arsenic is due to its presence in the weathered volcanic rocks sedimentary rocks fossil fuels and geothermal areas the mobility of arsenic in groundwater depends on various factors like adsorption oxidation reduction dissolution precipitation and co precipitation halim et al 2009 naik et al 2010 4 4 1 1 1 health hazard the high concentration of arsenic in groundwater causes various health problems like heart failure myocardial depolarization gastrointestinal effects abdominal colic and respiratory distress because of irritation of mucous membranes resulting in rhinitis

soles 4 4 1 2 remediation of arsenic contamination arsenic elimination from water by various physicochemical methods such as precipitation adsorption ion exchange electrocoagulation membrane processes and biological methods such as microbial treatment and phytoremediation has been widely used nath et al 2019 kumar et al 2019 the multivalent metal ions like al3 and fe3 adsorb arsenic from groundwater followed by co precipitation which is the most common practice for the removal of arsenic from water the precipitated arsenic is separated by sedimentation followed by sand filtration or microfiltration the best and most effective treatment involves coagulation of arsenic with aluminum and iron salts and lime softening the electrostatically held ions on a solid phase surface are exchanged for dissolved ions of a similar charge in the liquid phase the anion exchange resin is generally used as a solid the negatively charged as v species can be removed in the ion exchange process while for the removal of as iii it is necessary to oxidize it to as v for its complete removal the membrane techniques include reverse osmosis ultrafiltration electro dialysis and nano filtration where synthetic membranes are used to remove arsenic these processes remove arsenic through filtration electrostatic repulsion size exclusion and adsorption of arsenic bearing compounds in the adsorptive process water is passed through a contact bed containing multivalent metal ions where arsenic is adsorbed and removed by chemical reactions in india and bangladesh activated alumina based sorptive media are being used for the elimination of arsenite arsenate and phosphorous from water ferric hydroxide granules are highly effective adsorbents kumar et al 2019 bioremediation through biomethylation of as in contaminated soils and aquatic sources is an effective ecofriendly approach to remediation ranjan et al 2020 aquatic plants like azolla and spirodella duckweed species are generally used to remove arsenic from the water rahman and ravenscroft 2003 observed arsenic accumulation of 175 g day by duckweed plants from the pond of a 1 ha area in situ microbial remediation is another promising approach to arsenic remediation gupta et al 2021 4 4 2 lead 4 4 2 1 occurrence and fate of lead in groundwater the major lead pb contamination of groundwater occurs through industrial sources such as chemical manufacturing battery manufacturing metal smelting and processing secondary metals production and lead contaminated waste processing lead enters water bodies and land typically in the form of elemental lead oxides and hydroxides of lead and lead metal oxy anion complexes smith et al 1995 the solubility of lead in groundwater depends on ph dissolved salts concentrations and mineral types a major part of the lead in groundwater occurs as undissolved precipitates of pbco3 pb oh 2 pb2o and pbso4 or as sorbed ions or mineral surface coatings or as suspended organic matter 4 4 2 1 1 health hazard according to the who the permissible limit of lead in drinking water is 10 μg l ppb world health organization 2021 lead has adverse effects on human

remediation of lead contamination sorption mobility reduction of the metals by oxidation or immobilization prb and various biological methods can be utilized for achieving higher removal efficiency of lead from groundwater sources the sorption processes depend on the ph ionic strength metal concentration type of ion adsorbent dosage temperature time surface area and nature of the adsorbent biela and šopíková 2017 observed that lead could be removed from water by the use of sorption material like bayoxide e33 ramdani et al 2020 observed that the use of synthetic hydroxyapatite sy hap for 15 min completely adsorbed pb2 with removal efficiencies of 90 91 from wastewater of industrial effluents the pumice perlite mixture and pumice lime perlite mixture in the ratios of 1 1 and 2 2 1 respectively can be used as effective reactive media in prb for lead removal from water ranjbar et al 2017 the mobility of lead in groundwater can be reduced by immobilization or by performing chemical reactions such as oxidation reduction and neutralization reactions dai et al 2018 reported that biochar and phosphate added soils were very effective in eliminating lead from polluted groundwater with corresponding removal efficiencies of 94 2 and 84 5 through immobilization technology yucca decipiens extracts were used as biosurfactants to remove lead from groundwater of a mining community using the spherical agglomeration technique sat plants and microbes having bioaccumulation phytoextraction phytostabilization rhizofiltration and bio leaching characteristics are also widely used as bioremediation methods to ameliorate the metal contaminations including lead from groundwater resources nouri et al 2017 sharma and reddy 2004 4 4 3 chromium 4 4 3 1 occurrence and fate of chromium in groundwater chromium cr occurs naturally only in compound form but not in elemental form and the major sources of chromium contamination are the electroplating processes and chromium containing wastes disposal smith et al 2010 under aerobic conditions cr vi is the dominant form in shallow aquifers key cr vi species comprise chromate cro4 2 and dichromate cr2o7 2 that get precipitated in reacting with metal cations ba2 ag and pb2 cr vi is the most toxic form and is also more mobile the non adsorbed and soluble chromium complexes can leach into groundwater from the soil the higher the soil ph the more the leachability of cr vi 4 4 3 1 1 health hazard the allowable limit of cr vi in drinking water according to the who is 0 05 ppm world health organization 2020 whereas as per epa it is 100 parts per billion ppb or 0 1 mg l of total chromium cr vi causes health issues including nose irritations and nosebleeds skin rash allergic reactions ulcers kidney and liver damage weakened immune system genetic material alteration and even in the worst condition chromium poisoning leads to the death of the individual 4 4 3 2 remediation of chromium contamination activated carbon is found to be very effective in removing cr vi a prb using a 1 1 mass ratio of activated carbon and cast iron as reactive media showed a higher chromium removal rate of 3 806 mg g

carbonaceous black porous material called eucalyptus bark biochar ebb has the potential to remove all cr vi from chromium contaminated groundwater and chrome tanning wastewater choudhary et al 2017 ion exchange filtration methods can also effectively remove cr vi ions from aqueous mixtures the resin used in ion exchange filtration depends on the adsorbent dose the initial cr vi ion concentration the solution ph and the contact time adsorption efficiency as high as 99 was observed when ceralite ira 400 anion exchange resin was used and 100 mg l of initial cr vi ion concentration was maintained kumar et al 2008 the nanoscopic zero valent iron nzvi shows great reactivity for the removal of chromium from water which has been successfully utilized to remove cr vi by iron nanoparticles supported

toxic state cr iii mtimunye et al 2017 reported that using cultures of bacillus cereus and enterococcus sp in the presence of natural carbon sources they removed 93 removal of cr vi from a continuous feed of contaminated water with a chromium content of 40 60 mg l 4 4 4 cadmium 4 4 4 1 occurrence and fate of cadmium in groundwater cadmium cd occurs in nature generally in the form of cds or cdco3 the most usual forms of cadmium are cd2 cd oh 2 and cadmium cyanide complexes smith et al 1995 hu et al 2015 at high ph the dominant forms of cadmium are carbonate cdco3 solids and hydroxide cd oh 2 while at lower ph 8 cd2 and aqueous sulfate species are the prevailing forms the mining of sulfide ores from zinc copper and lead contributed a significant amount of cadmium as a by product cadmium

extremely toxic cadmium can enter the human body through contaminated water and has an extensive half life of 10 33 years in the human body the long standing exposure to cadmium causes disturbed calcium metabolism in the body as it can replace calcium due to similar ionic properties kubier et al 2019 also cause other adverse health effects in humans such as renal damage lung cancer and prostate cancer the chronic cadmium poisoning causing itai itai disease was first discovered in japan in the early 20th century 4 4 4 2 remediation of cadmium contamination the cadmium from soil and water is effectively adsorbed in biochar made from vinegar residue at 700 c li et al 2018 observed that the application of 10 biochar was most effective for the soil having cadmium contamination levels of 1 0 or 2 5 mg kg 1 while 5 biochar application was effective for the soils with cadmium levels of 0 5 mg cd kg 1 therefore biochar could be explored as a promising alternative for cadmium remediation in soil and water prb using replaceable semi permanent or permanent reactive media can be applied at the sub surface level through the flow path of a contaminated groundwater plume to reduce the cadmium contamination effectively the water is permitted to move through its natural gradient thus making a passive treatment system the use of nano metal oxides like zinc oxide zno titanium oxides tio2 magnesium oxide mgo hydrous manganese dioxide mno2 and iron oxides through the process of adsorption is another viable option to remove cadmium from groundwater mahdavi et al 2013 bioremediation by biosorbent calotropis procera giant milkweed is effectively utilized to treat industrial effluents or groundwater contaminated with cadmium the cadmium biosorption capacity of

or does not undergo treatment procedures this in the long run could impose significant environmental concerns in rural areas plastics are most popular in various sectors due to their low cost ease of availability and adaptability high strength and many other advantages however they are also becoming a major concern due to their poor biodegradable property which pollute the environment das et al 2022 vaid et al 2021 plastics with less than 5 mm in size are considered microplastics and also treated as emerging contaminants due to the frequent occurrence in groundwater as well as the cause of many ill effects on humans rout et al 2022 koelmans et al 2019 ren et al 2021 the typical household waste and municipal wastes broadly consist of organic and inorganic materials and specifically food wastes leathers plastics paper metals cardboard textiles glass batteries unused and expired medicines and even a few other ecs that enter into the sewage systems such as detergents and pcps jouhara et al 2017 drugs hormones used in animal husbandry practices such as 17 beta oestradiol progesterone testosterone zeranol trenbolone melengestrol acetate etc are other sources of ecs kumar et al 2019 priyanka and mohapatra 2020 the residual drugs hormones from animal bodies through their excretion and fecal matter enter subsurface soils that can be leached into the groundwater nawaz and sengupta 2019 pcps such as antidandruff shampoo fluoride containing toothpaste skin moisturizers deodorants face and body cleansers hair removal creams and other cosmetics etc contain chemicals and drugs which can also have a significant impact on water pollution when mixed with environments from discarded containers for example the antidandruff shampoo contains many organic and inorganic compounds including some drugs to inhibit fungal growth such as miconazole nitrate this drug has been detected in biosolids from wastewater treatment plants wwtp and sewage sludge peysson and vulliet 2013 tran et al 2018 in indian wwtps pcps have been detected as high as 537 μg l in the influent waters mohapatra et al 2016 sucralose aspartame and much other ass are used as sugar substitutes in many dietary products and used for human consumption through human excretion these enter the wastewater and sewage system saucedo vence et al 2017 the solid wastes which are otherwise known as municipal solid wastes msw are dumped in the municipal landfills which could be a major source of pharmaceuticals due to the presence of expired drugs and many other pharmaceuticals disposed of from diverse sources another type of contaminant found in msw is hazardous substances in the form of paints batteries mercury containing waste such as broken thermometers and many other household wastes rout et al 2016b these household hazardous wastes are highly unregulated unlike the industrial hazardous wastes and from the landfills along with the transformed products of pharmaceuticals and pcps these can reach groundwater via subsurface soil percolation and eventually leads to groundwater pollution slack et al 2005 these wastes in the landfills undergo physical chemical and biological transformation and when mixed with rainwater or other moisture carrying wastes can develop different toxic nontoxic by products samadder et al 2017 these aqueous liquid products thus can add more ecs to pollute groundwater the sewage and wastewaters are usually undergone some pre treatment procedures in wwtps to remove organic and toxic compounds toxic compounds may be degraded through chemical and biological using microbes means but due to the varied chemical nature of ecs incomplete degradation or bio transformation may occur which also contributes to its presence in natural aquatic systems the sucralose was detected in a higher concentration 62 000 ng l in the wwtp influents and the effluent concentration was 44 640 ng l which was not efficiently removed during the treatment processes du et al 2014 mohapatra et al 2016 the major sources of water for drinking and various other human consumption are surface water and groundwater but the water quality of these natural systems is polluted by mixing of sewage waters with natural surface water bodies and also through surface water ground water exchange buerge et al 2009 lapworth et al 2012 li 2014 gogoi et al 2018 extrinsic and intrinsic physicochemical properties of ecs in a given environment determine the fate of these contaminants the intrinsic factors of contaminants such as hydrophilic hydrophobic nature chemical reactivity with water and accessory contaminants ionic nature etc contribute to their retention in the environment and also determine their bioavailability and toxicity on the other hand extrinsic factors such as temperature ph redox conditions microbial population etc in the sewage landfill site wwtp and the aquatic environment can also affect their retention time or biochemical degradation lapworth et al 2012 li w 2014 the landfill leachate analysis showed these are mostly composed of dissolved organic and inorganic salt metal ions ammonia and specifically chloride fluoride iron and toxic heavy metals jhamnani and singh 2009 samadder et al 2017 although there is less chance of accumulation of pcps in landfills these are frequently available in sewage and wwtps however landfills occupied with heavy metals can pose serious leaching and percolation to the nearby aquatic environment through rainfall and surface water groundwater exchange 5 1 1 health hazard ecs can have several ill effects on human and aquatic animal health for example in humans pfass can induce cancer and many other pathophysiological conditions such as developmental retardation of the reproductive organ endometriosis infertility immunotoxicity bioaccumulation ulcer based diseases thyroid abnormality and colitis dbps can induce birth defects and bladder cancer and the precursor of microplastics such as bisphenol a can trigger breast cancer development by binding to estrogen receptors microplastics can also block the digestive tract of marine animals and ass such as sucralose can be toxic to fishes and aquatic animals tadda et al 2021 sucralose can be deleterious to gills muscles and the brain of cyprinus carpio through the production of oxygen derived free radicals from cellular oxidative metabolism saucedo vence et al 2017 nawaz and sengupta 2019 5 2 remediation of household and municipal waste contaminant depending on the type of waste remediation technologies differ due to the heterogeneous nature of household and msw several different remediation technologies have been developed for their amendment for example organic wastes can be reused and recycled by using composting and anaerobic digestion methods mohanty et al 2022 sridhar et al 2021 there are many other novel technologies such as prbs ek technology micro and nanobubbles mnbs solubilizing agents biologically enhanced degradation etc available to remediate a variety of waste materials from solid wastes ghaeminia and mokhtarani 2018 ye et al 2019 prbs can be used in contaminated soils such as in the vicinity of landfills for the removal of heavy metals ek remediation technology can be used in contaminated soils which produce strong oxidizing hydroxyl radicals using electrical current through pairs of electrodes biological enhanced degradation such as the use of fungi bacteria and actinomycetes on contaminated soils and landfill leachates is another viable remediation technology solubilizing agents such as surfactant and cosolvent can be used to decontaminate non polar organic compounds mostly the liquids such as benzene toluene xylene petroleum products etc the presence of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in these contaminants makes them suitable for removal these are widely used for the remediation of industrial pollutants and can also be employed in wwtps another advanced remediation technology for liquid wastes such as wwtp and contaminated groundwater is mnbs these are minute bubbles with a diameter of 0 10 μm 50 μm having high surface charge large specific surface area higher residual time in the water high gas liquid mass transfer rate and high charge density near the water air interface strong oxidizing hydroxyl radical generation of these mnbs with ozone can be a better remediation option for the mixture of organic compounds such as ecs in groundwater and wwtps ye et al 2019 msw in the form of compost can be utilized in agricultural land to provide nutrition to the growing plants and also it improves the soil texture and structure srivastava et al 2016 6 healthcare and laboratory waste contaminant healthcare units with modern infrastructure facilities are emerging worldwide and routine use of sophisticated instruments and bio medical accessories for diagnosis as well as therapeutics purposes increase waste generation the wastes generated from different animal and human healthcare units and research laboratories including ayush hospitals clinical establishments etc are mostly comprised of surgical needles scalpels blades surgical cotton expired drugs body fluids blood animal tissues and organs are termed as bio medical wastes radha et al 2009 according to bio medical wastes management and handling rules 1998 and successive modifications made by the ministry of environment forest and climate change government of india bio medical waste is defined as any waste which is generated during the diagnosis treatment or immunization of human beings or animals or in research activities pertaining thereto or in the production or testing of biologicals as of 2018 19 india only accounts for the generation of 557 metric tons of bio medical waste per day of which 92 undergoes safe disposal with treatments annual report 2019 it can be speculated that even 8 of biomedical waste can contribute to significant health concerns and ecotoxicological effects due to improper disposal a major portion of these bio medical wastes are non hazardous or general bio medical wastes comprising up to 85 and the rest contain hazardous chemical radioactive waste and infectious wastes chartier 2014 the hazardous wastes which are otherwise known as regulated bio medical waste undergo strict regulations and proper handling and management whereas those coming under non hazardous categories are disposed of according to municipal regulations like those of household wastes this creates a burden on municipal landfill sites the leachates from municipal landfills and improper disposal of hazardous waste have the potential to contaminate groundwater anitha and jayraaj 2012 hospital and laboratory waste contaminants including wastes that originated from wwtp have been found in many aquatic sources such as groundwater and surface water gogoi et al 2018 apart from these poor management and handling of wastes generated by many laboratories and institutions carrying out modern biology and genetic modification research which are not included in bio medical waste but contain genetically engineered microbes and cells can pose a significant impact on health and the environment as they contain toxic substances and even contribute in developing infectious microbes rajor et al 2012 these wastes are placed under the manufacture export import use and storage of hazardous micro organisms genetically engineered micro organisms or cells rules 1989 act for instance ethidium bromide a chemical used to visualize nucleic acids is routinely used and thrown into waste bins and it is known to possess carcinogenic properties a major diagnostic instrument in hospitals and diagnostic centers including a few modern biology research centers use radioactive substances for the detection of diseases such as cancer diagnosis many imaging techniques using x rays etc and these wastes are covered under the provisions of the atomic energy act 1962 33 of 1962 and rules central pollution control board 2016 efficient management of bio medical waste is needed and it would be possible by avoiding waste generation and simultaneously recovering more by reusing and recycling as much waste as possible datta et al 2018 6 1 occurrence and fate of biomedical waste contaminant in groundwater an increase in the per capita waste generation due to the rise in advanced healthcare facilities is a major concern that additionally build up contaminants in wwtp due to improper disposal the contaminants might pose a serious environmental risk to aquatic organisms as well as humans when mixed into aquatic systems based on the available information from the developed countries major healthcare contaminants are pharmaceuticals antibiotics antifungal antimicrobial medicines nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids anticonvulsant antidepressant drugs ass high blood pressure treating drugs such as β blockers steroidal hormones lipid cholesterol lowering drugs x ray contrast agents uv filters nerve stimulants anti pruritic drugs plasticizers insect repellents etc are the major contaminants found in wwtp and aquatic bodies tran et al 2018 mohapatra et al 2018 developed nations have strict regulations for proper disposition management and availability of information on contaminants in environmental samples but the information is lacking or scanty in many developing countries including india and even there is poor management of these wastes tran et al 2018 drugs such as ciprofloxacin cetirizine and fluconazole are detected in higher concentrations in different water sources such as surface water groundwater and wastewater sources in india gani and kazmi 2017 kuroda and kobayashi 2021 sengar and arya 2019 in groundwater 28 μg l cetirizine and 14 μg l ciprofloxacin were observed and in river water the concentrations were 530 μg l and 2500 μg l respectively kuroda and kobayashi 2021 when detected in the wastewaters extremely high concentrations of ciprofloxacin and fluconazole were observed 31 mg l and 236 mg l respectively sengar and arya 2019 pharmaceutical compounds are also widely consumed by humans to inhibit microbial growth for many medical reasons intensive farming due to increased demand for animal proteins and modernization in agriculture and allied activities improved healthcare facilities etc also results in higher antibiotic use that eventually leads to antibiotic resistance manyi loh et al 2018 these antimicrobial compounds are also classified as micropollutants of emerging concern as they impact eco toxicological effects even at low concentrations antibiotics such as tetracyclines penicillins β lactams sulfonamides and trimethoprim macrolides lincosamides and streptogramins quinolones including many other groups are frequently detected in wwtps which facilitates the development of antimicrobial resistance due to continuous exposure of bacteria to these compounds nappier et al 2020 mutuku et al 2022 the favorable climatic condition for the growth of antibiotic resistance microbial population intensive farming and use of antibiotics and agrochemicals particularly antibiotics and pharmaceutical drugs in animal husbandry and pisciculture along with the increased incidence of drug resistance malarial parasites is a major concern menon et al 2020 the occurrence of these emerging health care waste contaminants particularly antibiotics and few pharmaceutical products is largely possible due to their easy availability in pharmaceutical shops without any prescription residual pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics and hormones through urines and feces and the improper disposition of expired drugs from healthcare centers these were eventually introduced to the sewage system giger et al 2003 lapworth et al 2012 mohapatra et al 2016 gogoi et al 2018 sewage systems and wwtp are the major sources of biomedical contaminants that in the long run worsened the quality of groundwater and surface water lapworth et al 2012 mohapatra et al 2016 another possible contamination of groundwater is heavy metals which are used in medicines photographic x ray films and also in various medical instruments the x ray contrast media iopamidol and diatrizoic acid were detected at 24 94 ng l in the groundwater sources of switzerland ens et al 2014 sui et al 2015 the incineration treatment of these wastes produces ash containing a higher concentration of heavy metals which are buried in the municipal landfills and when leached to the surface and groundwater can have serious health hazards to humans and aquatic animals zhao et al 2009 anitha and jayraaj 2012 despite regulatory mechanisms for waste treatments at the source and different treatment facilities still the contaminants are not effectively removed the concentration of ecs is detected in quantities much higher than expected in the water discharged from the sewage treatment plants and sludge samples kapelewska et al 2018 this would otherwise cause an increment of toxic substances in various aquatic resources li 2014 healthcare and biomedical waste contaminants detected in the wastewaters mostly consist of antibiotics used for human and animal husbandry practices steroid hormones and edcs and many pcps lapworth et al 2012 gogoi et al 2018 in the groundwater the higher level of ecs observed are mostly antibiotics and pcps the different concentration levels are lipid regulators 7 5 μg l antibiotics 0 2 μg l antiepileptic drugs 1 1 μg l 17β estradiol 13 80 ng l and the plasticizer bisphenol a 0 5 44 ng l gogoi et al 2018 indiscriminate use of antibiotics is the leading cause of the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb which is a serious health concern quinolones sulfonamides tetracycline and their corresponding genes are most prevalent in the groundwater zainab et al 2020 bacteria consuming a higher amount of antibiotics from the contaminated environment makes them resistant and on the other hand antibiotic resistance genes args may easily be transferred among the bacteria through horizontal gene transfer developing arb through sw gw exchange and many other processes groundwater may also be contaminated with args and arb harb et al 2019 zainab et al 2020 rout et al 2021a the effect of edcs has been shown to elicit adverse impact on egg development and hormonal imbalance sex change particularly in aquatic animals which is a serious concern as the feminization of male fish has been observed due to the androgenic or estrogenic activities of edcs li 2014 gogoi et al 2018 major treatment protocols in wwtp are carried out to remove organic substances and suspended solids but are not effective in removing organic pharmaceuticals and other related biomedical wastes particularly if they are hydrophilic many other treatment operations followed to reduce the egcs include biodegradation photo degradation chemical degradation and sorption among these photo degradation and photo transformation are the most promising and ecofriendly natural attenuation processes which can degrade pharmaceutical compounds in surface waters exposed to sunlight mohapatra et al 2021 all these primary treatments and other secondary treatments are not adequate to completely remove the pharmaceutical wastes from wwtp this necessitates another tertiary treatment process that would significantly lower the concentration of the biomedical waste contaminants so that there will be less chance of accumulation in the surface water and groundwater resources mohapatra et al 2016 sorption is the adsorption of the contaminants to the soil surface and other substances in the surface and subsurface zone which is influenced by the ionic condition of the contaminants and the ph of the medium for example atenolol is the β blocker a drug used to treat hypertension and it can readily dissolve in water with a higher retention time due to the presence of the amine group atenolol contamination from groundwater natural aquifers and sewage water or wwtp can be removed by a chemical degradation process through cation exchange or competitive sorption in the subsurface soil zone this way the accumulation of the drug would be reduced in the groundwater schaffer et al 2012 lapworth et al 2012 fona 2013 schaffer and licha 2014 on the other hand negatively charged drugs such as diclofenac and ibuprofen are resistant to sorption onto negatively charged subsurface matrices or weakly bind to the neutral surface which poses a serious problem from removal from groundwater sources lapworth et al 2012 degradation of antibiotics from the drinking water supply and wwtp is a cumbersome process due to the unavailability of simple and cost effective methods recently an ecofriendly method has been utilized to see the antibiotics degradation process using horseradish peroxidase enzyme in contaminated water containing tetracycline liang et al 2021 apart from this the biodegradation by microorganisms or biotransformation to a less toxic form photo degradation by light induced mechanism and interaction with other extrinsic factors in the soil matrices such as aerobic and anaerobic conditions greatly affect the fate of contaminants mohapatra et al 2021 for instance the aerobic condition favors the growth of microorganisms in the subsurface soil zone which can be positively correlated with the microbial biotransformation of residual pharmaceutical compounds dissolved in the water whereas in the anaerobic condition biodegradation may not be possible or even if possible it takes longer time buerge et al 2006 kujawa roeleveld et al 2008 de mes et al 2008 li 2014 another pretreatment procedure followed in the case of biomedical wastes is incineration technology due to high temperature treatments hazardous substances containing infectious microorganisms are destroyed and converted to ash containing a few elemental forms including heavy metals called incinerated bio medical waste ash ibwa rajor et al 2012 the ibwa can finally be disposed of in the municipal landfills which could be the source of heavy metal contaminants to groundwater through leaching and percolation parameswari et al 2012 6 1 1 health hazard ecs in healthcare and laboratory wastes that contains mostly pharmaceutical compounds such as antibiotics nsaids and edc can pose serious health hazards and ecotoxicological effect on humans and aquatic animals estrone 17 β estradiol and 17 α ethynylestradiol etc are the medicines used for birth control that can induce sex change such as the feminization of male fish gogoi et al 2018 li 2014 kidney and gills of fishes can be affected by nsaids as observed in the case of diclofenac treatment in brown trout fish salmo trutta f fario hoeger et al 2005 the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the natural environment due to unhygienic and unsafe drinking water consumption such as urinary tract infection might occur due to carbapenem resistance klebsiella pneumoniae infection diarrhea and dysentery due to ciprofloxacin resistant shigella spp infection world health organization 2017 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 6 2 remediation of healthcare and laboratory waste contaminant the hospital and laboratory wastes containing hazardous materials should follow strict guidelines for safe disposal after pre treatment of the wastes the following major treatment technologies at source points such as hospitals and laboratories using chemical physical or biological means can be undertaken for safe remediation a disinfection treatment with chemicals such as sodium hypochlorite ozone or alkaline hydrolysis b thermal treatments such as low temperature treatment 100 180 c using autoclave microwave or high temperature treatment 200 1000 c using an incinerator combustion infrared heat etc c irradiation treatments such as the use of uv rays and electron beams d encapsulation treatment in which hazardous waste materials are sealed in high density plastic or metallic containers with some immobilized materials e biological treatments such as the use of microbes and enzymes for the degradation of non toxic substances f finally buried in the landfills after treating in all possible ways and by reducing reusing and recycling where ever possible world health organization 2017 7 conclusions and future scope of research the socio economic development of the country largely depends on groundwater resources the groundwater quality is a major apprehension as it is the backbone of the potable water supply in urban as well as rural areas the chemical composition of groundwater depends on the extent and nature of rock water interaction and is also affected by diverse geological formations and varying climatic in recent years groundwater contamination worldwide has become an emerging concern due to the improvement in detection methods and availability of information a large number of egcs are arising from anthropogenic activities and poor sanitation management dearth of awareness among the people indiscriminate use of high doses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides household wastes biomedical wastes containing pharmaceuticals and ppcs are contaminating groundwater either through municipality landfill leachates or through wwtps contaminated groundwater leads to severe health consequences for humans and aquatic animals information on many of the egcs is even not detected due to the lack of knowledge in situ and ex situ remediation technologies are available to eliminate the risk of egcs to human health and the ecosystem as a whole but more research ought to be undertaken to see the ecotoxicological effects that are unforeseeable due to the mixed chemical nature of the egcs the environmental interactions of these egcs need to be studied and future research should be undertaken on the development of advanced treatment techniques along with combinatorial treatment methods for efficient removal of egcs declaration of competing interest the authors

11701,fresh water shortage waterborne diseases due to unsafe drinking water and environmental imbalance are caused by water pollution and aquatic habitat deterioration traditional methods for monitoring polluted water are not efficient enough for assessment of various inorganic pollutants and microorganisms degrading water due to their variability with time and sources bio sensitiveness reliability selectivity low cost simplicity and real time response are attracting the attention of researchers for developing biosensor devices to detect toxic chemicals in drinking water artificial intelligence techniques using image analysis are successfully employed for detecting contaminants in water and quality monitoring this paper highlights different types of biosensors to detect water contaminants and ways to enhance water quality the working and application of different types of biosensors are also discussed the present work also highlights the use of nanomaterials in the field of the biosensors this paper also includes an overview of the importance of multiscale modeling in designing the biosensor and then the challenges and future scope in this field graphical abstract image 1 keywords biosensor wastewater treatment heavy metal microbial contaminants drinking water multiscale modeling data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction unsafe water is one of the world s most serious health and environmental issues especially in poor and developing countries each year 1 2 million people die due to the consumption of contaminated water unsafe water resources are responsible for 6 of deaths in low income countries about 20 of the world s population does not have access to safe drinking water infectious disorders such as typhoid dysentery diarrhea cholera hepatitis a and polio are all linked to the unavailability of clean water supplies it also worsens malnutrition particularly stunting in children fig 1 shows that it is one of the major factors responsible for deaths around the world in 2017 1 2 percent died prematurely as a result of contaminated water according to the global burden of disease research to put this into perspective this was three times the number of homicides in 2017 and equal to the number of people killed in road accidents around the world ritchie and roser 2021 contagious diseases are triggered by chemical and biological impurities in drinking and tap water the demand for fresh and safe water has risen sharply due to rapid industrialization increased urbanization rising living standards and dependence on irrigated agriculture many pollutants including pathogenic escherichia coli are introduced into the environment through wastewater including organic inorganic chemicals pesticides and heavy metals the world is facing acute shortage of safe drinking water not just because of diminishing supplies but also because of declining quality as a result many governments are giving priority to reduce hazardous effluents entering the environment and polluting water hossain and mansour 2019 drinking water quality is an important environmental predictor of health physical chemical and microbiological aspects are used to characterize the quality of water heavy metals organic substances total suspended solids and turbidity are all indicated by physical and chemical measurements chemical parameters in most cases provide a chronic health risk by accumulating heavy metals over time while other components such as arsenic and nitrites nitrates might show a more immediate effect on the other hand physical characteristics impact the appearance and flavor of drinking water and the elimination of microbiological infections drinking water quality is the most critical aspect considering vulnerable populations such as children immune compromised adults etc pal et al 2018 to provide a secure and clean water supply quick and sensitive detection procedures are essential human health is harmed by contaminated water which can lead to communicable diseases like influenza hepatitis sars gastric ulcers pulmonary disease and pneumonia the water supply contains a number of non biological pollutants including silica salt sulfur ammonia and chlorine to name a few heavy metals such as nickel ni cadmium cd arsenic as mercury hg and lead pb are also present in water sources these non biological pollutants are among the most commonly identified contaminants in urban environments where a wide range of human activities occur zulkifli et al 2018 groundwater contains chemical species like hg zn cd chromium cr lead pb fluoride f and metalloid species like selenium se and arsenic as in concentrations above the who limit the majority of them seriously harm people s health these metals and metalloids are naturally occurring substances on earth and their concentration changes with local geology algieri et al 2022 chen et al reported that arsenic is a naturally occurring environmental contaminant to which humans are frequently exposed it has been associated with several health problems including heart disease neurological diseases and cancer it is a group 1 human carcinogen and is on the first priority list for dangerous substances in the united states comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the epa chen and rosen 2014 xiang et al observed the natural concentration of toxic chemicals pb and hg was found to be less than 0 003 ng ml in streams on the other hand heavy metal concentrations in polluted waterbodies may be two to three orders of magnitude greater than natural concentrations or even higher the majority of biosensors use electrochemical methods to detect mercury cadmium lead and copper xiang et al 2020 ooi et al reported agrochemical sprays dispersants and pesticides contain sodium lauryl sulfate which is hazardous to aquatic species it changes the morphology of organs like the spleen and kidney affects swimming abilities metabolism and the growth and mortality rates of fish species it severely influences the fertilization of ova and sperm in fish reducing the chances of fertilization and is also hazardous to rodents and humans ooi et al 2015 legionella cryptosporidium giardia pseudomonas and e coli are commonly discovered microbes in drinking water sources according to the world health organization who zulkifli et al 2018 table 1 includes most of the chemical contaminants and the related diseases caused by thema contaminant s regulatory limit indicates the level of protection for human health that water systems can accomplish with the best available technology according to the world health organization report on global shortage of safe drinking water and its health consequences at least 2 billion people drink contaminated water and each year around 4 85 000 diarrhoeal fatalities are caused by contaminated drinking water by 2025 half of the world s population would be living in water stressed areas wastewater reuse for the recovery of water minerals or energy has become one of the necessities wastewater is increasingly being used for irrigation in poor nations accounting for 7 of all irrigated land while improper wastewater management poses health dangers proper wastewater management can result in various benefits including enhanced food production chouler and biosensors 2015 drinking water n d water monitoring technology is widely used to detect contaminants including water treatment plants and water distribution systems and in a wide array of water ecology applications in recent decades a considerable demand for research has been made to produce robust and efficient contamination detection technologies with low running costs and energy recent biosensor and spectroscopic technological breakthroughs have quantitatively and qualitatively enhanced detection sensitivity ritchie and roser 2021 present work reviews different types of biosensors that can be used to detect water contaminants and improve water quality water monitoring analytical technologies have evolved from traditional analytical methods to today s fast and accurate biosensing devices traditional microfluidic devices laboratory based analysis instrumental model based event detection and spectroscopic approaches are being replaced by modern biosensors for water monitoring accurately identifying and detecting chemical pollutants in water depends upon the appropriate detection method which may involve quantitative qualitative or hybrid measurements for a long time chemical and biological sensors have been in high demand for use in water monitoring technologies and are easy to integrate and commercialize zulkifli et al 2018 reusing wastewater particularly from urban effluent has emerged as a practical solution to the scarcity of freshwater sources for various uses reclamation and reusing of wastewater are now acknowledged as an integral component of water resource conservation especially in nations with limited access to fresh water the usage of wastewater following an appropriate treatment procedure necessitates effective water quality monitoring before reclaimed water can be used for diverse uses it must meet quality standards eliminating dangerous pollutants as a crucial and mandatory need abdullah et al 2017 the selection design and operation of treatment technologies as well as the recycling of waste depend on the concentration of elements in wastewater the development of new technology to monitor waste products utilizing affordable and real time methodologies has received increased attention due to the fluctuating composition of pollutants in wastewater depending upon time and locations the various qualities of waste fluids that are disposed of or reused are regularly measured using a variety of quality indicators most of them are based on laboratory techniques which are slow and expensive because they need frequent data sampling and sample pre treatment these factors indicate the requirement of the development of new techniques that are more sensitive portable and effective in the on site detection of multiple contaminants made up of a variety of components ejeian et al 2018 the development of various monitoring techniques to measure the level of contamination before during and after the proper treatment of the public sewage processes has been sparked by the requirement of continuous wastewater quality management abdullah et al 2017 2 biosensors water contamination produced by various heavy metals can be monitored using biosensors which are a simple reliable and quick solution provider iupac defines the biosensor as a self contained integrated device capable of providing specific quantitative or semi quantitative analytical information using a biological recognition element biochemical receptor which is retained in a direct spatial contact with an electrochemical transduction element in addition to the presence of heavy metals with their total biologically accessible levels in the water sometimes plays more important role than chemical composition biosensors can be utilized to measure their biological impacts such as cytotoxicity or toxicity odobašić et al 2019 for wastewater treatment and water reclamation procedures monitoring the precise level of organic matter in wastewater is crucial for the environment and human health using organic materials in wastewater treatment applications has several drawbacks including the generation of toxic byproducts and fouling of membrane filtering systems two typical variables are frequently examined to analyze the concentration of organic materials in water environments the biochemical oxygen demand bod index which measures the volume of oxygen that aerobic microbes use to decompose biodegradable organic materials the second is the chemical oxygen demand cod which measures how much oxygen is being consumed by chemical processes in water the conventional method for characterising bod is based on in situ measurements taken over a brief period or off line monitoring conducted over a period of 5 or 7 days however compared to traditional methods biosensors offer faster and more accurate findings for the detection of these indices cheulkar et al coupling of a transducer with bio element forms the biosensor which functions exactly like a human nose with low detection limits the human nose can qualitatively identify numerous compounds and even provide early knowledge of the concentration olfactory receptors are used to sense odour which acts as the sensory element the data from the olfactory membrane is converted into an electrical signal by the olfactory nerve cells which act as a transducer the brain decodes the received signal and converts it into a feeling or perception functioning as a microprocessor the typical biosensor design is insufficient for monitoring a wide range of target analytes on the other hand many biosensors have been developed that use entire microorganisms as the sensing element to quickly and spectacularly detect inorganic contaminants and heavy metals quickly zulkifli et al 2018 the biological element and transducer are the two main components of any biosensor 2 1 biological element baroreceptor the presence and concentration of a chemical analyte i e material to be detected are detected using biological components antibodies enzymes nucleic acids and entire cells are the most prevalent biological constituents when antibodies are used as the biological ingredient biosensor sensitivity is greatly improved nucleic acids rna and dna usually react due to their base pairing characteristics with the right element substrate these are excellent for detecting genetic disorders hossain and mansour 2019 2 2 transducer the transducer is the key element and essential part of a biosensor the transducer sends a physical change into a signal that may be later processed biomaterials or biological components can be connected or mixed with the transducer hossain and mansour 2019 most transducers provide optical and electrical signals that are typically proportionate to the number of interactions between the analyte and the bioreceptor an analyte is a material of interest that must be detected and a bioreceptor is a molecule that identifies the analyte precisely bhalla et al 2016 zulkifli et al 2018 the basic block diagram of biosensor functioning presented by naresh et al naresh and lee 2021 is redrawn and shown in fig 2 naresh and lee 2021 electrochemical piezoelectric optical and thermal biosensors are various types of biosensors available today for the fabrication of biosensors different types of transducers are used in a variety of applications fig 3 gives the classification of biosensors based on the detection method and transducer system namhil and kemp 2018 shavanova et al 2016 2 3 electrochemical biosensors electrochemical biosensors were among the first biosensors to be proposed widely published and marketed when a biomolecule bio receptor interacts with a target analyte ions or electrons are created or consumed and the electrical current or potential electrical properties of the analyte solution are altered these changes are detected by the transducer which generates an electrochemical signal proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample solution low sample preparation requirement and sensitivity in tiny sample quantities are two advantages of electrochemical biosensors direct sample analysis is also possible allowing for automation the low repeatability and stability of detections are disadvantageous for the sensing odobašić et al 2019 electrochemical biosensors are categorized into three subclasses based on the type of detected signal conductometric amperometric and potentiometric 2 3 1 potentiometric transducers in potentiometric transducers ion selective electrodes are used for measuring the change these electrodes are responsible for selectively targeting the ions when the sample interferes at zero current open circuit the difference between the potentials emf of the working electrode and reference electrode are measured by these devices to determine the analyte concentration 8 18 equation 1 is the relation governing the ion selective

2019 2 3 2 amperometric transducers this biosensor is known to be the most prevalent electrochemical biosensor type it is an integrated self contained device that provides particular quantitative analytical information by measuring the current generated by the oxidation or reduction of an electroactive biological constituent sadeghi 2013 compared with potentiometric biosensors amperometric biosensors are faster and more sensitive but they have interference from non interesting electroactive chemicals and poor selectivity zulkifli et al 2018 amperometric biosensors detect the current flow between electrodes on the occurrence of a redox reaction the glucose biosensor is arguably the best studied amperometric biosensor technology glucose oxidase gox catalyses the reaction of glucose with oxygen to gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide in this system a redox reaction of hydrogen peroxide or a mediator at the working electrode causes the signal to be represented as current ampere

perform at a low voltage are light insensitive can easily be miniaturized and do not need a reference electrode odobašić et al 2019 mikkelsen et al investigated conductometric transducer for enzymatic urea and d amino acid biosensors these constructed conduct metric transducers do not appear to be viable for in vivo applications since they respond to ionic strength variations mikkelsen and rechnitz 1989 shulga et al constructed a thin film based conduct metric transducer for urea and glucose detection the buffer capacity of the examined sample had no bearing on the biosensor s kinetic response moreover this biosensor did not require an electrode reference for this type sensor al cu cr and ni electrodes are being investigated by research as laad and jatti 2015 shul ga et al 1994 2 4 optical biosensor optical biosensors provide several advantages over traditional analytical techniques including the ability to detect a wide range of biological and chemical compounds directly in real time and without the use of labels a biorecognition sensing element is merged with an optical transducer system in an optical biosensor which is small analytical equipment an optical biosensor s primary goal is to provide a signal proportional to the concentration of material being examined analyte as biorecognition elements the optical biosensor can use a variety of biological components such as antibodies enzymes receptors nucleic acids antigens entire cells and tissues damborský et al 2016 depending on their optical architecture biosensors can be extrinsic or intrinsic the incident light wave is contained within a waveguide or in optical fiber and propagates into the intrinsic biosensors but the wave structure is designed to allow the analyte to interact with the wave the light wave passes through the sampling phase and responds in extrinsic biosensors and the optical fiber is employed for the transmission of the signal odobašić et al 2019 ultraviolet visible absorption internal reflection spectroscopy fluorescence phosphorescence emission bioluminescence chemiluminescence laser light scattering and surface plasma spectroscopy are the most common photometric techniques used in optical biosensors hossain and mansour 2019 2 4 1 label free optical detection in a label free detection the detected signal is formed immediately by the analyte and the appropriate transducer interacting on site a label free mode greatly decreases the cost expertise and labor required to develop assays by eliminating experimental errors such as background fluorescence shelf life and quenching khansili et al 2018 2 4 1 1 surface plasmon resonance spr spr is a label free one of the most advanced and useful techniques spr is used for the detection of toxic materials due to its high sensitivity versatility and possibility of real time read out when a metal film is illuminated changes in refractive index at the film s surface is detected by spr sensors where surface plasmons electromagnetic waves propagate peltomaa et al 2018 in other words spr is a surface sensitive optical technology that links to the evanescent electromagnetic field emf produced by incident light under total internal reflections of the surface of a thin metal sheet because the evanescent field reduces exponentially as the penetrating distance from the interface increases only surface confined molecule interactions on the transducer surface are monitored using spr f long et al 2013a b when interacting with light waves metal nanostructures are smaller in size than the incident wavelength phenomenon of localized surface plasmon resonance occurs this is a significant advancement for spr based biosensors for small molecules direct detection by spr sensor is difficult because of their tiny size as a result analyte binding produces a very small change in refractive leading to observations with low signal to noise ratios on the other hand direct detection is simpler and offers several advantages over indirect methods including smaller sample volumes shorter assay times the ability to do direct kinetic measurements and the elimination of the conjugated analyte competitor spr sensor performance is influenced by the biofunctionalization and chemical interface as well as the structural electrical and optical properties of the instrument peltomaa et al 2018 2 4 1 2 grating coupler fibre optic and evanescent wave biosensor when a grating is integrated into a planar optical waveguide the spectrum of guided light modes can be observed and monitored due to chemical interactions with the waveguide s surface the peaks in the spectrum shift when the waveguide s surface is exposed to various solutions it is a highly sensitive method that can track these interactions in real time this integrated optical approach does not require radioactive fluorescent or other types of labeling because it depends on the refractive index i e polarizability density in the waveguide surface region its sensing concept is analogous to the evanescent surface plasmon field of spr technology in this sensing technique the evanescent emf of guided light spans a few hundred nano meters above the waveguide vörös et al 2002 evanescent confines the interaction of biosensor input output and fluidics inflow outflow to a single interface therefore the evanescent system has found wide applications and flexibility in the design of biosensors in luminous sensors evanescent light stimulates luminescent molecules on the waveguide surface capturing and guiding the emitted light as a result the bulk sample s background signal can be reduced and this detection method is usually more selective and sensitive than label free techniques for detecting small molecules peltomaa et al 2018 2 4 1 3 interferometric interferometric biosensors function by measuring changes in refractive index caused by a biorecognition event in the detecting area an interference pattern is formed by combining two light beams reference beams and the sensor which is used to measure the change in the sensor region the recognition element e g enzymes aptamers antibodies is functionalized and is responsible for recognizing target analyte selectively the recognition element must be immobilized in order to make the sensor work efficiently peltomaa et al 2018 this technology also known as resonant waveguide grating can be used to identify cellular redistribution analyze cellular responses and cellular activities and has been used to detect the avian influenza virus damborský et al 2016 this sensor can do multi analyte or multi sample analysis by merging different channel pairs sensing reference into a single waveguide peltomaa et al 2018 2 4 2 label optical detection a label is used to generate an optical signal using a fluorescent luminescent or colorimetric approach in label based sensing khansili et al 2018 2 4 2 1 fluorescence fluorescence is the most widely employed method in the fields of drug development biotechnology and medical testing and it is the analytical approach of choice in a wide range of schemes the detection of a single molecule is the highest level of sensitivity possible and it has long been a target of analytical procedures fluorescence is a natural choice for single molecule detection because of its great sensitivity and the fact that a bright signal shows against a dark backdrop strianese et al 2012 fluorescent tags such as dyes are used to mark either target molecules or biorecognition molecules in fluorescence based detection the fluorescence intensity reflects the existence of target molecules as well as the strength of interaction between biorecognition molecules and target fluorescence detection is extremely sensitive with a detection limit of one single molecule but it is affected by difficult processes of labelling that can potentially affect a biomolecule s function the quantitative analysis is difficult as the number of fluorophores per molecule can t be exactly regulated because of the fluorescence signal bias fan et al 2008 2 4 2 2 luminescence luminescence is a common phenomenon in which molecules produce light as they return to their ground state after being stimulated depending on the source of the energy that leads to this excited state different types of luminescence can be observed and recognized chemiluminescence in which light is produced by chemical reactions is of particular interest bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence that is connected with living organisms and reactions catalysed by enzymes the inclusion of enzymes gives the system molecular recognition features that are one of a kind in terms of specificity especially when chiral molecules are involved blum and coulet 2000 optical immunosensors are comprised of labels capable of causing optical changes light emitting enzymes such as peroxidase and luciferase fluorescent compounds and electrochemical luminescent molecules are among the labels due to optoelectronic technology high dynamic range and low detection limits immunosensors with a luminous label have become popular aizawa et al 1989 2 4 2

procedures have been demonstrated for the detection of various analytes for a single test from pathogens to toxic chemicals which may be seen with the naked eye or detected using optical devices they are however limited to laboratory settings due to the complexity and fragility of the apparatus required for detection luka et al 2017 2 5 piezoelectric biosensor piezoelectric transducers are employed as biorecognition elements in piezoelectric biosensors because of the availability and great thermal strength and chemical stability in aqueous solutions quartz crystals are most prevalent in this type of biosensor a piezoelectric material produces electrical power when twisted under mechanical stress and conversely deforms elastically when subjected to an electric field odobašić et al 2019 this means these devices convert the vibrations on their surfaces into electrical voltages the adsorbed material on the surface of the substance or the mass of the substance can impact the frequency of vibration which can be connected to variations in the measured frequency hossain and mansour 2019 the frequency change occurring in the transducer is given by equation 2 2 δ f k f 2 δ m a where df change in resonant frequency f resonant frequency k constant for particular crystal a absorbing surface area and dm mass difference of absorbed material the change in resonance frequencies caused by analyte adsorption on the piezoelectric signal is measured by the transducer piezoelectric immunosensors are devices made of materials like quartz crystals that have a bioreceptor adsorbed on their surface such as silver or antimony and which resonate on the application of an external alternating electric field the mass changes in the quartz crystal are proportional to the resonance frequency the biospecific response between two interacting molecules one fixed on the surface and the other free in solution or can be monitored in real time the insecticide carbaryl and 3 5 6 trichloro 2 pyridinol tcp the major metabolite of the pesticide chlorpyrifos and the herbicide triclopyr were determined using a piezo immunosensor for detection monoclonal antibodies were utilized in a competitive conjugate immobilized immunoassay the immunosensor s great precision and accuracy enable it to be used to determine carbaryl and tcp marrazza 2014 2 6 thermal biosensors thermal biosensors are also known as calorimetric biosensors these biosensors detect bio receptors and analyte interactions producing a heat change proportional to analyte concentration odobašić et al 2019 thermistors can be used to determine heat change which can be connected to measuring analyte concentration hossain and mansour 2019 the thermistors which are used for measuring the changes in the temperature are based on an electrical temperature resistance variation and follow the relation as given by equation 3 3 r 1 r 2 e β 1 t 1 1 t 2 where r1 and r2 are the resistances of the thermistor and t1 and t2 temperature in kelvin and b is thermistor constant thermal biosensors have several advantages including detection without reactant labelling no periodic recalibration and no interference from the sample s electrochemical and optical properties odobašić et al 2019 3 biosensors for monitoring the water quality there are several factors responsible for water quality changes in nutrition temperature sediment ph and a number of trace constituents such as nutrients heavy metals pesticides and biological factors have a negative impact on the health of water systems biosensors play an important role in the detection of contaminants in drinking water enzymatic biosensors account for the majority of biosensors based on the principles of electrochemical reactions the advantage of enzymatic biosensors is their great selectivity for the target analyte however they are time consuming comparatively expensive and possess low stability because of enzyme deactivation or leaching on the other hand the use of bacteria has the advantage of being incredibly simple to produce biocatalysts especially in large quantities traditional biosensors are less versatile and sensitive to a wider variety of analytes but microbial biosensors are more adaptable and sensitive to a wider range of analytes electrochemical methods such as conductometry potentiometry and amperometry are commonly used for microbial sensors optical microbial biosensors are widely used chouler and biosensors 2015 because antibodies have high specificity and binding affinity for antigens that are damaging to the organism antibody based biosensors can be utilized to detect metal ions these devices use the formation of antibody metal ion complexes as a detecting approach a transducer converts the result of their immunochemical interaction into quantifiable results which are then processed into readable values antibodies can detect antigens in extremely low quantities odobašić et al 2019

multiscale modeling approach all sensors are designed with one fundamental idea in mind to employ a transduction mechanism to detect changes in the environment around them whether the sensor is mechanical electrical or optical achieving high fidelity performance depends on the transduction mechanism s precision sensor shrinking accelerated with the development of nanotechnology and transduction devices with footprints smaller than a micron are now a reality antosiewicz and käll 2016 chemo bio mechanical phenomena in biosensing present an alluring opportunity for computational mechanics researchers to examine these phenomena with approaches that have not yet been utilized and to offer fresh insights into the design of next generation ultrasensitive biosensors and nano biosensors chen et al 2016 francesco petrosino et al petrosino et al 2020 2021 2022 noted that modeling and simulation are regarded as effective engineering and scientific techniques that connect physical chemical phenomena and properties of complex systems a fundamental biological process in nature protein adsorption on material surfaces has numerous potential applications in the domains of biosensors biofuel cells biocatalysis biomaterials and protein chromatography the study of protein interfacial adsorption characteristics is therefore extremely important from both a theoretical as well as a practical point of view controlling the protein s adsorption orientation on surfaces is one of the key scientific concerns in the study of regulated protein adsorption in general proteins can bind to material surfaces in either a random or ordered orientation it has been shown that an ordered adsorption orientation is advantageous for proteins to execute their biological functions more effectively for example to improve the effectiveness of the subsequent antibody antigen binding in biosensor applications antibodies should be immobilized with a certain and ordered end on orientation quan et al 2019 it has been recognized that protein adsorption on material surfaces can be affected by factors originating from three aspects including protein properties protein size rigidity and distribution of charged residues etc surface properties surface wettability charge morphology etc and external conditions temperature solution ph ionic strength etc these factors would influence protein adsorption in a synergistic manner thus leading to the extreme complexity of this scientific issue to investigate protein adsorption behaviors on material surfaces considerable experimental and theoretical simulation studies have been conducted however the resolution of current experimental techniques is still not enough to quantitatively determine the adsorption orientation and conformation of proteins at the atomistic level with the fast development of computer technology molecular simulation plays an increasingly important role in revealing the mechanism of chemical and biological processes and designing and developing new products molecular simulation as an alternative to experimental and theoretical methods has become a powerful tool for exploring the adsorption behaviors of proteins on material surfaces from the molecular viewpoint quan et al 2019 s curcio et al 2018 reported the interaction between protein and membrane surfaces using the concept of multiscale modeling francesco petrosino et al 2019 reported the study of enzyme immobilization on polymer membranes in this study adsorption of phospotriesterage on polysulphone membrane was investigated using a multiscale modeling approach the model s outcomes were helpful in learning more about the enzyme s adhesion and providing guidance on the orientations of its binding site chen et al 2011 reported that micro cantilever mcl surface bent due to the adsorption of biomolecules on it the phenomenon naturally calls for multiscale modeling according to him one needs to understand the microscopic mechanism at the molecular level and transfer critical information associated with bending deformation to the device level the multiscale study of the mcl was fundamental to understand the mechanisms of molecular recognition and their correlation with the mcl response adsorbate induced surface stresses have been extensively studied over the past few decades it is known that the adsorption of small molecules onto a clean crystalline surface changes atomic configurations bond angles and electron distribution on the surface the surface reconstruction leads to the change of the surface stress for complex biomolecular interactions such as the adsorption of protein on the mcl mechanisms such as electrostatic steric and van der waals interactions between neighboring adsorbates and conformational changes of adsorbed biomolecules have been proposed chen et al 2011 2016 for a solid liquid interface covered with biomolecules additional mechanisms such as the alternation of the electrical double layer in a buffer solution and the change of a hydrophobic to the hydrophilic surface due to adsorption have been suggested given the diversity and complexity of biosensing applications the aforementioned mechanisms are likely to be coupled it remains very challenging to identify dominant mechanisms for a given biosensing application chen et al 2011 2016 chen et al 2011 derived the multiscale scheme based on the minimization of the total energy with respect to the mcl curvature the total energy contains the bending elastic energy and the energy of biomolecular adsorption as equation 4 the former can be obtained on the basis of the linear elastic theory the later can be calculated from atomistic simulations for example first principles density functional theory dft simulations or classical molecular dynamics simulations with proper empirical interatomic potentials the conceptual link between the mcl biosensing platform multiscale modeling and surface characterization presented by chen et al 2011 is redrawn and shown in fig 4 below chen et al 2011 4 e t o t a l e b e n d i n g e a d s o r p t i o n the bending elastic energy is 5 e e l a s t i c y

macroscale physical quantity curvature tomsaz et al antosiewicz and käll 2016 reported the importance of multiscale modeling in designing the biosensor they used a multiscale approach utilizing electromagnetic calculations and stochastic diffusion reaction simulations to minimize the readout uncertainty of functionalized plasmonic molecular sensors this minimization is equivalent to maximizing a plasmonic sensors q factor which is the ratio of the mean and standard deviation of the peak shift the three factors influencing the accuracy of such sensors are the inhomogeneity of the plasmonic response and the spatial binding probability both affected by the sensor shape as well as the stochastic properties of receptor occupancy tomsaz et al applied this methodology to study the uncertainty of counting molecules using a typical plasmonic sensor the nanorod as a function of its aspect ratio this approach significantly reduced the errors in experimentation and paved the way to

image analysis based detection approaches are significantly outperformed by ai 8 challenges and future scope many biosensor results are misinterpreted as false positives to address these challenges much effort must be put into developing effective biocontainment strategies and methodologies for fine tuning biosensor sensitivity and specificity although non living easily adjustable cell free biosensors address some of these challenges it is still impossible to predict how changing certain parameters impacts a sensor s overall function future cell free sensor development should concentrate on discovering and optimizing the aspects that lead to effective sensor and reporter function in cell free systems for biosensing thavarajah et al 2020 samples are usually verified in a laboratory to manage contaminants and pathogens in water which means that the time between collection and measurement delays the result if a quick response is required such as if the water is drinkable or if environmental disasters must be avoided this method is insufficient in recent years several research groups have been working on portable water analysis equipment however not all contaminants in a

biosensors for fast determination of toxicity in water n d contaminations often comprise mixtures of compounds that need to be identified in combination drugs with comparable modes of action usually behave additively but compounds with different modes of action might cause synergism and antagonism interfering with the observed effects depending on the strain and substances involved this can improve or hinder the bacteria s capacity to detect the total parameter of a complex mixture s collective activity more attention should be paid to the importance of these compound reactions woutersen et al 2011 when developing nanosensors safety of materials should be considered as an integral part of the initial design and not at the end of the design cycle the health and environmental

critical aspect considering vulnerable populations such as children immune compromised adults etc pal et al 2018 to provide a secure and clean water supply quick and sensitive detection procedures are essential human health is harmed by contaminated water which can lead to communicable diseases like influenza hepatitis sars gastric ulcers pulmonary disease and pneumonia the water supply contains a number of non biological pollutants including silica salt sulfur ammonia and chlorine to name a few heavy metals such as nickel ni cadmium cd arsenic as mercury hg and lead pb are also present in water sources these non biological pollutants are among the most commonly identified contaminants in urban environments where a wide range of human activities occur zulkifli et al 2018 groundwater contains chemical species like hg zn cd chromium cr lead pb fluoride f and metalloid species like selenium se and arsenic as in concentrations above the who limit the majority of them seriously harm people s health these metals and metalloids are naturally occurring substances on earth and their concentration changes with local geology algieri et al 2022 chen et al reported that arsenic is a naturally occurring environmental contaminant to which humans are frequently exposed it has been associated with several health problems including heart disease neurological diseases and cancer it is a group 1 human carcinogen and is on the first priority list for dangerous substances in the united states comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the epa chen and rosen 2014 xiang et al observed the natural concentration of toxic chemicals pb and hg was found to be less than 0 003 ng ml in streams on the other hand heavy metal concentrations in polluted waterbodies may be two to three orders of magnitude greater than natural concentrations or even higher the majority of biosensors use electrochemical methods to detect mercury cadmium lead and copper xiang et al 2020 ooi et al reported agrochemical sprays dispersants and pesticides contain sodium lauryl sulfate which is hazardous to aquatic species it changes the morphology of organs like the spleen and kidney affects swimming abilities metabolism and the growth and mortality rates of fish species it severely influences the fertilization of ova and sperm in fish reducing the chances of fertilization and is also hazardous to rodents and humans ooi et al 2015 legionella cryptosporidium giardia pseudomonas and e coli are commonly discovered microbes in drinking water sources according to the world health organization who zulkifli et al 2018 table 1 includes most of the chemical contaminants and the related diseases caused by thema contaminant s regulatory limit indicates the level of protection for human health that water systems can accomplish with the best available technology according to the world health organization report on global shortage of safe drinking water and its health consequences at least 2 billion people drink contaminated water and each year around 4 85 000 diarrhoeal fatalities are caused by contaminated drinking water by 2025 half of the world s population would be living in water stressed areas wastewater reuse for the recovery of water minerals or energy has become one of the necessities wastewater is increasingly being used for irrigation in poor nations accounting for 7 of all irrigated land while improper wastewater management poses health dangers proper wastewater management can result in various benefits including enhanced food production chouler and biosensors 2015 drinking water n d water monitoring technology is widely used to detect contaminants including water treatment plants and water distribution systems and in a wide array of water ecology applications in recent decades a considerable demand for research has been made to produce robust and efficient contamination detection technologies with low running costs and energy recent biosensor and spectroscopic technological breakthroughs have quantitatively and qualitatively enhanced detection sensitivity ritchie and roser 2021 present work reviews different types of biosensors that can be used to detect water contaminants and improve water quality water monitoring analytical technologies have evolved from traditional analytical methods to today s fast and accurate biosensing devices traditional microfluidic devices laboratory based analysis instrumental model based event detection and spectroscopic approaches are being replaced by modern biosensors for water monitoring accurately identifying and detecting chemical pollutants in water depends upon the appropriate detection method which may involve quantitative qualitative or hybrid measurements for a long time chemical and biological sensors have been in high demand for use in water monitoring technologies and are easy to integrate and commercialize zulkifli et al 2018 reusing wastewater particularly from urban effluent has emerged as a practical solution to the scarcity of freshwater sources for various uses reclamation and reusing of wastewater are now acknowledged as an integral component of water resource conservation especially in nations with limited access to fresh water the usage of wastewater following an appropriate treatment procedure necessitates effective water quality monitoring before reclaimed water can be used for diverse uses it must meet quality standards eliminating dangerous pollutants as a crucial and mandatory need abdullah et al 2017 the selection design and operation of treatment technologies as well as the recycling of waste depend on the concentration of elements in wastewater the development of new technology to monitor waste products utilizing affordable and real time methodologies has received increased attention due to the fluctuating composition of pollutants in wastewater depending upon time and locations the various qualities of waste fluids that are disposed of or reused are regularly measured using a variety of quality indicators most of them are based on laboratory techniques which are slow and expensive because they need frequent data sampling and sample pre treatment these factors indicate the requirement of the development of new techniques that are more sensitive portable and effective in the on site detection of multiple contaminants made up of a variety of components ejeian et al 2018 the development of various monitoring techniques to measure the level of contamination before during and after the proper treatment of the public sewage processes has been sparked by the requirement of continuous wastewater quality management abdullah et al 2017 2 biosensors water contamination produced by various heavy metals can be monitored using biosensors which are a simple reliable and quick solution provider iupac defines the biosensor as a self contained integrated device capable of providing specific quantitative or semi quantitative analytical information using a biological recognition element biochemical receptor which is retained in a direct spatial contact with an electrochemical transduction element in addition to the presence of heavy metals with their total biologically accessible levels in the water sometimes plays more important role than chemical composition biosensors can be utilized to measure their biological impacts such as cytotoxicity or toxicity odobašić et al 2019 for wastewater treatment and water reclamation procedures monitoring the precise level of organic matter in wastewater is crucial for the environment and human health using organic materials in wastewater treatment applications has several drawbacks including the generation of toxic byproducts and fouling of membrane filtering systems two typical variables are frequently examined to analyze the concentration of organic materials in water environments the biochemical oxygen demand bod index which measures the volume of oxygen that aerobic microbes use to decompose biodegradable organic materials the second is the chemical oxygen demand cod which measures how much oxygen is being consumed by chemical processes in water the conventional method for characterising bod is based on in situ measurements taken over a brief period or off line monitoring conducted over a period of 5 or 7 days however compared to traditional methods biosensors offer faster and more accurate findings for the detection of these indices cheulkar et al coupling of a transducer with bio element forms the biosensor which functions exactly like a human nose with low detection limits the human nose can qualitatively identify numerous compounds and even provide early knowledge of the concentration olfactory receptors are used to sense odour which acts as the sensory element the data from the olfactory membrane is converted into an electrical signal by the olfactory nerve cells which act as a transducer the brain decodes the received signal and converts it into a feeling or perception functioning as a microprocessor the typical biosensor design is insufficient for monitoring a wide range of target analytes on the other hand many biosensors have been developed that use entire microorganisms as the sensing element to quickly and spectacularly detect inorganic contaminants and heavy metals quickly zulkifli et al 2018 the biological element and transducer are the two main components of any biosensor 2 1 biological element baroreceptor the presence and concentration of a chemical analyte i e material to be detected are detected using biological components antibodies enzymes nucleic acids and entire cells are the most prevalent biological constituents when antibodies are used as the biological ingredient biosensor sensitivity is greatly improved nucleic acids rna and dna usually react due to their base pairing characteristics with the right element substrate these are excellent for detecting genetic disorders hossain and mansour 2019 2 2 transducer the transducer is the key element and essential part of a biosensor the transducer sends a physical change into a signal that may be later processed biomaterials or biological components can be connected or mixed with the transducer hossain and mansour 2019 most transducers provide optical and electrical signals that are typically proportionate to the number of interactions between the analyte and the bioreceptor an analyte is a material of interest that must be detected and a bioreceptor is a molecule that identifies the analyte precisely bhalla et al 2016 zulkifli et al 2018 the basic block diagram of biosensor functioning presented by naresh et al naresh and lee 2021 is redrawn and shown in fig 2 naresh and lee 2021 electrochemical piezoelectric optical and thermal biosensors are various types of biosensors available today for the fabrication of biosensors different types of transducers are used in a variety of applications fig 3 gives the classification of biosensors based on the detection method and transducer system namhil and kemp 2018 shavanova et al 2016 2 3 electrochemical biosensors electrochemical biosensors were among the first biosensors to be proposed widely published and marketed when a biomolecule bio receptor interacts with a target analyte ions or electrons are created or consumed and the electrical current or potential electrical properties of the analyte solution are altered these changes are detected by the transducer which generates an electrochemical signal proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample solution low sample preparation requirement and sensitivity in tiny sample quantities are two advantages of electrochemical biosensors direct sample analysis is also possible allowing for automation the low repeatability and stability of detections are disadvantageous for the sensing odobašić et al 2019 electrochemical biosensors are categorized into three subclasses based on the type of detected signal conductometric amperometric and potentiometric 2 3 1 potentiometric transducers in potentiometric transducers ion selective electrodes are used for measuring the change these electrodes are responsible for selectively targeting the ions when the sample interferes at zero current open circuit the difference between the potentials emf of the working electrode and reference electrode are measured by these devices to determine the analyte concentration 8 18 equation 1 is the relation governing the ion selective electrode s signal is 1 e e 0 r t z f ln i where e emf in volt r molar gas constant e0 characteristics constant for the ion selective electrode t temperature in kelvin f faraday constant z ionic charge and i concentration of the analyte ion selective electrodes in potentiometric transducers include solid state electrodes glass electrodes and glass ph electrodes for cations hossain and mansour 2019 2 3 2 amperometric transducers this biosensor is known to be the most prevalent electrochemical biosensor type it is an integrated self contained device that provides particular quantitative analytical information by measuring the current generated by the oxidation or reduction of an electroactive biological constituent sadeghi 2013 compared with potentiometric biosensors amperometric biosensors are faster and more sensitive but they have interference from non interesting electroactive chemicals and poor selectivity zulkifli et al 2018 amperometric biosensors detect the current flow between electrodes on the occurrence of a redox reaction the glucose biosensor is arguably the best studied amperometric biosensor technology glucose oxidase gox catalyses the reaction of glucose with oxygen to gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide in this system a redox reaction of hydrogen peroxide or a mediator at the working electrode causes the signal to be represented as current ampere against glucose concentration bai et al 2011 amperometric and potentiometric biosensors are essentially equal in terms of frequency response time response and sensitivity hossain and mansour 2019 2 3 3 conductometric transducers conductometric biosensors evaluate the electrical conductivity of a sample solution between two electrodes as a result of a biological process odobašić et al 2019 the conductivity is then compared to the concentration of the analyte during this measurement the applied potential might be either constant or sweeping bai et al 2011 the conductometric microbial sensors perform at a low voltage are light insensitive can easily be miniaturized and do not need a reference electrode odobašić et al 2019 mikkelsen et al investigated conductometric transducer for enzymatic urea and d amino acid biosensors these constructed conduct metric transducers do not appear to be viable for in vivo applications since they respond to ionic strength variations mikkelsen and rechnitz 1989 shulga et al constructed a thin film based conduct metric transducer for urea and glucose detection the buffer capacity of the examined sample had no bearing on the biosensor s kinetic response moreover this biosensor did not require an electrode reference for this type sensor al cu cr and ni electrodes are being investigated by research as laad and jatti 2015 shul ga et al 1994 2 4 optical biosensor optical biosensors provide several advantages over traditional analytical techniques including the ability to detect a wide range of biological and chemical compounds directly in real time and without the use of labels a biorecognition sensing element is merged with an optical transducer system in an optical biosensor which is small analytical equipment an optical biosensor s primary goal is to provide a signal proportional to the concentration of material being examined analyte as biorecognition elements the optical biosensor can use a variety of biological components such as antibodies enzymes receptors nucleic acids antigens entire cells and tissues damborský et al 2016 depending on their optical architecture biosensors can be extrinsic or intrinsic the incident light wave is contained within a waveguide or in optical fiber and propagates into the intrinsic biosensors but the wave structure is designed to allow the analyte to interact with the wave the light wave passes through the sampling phase and responds in extrinsic biosensors and the optical fiber is employed for the transmission of the signal odobašić et al 2019 ultraviolet visible absorption internal reflection spectroscopy fluorescence phosphorescence emission bioluminescence chemiluminescence laser light scattering and surface plasma spectroscopy are the most common photometric techniques used in optical biosensors hossain and mansour 2019 2 4 1 label free optical detection in a label free detection the detected signal is formed immediately by the analyte and the appropriate transducer interacting on site a label free mode greatly decreases the cost expertise and labor required to develop assays by eliminating experimental errors such as background fluorescence shelf life and quenching khansili et al 2018 2 4 1 1 surface plasmon resonance spr spr is a label free one of the most advanced and useful techniques spr is used for the detection of toxic materials due to its high sensitivity versatility and possibility of real time read out when a metal film is illuminated changes in refractive index at the film s surface is detected by spr sensors where surface plasmons electromagnetic waves propagate peltomaa et al 2018 in other words spr is a surface sensitive optical technology that links to the evanescent electromagnetic field emf produced by incident light under total internal reflections of the surface of a thin metal sheet because the evanescent field reduces exponentially as the penetrating distance from the interface increases only surface confined molecule interactions on the transducer surface are monitored using spr f long et al 2013a b when interacting with light waves metal nanostructures are smaller in size than the incident wavelength phenomenon of localized surface plasmon resonance occurs this is a significant advancement for spr based biosensors for small molecules direct detection by spr sensor is difficult because of their tiny size as a result analyte binding produces a very small change in refractive leading to observations with low signal to noise ratios on the other hand direct detection is simpler and offers several advantages over indirect methods including smaller sample volumes shorter assay times the ability to do direct kinetic measurements and the elimination of the conjugated analyte competitor spr sensor performance is influenced by the biofunctionalization and chemical interface as well as the structural electrical and optical properties of the instrument peltomaa et al 2018 2 4 1 2 grating coupler fibre optic and evanescent wave biosensor when a grating is integrated into a planar optical waveguide the spectrum of guided light modes can be observed and monitored due to chemical interactions with the waveguide s surface the peaks in the spectrum shift when the waveguide s surface is exposed to various solutions it is a highly sensitive method that can track these interactions in real time this integrated optical approach does not require radioactive fluorescent or other types of labeling because it depends on the refractive index i e polarizability density in the waveguide surface region its sensing concept is analogous to the evanescent surface plasmon field of spr technology in this sensing technique the evanescent emf of guided light spans a few hundred nano meters above the waveguide vörös et al 2002 evanescent confines the interaction of biosensor input output and fluidics inflow outflow to a single interface therefore the evanescent system has found wide applications and flexibility in the design of biosensors in luminous sensors evanescent light stimulates luminescent molecules on the waveguide surface capturing and guiding the emitted light as a result the bulk sample s background signal can be reduced and this detection method is usually more selective and sensitive than label free techniques for detecting small molecules peltomaa et al 2018 2 4 1 3 interferometric interferometric biosensors function by measuring changes in refractive index caused by a biorecognition event in the detecting area an interference pattern is formed by combining two light beams reference beams and the sensor which is used to measure the change in the sensor region the recognition element e g enzymes aptamers antibodies is functionalized and is responsible for recognizing target analyte selectively the recognition element must be immobilized in order to make the sensor work efficiently peltomaa et al 2018 this technology also known as resonant waveguide grating can be used to identify cellular redistribution analyze cellular responses and cellular activities and has been used to detect the avian influenza virus damborský et al 2016 this sensor can do multi analyte or multi sample analysis by merging different channel pairs sensing reference into a single waveguide peltomaa et al 2018 2 4 2 label optical detection a label is used to generate an optical signal using a fluorescent luminescent or colorimetric approach in label based sensing khansili et al 2018 2 4 2 1 fluorescence fluorescence is the most widely employed method in the fields of drug development biotechnology and medical testing and it is the analytical approach of choice in a wide range of schemes the detection of a single molecule is the highest level of sensitivity possible and it has long been a target of analytical procedures fluorescence is a natural choice for single molecule detection because of its great sensitivity and the fact that a bright signal shows against a dark backdrop strianese et al 2012 fluorescent tags such as dyes are used to mark either target molecules or biorecognition molecules in fluorescence based detection the fluorescence intensity reflects the existence of target molecules as well as the strength of interaction between biorecognition molecules and target fluorescence detection is extremely sensitive with a detection limit of one single molecule but it is affected by difficult processes of labelling that can potentially affect a biomolecule s function the quantitative analysis is difficult as the number of fluorophores per molecule can t be exactly regulated because of the fluorescence signal bias fan et al 2008 2 4 2 2 luminescence luminescence is a common phenomenon in which molecules produce light as they return to their ground state after being stimulated depending on the source of the energy that leads to this excited state different types of luminescence can be observed and recognized chemiluminescence in which light is produced by chemical reactions is of particular interest bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence that is connected with living organisms and reactions catalysed by enzymes the inclusion of enzymes gives the system molecular recognition features that are one of a kind in terms of specificity especially when chiral molecules are involved blum and coulet 2000 optical immunosensors are comprised of labels capable of causing optical changes light emitting enzymes such as peroxidase and luciferase fluorescent compounds and electrochemical luminescent molecules are among the labels due to optoelectronic technology high dynamic range and low detection limits immunosensors with a luminous label have become popular aizawa et al 1989 2 4 2 3 colorimetric the technique of colorimetry is used to determine the concentration of colored substances in a solution colorimetric assays that use this method to detect hybridization are sensitive and simple to use target dna concentrations as low as pico molar can be seen with the naked eye and the sensor works even in complicated sample matrices like blood serum colorimetric gold nanoparticle biosensors have found widespread use in diagnostics the au np based colorimetric sensor has the advantages of being very sensitive simplistic and useful for real time detection without using large scale instruments and devices proteins dnas metal ions and tiny molecules have all been detected using this type of biosensor qiang et al 2020 fast adaptive cost efficient and sensitive colorimetric procedures have been demonstrated for the detection of various analytes for a single test from pathogens to toxic chemicals which may be seen with the naked eye or detected using optical devices they are however limited to laboratory settings due to the complexity and fragility of the apparatus required for detection luka et al 2017 2 5 piezoelectric biosensor piezoelectric transducers are employed as biorecognition elements in piezoelectric biosensors because of the availability and great thermal strength and chemical stability in aqueous solutions quartz crystals are most prevalent in this type of biosensor a piezoelectric material produces electrical power when twisted under mechanical stress and conversely deforms elastically when subjected to an electric field odobašić et al 2019 this means these devices convert the vibrations on their surfaces into electrical voltages the adsorbed material on the surface of the substance or the mass of the substance can impact the frequency of vibration which can be connected to variations in the measured frequency hossain and mansour 2019 the frequency change occurring in the transducer is given by equation 2 2 δ f k f 2 δ m a where df change in resonant frequency f resonant frequency k constant for particular crystal a absorbing surface area and dm mass difference of absorbed material the change in resonance frequencies caused by analyte adsorption on the piezoelectric signal is measured by the transducer piezoelectric immunosensors are devices made of materials like quartz crystals that have a bioreceptor adsorbed on their surface such as silver or antimony and which resonate on the application of an external alternating electric field the mass changes in the quartz crystal are proportional to the resonance frequency the biospecific response between two interacting molecules one fixed on the surface and the other free in solution or can be monitored in real time the insecticide carbaryl and 3 5 6 trichloro 2 pyridinol tcp the major metabolite of the pesticide chlorpyrifos and the herbicide triclopyr were determined using a piezo immunosensor for detection monoclonal antibodies were utilized in a competitive conjugate immobilized immunoassay the immunosensor s great precision and accuracy enable it to be used to determine carbaryl and tcp marrazza 2014 2 6 thermal biosensors thermal biosensors are also known as calorimetric biosensors these biosensors detect bio receptors and analyte interactions producing a heat change proportional to analyte concentration odobašić et al 2019 thermistors can be used to determine heat change which can be connected to measuring analyte concentration hossain and mansour 2019 the thermistors which are used for measuring the changes in the temperature are based on an electrical temperature resistance variation and follow the relation as given by equation 3 3 r 1 r 2 e β 1 t 1 1 t 2 where r1 and r2 are the resistances of the thermistor and t1 and t2 temperature in kelvin and b is thermistor constant thermal biosensors have several advantages including detection without reactant labelling no periodic recalibration and no interference from the sample s electrochemical and optical properties odobašić et al 2019 3 biosensors for monitoring the water quality there are several factors responsible for water quality changes in nutrition temperature sediment ph and a number of trace constituents such as nutrients heavy metals pesticides and biological factors have a negative impact on the health of water systems biosensors play an important role in the detection of contaminants in drinking water enzymatic biosensors account for the majority of biosensors based on the principles of electrochemical reactions the advantage of enzymatic biosensors is their great selectivity for the target analyte however they are time consuming comparatively expensive and possess low stability because of enzyme deactivation or leaching on the other hand the use of bacteria has the advantage of being incredibly simple to produce biocatalysts especially in large quantities traditional biosensors are less versatile and sensitive to a wider variety of analytes but microbial biosensors are more adaptable and sensitive to a wider range of analytes electrochemical methods such as conductometry potentiometry and amperometry are commonly used for microbial sensors optical microbial biosensors are widely used chouler and biosensors 2015 because antibodies have high specificity and binding affinity for antigens that are damaging to the organism antibody based biosensors can be utilized to detect metal ions these devices use the formation of antibody metal ion complexes as a detecting approach a transducer converts the result of their immunochemical interaction into quantifiable results which are then processed into readable values antibodies can detect antigens in extremely low quantities odobašić et al 2019 long et al used a structure switching dna optical biosensor to detect heavy metal ions fluorescence labeled dna with a t t mismatch structure was used to connect with dna probes mounted on the sensor surface in this approach the sensor s selectivity and reactivity to potential interference from other metal cations such pb2 ni2 cr2 mn2 ca2 fe2 mg2 cu2 sn2 co2 and zn2 have been examined at

spectrophotometric technique has a sensitivity of 1 mm while the electrical method has a sensitivity of 5 mm ilangovan et al 2006 hara et al reported that enzyme based biosensors have the capacity to detect heavy metal ions such as pb2 cu2 cd2 cr and hg2 hara and singh 2021 a known rna cleaving dnazyme was modified using phosphorothioate adding a sulfur group ce13 d by liu et al this biosensor provided the best platform for the detection of cadmium li and huang n d hojiris et al højris et al 2018 developed an optical real time monitoring bacterial biosensor to study the dynamics of drinking water microbiology and to get an early warning of pollution events in drinking water the correlation of a constructed biosensor with atp is good but the correlation with turbidity against the sum of bacteria and abiotic particles from the sensor is dependent on the pollution source højris et al 2018 for the detection of faecal contamination in seawater samples the real life feasibility of molecularly imprinted polymers mip based sensor devices were described enterococcus faecalis e faecalis was used as a faecal indicator to analyze water quality using mip nanoparticles mip

multiscale modeling approach all sensors are designed with one fundamental idea in mind to employ a transduction mechanism to detect changes in the environment around them whether the sensor is mechanical electrical or optical achieving high fidelity performance depends on the transduction mechanism s precision sensor shrinking accelerated with the development of nanotechnology and transduction devices with footprints smaller than a micron are now a reality antosiewicz and käll 2016 chemo bio mechanical phenomena in biosensing present an alluring opportunity for computational mechanics researchers to examine these phenomena with approaches that have not yet been utilized and to offer fresh insights into the design of next generation ultrasensitive biosensors and nano biosensors chen et al 2016 francesco petrosino et al petrosino et al 2020 2021 2022 noted that modeling and simulation are regarded as effective engineering and scientific techniques that connect physical chemical phenomena and properties of complex systems a fundamental biological process in nature protein adsorption on material surfaces has numerous potential applications in the domains of biosensors biofuel cells biocatalysis biomaterials and protein chromatography the study of protein interfacial adsorption characteristics is therefore extremely important from both a theoretical as well as a practical point of view controlling the protein s adsorption orientation on surfaces is one of the key scientific concerns in the study of regulated protein adsorption in general proteins can bind to material surfaces in either a random or ordered orientation it has been shown that an ordered adsorption orientation is advantageous for proteins to execute their biological functions more effectively for example to improve the effectiveness of the subsequent antibody antigen binding in biosensor applications antibodies should be immobilized with a certain and ordered end on orientation quan et al 2019 it has been recognized that protein adsorption on material surfaces can be affected by factors originating from three aspects including protein properties protein size rigidity and distribution of charged residues etc surface properties surface wettability charge morphology etc and external conditions temperature solution ph ionic strength etc these factors would influence protein adsorption in a synergistic manner thus leading to the extreme complexity of this scientific issue to investigate protein adsorption behaviors on material surfaces considerable experimental and theoretical simulation studies have been conducted however the resolution of current experimental techniques is still not enough to quantitatively determine the adsorption orientation and conformation of proteins at the atomistic level with the fast development of computer technology molecular simulation plays an increasingly important role in revealing the mechanism of chemical and biological processes and designing and developing new products molecular simulation as an alternative to experimental and theoretical methods has become a powerful tool for exploring the adsorption behaviors of proteins on material surfaces from the molecular viewpoint quan et al 2019 s curcio et al 2018 reported the interaction between protein and membrane surfaces using the concept of

al 2011 reported that micro cantilever mcl surface bent due to the adsorption of biomolecules on it the phenomenon naturally calls for multiscale modeling according to him one needs to understand the microscopic mechanism at the molecular level and transfer critical information associated with bending deformation to the device level the multiscale study of the mcl was fundamental to understand the mechanisms of molecular recognition and their correlation with the mcl response adsorbate induced surface stresses have been extensively studied over the past few decades it is known that the adsorption of small molecules onto a clean crystalline surface changes atomic configurations bond angles and electron distribution on the surface the surface reconstruction leads to the change of the surface stress for complex biomolecular interactions such as the adsorption of protein on the mcl mechanisms such as electrostatic steric and van der waals interactions between neighboring adsorbates and conformational changes of adsorbed biomolecules have been proposed chen et al 2011 2016 for a solid liquid interface covered with biomolecules additional mechanisms such as the alternation of the electrical double layer in a buffer solution and the change of a hydrophobic to the hydrophilic surface due to adsorption have been suggested given the diversity and complexity of biosensing applications the aforementioned mechanisms are likely to be coupled it remains very challenging to identify dominant mechanisms for a given biosensing application chen et al 2011 2016 chen et al 2011 derived the multiscale scheme based on the minimization of the total energy with respect to the mcl curvature the total energy contains the bending elastic energy and the energy of biomolecular adsorption as equation 4 the former can be obtained on the basis of the linear elastic theory the later can be calculated from atomistic simulations for example first principles density functional theory dft simulations or classical molecular dynamics simulations with proper empirical interatomic potentials the conceptual link between the mcl biosensing platform multiscale modeling and surface characterization presented by chen et al 2011 is redrawn and shown in fig 4 below chen et al 2011 4 e t o t a l e b e n d i n g e a d s o r p t i o n the bending elastic energy is 5 e e l a s t i c y κ 2 t 3 24 1 ν 2 b l where y κ ν t b and l are yang s module curvature poisson ratio thickness width and length of the mcl respectively the equilibrium state can be obtained from the derivative of the total energy with respect to the curvature equal to zero combining equations 4 and 5 the resulting equation 6 is 6 i a t o m s f i r i κ y κ t 3 12 1 ν 2 b δ l where the summation sign indicates the sum of the total number of atoms of a beam and fi and ri are the atomic force and position of the ith atom thus the equation connects the microscale information atomic force and atomic position and macroscale physical quantity curvature tomsaz et al antosiewicz and käll 2016 reported the importance of multiscale modeling in designing the biosensor they used a multiscale approach utilizing electromagnetic calculations and stochastic diffusion reaction simulations to minimize the readout uncertainty of functionalized plasmonic molecular sensors this minimization is equivalent to maximizing a plasmonic sensors q factor which is the ratio of the mean and standard deviation of the peak shift the three factors influencing the accuracy of such sensors are the inhomogeneity of the plasmonic response and the spatial binding probability both affected by the sensor shape as well as the stochastic properties of receptor occupancy tomsaz et al applied this methodology to study the uncertainty of counting molecules using a typical plasmonic sensor the nanorod as a function of its aspect ratio this approach significantly reduced the errors in experimentation and paved the way to design the effective biosensor for desired application 6 artificial intelligence based water monitoring systems in automated image treatment applications artificial intelligence was widely used particularly if there is no identifiable pattern in the picture data a water monitoring application platform based on artificial intelligence ai has been developed to capture the sensor image via an integrated smartphone camera identify the presence of sensing parameters and classify the level according to the color intensity recognized in the captured image training sets through deep convolutional neural networks cnn gunda et al 2019 the use of ai algorithms to model and predict water quality is important for environmental preservation hmoud et al constructed ai model using data from rivers collected from various sites across india to forecast and classify water quality for drinking seven essential characteristics were calculated using the water quality index dissolved oxygen ph conductivity biological oxygen demand nitrate fecal coliform and total coliform these were regarded as important water quality indicators al adhaileh and sustainability 2021 7 conclusion making safe drinking water available for the growing population of the world has become the top priority of governments especially in developing nations a number of traditional analytical techniques are already existing which involve time consuming laboratory dependent methods the new biosensing techniques are gaining popularity for monitoring the water quality based on several quality parameters which are physical organic chemical biochemical and biological there are a number of biosensors available in the market today with varying costs and different levels of sophistication though water quality monitoring is a complex task and requires continuous development of new sensing materials and technologies for fast and correct detection the present work highlights the advantages of biosensors over traditional water quality monitoring techniques it discusses various types of biosensors for the detection of toxic materials in drinking water different types of transducers are discussed in detail to make biosensors for the detection of toxic materials as per the requirement with the advancement is nanotechnology and microelectronics more efficient faster and accurate biosensors can be fabricated the use of biosensors to detect toxic chemicals from drinking water will minimize the health diseases and related problems caused due to unsafe drinking water emerging advancements in artificial intelligence ai open up a lot of possibilities for making better predictions from data on water contamination and it can pinpoint the exact level of specific toxins in water image analysis based detection approaches are significantly outperformed by ai 8 challenges and future scope many biosensor results are misinterpreted as false positives to address these challenges much effort must be put into developing effective biocontainment strategies and methodologies for fine tuning biosensor sensitivity and specificity although non living easily adjustable cell free biosensors address some of these challenges it is still impossible to predict how changing certain parameters impacts a sensor s overall function future cell free sensor development should concentrate on discovering and optimizing the aspects that lead to effective sensor and reporter function in cell free systems for biosensing thavarajah et al 2020 samples are usually verified in a laboratory to manage contaminants and pathogens in water which means that the time between collection and measurement delays the result if a quick response is required such as if the water is drinkable or if environmental disasters must be avoided this method is insufficient in recent years several research groups have been working on portable water analysis equipment however not all contaminants in a sample are always detected by these new approaches another problem is that they require specialized portable tools that are either expensive heavy or bulky pujol vila et al 2016 r d csic optical biosensors for fast determination of toxicity in water n d contaminations often comprise mixtures of compounds that need to be identified in combination drugs with comparable modes of action usually behave additively but compounds with different modes of action might cause synergism and antagonism interfering with the observed effects depending on the strain and substances involved this can improve or hinder the bacteria s capacity to detect the total parameter of a complex mixture s collective activity more attention should be paid to the importance of these compound reactions woutersen et al 2011 when developing nanosensors safety of materials should be considered as an integral part of the initial design and not at the end of the design cycle the health and environmental consequences of nanomaterials have been studied extensively and this knowledge should be leveraged to select the optimal materials for nanosensor design the application of green chemistry principles to nanotechnology provides a beneficial foundation for developing appropriate nontoxic and sustainable designs that nonetheless achieve the needed functionality vikesland 2018 declaration of competing

language the results were visualised with biblioshiny and vosviwer the outcome of the study suggests that research articles related to groundwater quality analysis on urban area is increasing year per year researchers from different fields and countries are collaborating for an integrated outcome groundwater vulnerability groundwater quality assessment the source of pollutants in groundwater groundwater contamination the presence of hazardous materials in groundwater are evolving topics for the last three decades the trends in these topics show the application of spatial data science remote sensing statistical algorithms in groundwater quality analysis for urban area this paper will inspire the researchers to understand the situation about groundwater quality articles related to it authors involved to this subject and most useable methods for analysis and future scope in this research field graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality urbanisation bibliometric analysis bibliomatrix data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is one of the important natural resources in the world groundwater plays a significant role in hydrological cycle as it reacts with other hydrological resources alley et al 2005 also groundwater has an importance in civilization more than 2 5 billion of people in the world directly depends on consuming the groundwater as drinking purpose and about 50 of the arable land is irrigated by groundwater utilisation of groundwater greatly preceded understanding of its origin occurrence and movement usage of groundwater increased after the industrial revolution application of modern techniques and demand of water in industry and agriculture fienen and arshad 2016 with the growing process of urbanisation utilisation of groundwater increased fienen and arshad 2016 municipal water supply depends on groundwater in several parts of the world especially in humid and arid regions where water availability is not so adequate groundwater source is ultimate one chen et al 2018 karnieli et al 1984 safa et al 2020 groundwater quality is one of the important factors to evaluate because some portion of groundwater may not meet up the adequate level to be utilised specifically for drinking purpose quality of groundwater depends on the composition of recharge subsurface medium and the climate şen 2015 partially changes occur in groundwater quality because of infiltrated particles in the soil fitts 2013 naturally groundwater quality faces deficiency to be called as pure for several factors like high salinity in arid regions salt bearing rock formations excessive hardness in carbonate formations high sulphate content significant fluoride level in sedimentary rocks arsenic content and naturally occurring bacteria margat and van der gun 2013 groundwater quality assessment is necessary for its various usage in different needs and now it is being monitored in numerous aquifer around the world margat and van der gun 2013 groundwater contamination due to numerous reasons is now an emerging concern for humankind fares 2016 specifically urban groundwater exploitation is a serious issue as it brings the consequences of groundwater mistreatment drangert and cronin 2004 it has been recognised that groundwater quality changing its characteristics in urban area within a short span of time due to anthropogenic reasons like leakage from underground pipes of domestic and industrial wastes soaking of pollutant material from roads polluted water recharge after rainfall etc elumalai et al 2017 researchers related to this subject published several articles about the source of toxicities in groundwater fienen and arshad 2016 lerner and barrett 1996 lerner and tellam 1992 nambi et al 2017 roy et al 2015 roy and bickerton 2012 safa et al 2020 somasundaram et al 1993 wakode et al 2018a awareness about impact of urbanisation on groundwater quality has developed recently so research interest related to it has increased specifically from the end of twentieth century detailed study on urban groundwater quality already upgraded with technological advancement in field observation integrated statistical approaches and application of modern machinery techniques alazaiza et al 2021 barcelona 2005 che nordin et al 2021 gao and li 2014 mueller et al 2012 us epa 2022 identification of research prospect related to the depleting resource like groundwater and its quality need to be revised through published articles which are significant and informative in various way it has been observed that in last thirty years scope of research sector has changed tremendously after integration and agglomeration of several co related subjects and significant usage of digital computation process and internet significant number of papers has been published in the meantime which pointedly contributed the effectiveness of research in urban groundwater quality through review articles adeniyi and giwa 2021 barrett et al 1999 devic et al 2014 foster et al 2013 graham and polizzotto 2013 katz et al 2011 kurwadkar 2014 loftis 1996 ravish et al 2021 wakida and lerner 2005a in most cases exposure of groundwater quality studies remained limited with in conventional review approach any alternative process like reviewing though bibliometric analysis about urban groundwater quality assessment has not been approached yet it can be stated that bibliometric analysis summarizes massive quantities of bibliometric data to present the state of the intellectual structure and emerging trends of a research topic or field donthu et al 2021a it is used where review scope is broad and too large to review manually already bibliometric analysis has achieved immense popularity in business research donthu et al 2021b bibliometric analysis on research articles processes quantitative and qualitative analysis of developments about the topic in scientific field dominko and verbič 2019 scholars in different research field use bibliometric analysis to show evolving movements in article collaborative understandings journal performance intellectual structures social structures etc szomszor et al 2021 the data that takes centre stage in bibliometric analysis tends to be massive hundreds to thousands of papers and objective in nature e g number of citations most cited article most used words and subjective e g thematic evolution also bibliometric analysis examines the primary metadata of the paper and helps to interpret with statistical approach madani and weber 2016 the representation of the outcome produces proper visualisation which is very attractive and easy to understand review articles through bibliometric analysis has expanded the sphere of viewing a topic as it was used to like before a limited amount of paper has published with bibliometric analysis about groundwater related research li et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 zyoud and fuchs hanusch 2017 the number of research paper related to this kind of review is not enough for identification of trend about impact of urbanisation on groundwater quality somehow a holistic view about the standpoint of research field about urban water quality has not been addressed properly through review articles on the light of the above this paper aims to identify the evolution of scientific research field for last thirty years in urban groundwater quality through bibliometric analysis according to author s knowledge this approach has been taken for the first time to recognise evolution of groundwater quality assessment in urban area through bibliometric analysis the study has been focused within timeframe of 1990 2022 to get the kernel of past and present condition about urban groundwater quality for this certain objectives have been approached to i quantify overall information that can be collected from documents which has been used in this study ii identify relevant emerging sources that reflected details about this topic iii identify authors who have contributed significantly in the subject matter iv analyse emerging words or subtopics that are most relevant for the study v create network analysis to understand the relation and variation between authors and co authors documents and other related variables and visualise the scenario vi recognise the basic and emerging themes from the study vii understand country wise scientific production and global collaboration between countries mainly collected research documents has been quantified and conceptual intellectual and social structures has been recognised to create a clear image about the evolution of urban groundwater quality related studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 data retrieval standardisation of bibliometric analysis exclusively depends on the process that helps to accumulate the data data collection is an important part for further review different kind of scientific material available electronically via internet but integrated updated and qualified products are necessary for the process several databases are available across the web like web of science scopus pubmed etc these databases are authenticated and approved worldwide in this journal we have accessed scopus https www scopus com home uri for the bibliometric analysis scopus is the largest abstract and citation database of peer reviewed literature like scientific journals books and conference proceedings which delivering a comprehensive overview of the world s research output baas et al 2020 in the scopus database there are thousands of documents on various topics most relevant documents needed to be found out to understand the recent trends in impact of urbanisation on groundwater quality over the world several attempts have been made to find out exact matches from the database finally the search has been performed using the query line like all impact of urbani ation and groundwater quality or groundwater contamination and limit to pubstage final and limit to doctype ar or limit to doctype cp or limit to doctype ch or limit to doctype bk and limit to language english and limit to srctype j or limit to srctype b or limit to srctype p or limit to srctype k and exclude doctype bk and exclude srctype b or exclude srctype k this query line describes that all kind of documents has been selected with impact of urbani s z ation as a phrase and groundwater quality as another phrase for exact results related to topic different filters has been applied like the study has been limited to the research article that are already published query has been limited to documents written in english concept from books has been excluded from the study after this process from the initial findings of 900 documents 709 articles have been selected for the bibliometric analysis this search query was conducted on 21 march 2022 limited number of documents have been incorporated in the study from 2022 as it covered only published materials from first three months bibliometric analysis usually follows some general steps to conduct the study initial stages start with data collection which has been already discussed after that it follows steps like data filtering data analysis data visualisation and data interpretation 2 2 analysis technique broadly bibliometric analysis technique can be divided into two categories performance analysis and science mapping performance analysis examines the contributions in specified research field donthu et al 2021a this part of analysis is descriptive in nature research paper related with review certainly go through this process performance analysis consists certain parameters like number of sources involved in the research number of documents involved in the research average citation per documents number of keywords used in the study number of authors related to the study etc science mapping examines the relationships between research constituents further analysis describes structural connections and intellectual interactions between the articles the techniques related to it are co citation analysis bibliographic coupling word analysis etc donthu et al 2021a review through bibliometric analysis is an emerging concept in research field a flow diagram has been created to create a clear idea about this method fig 1 2 3 relevant terminology related with bibliometric analysis 2 3 1 bradford s law bradford s law predicts that number of journals in the second and third zones will n and n2 time larger than first zone respectively thus it is possible to measure the number of journals which are in the core and middle group from the total number of journals nash stewart et al 2012 2 3 2 h index it is an index that attempts to measure the productivity and impact of the published work of a scientist or a scholar this index is a useful measurements that helps to compare scientific production and writing hirsch 2005 2 3 3 thematic network according the frequency of co occurrence of keywords thematic networks are structured using the algorithm of simple centres a set of keywords in a group are identified and these groups termed as themes these themes are analysed clockwise and according to centrality and density it is divided 2 3 4 thematic map motor themes are well developed and important for structuring the research appropriately and niche theme has marginal or limited role in the scientific development whereas emerging or declining theme are weakly developed and poorly structured and marginally related to scientific field basic themes are relevant to scientific field but not yet developed lópez robles et al 2019 2 3 5 thematic evolution raw data were divided into different groups of years or subperiods to analyse evolution of themes under the study generally inclusion index helps to generate thematic evolution map armenta medina et al 2022 2 3 6 multiple correspondence analysis mca mca is data analysis tool for categorical data it helps to detect and represent structures related to the dataset it represents data as a point generating through euclidean space it is a subpart of correspondence analysis that is applicable to dataset and it is counterpart of principal component analysis murtagh 2008 2 3 7 betweenness centrality and pagerank centrality refers to the number of relational ties a research constituent has in a network betweenness refers to a node s ability to carry information between unconnected groups of nodes wherein each node represents a research constituent closeness centrality refers to the capability of nodes to carry information effectively by being closer to other nodes in the network pagerank can be used to calculate the prestige of publications that have an influence in the research field intellectual structure of a research field can be identified by co citation network of papers related to the subject in bibliometric analysis it has been found out that mostly the network based on papers can be divided into 4 clusters on the basis of betweenness and closeness and pagerank top most paper has been discused here for understanding the correlation between papers this ranking is based upon the value of pagerank in this paper we have tried to cover important technical methods to analyse contemporary trends in the research field about groundwater quality upon the impact of urbanisation relevant sources eminent authors and significant documents has been analysed focusing the subject domain and conceptual intellectual and social structures has been identified with knowledge gathered from those documents this process is dependent on usage of proper software specialised for bibliometric analysis in this paper we have used r programming language in our study r is mainly a statistical programming language with several multi disciplinary libraries to perform solutions bibliometrix aria and cuccurullo 2017 derviş 2020 is one of the libraries that is used as tool for quantitative research in scientometrics and bibliometrics it is capable enough to work with topmost databases like web of science scopus pubmed lens etc this software integrates with programmed user interface biblioshiny https www bibliometrix org home that visualise the analysis this process of analysis in this software divide workflow into certain steps like data loading and conversion bibliometric analysis bibliographic network metrices visualizing bibliographic networks co word analysis i e the conceptual structure of a field and historical direct citation network vosviewer https app vosviewer com has been used to visually represent the network analysis data 3 result 3 1 main information about the collection urban groundwater quality was the primary research topic for 709 documents more than four thousand authors contributed through this topic for the last thirty years only 26 papers have been authored singularly rest of the papers have been documented by collaboration on an average more than 4 authors are involved on writing an article collaboration index calculated as 3 6 further details have been mentioned on the table below table 1 annual scientific production has increased about the groundwater quality issue in urban area through years fig 2 in 2021 146 papers have been published while in 2020 the number was 104 whereas number of productions was less than 20 in 2010 the number of publications was less than five in a year in the era of nineties annual growth rate of scientific production rate is 11 88 average citation per year has increased with time most citation has been counted about this specified topic in 2013 these citations produced near about sixty thousand references till the time span already more than nine hundred documents have been published about the groundwater quality issue that are mostly related with urban area authors have mentioned more than two thousand keywords that defines the subject matter and scopus machine learning process has generated near about five thousand words that are closely reflects the topic most of the documents are published in collaborative way only twenty six articles have been published single author 3 2 focus on domain 3 2 1 sources the trend of annually published article works as the significant indicator of the current state of research it reflects attraction of researchers towards subject matter development in this field from macro outlook tsolakis and anthopoulos 2015 yang et al 2021 research about groundwater quality on urban area has been encouraged reviewed and published by several publication houses table 2 environmental earth science has published highest number of original articles on urban groundwater quality in last three decade they published 52 articles on urban groundwater quality related topic environmental monitoring and assessment came to the next and science of the total environment came after it number of publications are 39 for the former and 29 for the latter from reference list it can be analysed that journal of hydrology has been cited most with number of 1257 next the journal science of total environment with 849 citations contribution of journals like groundwater for sustainable development and arabian journal of geosciences are noteworthy based on cumulative frequency and citations they achieved within year of publishing timespan according to bradford s law listed top ten journals are part of a single core zone 3 2 2 authors bibliometric analysis identified authors who have already contributed the research sector by publishing articles on specified topic it is comparatively new and an alarming topic for the highly urbanised cities and several authors have shared water quality related observation through their writing we have shortlisted ten authors according to number of articles they published fig 3 authors related to this subject has produced enough insight through their work and it reflected in their h index score prof s k singh has published most of the article in last 30 years and got 637 citations for his contribution he

citations for her contribution p k shrivastava s k singh and m gupta has jointly worked for groundwater research that has been reflected in their papers h zhang published 9 articles and got 271 citations he worked on groundwater contamination specially he stressed on arsenic contamination in groundwater contribution of j chen s kumar and m kumar are noteworthy they have also acclaimed with significant number of citations for their work lerner has most citations over the years for his work on urban groundwater pollution in his articles he assessed every aspect of groundwater for urban area in details shrivastava singh and gupta collaboratively made effort to identify groundwater scenario for urban area mostly they have applied geographical information system to identify spatial variation of groundwater parameters country wise scientific production has been analysed in this paper fig 4 articles from chinese authors has been acclaimed with highest citations according to total number of citations india and u s a ranks after it authors from u k and australia has also acclaimed with significant number of citations whereas in average number of articles australia ranked top and u k comes after it china india and usa collected higher number of citations with lower number in articles 3 2 3 documents 3 2 3 1 most frequent words most frequent words have been extracted from the author s mentioned key words which counts more than two thousand we have selected best and top 30 words from them fig 5 groundwater and urbanisation came as most frequent words for obvious reason but with further observation we have found that groundwater quality occurred 47 times and hydrochemistry came up 27 times in the studies gis has been used for 27 times words like anthropogenic activities contamination vulnerability also been identified that refers the exploitation of groundwater in urban area several methodological terms like cluster analysis principal component analysis has been used to understand impact of groundwater quality parameters effective on urban area application of remote sensing gis and landuse studies has also been identified through keywords in urban groundwater quality analysis that mainly helps in geographical analysis different kind of heavy metals trace material and stable isotopes has been identified in research that defines the possibility of occurrence of such materials in urban area specially impact of nitrates has been an important research topic for authors seawater intrusion has been mentioned in different studies because most of the urban areas are close to coastal belt procedure of groundwater management has been discussed as a solution in every article 3 2 3 2 evolving words top ten keywords have been selected from bibliometric analysis according to their occurrence and evolving characteristics in research articles fig 6 from 1990 to 2000 number articles were very limited so most of the keywords has been used in limited number number of occurrences increased after 2000 and in the next ten year all the top keywords has been used equally but after 2010 a rapid change can be observed on usage of certain keywords specifically significant amount of growth can be observed for keywords like urbanisation and groundwater and water quality occurrence and usage of other keywords like hydrochemistry remote sensing gis pollution groundwater recharge increased as focus on urban groundwater quality was concentrated within these topics 3 2 3 3 most cited documents we have figured out top 10 contributing articles about groundwater quality in between 1991 and 2022 that focused on urban area the ranking of the contributing articles based on their total citation number and this process is based upon factor analysis table 3 fletcher et al 2013 published an article on modelling urban hydrology in this paper a comprehensive approach has been taken to understand the urban water scenario and surface water groundwater interaction they have mentioned about subsurface runoff process and subsurface flow process in urban area and its impact on water quality wakida and lerner 2005b published a paper about groundwater nitrate that are sourced from non agricultural activities they have mentioned about presence of nitrate in groundwater surrounding the city than beneath it they take nottingham as a study area and analysed the presence of nitrate in urban area that are sourced from agricultural activities as a result they have a found that source of nitrate concentration in groundwater in urban area because of wastewater disposal solid waste disposal and sewage leakages lerner 2002a in his paper has mentioned that source and pathways of groundwater is more numerous and complex in urban area than for rural area he prescribed for quantification of groundwater recharge in urban area should be done with integrated approach and he identified four chemical signatures like inorganic organic particulate and isotopic material in urban groundwater he concluded with opinion that anthropogenic possibility of groundwater recharge is increasing mcgrane 2016 described about the impact of urbanisation on hydrological and water quality dynamics he reviewed the groundwater quality perspective for urban water management he described about the impact of impervious surface from urban area makes a negative impact on urban groundwater recharge in this article he described how groundwater quality is changing due to contamination from urban sources change in recharge process making change in groundwater quality also gu et al 2013 has mentioned about presence of nitrate in groundwater they generated their study in the china and found out that most of the nitrate concentration can be identified in industrial and urban area the depicted anthropogenic factors are responsible for reactive nitrate concentration in groundwater and it is mostly found in dense urbanised cities huang et al 2010 has identified appropriate methods to identify spatial variation in water pollution they applied fuzzy comprehensive method to understand difference water quality based on weightage of the crucial parameters this method afterwards largely used to analyse the quality of groundwater also gorelick and zheng 2015 discussed on global change and groundwater management challenge they find out the problem for last fifty years that changed the aquifer storage and depletion trajectory management they also identified land subsidence seawater intrusion groundwater dependency supply vulnerability are most emerging issues that made a change in the scenario globally about groundwater they addressed about groundwater management challenges in terms of quantity and quality huang et al 2013 presented a paper on evolution of groundwater chemistry in rapidly urbanised coastal area due to anthropogenic process this study is mainly based in south china according to researchers human activities are responsible for the occurrences of no3 so4 and mg2 their objective of the study was to find out the land use changes and its impact on groundwater quality they applied principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis to analyse the parameters that make changes in groundwater quality varol and davraz 2015 have applied wqi to evaluate the groundwater quality and he also applied multivariate analysis with different groundwater quality components this study was limited to plain land of turkey but this method made an impact in scientific field afterwards leung and jiao 2006 made a study on hong kong island about the heavy metal and stress element distributions in groundwater in highly urbanised spaces this study shed important light on the identification and evolution of leakage from service pipes in a particular area based on aqueous distributions of heavy metals and trace elements 3 3 knowledge structure 3 3 1 conceptual structure 3 3 1 1 network analysis on co occurrence of author s keywords network analysis can help to find out how important parameters about impact of urbanisation on groundwater quality are related to each other each relevant topics in this paper representing the nodes and those are joined with several vertices presenting interconnection between those topics fig 7 in this bibliometric analysis groundwater came up as most important topic that are related with all other nodes according to word size in the diagram urbanisation is next both the words are closely related with geochemistry surface runoff anthropogenic activities nutrients etc health related issues arsenic contamination sea water intrusion came as consequence related to the domain methodological terms like cluster analysis principal component analysis factor analysis are closely related with groundwater remote sensing and gis techniques are separated from clustered words but used frequently in this research field and these topics are interrelated with other significant topics like urbanisation and other statistical methods 3 3 1 2 thematic map with keywords plus scopus data generates keywords from abstracts according to their relevance through machine learning process such words on urban groundwater related research have been clustered by themes for a better understanding fig 8 groundwater quality analysis hydrochemistry and water quality index is the basic theme for this research also groundwater pollution and presence of heavy metals on urban groundwater are the most common topic for research investigation on water quality parameters impact of land use and aquifer study are the most well identified themes in urban groundwater quality analysis groundwater contamination nitrate contamination also the part of motor themes as these topics are well recognised themes among the researchers urban groundwater related issues specifically under karst topography has been well acknowledged by researchers limited research has been done on direct impact of urbanisation process urban sprawling urban agglomeration highly developed infrastructure etc variability of groundwater recharge and direct and indirect effect of climate change also limited application of remote sensing data and related gis application has been used in urban groundwater quality assessment recently sea water intrusion advanced statistical analysis of groundwater quality parameters and impact on coastal aquifers growing as important themes for the scientific field but these topics has not taken shape yet in groundwater quality analysis these topics now treated as emerging theme in this research field limited studies have been done on these topics topics on groundwater pollution and deteriorated urban groundwater quality in country like india are also emerging 3 3 1 3 multiple correspondence analysis conceptual structure map has been produced using multiple correspondence analysis fig 9 keywords generated from scopus database has been structured visually two clusters have been formed from all the 4939 words application of hydrochemistry water quality analysis risk assessment groundwater resource evaluation groundwater as a drinking water urbanisation process urban growth all consists in one cluster these concepts are diverged in both the principal dimensions environmental monitoring water pollutants findings of nitrate chemical proponents of groundwater has been clustered separately research field about groundwater study in an urban area mostly depends on these parameters researchers followed one of the cluster s parameters groundwater related research in urban area mainly concentrated with a specified study area applying different statistical methods or general analysis has been produced those can be relatable to all the groundwater scenario for an urban area 3 3 1 4 thematic evolution with author s keywords thematic evolution describes relevant topics that are possibly related with groundwater quality on urban area evolution of themes and topics evolved with time those were most significant at that time fig 10 so the period of 1991 to the beginning of 2022 has been divided into four time frames in the decades of 90 s identification of pollutant in groundwater and contaminations of such pollutants were most discussed topic new millennium came up with more specified topics on groundwater than the past decade urbanisation related issues on groundwater was popular then different interdisciplinary methods were applied on groundwater quality analysis environmental degradation related to invasive species and its effect on groundwater were trending topics in research field in the next decade application of water quality index analysis in urban area were trending application of gis in groundwater quality analysis to find out spatial variation and visualisation was started then year 2021 was most successful on research of groundwater quality in urban area application of different machine learning algorithms complex statistical analysis started to apply in this research field change in groundwater quality affecting drinking water in many parts of the world that became an important topic now impact of groundwater recharge in groundwater quality coming out to be a trending issue groundwater quality issues now being counted as a serious issue for the urban planning and management 3 3 2 intellectual structure 3 3 2 1 co citation network of papers co citations networks describing interrelation between research articles through citations and thus showing evolution and flow path of research with time fig 11 j gibbs in 1970 published a paper on mechanisms on world water chemistry this paper proved to most informative through time gibbs 1970 d lerner in 2002 described about groundwater recharge in urban area it was an imprtant contribution to scientific field lerner 2002c another milstone in this research field is the contribution of s j mcgrane in 2016 he also discussed about the water quality dyanmics in urban area mcgrane 2016 carlson et al in 2016 discussed about urbanisation on groundwater quality and recharge the study was specified to the semi arid alluvial basin area carlson et al 2011 d k todd in 1980 made an impaccable contrubution to this research field by contribution theoretical contribution in groundwater hydrology j w l 1981 in 2018 wakode et al contributed in groundwater recharge and urbanisation applying gis and remote sensing techniques wakode et al 2018b in 2004 natarajan et al has published a paper about hydrogeochemical process in groundwater environment it made aprominent impact on the research field rajmohan and elango 2003 arthur piper in 1940 produced an evolution in visualisation of geochemical properties of water after this publication now diagram named after piper has proven to be most effective way to visualise hydrochemical parameters piper 1944 applying multivariate statistical analsysis and on water quality parameters srestha et al elaborated the scope of study on water quality analsysis shrestha and kazama 2007 all the papers that are relevant and cited numerously by another authors already mentioned here these papers representing the inception of ideas and these pioneering applications have been followed afterwards in numerous research and acknowledged with citations in last thirty years 3 3 3 social structure 3 3 3 1 contributing countries bibliometric analysis depicts about social structure in the research field the contribution and collaboration in between researchers and their associated institutions fig 12 most collaboration about the topic has been initiated from india to united kingdom that about 15 times india collaborated with usa for 13 times and china collaborated with usa for 11 times about urbanisation and groundwater quality china collaborated with australia about 10 times china collaborated with japan about 9 times and collaboration between usa and united kingdom has happened 8 times where china collaborated with united kingdom 6 times mostly a deep collaboration route has been observed between usa china united kingdom and india collaboration in research field integrates the research quality and contribution towards the whole world 4 discussion in the present study statistical methods and scientific mapping have been approached through bibliometric analysis to understand evolution of research sector about urban groundwater quality it is an emerging concept as awareness on environmental resources is getting increased nowadays urbanisation is an important factor for development also it is showing a prominent impact on groundwater it is one the resources that are getting utilised and exploited in urban area research prospect on this subject has emerged from the end of the twentieth century research related to deteriorating groundwater quality has a positive correlation with increasing urbanisation in last three decades research sector on subsurface water has broadly collaborated with other related scientific fields publication trend showing research on this topic increased with time annual growth rate of scientific production is high in the recent years that signifies researchers has shown their interest on investigating about urban groundwater quality analysis mostly environmental issue related journals and specifically water related journals published such research articles these articles have been well appreciated in the scientific research field with h index and significant number of citations authors from hydrogeological background engineering background have worked on this subject matter mostly authors from india china and usa achieved the top positions through h index value serious issues like contamination presence of heavy metals and nitrates in groundwater landuse change seawater intrusion identification of hazardous trace materials in groundwater emerged in this research field researchers mostly applied various kind of statistical techniques through gis and geostatistics to understand more about groundwater quality knowledge from hydrogeology and hydrochemistry merged with modern computational techniques in recent years use of advanced machine learning data mining are the upcoming techniques in this research field to know in detail and predict the future scenario on groundwater quality study on urban hydrology urban hydro geochemistry urban water management stormwater management groundwater recharge has been the centre of attraction for researchers in last thirty years comprehensive approach on groundwater study now getting increased top cited documents discussed about presence of hazardous material generated from anthropogenic activities are the sources of such hazardous materials in urban area they have also identified the causes behind the change in groundwater quality and found out appropriate methods to analyse the groundwater quality parameters and afterwards these techniques have been utilised by researchers in different study area principal component analysis cluster analysis water quality index is most popular among them researchers from different research field collaborated with each other in the past years thus various scientific viewpoints integrated this topic previous researchers have been well appreciated through citations in relatively new articles countries from whole world specially countries with urbanisation rate collaborated with each other and research institutes and universities contributed each other for development in urban groundwater scenario india china and usa mostly contributed in this research field as these countries are facing the issue of increasing urbanisation in last three decades research related with groundwater study mostly divided into agricultural sector and urban area and urban scenario became a distinct one after this extensive review it can be summarised that previously researchers focused on finding general causes for change in groundwater quality in urban area it was limited to hydrogeological and hadrochemical explorations recently researchers inclined to more site specific analysis thus dependency on advanced computational techniques and spatial analysis increased correlated issues like effect of climate change anthropogenic activities sustainability approach drawing attention in urban groundwater quality research nowadays researchers mainly focused on multidisciplinary research actions for urban groundwater quality assessment 5 conclusion in this paper we have tried to analyse the trend of research pattern through research articles from the scopus database with the help of bibliometric analysis broad issues like this impossible handle it manual observation and it lacks the quality also whereas scientific and statistical data analysis method like bibliometric analysis help to create deep insight on the topic and it is more accurate through this paper it can be encapsulated that urbanisation has made a significant change in the groundwater quality in recent days and researchers have identified the possible causes behind it applied several statistical methods to analyse the water quality parameters related with groundwater contaminations vulnerable situations have been addressed and possible remedial measures have been suggested this topic is attracting researchers because there are numerous scopes to do in this field as most portion of the topic is unexplored in this paper review has been done thorough bibliometric analysis this process follows more statistical and scientifical approach than conventional review though some drawbacks has been identified in time of analysis articles have been selected based on parameters like number of citations h index etc but valuable and significant articles may be overlooked with low score in that case representation may be biased articles has been selected based on query and certain modification in query may generate different result bibliometric analysis depends on machinery computation so human experience and intellectual point of view sometimes may be neglected in outcome bibliometrix package through r programming language only provides the facility to produce bibliometric analysis hence some language related errors grammatical mistakes and image resolution related issues has been identified in time of visualisation of the result as bibliometrix package and biblioshiny directly generate result from raw metadata we hope that with proper upgradation in these packages these issues will be resolved we have broadly captured the issue to understand the evolution of urban groundwater quality assessment on the research field for the last three decades some emerging topics which are more important these days like antibiotic resistance genes microbes in groundwater contaminations through radioactive trace materials and hazardous microplastics has not been highlighted in this bibliometric analysis these emerging topics in urban groundwater related research must be acknowledged further there are several ways to understand the previous research contribution in this specified field but bibliometric analysis followed most contemporary approach to know more about researcher s point of view on groundwater quality in urban area with more descriptive and quantitative way this article will positively help to experience the trend and motive of research on groundwater quality analysis for urban area ethical

11702,assessment of natural resources is an emerging concept in the research field groundwater is a seriously vulnerable natural resource in urban area research related to the analysis of groundwater quality in urban areas is relatively new to the research field in this paper a comprehensive review has been conducted to understand the research trend this research paper focuses on the contemporary timespan 1990 2022 with 709 articles to understand the progress on urban groundwater quality analysis bibliometric analysis has been performed in this paper to incorporate a large volume of papers related to the study the most promising citation database scopus has been used to collect article related metadata the process was executed with help of bibliometrix package on the r programming language the results were visualised with biblioshiny and vosviwer the outcome of the study suggests that research articles related to groundwater quality analysis on urban area is increasing year per year researchers from different fields and countries are collaborating for an integrated outcome groundwater vulnerability groundwater quality assessment the source of pollutants in groundwater groundwater contamination the presence of hazardous materials in groundwater are evolving topics for the last three decades the trends in these topics show the application of spatial data science remote sensing statistical algorithms in groundwater quality analysis for urban area this paper will inspire the researchers to understand the situation about groundwater quality articles related to it authors involved to this subject and most useable methods for analysis and future scope in this research field graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality urbanisation bibliometric analysis bibliomatrix data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is one of the important natural resources in the world groundwater plays a significant role in hydrological cycle as it reacts with other hydrological resources alley et al 2005 also groundwater has an importance in civilization more than 2 5 billion of people in the world directly depends on consuming the groundwater as drinking purpose and about 50 of the arable land is irrigated by groundwater utilisation of groundwater greatly preceded understanding of its origin occurrence and movement usage of groundwater increased after the industrial revolution application of modern techniques and demand of water in industry and agriculture fienen and arshad 2016 with the growing process of urbanisation utilisation of groundwater increased fienen and arshad 2016 municipal water supply depends on groundwater in several parts of the world especially in humid and arid regions where water availability is not so adequate groundwater source is ultimate one chen et al 2018 karnieli et al 1984 safa et al 2020 groundwater quality is one of the important factors to evaluate because some portion of groundwater may not meet up the adequate level to be utilised specifically for drinking purpose quality of groundwater depends on the composition of recharge subsurface medium and the climate şen 2015 partially changes occur in groundwater quality because of infiltrated particles in the soil fitts 2013 naturally groundwater quality faces deficiency to be called as pure for several factors like high salinity in arid regions salt bearing rock formations excessive hardness in carbonate formations high sulphate content significant fluoride level in sedimentary rocks arsenic content and naturally occurring bacteria margat and van der gun 2013 groundwater quality assessment is necessary for its various usage in different needs and now it is being monitored in numerous aquifer around the world margat and van der gun 2013 groundwater contamination due to numerous reasons is now an emerging concern for humankind fares 2016 specifically urban groundwater exploitation is a serious issue as it brings the consequences of groundwater mistreatment drangert and cronin 2004 it has been recognised that groundwater quality changing its characteristics in urban area within a short span of time due to anthropogenic reasons like leakage from underground pipes of domestic and industrial wastes soaking of pollutant material from roads polluted water recharge after rainfall etc elumalai et al 2017 researchers related to this subject published several articles about the source of toxicities in groundwater fienen and arshad 2016 lerner and barrett 1996 lerner and tellam 1992 nambi et al 2017 roy et al 2015 roy and bickerton 2012 safa et al 2020 somasundaram et al 1993 wakode et al 2018a awareness about impact of urbanisation on groundwater quality has developed recently so research interest related to it has increased specifically from the end of twentieth century detailed study on urban groundwater quality already upgraded with technological advancement in field observation integrated statistical approaches and application of modern machinery techniques alazaiza et al 2021 barcelona 2005 che nordin et al 2021 gao and li 2014 mueller et al 2012 us epa 2022 identification of research prospect related to the depleting resource like groundwater and its quality need to be revised through published articles which are significant and informative in various way it has been observed that in last thirty years scope of research sector has changed tremendously after integration and agglomeration of several co related subjects and significant usage of digital computation process and internet significant number of papers has been published in the meantime which pointedly contributed the effectiveness of research in urban groundwater quality through review articles adeniyi and giwa 2021 barrett et al 1999 devic et al 2014 foster et al 2013 graham and polizzotto 2013 katz et al 2011 kurwadkar 2014 loftis 1996 ravish et al 2021 wakida and lerner 2005a in most cases exposure of groundwater quality studies remained limited with in conventional review approach any alternative process like reviewing though bibliometric analysis about urban groundwater quality assessment has not been approached yet it can be stated that bibliometric analysis summarizes massive quantities of bibliometric data to present the state of the intellectual structure and emerging trends of a research topic or field donthu et al 2021a it is used where review scope is broad and too large to review manually already bibliometric analysis has achieved immense popularity in business research donthu et al 2021b bibliometric analysis on research articles processes quantitative and qualitative analysis of developments about the topic in scientific field dominko and verbič 2019 scholars in different research field use bibliometric analysis to show evolving movements in article collaborative understandings journal performance intellectual structures social structures etc szomszor et al 2021 the data that takes centre stage in bibliometric analysis tends to be massive hundreds to thousands of papers and objective in nature e g number of citations most cited article most used words and subjective e g thematic evolution also bibliometric analysis examines the primary metadata of the paper and helps to interpret with statistical approach madani and weber 2016 the representation of the outcome produces proper visualisation which is very attractive and easy to understand review articles through bibliometric analysis has expanded the sphere of viewing a topic as it was used to like before a limited amount of paper has published with bibliometric analysis about groundwater related research li et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 zyoud and fuchs hanusch 2017 the number of research paper related to this kind of review is not enough for identification of trend about impact of urbanisation on groundwater quality somehow a holistic view about the standpoint of research field about urban water quality has not been addressed properly through review articles on the light of the above this paper aims to identify the evolution of scientific research field for last thirty years in urban groundwater quality through bibliometric analysis according to author s knowledge this approach has been taken for the first time to recognise evolution of groundwater quality assessment in urban area through bibliometric analysis the study has been focused within timeframe of 1990 2022 to get the kernel of past and present condition about urban groundwater quality for this certain objectives have been approached to i quantify overall information that can be collected from documents which has been used in this study ii identify relevant emerging sources that reflected details about this topic iii identify authors who have contributed significantly in the subject matter iv analyse emerging words or subtopics that are most relevant for the study v create network analysis to understand the relation and variation between authors and co authors documents and other related variables and visualise the scenario vi recognise the basic and emerging themes from the study vii understand country wise scientific production and global collaboration between countries mainly collected research documents has been quantified and conceptual intellectual and social structures has been recognised to create a clear image about the evolution of urban groundwater quality related studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 data retrieval standardisation of bibliometric analysis exclusively depends on the process that helps to accumulate the data data collection is an important part for further review different kind of scientific material available electronically via internet but integrated updated and qualified products are necessary for the process several databases are available across the web like web of science scopus pubmed etc these databases are authenticated and approved worldwide in this journal we have accessed scopus https www scopus com home uri for the bibliometric analysis scopus is the largest abstract and citation database of peer reviewed literature like scientific journals books and conference proceedings which delivering a comprehensive overview of the world s research output baas et al 2020 in the scopus database there are thousands of documents on various topics most relevant documents needed to be found out to understand the recent trends in impact of urbanisation on groundwater quality over the world several attempts have been made to find out exact matches from the database finally the search has been performed using the query line like all impact of urbani ation and groundwater quality or groundwater contamination and limit to pubstage final and limit to doctype ar or limit to doctype cp or limit to doctype ch or limit to doctype bk and limit to language english and limit to srctype j or limit to srctype b or limit to srctype p or limit to srctype k and exclude doctype bk and exclude srctype b or exclude srctype k this query line describes that all kind of documents has been selected with impact of urbani s z ation as a phrase and groundwater quality as another phrase for exact results related to topic different filters has been applied like the study has been limited to the research article that are already published query has been limited to documents written in english concept from books has been excluded from the study after this process from the initial findings of 900 documents 709 articles have been selected for the bibliometric analysis this search query was conducted on 21 march 2022 limited number of documents have been incorporated in the study from 2022 as it covered only published materials from first three months bibliometric analysis usually follows some general steps to conduct the study initial stages start with data collection which has been already discussed after that it follows steps like data filtering data analysis data visualisation and data interpretation 2 2 analysis technique broadly bibliometric analysis technique can be divided into two categories performance analysis and science mapping performance analysis examines the contributions in specified research field donthu et al 2021a this part of analysis is descriptive in nature research paper related with review certainly go through this process performance analysis consists certain parameters like number of sources involved in the research number of documents involved in the research average citation per documents number of keywords used in the study number of authors related to the study etc science mapping examines the relationships between research constituents further analysis describes structural connections and intellectual interactions between the articles the techniques related to it are co citation analysis bibliographic coupling word analysis etc donthu et al 2021a review through bibliometric analysis is an emerging concept in research field a flow diagram has been created to create a clear idea about this method fig 1 2 3 relevant terminology related with bibliometric analysis 2 3 1 bradford s law bradford s law predicts that number of journals in the second and third zones will n and n2 time larger than first zone respectively thus it is possible to measure the number of journals which are in the core and middle group from the total number of journals nash stewart et al 2012 2 3 2 h index it is an index that attempts to measure the productivity and impact of the published work of a scientist or a scholar this index is a useful measurements that helps to compare scientific production and writing hirsch 2005 2 3 3 thematic network according the frequency of co occurrence of keywords thematic networks are structured using the algorithm of simple centres a set of keywords in a group are identified and these groups termed as themes these themes are analysed clockwise and according to centrality and density it is divided 2 3 4 thematic map motor themes are well developed and important for structuring the research appropriately and niche theme has marginal or limited role in the scientific development whereas emerging or declining theme are weakly developed and poorly structured and marginally related to scientific field basic themes are relevant to scientific field but not yet developed lópez robles et al 2019 2 3 5 thematic evolution raw data were divided into different groups of years or subperiods to analyse evolution of themes under the study generally inclusion index helps to generate thematic evolution map armenta medina et al 2022 2 3 6 multiple correspondence analysis mca mca is data analysis tool for categorical data it helps to detect and represent structures related to the dataset it represents data as a point generating through euclidean space it is a subpart of correspondence analysis that is applicable to dataset and it is counterpart of principal component analysis murtagh 2008 2 3 7 betweenness centrality and pagerank centrality refers to the number of relational ties a research constituent has in a network betweenness refers to a node s ability to carry information between unconnected groups of nodes wherein each node represents a research constituent closeness centrality refers to the capability of nodes to carry information effectively by being closer to other nodes in the network pagerank can be used to calculate the prestige of publications that have an influence in the research field intellectual structure of a research field can be identified by co citation network of papers related to the subject in bibliometric analysis it has been found out that mostly the network based on papers can be divided into 4 clusters on the basis of betweenness and closeness and pagerank top most paper has been discused here for understanding the correlation between papers this ranking is based upon the value of pagerank in this paper we have tried to cover important technical methods to analyse contemporary trends in the research field about groundwater quality upon the impact of urbanisation relevant sources eminent authors and significant documents has been analysed focusing the subject domain and conceptual intellectual and social structures has been identified with knowledge gathered from those documents this process is dependent on usage of proper software specialised for bibliometric analysis in this paper we have used r programming language in our study r is mainly a statistical programming language with several multi disciplinary libraries to perform solutions bibliometrix aria and cuccurullo 2017 derviş 2020 is one of the libraries that is used as tool for quantitative research in scientometrics and bibliometrics it is capable enough to work with topmost databases like web of science scopus pubmed lens etc this software integrates with programmed user interface biblioshiny https www bibliometrix org home that visualise the analysis this process of analysis in this software divide workflow into certain steps like data loading and conversion bibliometric analysis bibliographic network metrices visualizing bibliographic networks co word analysis i e the conceptual structure of a field and historical direct citation network vosviewer https app vosviewer com has been used to visually represent the network analysis data 3 result 3 1 main information about the collection urban groundwater quality was the primary research topic for 709 documents more than four thousand authors contributed through this topic for the last thirty years only 26 papers have been authored singularly rest of the papers have been documented by collaboration on an average more than 4 authors are involved on writing an article collaboration index calculated as 3 6 further details have been mentioned on the table below table 1 annual scientific production has increased about the groundwater quality issue in urban area through years fig 2 in 2021 146 papers have been published while in 2020 the number was 104 whereas number of productions was less than 20 in 2010 the number of publications was less than five in a year in the era of nineties annual growth rate of scientific production rate is 11 88 average citation per year has increased with time most citation has been counted about this specified topic in 2013 these citations produced near about sixty thousand references till the time span already more than nine hundred documents have been published about the groundwater quality issue that are mostly related with urban area authors have mentioned more than two thousand keywords that defines the subject matter and scopus machine learning process has generated near about five thousand words that are closely reflects the topic most of the documents are published in collaborative way only twenty six articles have been published single author 3 2 focus on domain 3 2 1 sources the trend of annually published article works as the significant indicator of the current state of research it reflects attraction of researchers towards subject matter development in this field from macro outlook tsolakis and anthopoulos 2015 yang et al 2021 research about groundwater quality on urban area has been encouraged reviewed and published by several publication houses table 2 environmental earth science has published highest number of original articles on urban groundwater quality in last three decade they published 52 articles on urban groundwater quality related topic environmental monitoring and assessment came to the next and science of the total environment came after it number of publications are 39 for the former and 29 for the latter from reference list it can be analysed that journal of hydrology has been cited most with number of 1257 next the journal science of total environment with 849 citations contribution of journals like groundwater for sustainable development and arabian journal of geosciences are noteworthy based on cumulative frequency and citations they achieved within year of publishing timespan according to bradford s law listed top ten journals are part of a single core zone 3 2 2 authors bibliometric analysis identified authors who have already contributed the research sector by publishing articles on specified topic it is comparatively new and an alarming topic for the highly urbanised cities and several authors have shared water quality related observation through their writing we have shortlisted ten authors according to number of articles they published fig 3 authors related to this subject has produced enough insight through their work and it reflected in their h index score prof s k singh has published most of the article in last 30 years and got 637 citations for his contribution he has done work on environmental engineering water resources pollution control and waste management singh has made an impact on groundwater quality study through h index value near about 12 p k shrivastava produced 16 articles and his writing has been acclaimed with 892 citations his articles also scored highest h index value among other authors he has done lot of work on groundwater study especially on hydrological modelling and his expertise in remote sensing made an impact in this research domain y li from china delivered 11 articles on groundwater quality m gupta is a researcher associated with nasa she has done enormous work on groundwater quality studies application of gis and remote sensing in groundwater study has been reflected prominently in her 8 papers she has 390 citations for her contribution p k shrivastava s k singh and m gupta has jointly worked for groundwater research that has been reflected in their papers h zhang published 9 articles and got 271 citations he worked on groundwater contamination specially he stressed on arsenic contamination in groundwater contribution of j chen s kumar and m kumar are noteworthy they have also acclaimed with significant number of citations for their work lerner has most citations over the years for his work on urban groundwater pollution in his articles he assessed every aspect of groundwater for urban area in details shrivastava singh and gupta collaboratively made effort to identify groundwater scenario for urban area mostly they have applied geographical information system to identify spatial variation of groundwater parameters country wise scientific production has been analysed in this paper fig 4 articles from chinese authors has been acclaimed with highest citations according to total number of citations india and u s a ranks after it authors from u k and australia has also acclaimed with significant number of citations whereas in average number of articles australia ranked top and u k comes after it china india and usa collected higher number of citations with lower number in articles 3 2 3 documents 3 2 3 1 most frequent words most frequent words have been extracted from the author s mentioned key words which counts more than two thousand we have selected best and top 30 words from them fig 5 groundwater and urbanisation came as most frequent words for obvious reason but with further observation we have found that groundwater quality occurred 47 times and hydrochemistry came up 27 times in the studies gis has been used for 27 times words like anthropogenic activities contamination vulnerability also been identified that refers the exploitation of groundwater in urban area several methodological terms like cluster analysis principal component analysis has been used to understand impact of groundwater quality parameters effective on urban area application of remote sensing gis and landuse studies has also been identified through keywords in urban groundwater quality analysis that mainly helps in geographical analysis different kind of heavy metals trace material and stable isotopes has been identified in research that defines the possibility of occurrence of such materials in urban area specially impact of nitrates has been an important research topic for authors seawater intrusion has been mentioned in different studies because most of the urban areas are close to coastal belt procedure of groundwater management has been discussed as a solution in every article 3 2 3 2 evolving words top ten keywords have been selected from bibliometric analysis according to their occurrence and evolving characteristics in research articles fig 6 from 1990 to 2000 number articles were very limited so most of the keywords has been used in limited number number of occurrences increased after 2000 and in the next ten year all the top keywords has been used equally but after 2010 a rapid change can be observed on usage of certain keywords specifically significant amount of growth can be observed for keywords like urbanisation and groundwater and water quality occurrence and usage of other keywords like hydrochemistry remote sensing gis pollution groundwater recharge increased as focus on urban groundwater quality was concentrated within these topics 3 2 3 3 most cited documents we have figured out top 10 contributing articles about groundwater quality in between 1991 and 2022 that focused on urban area the ranking of the contributing articles based on their total citation number and this process is based upon factor analysis table 3 fletcher et al 2013 published an article on modelling urban hydrology in this paper a comprehensive approach has been taken to understand the urban water scenario and surface water groundwater interaction they have mentioned about subsurface runoff process and subsurface flow process in urban area and its impact on water quality wakida and lerner 2005b published a paper about groundwater nitrate that are sourced from non agricultural activities they have mentioned about presence of nitrate in groundwater surrounding the city than beneath it they take nottingham as a study area and analysed the presence of nitrate in urban area that are sourced from agricultural activities as a result they have a found that source of nitrate concentration in groundwater in urban area because of wastewater disposal solid waste disposal and sewage leakages lerner 2002a in his paper has mentioned that source and pathways of groundwater is more numerous and complex in urban area than for rural area he prescribed for quantification of groundwater recharge in urban area should be done with integrated approach and he identified four chemical signatures like inorganic organic particulate and isotopic material in urban groundwater he concluded with opinion that anthropogenic possibility of groundwater recharge is increasing mcgrane 2016 described about the impact of urbanisation on hydrological and water quality dynamics he reviewed the groundwater quality perspective for urban water management he described about the impact of impervious surface from urban area makes a negative impact on urban groundwater recharge in this article he described how groundwater quality is changing due to contamination from urban sources change in recharge process making change in groundwater quality also gu et al 2013 has mentioned about presence of nitrate in groundwater they generated their study in the china and found out that most of the nitrate concentration can be identified in industrial and urban area the depicted anthropogenic factors are responsible for reactive nitrate concentration in groundwater and it is mostly found in dense urbanised cities huang et al 2010 has identified appropriate methods to identify spatial variation in water pollution they applied fuzzy comprehensive method to understand difference water quality based on weightage of the crucial parameters this method afterwards largely used to analyse the quality of groundwater also gorelick and zheng 2015 discussed on global change and groundwater management challenge they find out the problem for last fifty years that changed the aquifer storage and depletion trajectory management they also identified land subsidence seawater intrusion groundwater dependency supply vulnerability are most emerging issues that made a change in the scenario globally about groundwater they addressed about groundwater management challenges in terms of quantity and quality huang et al 2013 presented a paper on evolution of groundwater chemistry in rapidly urbanised coastal area due to anthropogenic process this study is mainly based in south china according to researchers human activities are responsible for the occurrences of no3 so4 and mg2 their objective of the study was to find out the land use changes and its impact on groundwater quality they applied principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis to analyse the parameters that make changes in groundwater quality varol and davraz 2015 have applied wqi to evaluate the groundwater quality and he also applied multivariate analysis with different groundwater quality components this study was limited to plain land of turkey but this method made an impact in scientific field afterwards leung and jiao 2006 made a study on hong kong island about the heavy metal and stress element distributions in groundwater in highly urbanised spaces this study shed important light on the identification and evolution of leakage from service pipes in a particular area based on aqueous distributions of heavy metals and trace elements 3 3 knowledge structure 3 3 1 conceptual structure 3 3 1 1 network analysis on co occurrence of author s keywords network analysis can help to find out how important parameters about impact of urbanisation on groundwater quality are related to each other each relevant topics in this paper representing the nodes and those are joined with several vertices presenting interconnection between those topics fig 7 in this bibliometric analysis groundwater came up as most important topic that are related with all other nodes according to word size in the diagram urbanisation is next both the words are closely related with geochemistry surface runoff anthropogenic activities nutrients etc health related issues arsenic contamination sea water intrusion came as consequence related to the domain methodological terms like cluster analysis principal component analysis factor analysis are closely related with groundwater remote sensing and gis techniques are separated from clustered words but used frequently in this research field and these topics are interrelated with other significant topics like urbanisation and other statistical methods 3 3 1 2 thematic map with keywords plus scopus data generates keywords from abstracts according to their relevance through machine learning process such words on urban groundwater related research have been clustered by themes for a better understanding fig 8 groundwater quality analysis hydrochemistry and water quality index is the basic theme for this research also groundwater pollution and presence of heavy metals on urban groundwater are the most common topic for research investigation on water quality parameters impact of land use and aquifer study are the most well identified themes in urban groundwater quality analysis groundwater contamination nitrate contamination also the part of motor themes as these topics are well recognised themes among the researchers urban groundwater related issues specifically under karst topography has been well acknowledged by researchers limited research has been done on direct impact of urbanisation process urban sprawling urban agglomeration highly developed infrastructure etc variability of groundwater recharge and direct and indirect effect of climate change also limited application of remote sensing data and related gis application has been used in urban groundwater quality assessment recently sea water intrusion advanced statistical analysis of groundwater quality parameters and impact on coastal aquifers growing as important themes for the scientific field but these topics has not taken shape yet in groundwater quality analysis these topics now treated as emerging theme in this research field limited studies have been done on these topics topics on groundwater pollution and deteriorated urban groundwater quality in country like india are also emerging 3 3 1 3 multiple correspondence analysis conceptual structure map has been produced using multiple correspondence analysis fig 9 keywords generated from scopus database has been structured visually two clusters have been formed from all the 4939 words application of hydrochemistry water quality analysis risk assessment groundwater resource evaluation groundwater as a drinking water urbanisation process urban growth all consists in one cluster these concepts are diverged in both the principal dimensions environmental monitoring water pollutants findings of nitrate chemical proponents of groundwater has been clustered separately research field about groundwater study in an urban area mostly depends on these parameters researchers followed one of the cluster s parameters groundwater related research in urban area mainly concentrated with a specified study area applying different statistical methods or general analysis has been produced those can be relatable to all the groundwater scenario for an urban area 3 3 1 4 thematic evolution with author s keywords thematic evolution describes relevant topics that are possibly related with groundwater quality on urban area evolution of themes and topics evolved with time those were most significant at that time fig 10 so the period of 1991 to the beginning of 2022 has been divided into four time frames in the decades of 90 s identification of pollutant in groundwater and contaminations of such pollutants were most discussed topic new millennium came up with more specified topics on groundwater than the past decade urbanisation related issues on groundwater was popular then different interdisciplinary methods were applied on groundwater quality analysis environmental degradation related to invasive species and its effect on groundwater were trending topics in research field in the next decade application of water quality index analysis in urban area were trending application of gis in groundwater quality analysis to find out spatial variation and visualisation was started then year 2021 was most successful on research of groundwater quality in urban area application of different machine learning algorithms complex statistical analysis started to apply in this research field change in groundwater quality affecting drinking water in many parts of the world that became an important topic now impact of groundwater recharge in groundwater quality coming out to be a trending issue groundwater quality issues now being counted as a serious issue for the urban planning and management 3 3 2 intellectual structure 3 3 2 1 co citation network of papers co citations networks describing interrelation between research articles through citations and thus showing evolution

years 3 3 3 social structure 3 3 3 1 contributing countries bibliometric analysis depicts about social structure in the research field the contribution and collaboration in between researchers and their associated institutions fig 12 most collaboration about the topic has been initiated from india to united kingdom that about 15 times india collaborated with usa for 13 times and china collaborated with usa for 11 times about urbanisation and groundwater quality china collaborated with australia about 10 times china collaborated with japan about 9 times and collaboration between usa and united kingdom has happened 8 times where china collaborated with united kingdom 6 times mostly a deep collaboration route has been observed between usa china united kingdom and india collaboration in research field integrates the research quality and contribution towards the whole world 4 discussion in the present study statistical methods and scientific mapping have been approached through bibliometric analysis to understand evolution of research sector about urban groundwater quality it is an emerging concept as awareness on environmental resources is getting increased nowadays urbanisation is an important factor for development also it is showing a prominent impact on groundwater it is one the resources that are getting utilised and exploited in urban area research prospect on this subject has emerged from the end of the twentieth century research related to deteriorating groundwater quality has a positive correlation with increasing urbanisation in last three decades research sector on subsurface water has broadly collaborated with other related scientific fields publication trend showing research on this topic increased with time annual growth rate of scientific production is high in the recent years that signifies researchers has shown their interest on investigating about urban groundwater quality analysis mostly environmental issue related journals and specifically water related journals published such research articles these articles have been well appreciated in the scientific research field with h index and significant number of citations authors from hydrogeological background engineering background have worked on this subject matter mostly authors from india china and usa achieved the top positions through h index value serious issues like contamination presence of heavy metals and nitrates in groundwater landuse change seawater intrusion identification of hazardous trace materials in groundwater emerged in this research field researchers mostly applied various kind of statistical techniques through gis and geostatistics to understand more about groundwater quality knowledge from hydrogeology and hydrochemistry merged with modern computational techniques in recent years use of advanced machine learning data mining are the upcoming techniques in this research field to know in detail and predict the future scenario on groundwater quality study on urban hydrology urban hydro geochemistry urban water management stormwater management groundwater recharge has been the centre of attraction for researchers in last thirty years comprehensive approach on groundwater study now getting increased top cited documents discussed about presence of hazardous material generated from anthropogenic activities are the sources of such hazardous materials in urban area they have also identified the causes behind the change in groundwater quality and found out appropriate methods to analyse the groundwater quality parameters and afterwards these techniques have been utilised by researchers in different study area principal component analysis cluster analysis water quality index is most popular among them researchers from different research field collaborated with each other in the past years thus various scientific viewpoints integrated this topic previous researchers have been well appreciated through citations in relatively new articles countries from whole world specially countries with urbanisation rate collaborated with each other and research institutes and universities contributed each other for development in urban groundwater scenario india china and usa mostly contributed in this research field as these countries are facing the issue of increasing urbanisation in last three decades research related with groundwater study mostly divided into agricultural sector and urban area and urban scenario became a distinct one after this extensive review it can be summarised that previously researchers focused on finding general causes for change in groundwater quality in urban area it was limited to hydrogeological and hadrochemical explorations recently researchers inclined to more site specific analysis thus dependency on advanced computational techniques and spatial analysis increased correlated issues like effect of climate change anthropogenic activities sustainability approach drawing attention in urban groundwater quality research nowadays researchers mainly focused on multidisciplinary research actions for urban groundwater quality assessment 5 conclusion in this paper we have tried to analyse the trend of research pattern through research articles from the scopus database with the help of bibliometric analysis broad issues like this impossible handle it manual observation and it lacks the quality also whereas scientific and statistical data analysis method like bibliometric analysis help to create deep insight on the topic and it is more accurate through this paper it can be encapsulated that urbanisation has made a significant change in the groundwater quality in recent days and researchers have identified the possible causes behind it applied several statistical methods to analyse the water quality parameters related with groundwater contaminations vulnerable situations have been addressed and possible remedial measures have been suggested this topic is attracting researchers because there are numerous scopes to do in this field as most portion of the topic is unexplored in this paper review has been done thorough bibliometric analysis this process follows more statistical and scientifical approach than conventional review though some drawbacks has been identified in time of analysis articles have been selected based on parameters like number of citations h index etc but valuable and significant articles may be overlooked with low score in that case representation may be biased articles has been selected based on query and certain modification in query may generate different result bibliometric analysis depends on machinery computation so human experience and intellectual point of view sometimes may be neglected in outcome bibliometrix package through r programming language only provides the facility to produce bibliometric analysis hence some language related errors grammatical mistakes and image resolution related issues has been identified in time of visualisation of the result as bibliometrix package and biblioshiny directly generate result from raw metadata we hope that with proper upgradation in these packages these issues will be resolved we have broadly captured the issue to understand the evolution of urban groundwater quality assessment on the research field for the last three decades some emerging topics which are more important these days like antibiotic resistance genes microbes in groundwater contaminations through radioactive trace materials and hazardous microplastics has not been highlighted in this bibliometric analysis these emerging topics in urban groundwater related research must be acknowledged further there are several ways to understand the previous research contribution in this specified field but bibliometric analysis followed most contemporary approach to know more about researcher s point of view on groundwater quality

11703,emerging contaminants that can potentially impede the activity of the hormonal system of humans and other animals are referred to as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs apparently edcs are ubiquitous in our surroundings and through industrial and domestic waste streams get discharged into receiving water bodies even in trace concentrations these edcs can cause impairment of the reproductive system weaken immunity and cause child developmental disorders the extent of edcs pollution can be gauged by their identification at an alarming rate in rivers coastal regions and even subsurface aquifers the evident fiasco of conventional treatment in suppressing pollution of edc has provoked the development of electrochemical techniques such as electrochemical oxidation electrocoagulation electro fenton process and other electrochemical technologies ets these neoteric technologies are conveniently operated with minimal dependency on external chemicals manageable sludge generation and display superior degradation kinetics therefore ets are appropriate for mineralising pollutants of stubborn and recalcitrant nature though effective the techno economic assessment has revealed that et driven wastewater treatment is expensive compared to traditional biological processes additionally the life cycle analysis of these electrochemical devices has anticipated adverse environmental effects the operation of et is taxing mainly due to the cost of electrode material and power required for driving the electrochemical reactor thus this review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the usability and viability of ets for removing edcs from polluted water and plausible strategies to bring the treatment cost to competitive levels graphical abstract image 1 keywords electro fenton process emerging contaminants endocrine disrupting compounds electrochemical technologies life cycle analysis wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction every new material and technological innovation is inevitably accompanied by the emergence of unique waste products and pollutants as these pollutants are freshly found have novel sources and are either partly controlled or unregulated by relevant agencies they are typically referred to as emerging contaminants emcs the occurrence of emcs in aquatic environment is widespread and catalogued by many scientists behera et al 2011 hughes et al 2013 based on their source these emcs are further split into three categories a personal care items b pharmaceuticals and c endocrine disrupting compounds edcs gogoi et al 2018 the edcs are the most minacious of these three categories of emcs owing to their intrinsic capacity to disrupt hormonal balance which leads to the development of grievous health issues any natural or man made chemical compound that mimics and interferes with the regular functioning of the endocrine system of the human body is referred to as an edc kabir et al 2015 plastics food packaging building materials cosmetics and hygiene commodities pharmaceuticals herbicides insecticides etc include edcs such as parabens bisphenol a bpa phthalates estrone e1 triclosan tcs estradiol and estriol e3 dodge et al 2015 monneret 2017 extensive usage of these commodities has accumulated edcs in the environment particularly in natural hydric sources multiple cases of edcs contamination in rivers lakes oceans and subsurface water have come to light which is mostly attributable to insufficient effluent treatment facilities in industries su et al 2020 vymazal et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 subsurface water contamination is often caused by the percolation of dirty water into subterranean aquifers and it is frequently found in places near to polluted surface water sources for instance francisco et al 2019 detected the presence of different agricultural chemicals like malathion diuron atrazine etc in the groundwater wells in brazil revealing the deleterious impact of agricultural runoff on the groundwater quality owing to their ecotoxicological effects the prolonged presence of edcs in the surrounding ecosystem presents an immediate hazard to natural biota most edcs are known to cause chronic health issues such as hormone imbalance impairment of brain functioning congenital anomalies and improper development in infants monneret 2017 in addition exposure to edcs may induce malignancy in the breast obesity diabetes and infertility jambor et al 2017 nohynek et al 2013 similar detrimental effects of edcs on animals and aquatic biotas have been recorded including weakening of immunity malfunction of endocrine glands and genitals and tumour formation casanova nakayama et al 2011 xie et al 2018 therefore it is essential to eliminate edcs from domestic and industrial effluents in order to safeguard the natural ecosystem from these detrimental consequences typical wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not designed to tackle edcs hence conventional wwtps exhibit insufficient edc abatement in addition the complex nature of edcs makes them unamenable to bio based secondary treatments such as activated sludge process trickling filters anaerobic reactors etc de oliveira et al 2020 koumaki et al 2021 samal et al 2022 even so a certain degree of emc attenuation can be offered by bioremediation processes like constructed wetlands chowdhury et al 2022 nevertheless such treatment can become ineffective at higher emcs concentrations matamoros et al 2017 moreover edcs have been eliminated using sophisticated treatment techniques such as adsorption membrane filtration and advanced oxidation processes aops sun et al 2017 vieira et al 2020 electrochemical technologies ets including electrochemical oxidation eo electro fenton process ef electrocoagulation ec electro flotation process etc have emerged as an effective and eco friendly technique for removing emcs from polluted water the low chemical dependency low land footprint minimised sludge generation faster degradation kinetics and efficacy in oxidising varieties of chemical compounds make ets a lucrative prospect in the abatement of edcs the ets can eliminate the target biorefractory compounds by completely mineralising them into benign by products and harmless inorganic species the removal mechanism may involve anodic oxidation ao i e direct oxidation at the anode surface and mediated oxidation via reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl radical oh during eo and ef in ec rather than degrading contaminants are skimmed from top or settled at the bottom plenty of research findings advocate that eo ef and ec are efficient in removing emcs from wastewater such as parabens caffeine heavy metals phenols antibiotics beta blockers and dyes among others das and nandi 2022 raj et al 2021 such favourable outcome deems ets as a viable choice for treating edcs and other potentially toxic micropollutant laden wastewater the mechanism of edcs degradation by eo has been deciphered in the article by luna and bensalah though this review only revolves around boron doped diamond bdd anodes and eludes other electro chemical configurations de luna and bensalah 2022 hence in this article recent developments in edcs degradation using electrochemically driven oxidation techniques have been tracked the operational parameters that govern the contaminant removal efficiency of ets have been critically analysed to highlight the optimum working environment of each technology in order to assess economic viability a concise cost comparison between conventional treatment advanced oxidation systems and ets has also been presented to supplement environmental cost associated with the operation of these electrochemical systems is also incorporated further strategies for integrating ets with contemporary treatment technologies for economical operation are briefly discussed to the best of our knowledge such a comprehensive review on et driven edc abatement is not available in the literature the impending research gaps abstaining from field scale application of these technologies have been specified future research can be directed to address these impending lacunas so that ets can live up to its full potential 2 endocrine disrupting compounds occurrence and ecotoxicity according to who an edc is an extrinsic substance or combination that affects the functions of the endocrine system and subsequently causes adverse impacts on mammals and other organisms the edcs can thereby disrupt hormone biosynthesis metabolism or function which alters normal homeostatic regulation or reproduction generally edcs are classified into two categories synthetic compounds or industrial solvents lubricants and natural compounds diamanti kandarakis et al 2009 synthetic compounds comprise fungicides vinclozolin plasticizers phthalates insecticides dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane methoxychlor and different pharmaceutical compounds diethylstilbestrol moreover endocrine disruptors can also be produced by natural compounds present in human and animal food such as phytoestrogens like genistein and coumestrol nonetheless scientists also proposed a product based taxonomy of edcs classifying them into three groups based on the commodities in which they are utilised notably pesticides or insecticides industrial by products and food contact materials peña guzmán et al 2019 therefore edcs are widely categorised into the following six primary classes in this article to facilitate understanding and take into account the varied character of these substances such as i pesticides ii phenolic compounds iii phthalates iv paraben compounds v steroid estrogens and vi estrogenic heavy metals hence the following sub sections cover the prevalence ecotoxicity and health risks of these various groups of edcs 2 1 endocrine disrupting compounds present in the aquatic system as edcs are omnipresent in day to day products like personal care products packet foods plastic containers medications and other items human exposure is almost inescapable unfortunately most of these compounds eventually travel through different paths to reach the natural aquatic systems fig 1 and adversely affect the human body and other living organisms the occurrence of these edcs in various aquatic habitats has been briefed in table 1 basically edcs are not amenable to biological metabolism and therefore released in the receiving water bodies in undegraded or partially degraded form along with the treated effluent of wwtps previous investigations have confirmed the existence of edcs and their metabolites in sewage sludge and treated effluent of wwtps operating at different geological locations table 2 as an example pothitou and voutsa 2008 revealed that the influent of a sewage treatment plant stp in greece had 1 574 μg l of 4 nonylphenol 4 np and 0 445 μg l of tcs moreover according to a mass balance analysis of edcs entering and departing a wwtp in xiamen china up to 42 2 g of edcs entered the wwtp daily an estimated 6 15 g of edcs were ejected with the effluent and 7 60 g got accumulated in the settled sludge ashfaq et al 2018 therefore different edcs and other synthetic compounds should be substantially removed prior to the discharge of wastewater into natural water bodies furthermore a large amount of edcs have been detected in sludge collected from aerobic treatment units ashfaq et al 2018 therefore it implies that instead of biodegradation the mass removal mechanism in such systems occurs through the phase transition of pollutants via adsorption on the sludge surface for example an average of 71 μg g of di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp 4 3 μg g of di n butyl phthalate and 22 μg g of diisononyl phthalate were detected in sludge collected from 40 wwtps in korea lee et al 2019 likewise after secondary treatment the cumulative amount of phthalates ranging from 7 4 μg g to 138 6 μg g was observed in sludge during the investigation of seven treatment plants in taiwan dong et al 2020 however wwtps equipped with advanced tertiary treatment such as uv and ozonation units may report a significantly lower concentration of micropollutants in the final effluent to elucidate a 96 reduction in methylparaben mp concertation was observed in the treated effluent initial concentration 721 ng l of a wwtp in china ma et al 2018 even though the bulk of mp was removed in the secondary anaerobic oxic units the treated effluent had 113 ng l of mp which was further reduced to 28 7 ng l following the uv disinfection process ma et al 2018 this is in coherence with the finding of dhaka et al 2017 and dhaka et al 2018 wherein uv mediated aops were effective in mineralising paraben compounds to add further in one investigation benotti et al 2009 reported the existence of tcs 0 001 μg l bpa 0 025 μg l and nonylphenol np 0 1 μg l in potable water supply in the united states of america thus evidencing the vulnerability of the human population towards edcs in addition other noxious edcs including parabens 4 np e1 bpa 4 tert octylphenol 4 t op alkylphenol compounds etc are also frequently perceived in natural water sources farmlands and groundwaters li et al 2015 a probe for assessing anthropogenic pollutants in domestic effluents identified different phthalate esters such as dibutyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate with concentrations of 1 57 μg l and 4 77 μg l respectively in residential greywater obtained from chennai india delhiraja and philip 2020 to support further 5 82 μg l of tcs 11 08 μg l of bpa and 5 96 μg l of np were also found in this household greywater sample delhiraja and philip 2020 more appallingly renganathan et al 2021 discovered 10 39 ng l 205 62 ng l and 28 51 ng l of tcs carbamazepine and diclofenac respectively in cauvery river the principal source of freshwater for several states in southern india in natural streams organic contaminants are susceptible to the natural degradation process however the undegraded fraction may get entrapped in sediments and reside in the environment for a much longer duration koumaki et al 2018 this increases the exposure risk and can lead to bioaccumulation edcs in aquatic flora and fauna for instance an average concentration of 40 92 μg g and 5 98 μg g of bpa and np respectively was discovered in the hepatic tissue of fishes in the pearl river in south china lv et al 2019 furthermore a maximum of 8 03 μg l of carbamazepine was detected in the magdalena river in colombia while fish collected from the same river contained 32 0 μg kg and 90 8 μg kg of mp and carbamazepine respectively zhao et al 2019 hence it has been conclusively proven that the bioaccumulation of edc and other xenobiotic compounds in aquatic microorganisms is significantly higher than the concentration of those compounds in the environment increasing the risk of human exposure in regard to groundwater polluted surface water can also contaminate adjacent aquifers which becomes a serious concern when the groundwater is extracted for potable usage to illustrate sharma and co researcher detected more than 15 emcs in groundwater samples of the ganga river basin which included edcs like tcs 10 2 ng l and triclocarban 2 055 ng l sharma et al 2019 in a similar vein oceans are the sink for natural drainage systems and inevitably become contaminated thus causing detrimental impacts on aquatic lifespan for instance seawater of the coastal iberian region was found to have bpa values ranging from 0 020 μg l to 0 054 μg l while the concentration of np was detected at amounts between 0 031 μg l and 0 056 μg l salgueiro gonzález et al 2019 also high amounts of dehp diethyl phthalate dep and dibutyl phthalate dbp were identified in the seawater of kuwait with the highest concentration of 2 91 μg l 0 52 μg l and 1 22 μg l respectively salgueiro gonzález et al 2019 hence prompt action is required to alleviate the concentration of edcs from natural water bodies and prevent further recontamination 2 2 ecotoxicity and adverse health impacts of endocrine disrupting compounds primarily hormones utilise diverse chemical and biological cues to keep the intracellular homeostasis of an organism moreover the regular operation of the endocrine system can be interfered due to edcs by producing inadvertent exogenous chemical signals in the organism s cell as a result endocrine disruption can have a variety of detrimental health effects and fatal illnesses including diabetes obesity polycystic ovary syndrome breast cancer and other chronic diseases table 3 hence the accumulation of edcs in the aquatic system is considered as a superior toxicological consequence than other emcs hamid et al 2021 it is also believed that the edcs can intrude into immune system of fish through tainted food disrupting normal sex hormone activity and increasing vulnerability to pathogens milla et al 2011 similar changes were noticed in the immune responses of intertidal mud crab and chironomid larvae as per the literature aberrant cellular development also occurred in mud crab and chironomid larvae with exposure to 1 30 μg l and 100 μg l of bpa and dehp respectively park et al 2019 park and kwak 2010 likewise sun and liu 2017 also reported that embryotic malformations were observed in zebrafish after exposing them to up to 0 6 mg l of butyl benzyl phthalate extending further researchers also revealed that np is more hazardous than its parent compound nonylphenol ethoxylates npeo this is evident from the fact that np lethal concentration 24 h 50 for inhibiting soil nematode namely caenorhabditis elegans was 70 folds less than that of npeo 1916 14 mg l de la parra guerra and olivero verbel 2020 also tato et al observed that 4 np had higher toxicity compared to tcs and bpa for alga isochrysis galbana for the half maximal effective concentration ec50 of 24 1 μg l 34 μg l and 1 21 mg l for 4 np tcs and bpa respectively tato et al 2018 the complex structural make up of np may consist of twenty distinct isomers or more makes it challenging to anticipate health repercussions on vulnerable species soares et al 2008 furthermore the edcs also trigger severe health issues in humans such as birth deformities chromosomal disorders congenital malformation infertility and so on also the balance of thyroid and reproductive hormones in pregnant women is destabilized by the presence of parabens and phenols moreover mp and butylparaben bp elevate the level of sexual hormone binding globulin and thyroxin by 7 70 and 5 64 respectively in exposed patients whilst bpa 2 5 dichlorophenol and 2 4 dichlorophenol have the potential to reduce the level of progesterone aker et al 2016 similar findings were also observed in urine and semen specimens collected from 105 men in milan italy the maximum bpa concentration was found to be 0 10 μg g of creatinine along with 10 69 μg g and 19 3 μg g of creatinine dehp and mono n butyl phthalate respectively caporossi et al 2020 dichloro diphenyl dichloro ethylene is one of the significant prevalent metabolites of noxious dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane ddt that induces abnormal function of androgens activity by reacting with the hormone causing diabetes lind and lind 2018 research has been conducted on the effect of edcs exposure during pregnancy of women according to yang et al 2019 edcs can reach the placenta and impede the development of the embryo by harming cognitive impairments further zhang et al 2021 emphasized that preconception exposure of parents to phenols and phthalates elevates the chance of pregnancy complications by altering the level of sex hormones paraben preservatives are a common ingredient in many personal care products and cosmetics they are in the category of potentially carcinogenic materials this tenet was reinforced when amin et al 2019 detected paraben compounds in the malignant breast tissues of a patient to add further the vulnerability of the mother to parabens during pregnancy may onset obesity in the child leppert et al 2020 there is no denying the fact that endocrine disruption induced by edcs is one of the greatest threats to humans and the environment past research has linked exposure to edcs to the escalation of health issues and if left unregulated in the environment these xenobiotics chemicals might have a permanent negative impact on the ecosystem 3 different electrochemical technologies to remediate edcs the deleterious impacts of edcs and other similar hazardous contaminants on the aquatic biota necessitate the development of advanced treatment technologies such as ets to suppress xenobiotic pollution of natural water sources in respect of edcs mitigation from contaminated water different ets have displayed meritorious performance table 4 most of the ets rely on the in situ production of extremely potent oh to carry out the non selective mineralisation of organic contaminants present in wastewater in fact the inherent ability to generate reactive species electrochemically in the solution is the most distinguishable feature of ets which sets it apart from other advanced oxidation techniques though oh can abate a broad variety of organic contaminants in the aqueous medium they are transient average half life 20 ns and non selective which may escalate scavenging secondary reactions especially in diluted wastewater with very low pollutant concentration as an alternative employing persulfate in an advanced electrochemical oxidation process make use of relatively stable sulphate radical so4 having an average half life in the range of 30 40 μs and it is more selective towards organic pollutants scaria and nidheesh 2022 besides the presence of these major radicals many supplementary reactive species such as hypochlorous acid hocl cl2 and s2o8 2 may also participate in the removal mechanism of organics depending on their availability in the electrolyte it s apparent that the removal mechanism and kinetics of contaminants in any electrochemical system are a function of the reactive species involved in the oxidation process for example in fenton based processes oh is the dominating reactive species whereas in ec and persulfate oxidation pollutants are subdued majorly via metal hydroxides and so4 respectively diverse pollutant removal mechanisms driven by different electrogenerated reactive species can be visualised in fig 2 nonetheless oh employing electrochemical systems such as eo and ef remains the most representative technologies among numerous existing ets a brief discussion on the working mechanism and removal of edcs by the well established ets is presented in the subsequent section 3 1 electrochemical oxidation pollutant removal in eo can be accomplished through direct oxidation and or indirect oxidation mechanism usually the direct eo process is often termed ao as the oxidation of organic contaminant occurs by exchanging of electrons between the anode and the target compound directly eq 1 whereas indirect eo is facilitated by anodically generated reactive oxidising species such as oh hocl and sulphate ions so4 2 formation of oh results from water splitting at the anode at higher potential eq 2 while inorganic salts such as nacl and na2so4 present in the wastewater get oxidised at the anode to form reactive chlorine species and so4 2 in the solution ambauen et al 2020 the steps involved in the formation of different reactive species and subsequent degradation of pollutant in anode facilitated oxidation is depicted in fig 3 1 r ze oxidised product 2 h2o oh h e e 2 80 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she 3 mox oh mox 1 h e 4 mox 1 r mox ro 5 mox oh r co2 h2o h e where r represents the contaminant z is the number of electrons mox oh is anodic bonded oh and mox 1 denotes higher metal oxide depending on the characteristics of the anode material the electrochemically generated oh may be loosely bonded physisorption or strongly bonded chemisorption to the anode surface ganiyu et al 2021 the chemisorped oh formation is observed over so called active electrodes that have a low potential for oxygen evolution under applied potential titanium platinum ruthenium dioxide graphite and other active anodes form higher metal oxides at their surface by reacting with oh that is responsible for mediating contaminant oxidation eq 3 and eq 4 in contrast the so called non active electrodes have large overpotential for oxygen evolution that allows generation of physisorbed oh that can directly target the contaminant molecules eq 5 the physisorbed oh is more potent oxidant than the chemisorbed oh therefore non active anode driven eo is considered more effective in subduing recalcitrant compounds in wastewater to highlight at a current density of 50 ma cm2 15 min of reaction time was sufficient to completely eliminate 0 5 mg l of butyl paraben bp using a bdd anode pueyo et al 2020 meanwhile only 40 and 18 of bp could be degraded when stainless steel ss and pt anodes were employed respectively under identical operating conditions pueyo et al 2020 the physisorbed oh produced over the non active bdd anode reacts directly with the mp resulting in rapid removal kinetics apparently chemisorbed oh produced on the surface of active pt and ss anodes limited the degradation rate of mp moreover in the case of active electrodes the oxidation of organics is carried out by the higher metal oxides which can only occur in the vicinity of the anode this makes the ao process dependent on the mass transfer of the target pollutant from the bulk solution to the anode surface also the mineralisation efficiency of active anode suffers because oh higher metal oxide availability is confined to a relatively narrow anode water interface for instance the eo of 100 mg l mp solution using ti ru based dimensionally stable anode was completed in just 40 min of reaction time however the active anode could only subdue 36 of total organic carbon toc steter et al 2016 obviously the low toc removal reflects partial degradation of mp which corroborates the poor mineralisation ability of active anode materials undoubtedly bdd anodes perform exceptionally well in treating wastewater though their exorbitant cost prohibits wider applications alternatively cheaper electrodes fabricated using pbo2 and sno2 have displayed great promise as an effective inactive anode in the eo process in a comparative investigation the pbo2 anode was able to mineralise 70 of norfloxacin which was only 20 less than the mineralisation efficiency of the bdd anode sánchez montes et al 2018 however the anodes fabricated with pbo2 are not very stable at high current densities making them prone to leaching the poor durability of cheaper inactive anode makes their long term operation questionable another instrumental parameter influencing the efficiency of eo is the concentration of supplementing electrolytes in the wastewater these supporting electrolytes not only increase the conductivity of the electrolyte medium but also generate additional reactive species in the bulk solution that can help with pollutant removal martínez huitle and panizza 2018 the same phenomenon was also demonstrated by fajardo et al 2017 by supplementing the bulk solution with 10 g l of nacl during eo process augmenting bulk solution with nacl resulted in the complete removal of six phenolic compounds 3 4 5 trimethoxybenzoic acids 4 hydroxybenzoic acids gallic acids protocatechuic acids and veratric acids anode ti ruo2 initial concentration each compound 100 mg l the removal efficiency for the phenolic compounds dropped to a mere 30 when nacl was replaced by 10 g l of na2so4 fajardo et al 2017 the poor removal efficiency in the case of na2so4 could be explained by the formation of weaker s2o8 2 ions at the anode that were not effective in degrading phenol in contrast the nacl gets oxidised at the anode to produce active chlorine species such as cl2 hclo and ocl which are more powerful oxidants than s2o8 2 bosio et al 2020 zambrano and min reported corroborative findings during the electrochemical degradation of phenol initial concentration of 100 mg l ti mesh electrodes a 9 5 times higher removal efficiency 98 21 for phenol was attained by using 10 g l of nacl as a supporting electrolyte instead of na2so4 zambrano and min 2019 current density is the most critical determinant in the edc degradation efficiency of eo processes as it directly determines the rate at which oh is generated on the anode surface periyasamy and muthuchamy 2018 chen and co workers observed that during eo of 40 mg l dbp solution using ss cathode and pbo2 anode removal efficiency raised from 56 65 to 74 4 when the current density was elevated from 20 ma cm2 to 50 ma cm2 for an electrolysis period of 8 h chen et al 2022 undeniably at higher current densities degradation rate of contaminants is accelerated owing to the rapid electrogeneration of oh however a careful manipulation is required while tuning current density on electrodes because beyond a limiting applied current or voltage degradation of pollutants doesn t depend on the charge transfer actually when the current density on electrodes is sufficiently high the degradation kinetics of eo is limited by the mass transfer of pollutants monteil et al 2019 also many undesirable side reaction that occurs at elevated current supply decline the energy efficiency of the eo process turan et al 2020 additionally the degradation rate is also limited by the mass transfer rate of the concerned pollutant towards the anode s vicinity which doesn t increase beyond certain values even at higher current densities for example increasing the current density above 15 ma cm2 has an insignificant effect on the electrochemical degradation rate constant of 5 mg l of tetracycline due to the limiting mass transfer rate at elevated current densities wang et al 2018 the initial concentration of contaminant in the bulk solution can also influence the rate of degradation and removal efficiency during the eo treatment shen and co workers found that with an increase in the initial concentration from 700 μg l to 1000 μg l the removal efficiency dipped from 92 to 39 for a 4 h of eo experiment using ti based electrodes shen et al 2017 likewise the degradation rate constant of the pesticide thiamethoxam reduced from 0 73 min to 0 05 min when the initial concentration was raised from 1 mg l to 10 mg l lebik elhadi et al 2018 it s evident that the reaction kinetic of eo is dictated by the initial concentration of the pollutant and therefore should be considered while designing an efficient flow through electrochemical reactor lebik elhadi et al 2018 indeed the eo process is an effective method for abatement edcs and can evolve as a promising et for the removal of hazardous micropollutants present in wastewater 3 2 electrocoagulation the ec is an innovative electrochemical method that combines electrochemistry with coagulation and floatation for abating a wide variety of organic matter microorganisms and emcs from wastewater fig 4 during the initial stage of this electrochemical process metal ions released from an anode electrode produce coagulants which are then destabilized by neutralising the surface charge hold by contaminants and other fine suspended particles in water neutralisation of repulsive forces causes the suspended particles to clump together into flocs followed by their elimination through sedimentation meunier et al 2006 the charge moving through the cell dictates the amount of coagulant generated electrochemically during the ec process and can be approximated using faraday s law of electrolysis eq 6 ingelsson et al 2020 the efficiency of the ec process is often evaluated in terms of faradaic efficiency which is the ratio of actual coagulant mass produced during the experiment over the theoretically predicted coagulant mass eq 7 6 t h e o r e t i c a l c o a g u l a n t m a s s p r o d u c e d i t m z f 7 f a r a d i c e f f i c i e n c y a c t u a l c o a g u l a n t t h e o r e t i c a l c o a g u l a n t 100 z f m i t m 100 where i is the current intensity a t is the duration of electrolysis s m denotes the molar mass of the metal g mol m is the actual mass of metal coagulant g z is the metal valence and f stands for faraday s constant 96 485 c mol compared to traditional chemical coagulation or flocculation processes the ec method offers a number of benefits for example the addition of external chemical coagulants and polyelectrolytes is avoided as coagulants are produced in situ electrochemically in ec the sacrificial anode is used as a source for the dissolution of metal cations and the cathode is involved in the production of oh ions and h2 eq 8 to eq 12 shahedi et al 2020 also the electrochemically produced pristine coagulants result in much lower sludge formation as compared to chemical precipitation brillas and martínez huitle 2015 iron and aluminium electrodes are among the most commonly adopted sacrificial anodes in the electrochemically driven coagulation process the high dissolution rate at lower poised potentials non toxicity and ample production of hydroxides polymeric hydroxides and oxyhydroxides make fe and al electrodes an obvious choice for ec the rate of coagulants produced during ec can be optimised by regulating electrode current density to yield maximum separation of even trace pollutants from the wastewater to elucidate cook et al 2016 witnessed 81 66 64 63 61 and 56 decrease in the concentration of np bpa17α ethinyl estradiol ee2 17β estradiol e2 e1 and e3 post aluminium based ec treatment of real municipal wastewater spiked with mentioned estrogenic edcs maximum 61 63 56 64 66 and 81 of e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa and np respectively were removed from municipal wastewater spiked with these six types of edcs via ec reaction at the anode 8 fe s fe 2 aq 2e 9 4fe s 4fe 2 aq 8e 10 al s al 3 aq 3e reaction at the cathode 11 2h2o 2e h2 g 2oh 12 8h 8e 4h2 g likewise symonds et al 2015 subjected tertiary treated municipal wastewater to an aluminium anode fitted benchtop ec reactor to remove residual contaminants and nutrients the ec processed had 78 less concentration of personal care products ibuprofen iopromide gemfibrozil acetaminophen salicylic acid deet triclocarban and tcs while the microbial density shrunk by a 7 log scale for domestic wastewater utilizing a benchtop ec unit as far as the nutrient is concerned nitrate and nitrite combined initial concentration 191 μg l concentration came down by 50 whereas more than 95 of phosphate initial concentration 375 μg l was subdued symonds et al 2015 therefore these findings serve as an example of how ec may be used to successfully remove a variety of edcs and other micropollutants from industrial and domestic wastewater the crucial determinants affecting the performance of ec are electrode material inter electrode gap current density electrolyte conductivity and the initial ph of the solution the applied current density on electrodes governs the dissociation of metal ions from the anode hakizimana et al 2017 though the current density applied in ec depends upon the nature and type of wastewater being treated it typically varies in the range from 0 001 ma cm2 to 88 ma cm2 tahreen et al 2020 moreover current density also impacts the production rate and sizes of bubbles which in turn influences the growth of flocs ramyaa et al 2019 during an ec investigation using aluminium electrodes an increase in applied current density from 2 5 ma cm2 to 12 5 ma cm2 improved the removal of fungicide propiconazole initial concentration of 25 93 mg l from 50 to 60 shadmehr et al 2019 the increased removal efficiency at higher current density was ascribed to the higher dissolution of al ions in the solution that resulted in greater floc formation shadmehr et al 2019 however the excessive current may deteriorate the efficiency of ec by instigating unwanted secondary reactions while releasing a surplus concentration of coagulants that can cause charge reversal of the colloids and reduce the serviceability of the electrodes ingelsson et al 2020 hence optimising current density is imperative to a successful ec operation inter electrode distance is another key parameter for optimising ec operation a large electrode gap can be maintained for effluent with high electrical conductivity and weakly conductive effluents should be operated at a lower electrode gap to reduce power consumption shahedi et al 2020 a wider gap between the electrodes can lead to a delay in floc formation and incur higher power consumption to facilitate the movement of ions between the electrodes on the other hand a very less distance between the anode and cathode can disrupt the formation of metal hydroxide due to high electrostatic attraction khandegar and saroha 2013 in this regard chen and co workers observed that while ec pre treatment of high strength swine wastewater with initial chemical oxygen demand cod of 5500 mg l 50 6 removal of cod was attained after 35 min reaction time with an inter electrode distance of 2 cm and the cod removal reduced by 4 5 and 3 when the electrode gap was 3 cm and 1 cm respectively chen et al 2021 the higher cod removal at the inter electrode distance of 2 cm was because of the enhanced mass transfer caused by the turbulence created during the electrocoagulation process similarly in ec the solubility and nature of the coagulating species are governed by the ph of the bulk solution garcia segura et al 2017 the ec is more effective in mildly acidic electrolytes than in an alkaline environment for example phenol initial concentration 2 5 mg l removal efficiency dropped from 92 at ph of 2 0 to 38 at ph of 10 0 during a fe electrode driven ec treatment vasudevan 2014 the inferior performance at higher ph can be attributed to the formation of disadvantageous fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 that hinder phenol precipitation while in an acidic environment dissolved fe ii ions can instigate fenton type reaction that can abet phenol mineralisation vasudevan 2014 this limitation can be overcome by manoeuvring the type of coagulating species being generated during ec operation as an instance coupled ec with the eo process can boost the production of fe oh 3 and al oh 3 thus resulting in an efficient coagulation of phenol öztürk et al 2019 nonetheless the cod of ec treated effluent is much higher than the prescribed reusability standards and hence it is not suitable to recycle it for domestic or industrial uses tahreen et al 2020 therefore ec treatment is often integrated with different technologies to attain high quality effluent through hybrid systems such as ec aops ec membrane ec biological treatment etc tahreen et al 2020 malakootian and heidari achieved 100 phenol removal and 98 of cod mitigation for real steel industry wastewater influent cod of 880 mg l with a phenol content of 50 mg l by combined ec photo fenton treatment malakootian and heidari 2018 such ameliorated performance of integrated ec systems has developed a lot of optimism among researchers especially for tackling wastewater containing recalcitrant pollutants 3 3 electro fenton treatment for the disruption of edcs the eo or ao processes rely solely on the anode electrode and the cathode in such electrochemical systems has a trivial role in contaminant degradation electrochemical systems in which both anode and cathode electrochemistry are exploited usually exhibit superior performance than the anode based ets among cathode driven electrochemical systems for wastewater remediation the most established technique is the ef process unlike eo in ef based technologies homogeneous oxidants are produced that facilitate the degradation of pollutants in the bulk solution initially h2o2 was added externally along with a catalytic amount of fe ii to initiate the famous fenton reaction eq 13 to eq 14 however later it was discovered that carbonaceous cathode could take advantage of electrochemistry to produce h2o2 in situ through two electron reduction of o2 ganiyu et al 2018 generally during the ef treatment oxidation of organic contaminants eq 16 is mediated by electrochemically generated heterogeneous oh in the vicinity of the anode surface fig 5 simultaneously the catalytic activation of h2o2 in the presence of fe ii ions generates homogeneous oh in the wastewater matrix eq 14 trapido et al 2009 13 o2 2h 2e h2o2 e 0 68 v vs she 14 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh k 76 mol s e 0 67 v vs she 15 fe3 e fe2 16 oh edcs by products h2o moreover oh generated by h2o2 and ferrous salts during fenton s oxidation process has a high oxidation potential to mineralise the toxic edcs effectively therefore the production rate of h2o2 the concentration of fe ii properties of contaminants and solution ph significantly affect the ef process s efficacy surplus production of oh in the ef system has made it possible to treat concentrated wastewater laden with recalcitrant pollutants with appreciable efficiency for instance ef degradation using iron electrodes accomplished 99 1 removal of 4 mg l of dimethyl phthalate dolatabadi et al 2021 in contrast to eo the cathode material is a crucial determinant in the ef process in this veneration carbonaceous cathodes are preferred in ef treatment because they suppress four electron pathways and favour the two electron route for reducing o2 to yield h2o2 application of carbon cathodes warrants uninterrupted production of h2o2 as a consequence the requisite level of oh radical is sustained in the wastewater for oxidising the target refractory compounds rosales et al 2018 found out that 60 min of reaction time was adequate for totally degrading 100 mg l of mp via ef treatment whereas eo of mp employing bdd anode and carbon felt cathode took twice the time required during ef greater concentration of oh also means that pollutants are not only degraded rather mineralised to innocuous inorganics the concurrent observation was made while degrading of 20 mg l of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid using bdd electrodes wherein ef treatment attained 20 high toc removal than the eo process 49 cai et al 2020 to boost in situ h2o2 production a variety of carbon based materials such as graphite carbon cloth carbon felt etc have been thoroughly examined an extended investigation was conducted by sopaj et al 2020 on the efficacy of different commercially available carbonaceous electrodes for expediting the reduction of o2 by two electrons for enhanced h2o2 generation a maximum h2o2 concentration of 40 8 mg l and 102 mg l at an optimised current of 50 ma and ph of 3 0 was denoted in the case of carbon felt and carbon sponge cathodes respectively this probe made it clear that cathodes fabricated using highly porous carbon materials are advocated for application in the ef process the macrostructure of carbon electrodes with high porosity can bond with oxygen in ooh which favours h2o2 generation on the cathode surface that is further catalysed to oh thereby boosting the elimination of edcs in the ef process however the dull rate of h2o2 production and stringent control of solution ph in the range of 2 5 3 5 is the stunting disadvantages of the classical ef process complexation of fe occurs at higher ph along with the decomposition of h2o2 eq 17 which combinedly reduces the efficiency of the ef process dolatabadi et al 2021b alternatively when ph of the solution drops below 3 0 a dip in contaminant removal rate is observed ascribing to the limiting concentration of oh caused due to formation of oxonium ions a less potent radical species and scavenging effect of h eq 18 to eq 20 dolatabadi et al 2021a dolatabadi et al 2021b chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta tripolyphosphate etc have been used to prevent the precipitation of fe ions at circumneutral ph conditions during ef treatment deng et al 2020 furthermore the application of heterogeneous fenton s catalysts such as pyrite chalcopyrite etc has made it possible to operate the ef process under neutral and circumneutral ph ganiyu et al 2018 catalysts favouring the two electron reduction of oxygen are often applied in conjugation with an iron onto the cathode to enhance h2o2 generation that would subsequently produce copious amounts of homogenous oh in the bulk solution for instance 2 38 mg l of oh was detected after 60 min of electrolysis during heterogenous ef treatment of tetracycline using 80 mg l of fe2o3 ceo2 composite catalyst whereas only 0 51 mg l of oh was formed in the ao process without any catalyst for the same experimentation time zhang et al 2022 the generation of oh in such abundance causes rapid degradation of intractable edcs and drastically reduces the electrolysis period in a similar investigation 40 mg l of cofe2o4 catalysts resulted in 98 1 removal of 10 mg l of 2 4 dichlorophenol by employing a heterogenous ef process in 120 min wang et al 2021 thus the heterogenous ef process seems to be a feasible alternative for avoiding factitious regulation of electrolyte ph 17 2h2o2 2h2o o2 18 h2o2 h h3o2 19 h2o2 fe3 ho2 h fe2 20 oh h e h2o cell parameters like applied current density and initial pollutant concentration have a similar effect on the removal efficiency of the ef process as observed in eo due to analogous electrochemistry of both the ets in accordance a 5 min reaction time was required to completely oxidise 19 24 mg l of fungicide thiram via ef oxidation bdd anode at an applied current of 300 ma while almost twice the time was taken at an applied current of 50 ma under identical operating conditions thus affirming the positive effect of applied current on the degradation kinetics of pollutants mbaye et al 2022 the higher degradation rates at elevated applied current can be attributed to rapid generation of h2o2 at the cathode helping in the swifter formation of oh in large numbers availability of oh in more significant numbers certainly increases the opportunity of radical pollutant interaction leading to rapid mineralisation notably further expanding the current beyond 300 ma has an adverse effect on the degradation kinetics of pollutants it is believed that applying current above optimum during ef oxidation triggers many parasitic electrochemical reactions such as hydrogen evolution at the cathode and reduction of h2o2 to h2o that severely impacts the current efficiency of the treatment process mbaye et al 2022 hence operating the ef system at optimum current density is crucial for achieving higher removal efficiency of edcs and reducing power consumption the type of supporting electrolyte used in the ef system can also have a substantial impact on the overall removal efficiency of the treatment process the most preferred choice for supporting electrolytes in fenton based ets is na2so4 due to its relatively appropriate behaviour when compared to chloride and nitrate salts moreover highly reactive so4 eo 2 6 v vs normal hydrogen electrode can also be generated homogeneously in the solution as a result of sulphate ion electrolysis that can boost the degradation rate of contaminants however doltabadi and co workers found that increasing the dosage of na2so4 beyond an optimum value of 7 1 g l adversely impacted the removal of dmp by ef process as sulphate ion can start competing with oh to produce so4 which is relatively less reactive and more selective than the oh dolatabadi et al 2021a on the other hand when nacl is employed as a supporting electrolyte energy consumption of the ef system is increased due to the formation of active chlorine species such as hclo clo clo2 clo3 and clo4 which requires extra energy for their formation intriguingly titchou and co researchers observed that nacl restricted the toc removal of direct red 23 dye due to the formation of resistant organochlorine compounds and short chained carboxylic acids titchou et al 2022 instead using a mixture of na2so4 and nacl 3 1 as supporting electrolytes was found to be more effective in attaining swifter decolourisation and higher mineralisation of direct red 23 in the ef process this was probably due to the bleaching effect of hclo and infusion of so4 in the bulk solution that facilitated greater toc removal therefore specific electrolytes optimum current density and other cell parameters should be carefully controlled during the ef treatment to ameliorate the performance efficiency of the system 4 other emerging electrochemical technologies and hybrid systems for the removal of edcs from aqueous environments in some ets instead of h2o2 precursors like peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds are used to produce highly reactive so4 achieved by cleaving of the peroxide bond of the persulfate molecule by direct electrolysis or via reduced metals metal oxides and metallic composites lee et al 2020 moreover so4 is strongly selective towards the degradation of organic pollutants such as phenol dyes antibiotics and other electron abundant contaminants at the same time oh radical is non selective and thus prone to involvement in unwanted side reactions that may lower the treatment efficiency of the electrochemical system zhi et al 2020 besides the relatively long half life of so4 in comparison to oh gives them greater opportunity to come in contact with target pollutants and ultimately mineralise them zhi et al 2020 for instance eo with bdd anode and ss cathode of 1078 μg l of atrazine solution resulted in 36 3 degradation in 30 min whereas the addition of persulfate ion elevated the removal efficiency to 78 2 and degradation rate constant of 0 05 min 1 for the same electrolysis duration bu et al 2018 clearly so4 was responsible for accelerating the pace of degradation of atrazine also the reaction rate for so4 mediated eo was higher than that reported by komtchou and co workers during the degradation of atrazine solution with an initial concentration of 100 μg l via ef process bdd anode and carbon plate cathode wherein removal efficiency of 69 89 was achieved in 90 min with a degradation rate of 0 01 min 1 komtchou et al 2017 it is evident that so4 based ets are a plausible alternative to traditional ets and can be conjugated with oh to manifest superior performance electro peroxone e peroxone process in another emerging et that synergistically combines eo and ozonation process for rapid and efficient mitigation of emcs fig 6 in this process the cathode generated h2o2 interacts with o3 to produce oh that enhances the removal of refractory pollutants resistant to conventional ozone process yao et al 2019 moreover ozonation of bromide containing wastewater often produces carcinogenic bromate as a by product which is effectively avoided during the e peroxone process through quenching of hypobromous acid by in situ generated oh yao et al 2019 since a copious amount of oh is generated in the e peroxone process along with o3 a very high removal efficiency can be obtained in a short time interval that can significantly boost the energy efficiency of the treatment system this was visualised during the treatment of synthetic wastewater containing 40 mg l of diuron herbicide wherein the complete removal of diuron was accomplished in just 10 min of experimentation asgari et al 2021 moreover during the 90 min operation 41 3 of cod was removed at an energy consumption rate of 0 08 kwh g of cod removed which was much less than that consumed by ozonation 0 12 kwh g and electrolysis process 0 21 kwh g asgari et al 2021 one major advantage of the e peroxne process over the other fenton based ets is that they don t rely on the catalyst for activating oh which combined with high degradation rates and low energy requirement makes them an ideal ets when dealing with a large volume of wastewater moreover the bulk of biorefractory pollutants in the aqueous medium could be removed by using hybrid technologies which combine electrochemical approaches with additional biological or chemical treatments in this context a hybrid electrochemical reactor fabricated by de vidales et al 2014 combined uv light irradiation and ultrasound with an eo reactor fitted with a bdd anode and ss cathode for eliminating progesterone hormone progesterone initial concentration of 100 mg l was almost completely mineralised in 40 min by applying a current density of 30 ma cm2 along with ultrasound irradiation at 24 khz wave with 200 w of ultrasonic power and uv treatment at 254 nm wavelength with 4 w of power de vidales et al 2014 in fact in one investigation ec eo sequential treatment was found effective in inhibiting the viruses infesting the water samples thus exemplifying the versatility and effectiveness of combined and hybrid electrochemical systems in treating a wide spectrum of contaminants heffron et al 2019 however the expensive materials used as anode in eo are despised by many environmentalists as they are not sustainable for application beyond the laboratory das et al 2019 2021 therefore it becomes necessary to economise the treatment of ets by merging them with biological treatment das et al 2021 das et al 2021 the microbial fuel cell mfc is one innovative bio treatment technology that produces energy from wastewater which can be exploited for auxiliary usages das et al 2022 lately orthodox dual chamber mfcs have been tuned to execute fenton s oxidation in the cathodic chamber this mfc fenton integration the so called bio electro fenton bef system does not require an external power supply to drive the fenton s reaction making it a lucrative technique for the cost effective remediation of emcs sathe et al 2022 the efficacy of such a bef system was illustrated during the investigation by sathe et al 2021 the fe activated carbon based bef system reduced 10 mg l of sodium dodecyl sulphate surfactant solution by 87 4 within 4 h and parallelly produced power with a maximum power density of 105 67 mw m2 no doubt the bef is a relatively greener wastewater remediation technology than the conventional ef systems with the potential to develop into a full scale technology therefore an important hybrid strategy for the removal of edcs and other micropollutants from wastewater is biological treatment combined with ets however further research is required to develop a comprehensive knowledge of the microbiota s biodegradation process and the crucial variables that increase the effectiveness of edcs disintegration also it is essential to characterise and quantify the secondary metabolites and by products that are generated throughout the biodegradation process since at times they might be more toxic and persistent than the parent substances 5 treatment cost advantages and disadvantages of electrochemical technologies the most notable benefit of the ets over other conventional and advanced wastewater treatment systems is their capacity to mineralise a variety of resistant xenobiotic compounds at a comparatively faster rate to demonstrate in 60 min only 30 of np initial concentration 50 mg l could be degraded through ozonation while the ef process removed 70 of np in the same contact time thus affirming the higher potency of eo treatment barrera díaz et al 2018 along with eliminating stubborn emcs eo and ef have been effective at eradicating antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes however ef oxidation is preferred over eo because of shorter contact time and higher removal rate at a relatively lower poised potential this tenet was evidenced by chen and his colleagues while performing ef oxidation of wastewater the ef oxidation current density 21 5 ma cm2 fe ii 56 mg l of antibiotic resistant genes produced 3 8 4 1 5 2 and 4 8 log elimination for intracellular teta intracellular ampc extracellular teta and extracellular ampc respectively in 2 h chen et al 2020 by eradicating the microorganisms that are infesting the wastewater ets are able to simultaneously disinfect the wastewater and attenuate xenobiotic pollutants which can significantly lower the cost of disinfection recalcitrant organics are also oxidised rather quickly by chemical based treatment techniques such as ozonation uv h2o and other aops however when compared to ets the chemical based aops consume a lot more ex situ chemicals during the disintegration process moreover when compared to other sophisticated chemical treatments the chemicals employed in the ets particularly in the eo and ef procedures are relatively affordable and easily accessible for instance continuous ozone dosage of 120 mg l and chlorine dosage 9 5 mg l has to be sustained to degrade 4 mg l of tcs while eo of 10 mg l tcs required much cheaper na2so4 salt in a concentration of 21 mg l li 2021 mei et al 2021 further during ef 11 mg l of fe iii catalyst along with 7 mg l of na2so4 was sufficient for attenuating 50 mg l of tcs sires et al 2007 the role of in situ electrochemical generations of reactive oxygen species and catalyst regeneration can t be understated in making operations of ets almost chemical free furthermore the requirement for shipping and storing these chemicals is avoided by in situ production and electrochemical regeneration of chemicals in ets which lowers the operational cost of the treatment past investigations have estimated much lower operating costs for ets compared to aops like uv o3 treatment conventional fenton oxidation peroxone process and photocatalytic oxidation according to m rodríguez peña et al 2019 the most economical technology for decontaminating 4 np containing wastewater was eo with an approximated cost of 0 249 l followed by uv o3 0 270 l and ao process 0 455 l respectively barrera díaz et al 2018 felis and miksch 2015 rodríguez peña et al 2019 mousset et al 2021 formulated novel criteria for juxtaposing diverse aop for wastewater treatment using accumulated oxygen equivalent chemical oxidation dose accordingly when the cost incurred per gram of toc removed for 99 mineralisation of phenol initial concentration 137 5 mg l toc of 100 mg l was evaluated for different technologies by incorporating charges incurred for supplying electricity chemicals supplements and sludge handling the ef process emerged as the most cost efficient treatment alternative with an estimated operation cost of 0 033 g toc removed surprisingly ozonation turned out to be the most expensive among the considered aops with an exorbitant unit treatment cost of 1 16 g toc removed the photo electro fenton 0 19 g toc removed and conventional fenton oxidation 0 044 g toc removed were much cheaper than ozonation but still cost more than four times of the ef process mousset et al 2021 evidently the ef process is a more economically viable alternative for the advanced treatment of wastewater likewise in terms of recovering unit kg of phosphorous from the supernatant of anaerobic sludge fe electrode driven ec process amounted to 1 92 and the fe iii salt employing chemical precipitation cost 3 13 huang et al 2017 hence a significant cost saving can be achieved by replacing chemical coagulation with innovative electricity driven coagulation techniques reduced sludge generation particularly during eo and ef treatment is another significant benefit of these two processes as they tend to mineralise the target component rather than phase shift though adding fe ii ions in surfeit quantity can form a scum layer due to the generation of fe oh 3 flocs badellino et al 2007 on the other hand to coagulate contaminants in the wastewater ec promotes the electrochemical production of fe oh 3 however as pristine coagulants are electrochemically infused in situ in the wastewater a high degree of removal is achieved even at much lesser coagulant concentration which means sludge produced during ec is substantially smaller than that produced in the traditional coagulation process garcia segura et al 2017 other advantageous characteristics of ets making them ideal for the abatement of emcs from wastewater are their easy fabrication and operation equally effective in neutral and circumneutral ph and comparable performance while treating wastewater from different sources despite their robust performance and effective removal of refractory pollutants only a few investigations have explored the up scale application of ets this is because of the forbidding operating cost of electrochemical reactors which makes field scale applications still far from being realised the typical treatment cost of ets hybrid units and other advanced technologies reported in the literature is presented in table 5 the cost of catalyst and electrodes comprises the bulk of electrochemical reactor fabrication cost whereas the operating cost is chiefly due to the energy consumed in driving the electrochemical reactor kaur et al 2019 evaluated that ef oxidation of real textile wastewater incurred a charge of around 3 13 per m3 of wastewater which jumped to 5 76 for abating unit kg of cod this is much higher than the average cost of conventional wastewater treatment approximated to be about 0 28 m3 including nutrient removal molinos senante et al 2010 clearly at present maintenance and operation of electrochemically driven advanced oxidation of wastewater is quite taxing and still needs to bring down to compete with commercial wastewater treatment technologies since power tariffs and operation costs vary by location a more appropriate economic representation for the treatment cost of ets would be the amount of energy spent per unit of pollutant or kg of organics eliminated in this regard monteil et al 2019 approximated that a minimum of 0 39 w h energy will be consumed in subduing unit gram of toc from xenobiotics laden waste stream via ef and bef based treatments which is quite high and impractical for up scaled scenarios in addition the cost of electrode material is considered the most crucial capital expenditure in any ets the electrodes are susceptible to scaling leaching and corrosion under the influence of applied potential and need regular replacement brillas and garcia segura 2020 dos santos et al 2016 hence based on the lifetime of the specific electrode material an additional replacement charge must be accounted for while estimating the long term expenditure of these electrochemical systems stirling et al 2020 estimated that a ten fold reduction in the cost of bdd electrodes could vastly improve the affordability of et based reactors hence research efforts should be oriented towards decreasing the manufacturing cost of bdd electrodes and parallelly developing a cost effective substitute that can abet market implementation of these electrocatalytic devices furthermore the production of hazardous intermediates and metabolites as a result of partial mineralisation is a serious problem during the electrochemical degradation of biorefractory pollutants in one investigation when 20 mg l of bpa solution was treated using heterogeneous ef oxidation degradation intermediates like 4 isopropyl phenol phenol divinyloxyethane acetylacetone and isobutyric acid were identified in the effluent zhang et al 2020 likewise when the surfactant npeo breaks down degradation by products like 4 np and ethylene glycol are created that are more estrogenic than npeo itself da silva et al 2015 he et al 2020 these intermediates can further be mineralised into benign products like h2o and co2 by elongating the exposure time of the oxidation process nevertheless the mineralisation efficiency of eo and ef systems is limited by the pollutant concentration and hence the mineralisation efficiency reduces as the oxidation process progresses also when pollutant concentration becomes very less scavenging of reactive radicals takes place thus improvement in mineralisation efficiency is insignificant even after prolonged oxidation which makes the entire treatment uneconomical similar findings were reported when furosemide and ranitidine containing wastewater were subjected to oxidative degradation in a bio ef conjugated system it was observed that increasing the duration of electrolysis from one to eight hour inflated the treatment costs by five times for furosemide 56 82 and ranitidine 61 72 per unit gram toc removed olvera vargas et al 2016 hence in order to scale up these cutting edge treatment methods for widespread applications economic feasibility continues to be the prime objective prior to the discharge physicochemical characterisation of treated effluent should be conducted to identify any toxic intermediate by products that might have been formed due to the partial or incomplete oxidation of the target contaminants usually high end analytical devices such as liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms are employed to trace the degradation pathway of specific contaminants however while dealing with real wastewater where innumerable pollutants are present such an expensive analysis may not be economically viable in such scenarios a toxicity test can be used to estimate processed wastewater s ecotoxicity potential the microtox toxicity assay using vibrio fischeri is a standardised screening test that provides reliable results and has been employed to determine the toxicity of ef and eo treated biorefractory wastewater samples le et al 2017 phillips et al 2018 additionally the bioluminescence inhibition ratio higher value indicates greater toxicity can be calculated to quantify the toxicity of a wastewater sample alternatively green algae escherichia coli and several other microorganisms have also been used for estimating the toxicity and bioluminescence inhibition ratio of treated wastewater to a great effect ioannou ttofa et al 2019 wang et al 2018 6 life cycle analysis of electrochemical technologies to ensure the sustainable transition of technology it is necessary to determine the associated environmental impacts entailing its operation life cycle assessment lca is a tool that quantifies the environmental burden of a product or process for the entire working life and thus helps to select the alternative with the least impact on the ecosystem as far as ets are concerned most of the adverse effects are due to electricity consumption to illustrate for removing phenol from waste streams the ef process had the highest global warming potential gwp and ozone layer depletion potential odp when compared to adsorption and photocatalysis obviously because of excessive energy consumption magdy et al 2021 similarly the eo driven removal of perfluorooctanoic acids 1000 m3 wastewater was estimated to produce 84 9 kg co2 eq and 3 69 kg o3 eq which is significant in context to global warming and smog formation li et al 2022 moreover goyal and mondal 2022 concurred that electrode dissolution and power consumption were the two biggest contributors to gwp odp and fossil resource depletion in the ec process hence reducing the operational power demand is pivotal for elevating the environmental viability of these electrochemical systems in this respect efforts have been made to propel et via renewable sources like serra et al 2011 concluded that for degrading α methylphenylglycine the gwp and impacts in the terrestrial ecotoxicity category of solar driven photo fenton were at least seven folds and fourteen folds lower than that of the solar ef process respectively correspondingly the environmental penalty of the mfc powered bef process was found to be much milder than the eo of surfactant contaminated wastewater sathe et al 2021 some researchers have also advocated using heterogeneous fenton catalysts over homogenous catalysts as the former can reduce water footprint by up to 77 and have six folds less stress on marine life rodríguez et al 2016 further the deteriorating impacts of sludge generated in a homogeneous ef process can be reduced by recycling fe sludge as a heterogenous catalyst zhang et al 2022 nevertheless a more detailed assessment of environmental impacts needs to be undertaken for different configurations of individual and coupled et systems to understand the severity of impact in different environmental categories this feedback can then be utilised sustainably to mature electrochemically driven advanced oxidation technologies 7 future scope the ability of ao and ef processes to eliminate pollutants non selectively via in situ electrochemically produced oh makes them particularly effective in regulating the infiltration of emcs into hydric sources whereas the contaminant separation in ec is superior to that achieved in conventional chemical coagulation nonetheless these ets are merely laboratory showcases and have yet to prove their mettle in actual site applications the main problem with upscaling ets is the prohibitive power requirement and material cost to minimise these expenditures extensive research to develop affordable robust electrodes and efficient catalysts are necessary energy demand for operating ets can be subsidised through the use of renewable power sources the commercialisation of these esoteric technologies will be aided by more research on the comprehensive design of continuous flow energy efficient reactors for meeting practical requirements it is necessary to conduct more tests on pilot prototypes of ets to evaluate the behaviour of various cell characteristics and related operational challenges in the larger reactors this examination will contribute to a greater comprehension of the hydrodynamic and electrochemical behaviour of the degrading process which may be utilised to optimise electrochemical systems the analysis of the critical reactor components post experiment notably the electrodes can be investigated to unravel the reasons behind the performance drop understanding the deterioration of electrodes can aid in the development of more resilient electrodes with higher serviceability further leaching of the metallic anode is a persistent challenge faced in the eo and ef process which is usually mitigated through exorbitantly costly bdd and modified ti anodes this makes the electrochemical treatment of wastewater highly taxing also the technology readiness level of the anode based electrochemical treatment process is low 4 5 due to several operation difficulties encountered during up scaled experiments montiel et al 2021 hence more focus should be directed on searching for suitable cost effective anode materials for replacing expensive electrodes that will improve the technology readiness levels of ets taking them closer to full scale adaptation investigations have been conducted of late on coupled electrochemical systems such as the photo eo process photo ef process ef peroxi coagulation etc to enhance the removal of persistent pollutants li et al 2017 2021 thor et al 2020 these systems have exhibited improved performance though at the expense of increased power consumption and or chemical supplements an integrated system combining biological processes with ets may be a superior hybridisation strategy since it can lower both the total power consumption and electrolysis time in this context energy free fenton s oxidation of contaminants in mfc has emerged as a potential alternative to the power intensive ef process in addition ets make complex organic chemicals biodegradable as these are broken down into simpler intermediates this is a desirable pre treatment step before the wastewater is subjected to biological treatment a variety of combinations such as up flow anaerobic sludge bed eo sequencing batch reactor eo ec membrane filtration and sequencing batch reactor ef have been successfully applied for the elimination of resistant pollutants ganzenko et al 2020 vinduja and balasubramanian 2013 nevertheless a lack of comprehensive knowledge on the functionalities of bio et integrated systems may result in the un optimised operation of these hybrid units additional explorations into the intricate elements of hybrid systems may aid in circumventing ets obstacles and accelerate their adoption in existing wastewater treatment infrastructure 8 conclusion the occurrence of edcs in various water sources poses an impending danger to the well being of humans and aquatic life many edcs have been detected in natural hydric sources ranging from 740 μg l bpa in groundwater to 0 002 μg l bpa in river water persistent and prolonged vulnerability of edcs may have devastating health effects including hormonal malfunctioning dysfunction of reproductive organs malignancy obesity and developmental disorders in children among others conventional wastewater treatment facilities are not intended to remove edcs from wastewater and are thus the primary source of edc discharge into natural receiving waters these edcs can be readily eradicated from polluted water via et driven treatments as organic pollutants are non selectively attacked utilizing very powerful oh and other reactive species in such systems many investigations have reported complete degradation of edcs using electrochemically driven advanced oxidation techniques moreover the toc removal efficiency in most cases was greater than 90 which reflects the robustness of et based treatments in mineralising these recalcitrant contaminants nonetheless the widespread deployment of ets is hindered by their excessive operating costs and energy requirements in order to address obstacles faced during the operation and scalability of ets researchers have combined et with other aops and biological systems in this sense hybrid methods such as bef ef eo mbr ec ef etc have shown promise in the eradication of emcs nonetheless such infant technologies are crude and need further refinement

11703,emerging contaminants that can potentially impede the activity of the hormonal system of humans and other animals are referred to as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs apparently edcs are ubiquitous in our surroundings and through industrial and domestic waste streams get discharged into receiving water bodies even in trace concentrations these edcs can cause impairment of the reproductive system weaken immunity and cause child developmental disorders the extent of edcs pollution can be gauged by their identification at an alarming rate in rivers coastal regions and even subsurface aquifers the evident fiasco of conventional treatment in suppressing pollution of edc has provoked the development of electrochemical techniques such as electrochemical oxidation electrocoagulation electro fenton process and other electrochemical technologies ets these neoteric technologies are conveniently operated with minimal dependency on external chemicals manageable sludge generation and display superior degradation kinetics therefore ets are appropriate for mineralising pollutants of stubborn and recalcitrant nature though effective the techno economic assessment has revealed that et driven wastewater treatment is expensive compared to traditional biological processes additionally the life cycle analysis of these electrochemical devices has anticipated adverse environmental effects the operation of et is taxing mainly due to the cost of electrode material and power required for driving the electrochemical reactor thus this review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the usability and viability of ets for removing edcs from polluted water and plausible strategies to bring the treatment cost to competitive levels graphical abstract image 1 keywords electro fenton process emerging contaminants endocrine disrupting compounds electrochemical technologies life cycle analysis wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction every new material and technological innovation is inevitably accompanied by the emergence of unique waste products and pollutants as these pollutants are freshly found have novel sources and are either partly controlled or unregulated by relevant agencies they are typically referred to as emerging contaminants emcs the occurrence of emcs in aquatic environment is widespread and catalogued by many scientists behera et al 2011 hughes et al 2013 based on their source these emcs are further split into three categories a personal care items b pharmaceuticals and c endocrine disrupting compounds edcs gogoi et al 2018 the edcs are the most minacious of these three categories of emcs owing to their intrinsic capacity to disrupt hormonal balance which leads to the development of grievous health issues any natural or man made chemical compound that mimics and interferes with the regular functioning of the endocrine system of the human body is referred to as an edc kabir et al 2015 plastics food packaging building materials cosmetics and hygiene commodities pharmaceuticals herbicides insecticides etc include edcs such as parabens bisphenol a bpa phthalates estrone e1 triclosan tcs estradiol and estriol e3 dodge et al 2015 monneret 2017 extensive usage of these commodities has accumulated edcs in the environment particularly in natural hydric sources multiple cases of edcs contamination in rivers lakes oceans and subsurface water have come to light which is mostly attributable to insufficient effluent treatment facilities in industries su et al 2020 vymazal et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 subsurface water contamination is often caused by the percolation of dirty water into subterranean aquifers and it is frequently found in places near to polluted surface water sources for instance francisco et al 2019 detected the presence of different agricultural chemicals like malathion diuron atrazine etc in the groundwater wells in brazil revealing the deleterious impact of agricultural runoff on the groundwater quality owing to their ecotoxicological effects the prolonged presence of edcs in the surrounding ecosystem presents an immediate hazard to natural biota most edcs are known to cause chronic health issues such as hormone imbalance impairment of brain functioning congenital anomalies and improper development in infants monneret 2017 in addition exposure to edcs may induce malignancy in the breast obesity diabetes and infertility jambor et al 2017 nohynek et al 2013 similar detrimental effects of edcs on animals and aquatic biotas have been recorded including weakening of immunity malfunction of endocrine glands and genitals and tumour formation casanova nakayama et al 2011 xie et al 2018 therefore it is essential to eliminate edcs from domestic and industrial effluents in order to safeguard the natural ecosystem from these detrimental consequences typical wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not designed to tackle edcs hence conventional wwtps exhibit insufficient edc abatement in addition the complex nature of edcs makes them unamenable to bio based secondary treatments such as activated sludge process trickling filters anaerobic reactors etc de oliveira et al 2020 koumaki et al 2021 samal et al 2022 even so a certain degree of emc attenuation can be offered by bioremediation processes like constructed wetlands chowdhury et al 2022 nevertheless such treatment can become ineffective at higher emcs concentrations matamoros et al 2017 moreover edcs have been eliminated using sophisticated treatment techniques such as adsorption membrane filtration and advanced oxidation processes aops sun et al 2017 vieira et al 2020 electrochemical technologies ets including electrochemical oxidation eo electro fenton process ef electrocoagulation ec electro flotation process etc have emerged as an effective and eco friendly technique for removing emcs from polluted water the low chemical dependency low land footprint minimised sludge generation faster degradation kinetics and efficacy in oxidising varieties of chemical compounds make ets a lucrative prospect in the abatement of edcs the ets can eliminate the target biorefractory compounds by completely mineralising them into benign by products and harmless inorganic species the removal mechanism may involve anodic oxidation ao i e direct oxidation at the anode surface and mediated oxidation via reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl radical oh during eo and ef in ec rather than degrading contaminants are skimmed from top or settled at the bottom plenty of research findings advocate that eo ef and ec are efficient in removing emcs from wastewater such as parabens caffeine heavy metals phenols antibiotics beta blockers and dyes among others das and nandi 2022 raj et al 2021 such favourable outcome deems ets as a viable choice for treating edcs and other potentially toxic micropollutant laden wastewater the mechanism of edcs degradation by eo has been deciphered in the article by luna and bensalah though this review only revolves around boron doped diamond bdd anodes and eludes other electro chemical configurations de luna and bensalah 2022 hence in this article recent developments in edcs degradation using electrochemically driven oxidation techniques have been tracked the operational parameters that govern the contaminant removal efficiency of ets have been critically analysed to highlight the optimum working environment of each technology in order to assess economic viability a concise cost comparison between conventional treatment advanced oxidation systems and ets has also been presented to supplement environmental cost associated with the operation of these electrochemical systems is also incorporated further strategies for integrating ets with contemporary treatment technologies for economical operation are briefly discussed to the best of our knowledge such a comprehensive review on et driven edc abatement is not available in the literature the impending research gaps abstaining from field scale application of these technologies have been specified future research can be directed to address these impending lacunas so that ets can live up to its full potential 2 endocrine disrupting compounds occurrence and ecotoxicity according to who an edc is an extrinsic substance or combination that affects the functions of the endocrine system and subsequently causes adverse impacts on mammals and other organisms the edcs can thereby disrupt hormone biosynthesis metabolism or function which alters normal homeostatic regulation or reproduction generally edcs are classified into two categories synthetic compounds or industrial solvents lubricants and natural compounds diamanti kandarakis et al 2009 synthetic compounds comprise fungicides vinclozolin plasticizers phthalates insecticides dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane methoxychlor and different pharmaceutical compounds diethylstilbestrol moreover endocrine disruptors can also be produced by natural compounds present in human and animal food such as phytoestrogens like genistein and coumestrol nonetheless scientists also proposed a product based taxonomy of edcs classifying them into three groups based on the commodities in which they are utilised notably pesticides or insecticides industrial by products and food contact materials peña guzmán et al 2019 therefore edcs are widely categorised into the following six primary classes in this article to facilitate understanding and take into account the varied character of these substances such as i pesticides ii phenolic compounds iii phthalates iv paraben compounds v steroid estrogens and vi estrogenic heavy metals hence the following sub sections cover the prevalence ecotoxicity and health risks of these various groups of edcs 2 1 endocrine disrupting compounds present in the aquatic system as edcs are omnipresent in day to day products like personal care products packet foods plastic containers medications and other items human exposure is almost inescapable unfortunately most of these compounds eventually travel through different paths to reach the natural aquatic systems fig 1 and adversely affect the human body and other living organisms the occurrence of these edcs in various aquatic habitats has been briefed in table 1 basically edcs are not amenable to biological metabolism and therefore released in the receiving water bodies in undegraded or partially degraded form along with the treated effluent of wwtps previous investigations have confirmed the existence of edcs and their metabolites in sewage sludge and treated effluent of wwtps operating at different geological locations table 2 as an example pothitou and voutsa 2008 revealed that the influent of a sewage treatment plant stp in greece had 1 574 μg l of 4 nonylphenol 4 np and 0 445 μg l of tcs moreover according to a mass balance analysis of edcs entering and departing a wwtp in xiamen china up to 42 2 g of edcs entered the wwtp daily an estimated 6 15 g of edcs were ejected with the effluent and 7 60 g got accumulated in the settled sludge ashfaq et al 2018 therefore different edcs and other synthetic compounds should be substantially removed prior to the discharge of wastewater into natural water bodies furthermore a large amount of edcs have been detected in sludge collected from aerobic treatment units ashfaq et al 2018 therefore it implies that instead of biodegradation the mass removal mechanism in such systems occurs through the phase transition of pollutants via adsorption on the sludge surface for example an average of 71 μg g of di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp 4 3 μg g of di n butyl phthalate and 22 μg g of diisononyl phthalate were detected in sludge collected from 40 wwtps in korea lee et al 2019 likewise after secondary treatment the cumulative amount of phthalates ranging from 7 4 μg g to 138 6 μg g was observed in sludge during the investigation of seven treatment plants in taiwan dong et al 2020 however wwtps equipped with advanced tertiary treatment such as uv and ozonation units may report a significantly lower concentration of micropollutants in the final effluent to elucidate a 96 reduction in methylparaben mp concertation was observed in the treated effluent initial concentration 721 ng l of a wwtp in china ma et al 2018 even though the bulk of mp was removed in the secondary anaerobic oxic units the treated effluent had 113 ng l of mp which was further reduced to 28 7 ng l following the uv disinfection process ma et al 2018 this is in coherence with the finding of dhaka et al 2017 and dhaka et al 2018 wherein uv mediated aops were effective in mineralising paraben compounds to add further in one investigation benotti et al 2009 reported the existence of tcs 0 001 μg l bpa 0 025 μg l and nonylphenol np 0 1 μg l in potable water supply in the united states of america thus evidencing the vulnerability of the human population towards edcs in addition other noxious edcs including parabens 4 np e1 bpa 4 tert octylphenol 4 t op alkylphenol compounds etc are also frequently perceived in natural water sources farmlands and groundwaters li et al 2015 a probe for assessing anthropogenic pollutants in domestic effluents identified different phthalate esters such as dibutyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate with concentrations of 1 57 μg l and 4 77 μg l respectively in residential greywater obtained from chennai india delhiraja and philip 2020 to support further 5 82 μg l of tcs 11 08 μg l of bpa and 5 96 μg l of np were also found in this household greywater sample delhiraja and philip 2020 more appallingly renganathan et al 2021 discovered 10 39 ng l 205 62 ng l and 28 51 ng l of tcs carbamazepine and diclofenac respectively in cauvery river the principal source of freshwater for several states in southern india in natural streams organic contaminants are susceptible to the natural degradation process however the undegraded fraction may get entrapped in sediments and reside in the environment for a much longer duration koumaki et al 2018 this increases the exposure risk and can lead to bioaccumulation edcs in aquatic flora and fauna for instance an average concentration of 40 92 μg g and 5 98 μg g of bpa and np respectively was discovered in the hepatic tissue of fishes in the pearl river in south china lv et al 2019 furthermore a maximum of 8 03 μg l of carbamazepine was detected in the magdalena river in colombia while fish collected from the same river contained 32 0 μg kg and 90 8 μg kg of mp and carbamazepine respectively zhao et al 2019 hence it has been conclusively proven that the bioaccumulation of edc and other xenobiotic compounds in aquatic microorganisms is significantly higher than the concentration of those compounds in the environment increasing the risk of human exposure in regard to groundwater polluted surface water can also contaminate adjacent aquifers which becomes a serious concern when the groundwater is extracted for potable usage to illustrate sharma and co researcher detected more than 15 emcs in groundwater samples of the ganga river basin which included edcs like tcs 10 2 ng l and triclocarban 2 055 ng l sharma et al 2019 in a similar vein oceans are the sink for natural drainage systems and inevitably become contaminated thus causing detrimental impacts on aquatic lifespan for instance seawater of the coastal iberian region was found to have bpa values ranging from 0 020 μg l to 0 054 μg l while the concentration of np was detected at amounts between 0 031 μg l and 0 056 μg l salgueiro gonzález et al 2019 also high amounts of dehp diethyl phthalate dep and dibutyl phthalate dbp were identified in the seawater of kuwait with the highest concentration of 2 91 μg l 0 52 μg l and 1 22 μg l respectively salgueiro gonzález et al 2019 hence prompt action is required to alleviate the concentration of edcs from natural water bodies and prevent further recontamination 2 2 ecotoxicity and adverse health impacts of endocrine disrupting compounds primarily hormones utilise diverse chemical and biological cues to keep the intracellular homeostasis of an organism moreover the regular operation of the endocrine system can be interfered due to edcs by producing inadvertent exogenous chemical signals in the organism s cell as a result endocrine disruption can have a variety of detrimental health effects and fatal illnesses including diabetes obesity polycystic ovary syndrome breast cancer and other chronic diseases table 3 hence the accumulation of edcs in the aquatic system is considered as a superior toxicological consequence than other emcs hamid et al 2021 it is also believed that the edcs can intrude into immune system of fish through tainted food disrupting normal sex hormone activity and increasing vulnerability to pathogens milla et al 2011 similar changes were noticed in the immune responses of intertidal mud crab and chironomid larvae as per the literature aberrant cellular development also occurred in mud crab and chironomid larvae with exposure to 1 30 μg l and 100 μg l of bpa and dehp respectively park et al 2019 park and kwak 2010 likewise sun and liu 2017 also reported that embryotic malformations were observed in zebrafish after exposing them to up to 0 6 mg l of butyl benzyl phthalate extending further researchers also revealed that np is more hazardous than its parent compound nonylphenol ethoxylates npeo this is evident from the fact that np lethal concentration 24 h 50 for inhibiting soil nematode namely caenorhabditis elegans was 70 folds less than that of npeo 1916 14 mg l de la parra guerra and olivero verbel 2020 also tato et al observed that 4 np had higher toxicity compared to tcs and bpa for alga isochrysis galbana for the half maximal effective concentration ec50 of 24 1 μg l 34 μg l and 1 21 mg l for 4 np tcs and bpa respectively tato et al 2018 the complex structural make up of np may consist of twenty distinct isomers or more makes it challenging to anticipate health repercussions on vulnerable species soares et al 2008 furthermore the edcs also trigger severe health issues in humans such as birth deformities chromosomal disorders congenital malformation infertility and so on also the balance of thyroid and reproductive hormones in pregnant women is destabilized by the presence of parabens and phenols moreover mp and butylparaben bp elevate the level of sexual hormone binding globulin and thyroxin by 7 70 and 5 64 respectively in exposed patients whilst bpa 2 5 dichlorophenol and 2 4 dichlorophenol have the potential to reduce the level of progesterone aker et al 2016 similar findings were also observed in urine and semen specimens collected from 105 men in milan italy the maximum bpa concentration was found to be 0 10 μg g of creatinine along with 10 69 μg g and 19 3 μg g of creatinine dehp and mono n butyl phthalate respectively caporossi et al 2020 dichloro diphenyl dichloro ethylene is one of the significant prevalent metabolites of noxious dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane ddt that induces abnormal function of androgens activity by reacting with the hormone causing diabetes lind and lind 2018 research has been conducted on the effect of edcs exposure during pregnancy of women according to yang et al 2019 edcs can reach the placenta and impede the development of the embryo by harming cognitive impairments further zhang et al 2021 emphasized that preconception exposure of parents to phenols and phthalates elevates the chance of pregnancy complications by altering the level of sex hormones paraben preservatives are a common ingredient in many personal care products and cosmetics they are in the category of potentially carcinogenic materials this tenet was reinforced when amin et al 2019 detected paraben compounds in the malignant breast tissues of a patient to add further the vulnerability of the mother to parabens during pregnancy may onset obesity in the child leppert et al 2020 there is no denying the fact that endocrine disruption induced by edcs is one of the greatest threats to humans and the environment past research has linked exposure to edcs to the escalation of health issues and if left unregulated in the environment these xenobiotics chemicals might have a permanent negative impact on the ecosystem 3 different electrochemical technologies to remediate edcs the deleterious impacts of edcs and other similar hazardous contaminants on the aquatic biota necessitate the development of advanced treatment technologies such as ets to suppress xenobiotic pollution of natural water sources in respect of edcs mitigation from contaminated water different ets have displayed meritorious performance table 4 most of the ets rely on the in situ production of extremely potent oh to carry out the non selective mineralisation of organic contaminants present in wastewater in fact the inherent ability to generate reactive species electrochemically in the solution is the most distinguishable feature of ets which sets it apart from other advanced oxidation techniques though oh can abate a broad variety of organic contaminants in the aqueous medium they are transient average half life 20 ns and non selective which may escalate scavenging secondary reactions especially in diluted wastewater with very low pollutant concentration as an alternative employing persulfate in an advanced electrochemical oxidation process make use of relatively stable sulphate radical so4 having an average half life in the range of 30 40 μs and it is more selective towards organic pollutants scaria and nidheesh 2022 besides the presence of these major radicals many supplementary reactive species such as hypochlorous acid hocl cl2 and s2o8 2 may also participate in the removal mechanism of organics depending on their availability in the electrolyte it s apparent that the removal mechanism and kinetics of contaminants in any electrochemical system are a function of the reactive species involved in the oxidation process for example in fenton based processes oh is the dominating reactive species whereas in ec and persulfate oxidation pollutants are subdued majorly via metal hydroxides and so4 respectively diverse pollutant removal mechanisms driven by different electrogenerated reactive species can be visualised in fig 2 nonetheless oh employing electrochemical systems such as eo and ef remains the most representative technologies among numerous existing ets a brief discussion on the working mechanism and removal of edcs by the well established ets is presented in the subsequent section 3 1 electrochemical oxidation pollutant removal in eo can be accomplished through direct oxidation and or indirect oxidation mechanism usually the direct eo process is often termed ao as the oxidation of organic contaminant occurs by exchanging of electrons between the anode and the target compound directly eq 1 whereas indirect eo is facilitated by anodically generated reactive oxidising species such as oh hocl and sulphate ions so4 2 formation of oh results from water splitting at the anode at higher potential eq 2 while inorganic salts such as nacl and na2so4 present in the wastewater get oxidised at the anode to form reactive chlorine species and so4 2 in the solution ambauen et al 2020 the steps involved in the formation of different reactive species and subsequent degradation of pollutant in anode facilitated oxidation is depicted in fig 3 1 r ze oxidised product 2 h2o oh h e e 2 80 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she 3 mox oh mox 1 h e 4 mox 1 r mox ro 5 mox oh r co2 h2o h e where r represents the contaminant z is the number of electrons mox oh is anodic bonded oh and mox 1 denotes higher metal oxide depending on the characteristics of the anode material the electrochemically generated oh may be loosely bonded physisorption or strongly bonded chemisorption to the anode surface ganiyu et al 2021 the chemisorped oh formation is observed over so called active electrodes that have a low potential for oxygen evolution under applied potential titanium platinum ruthenium dioxide graphite and other active anodes form higher metal oxides at their surface by reacting with oh that is responsible for mediating contaminant oxidation eq 3 and eq 4 in contrast the so called non active electrodes have large overpotential for oxygen evolution that allows generation of physisorbed oh that can directly target the contaminant molecules eq 5 the physisorbed oh is more potent oxidant than the chemisorbed oh therefore non active anode driven eo is considered more effective in subduing recalcitrant compounds in wastewater to highlight at a current density of 50 ma cm2 15 min of reaction time was sufficient to completely eliminate 0 5 mg l of butyl paraben bp using a bdd anode pueyo et al 2020 meanwhile only 40 and 18 of bp could be degraded when stainless steel ss and pt anodes were employed respectively under identical operating conditions pueyo et al 2020 the physisorbed oh produced over the non active bdd anode reacts directly with the mp resulting in rapid removal kinetics apparently chemisorbed oh produced on the surface of active pt and ss anodes limited the degradation rate of mp moreover in the case of active electrodes the oxidation of organics is carried out by the higher metal oxides which can only occur in the vicinity of the anode this makes the ao process dependent on the mass transfer of the target pollutant from the bulk solution to the anode surface also the mineralisation efficiency of active anode suffers because oh higher metal oxide availability is confined to a relatively narrow anode water interface for instance the eo of 100 mg l mp solution using ti ru based dimensionally stable anode was completed in just 40 min of reaction time however the active anode could only subdue 36 of total organic carbon toc steter et al 2016 obviously the low toc removal reflects partial degradation of mp which corroborates the poor mineralisation ability of active anode materials undoubtedly bdd anodes perform exceptionally well in treating wastewater though their exorbitant cost prohibits wider applications alternatively cheaper electrodes fabricated using pbo2 and sno2 have displayed great promise as an effective inactive anode in the eo process in a comparative investigation the pbo2 anode was able to mineralise 70 of norfloxacin which was only 20 less than the mineralisation efficiency of the bdd anode sánchez montes et al 2018 however the anodes fabricated with pbo2 are not very stable at high current densities making them prone to leaching the poor durability of cheaper inactive anode makes their long term operation questionable another instrumental parameter influencing the efficiency of eo is the concentration of supplementing electrolytes in the wastewater these supporting electrolytes not only increase the conductivity of the electrolyte medium but also generate additional reactive species in the bulk solution that can help with pollutant removal martínez huitle and panizza 2018 the same phenomenon was also demonstrated by fajardo et al 2017 by supplementing the bulk solution with 10 g l of nacl during eo process augmenting bulk solution with nacl resulted in the complete removal of six phenolic compounds 3 4 5 trimethoxybenzoic acids 4 hydroxybenzoic acids gallic acids protocatechuic acids and veratric acids anode ti ruo2 initial concentration each compound 100 mg l the removal efficiency for the phenolic compounds dropped to a mere 30 when nacl was replaced by 10 g l of na2so4 fajardo et al 2017 the poor removal efficiency in the case of na2so4 could be explained by the formation of weaker s2o8 2 ions at the anode that were not effective in degrading phenol in contrast the nacl gets oxidised at the anode to produce active chlorine species such as cl2 hclo and ocl which are more powerful oxidants than s2o8 2 bosio et al 2020 zambrano and min reported corroborative findings during the electrochemical degradation of phenol initial concentration of 100 mg l ti mesh electrodes a 9 5 times higher removal efficiency 98 21 for phenol was attained by using 10 g l of nacl as a supporting electrolyte instead of na2so4 zambrano and min 2019 current density is the most critical determinant in the edc degradation efficiency of eo processes as it directly determines the rate at which oh is generated on the anode surface periyasamy and muthuchamy 2018 chen and co workers observed that during eo of 40 mg l dbp solution using ss cathode and pbo2 anode removal efficiency raised from 56 65 to 74 4 when the current density was elevated from 20 ma cm2 to 50 ma cm2 for an electrolysis period of 8 h chen et al 2022 undeniably at higher current densities degradation rate of contaminants is accelerated owing to the rapid electrogeneration of oh however a careful manipulation is required while tuning current density on electrodes because beyond a limiting applied current or voltage degradation of pollutants doesn t depend on the charge transfer actually when the current density on electrodes is sufficiently high the degradation kinetics of eo is limited by the mass transfer of pollutants monteil et al 2019 also many undesirable side reaction that occurs at elevated current supply decline the energy efficiency of the eo process turan et al 2020 additionally the degradation rate is also limited by the mass transfer rate of the concerned pollutant towards the anode s vicinity which doesn t increase beyond certain values even at higher current densities for example increasing the current density above 15 ma cm2 has an insignificant effect on the electrochemical degradation rate constant of 5 mg l of tetracycline due to the limiting mass transfer rate at elevated current densities wang et al 2018 the initial concentration of contaminant in the bulk solution can also influence the rate of degradation and removal efficiency during the eo treatment shen and co workers found that with an increase in the initial concentration from 700 μg l to 1000 μg l the removal efficiency dipped from 92 to 39 for a 4 h of eo experiment using ti based electrodes shen et al 2017 likewise the degradation rate constant of the pesticide thiamethoxam reduced from 0 73 min to 0 05 min when the initial concentration was raised from 1 mg l to 10 mg l lebik elhadi et al 2018 it s evident that the reaction kinetic of eo is dictated by the initial concentration of the pollutant and therefore should be considered while designing an efficient flow through electrochemical reactor lebik elhadi et al 2018 indeed the eo process is an effective method for abatement edcs and can evolve as a promising et for the removal of hazardous micropollutants present in wastewater 3 2 electrocoagulation the ec is an innovative electrochemical method that combines electrochemistry with coagulation and floatation for abating a wide variety of organic matter microorganisms and emcs from wastewater fig 4 during the initial stage of this electrochemical process metal ions released from an anode electrode produce coagulants which are then destabilized by neutralising the surface charge hold by contaminants and other fine suspended particles in water neutralisation of repulsive forces causes the suspended particles to clump together into flocs followed by their elimination through sedimentation meunier et al 2006 the charge moving through the cell dictates the amount of coagulant generated electrochemically during the ec process and can be approximated using faraday s law of electrolysis eq 6 ingelsson et al 2020 the efficiency of the ec process is often evaluated in terms of faradaic efficiency which is the ratio of actual coagulant mass produced during the experiment over the theoretically predicted coagulant mass eq 7 6 t h e o r e t i c a l c o a g u l a n t m a s s p r o d u c e d i t m z f 7 f a r a d i c e f f i c i e n c y a c t u a l c o a g u l a n t t h e o r e t i c a l c o a g u l a n t 100 z f m i t m 100 where i is the current intensity a t is the duration of electrolysis s m denotes the molar mass of the metal g mol m is the actual mass of metal coagulant g z is the metal valence and f stands for faraday s constant 96 485 c mol compared to traditional chemical coagulation or flocculation processes the ec method offers a number of benefits for example the addition of external chemical coagulants and polyelectrolytes is avoided as coagulants are produced in situ electrochemically in ec the sacrificial anode is used as a source for the dissolution of metal cations and the cathode is involved in the production of oh ions and h2 eq 8 to eq 12 shahedi et al 2020 also the electrochemically produced pristine coagulants result in much lower sludge formation as compared to chemical precipitation brillas and martínez huitle 2015 iron and aluminium electrodes are among the most commonly adopted sacrificial anodes in the electrochemically driven coagulation process the high dissolution rate at lower poised potentials non toxicity and ample production of hydroxides polymeric hydroxides and oxyhydroxides make fe and al electrodes an obvious choice for ec the rate of coagulants produced during ec can be optimised by regulating electrode current density to yield maximum separation of even trace pollutants from the wastewater to elucidate cook et al 2016 witnessed 81 66 64 63 61 and 56 decrease in the concentration of np bpa17α ethinyl estradiol ee2 17β estradiol e2 e1 and e3 post aluminium based ec treatment of real municipal wastewater spiked with mentioned estrogenic edcs maximum 61 63 56 64 66 and 81 of e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa and np respectively were removed from municipal wastewater spiked with these six types of edcs via ec reaction at the anode 8 fe s fe 2 aq 2e 9 4fe s 4fe 2 aq 8e 10 al s al 3 aq 3e reaction at the cathode 11 2h2o 2e h2 g 2oh 12 8h 8e 4h2 g likewise symonds et al 2015 subjected tertiary treated municipal wastewater to an aluminium anode fitted benchtop ec reactor to remove residual contaminants and nutrients the ec processed had 78 less concentration of personal care products ibuprofen iopromide gemfibrozil acetaminophen salicylic acid deet triclocarban and tcs while the microbial density shrunk by a 7 log scale for domestic wastewater utilizing a benchtop ec unit as far as the nutrient is concerned nitrate and nitrite combined initial concentration 191 μg l concentration came down by 50 whereas more than 95 of phosphate initial concentration 375 μg l was subdued symonds et al 2015 therefore these findings serve as an example of how ec may be used to successfully remove a variety of edcs and other micropollutants from industrial and domestic wastewater the crucial determinants affecting the performance of ec are electrode material inter electrode gap current density electrolyte conductivity and the initial ph of the solution the applied current density on electrodes governs the dissociation of metal ions from the anode hakizimana et al 2017 though the current density applied in ec depends upon the nature and type of wastewater being treated it typically varies in the range from 0 001 ma cm2 to 88 ma cm2 tahreen et al 2020 moreover current density also impacts the production rate and sizes of bubbles which in turn influences the growth of flocs ramyaa et al 2019 during an ec investigation using aluminium electrodes an increase in applied current density from 2 5 ma cm2 to 12 5 ma cm2 improved the removal of fungicide propiconazole initial concentration of 25 93 mg l from 50 to 60 shadmehr et al 2019 the increased removal efficiency at higher current density was ascribed to the higher dissolution of al ions in the solution that resulted in greater floc formation shadmehr et al 2019 however the excessive current may deteriorate the efficiency of ec by instigating unwanted secondary reactions while releasing a surplus concentration of coagulants that can cause charge reversal of the colloids and reduce the serviceability of the electrodes ingelsson et al 2020 hence optimising current density is imperative to a successful ec operation inter electrode distance is another key parameter for optimising ec operation a large electrode gap can be maintained for effluent with high electrical conductivity and weakly conductive effluents should be operated at a lower electrode gap to reduce power consumption shahedi et al 2020 a wider gap between the electrodes can lead to a delay in floc formation and incur higher power consumption to facilitate the movement of ions between the electrodes on the other hand a very less distance between the anode and cathode can disrupt the formation of metal hydroxide due to high electrostatic attraction khandegar and saroha 2013 in this regard chen and co workers observed that while ec pre treatment of high strength swine wastewater with initial chemical oxygen demand cod of 5500 mg l 50 6 removal of cod was attained after 35 min reaction time with an inter electrode distance of 2 cm and the cod removal reduced by 4 5 and 3 when the electrode gap was 3 cm and 1 cm respectively chen et al 2021 the higher cod removal at the inter electrode distance of 2 cm was because of the enhanced mass transfer caused by the turbulence created during the electrocoagulation process similarly in ec the solubility and nature of the coagulating species are governed by the ph of the bulk solution garcia segura et al 2017 the ec is more effective in mildly acidic electrolytes than in an alkaline environment for example phenol initial concentration 2 5 mg l removal efficiency dropped from 92 at ph of 2 0 to 38 at ph of 10 0 during a fe electrode driven ec treatment vasudevan 2014 the inferior performance at higher ph can be attributed to the formation of disadvantageous fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 that hinder phenol precipitation while in an acidic environment dissolved fe ii ions can instigate fenton type reaction that can abet phenol mineralisation vasudevan 2014 this limitation can be overcome by manoeuvring the type of coagulating species being generated during ec operation as an instance coupled ec with the eo process can boost the production of fe oh 3 and al oh 3 thus resulting in an efficient coagulation of phenol öztürk et al 2019 nonetheless the cod of ec treated effluent is much higher than the prescribed reusability standards and hence it is not suitable to recycle it for domestic or industrial uses tahreen et al 2020 therefore ec treatment is often integrated with different technologies to attain high quality effluent through hybrid systems such as ec aops ec membrane ec biological treatment etc tahreen et al 2020 malakootian and heidari achieved 100 phenol removal and 98 of cod mitigation for real steel industry wastewater influent cod of 880 mg l with a phenol content of 50 mg l by combined ec photo fenton treatment malakootian and heidari 2018 such ameliorated performance of integrated ec systems has developed a lot of optimism among researchers especially for tackling wastewater containing recalcitrant pollutants 3 3 electro fenton treatment for the disruption of edcs the eo or ao processes rely solely on the anode electrode and the cathode in such electrochemical systems has a trivial role in contaminant degradation electrochemical systems in which both anode and cathode electrochemistry are exploited usually exhibit superior performance than the anode based ets among cathode driven electrochemical systems for wastewater remediation the most established technique is the ef process unlike eo in ef based technologies homogeneous oxidants are produced that facilitate the degradation of pollutants in the bulk solution initially h2o2 was added externally along with a catalytic amount of fe ii to initiate the famous fenton reaction eq 13 to eq 14 however later it was discovered that carbonaceous cathode could take advantage of electrochemistry to produce h2o2 in situ through two electron reduction of o2 ganiyu et al 2018 generally during the ef treatment oxidation of organic contaminants eq 16 is mediated by electrochemically generated heterogeneous oh in the vicinity of the anode surface fig 5 simultaneously the catalytic activation of h2o2 in the presence of fe ii ions generates homogeneous oh in the wastewater matrix eq 14 trapido et al 2009 13 o2 2h 2e h2o2 e 0 68 v vs she 14 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh k 76 mol s e 0 67 v vs she 15 fe3 e fe2 16 oh edcs by products h2o moreover oh generated by h2o2 and ferrous salts during fenton s oxidation process has a high oxidation potential to mineralise the toxic edcs effectively therefore the production rate of h2o2 the concentration of fe ii properties of contaminants and solution ph significantly affect the ef process s efficacy surplus production of oh in the ef system has made it possible to treat concentrated wastewater laden with recalcitrant pollutants with appreciable efficiency for instance ef degradation using iron electrodes accomplished 99 1 removal of 4 mg l of dimethyl phthalate dolatabadi et al 2021 in contrast to eo the cathode material is a crucial determinant in the ef process in this veneration carbonaceous cathodes are preferred in ef treatment because they suppress four electron pathways and favour the two electron route for reducing o2 to yield h2o2 application of carbon cathodes warrants uninterrupted production of h2o2 as a consequence the requisite level of oh radical is sustained in the wastewater for oxidising the target refractory compounds rosales et al 2018 found out that 60 min of reaction time was adequate for totally degrading 100 mg l of mp via ef treatment whereas eo of mp employing bdd anode and carbon felt cathode took twice the time required during ef greater concentration of oh also means that pollutants are not only degraded rather mineralised to innocuous inorganics the concurrent observation was made while degrading of 20 mg l of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid using bdd electrodes wherein ef treatment attained 20 high toc removal than the eo process 49 cai et al 2020 to boost in situ h2o2 production a variety of carbon based materials such as graphite carbon cloth carbon felt etc have been thoroughly examined an extended investigation was conducted by sopaj et al 2020 on the efficacy of different commercially available carbonaceous electrodes for expediting the reduction of o2 by two electrons for enhanced h2o2 generation a maximum h2o2 concentration of 40 8 mg l and 102 mg l at an optimised current of 50 ma and ph of 3 0 was denoted in the case of carbon felt and carbon sponge cathodes respectively this probe made it clear that cathodes fabricated using highly porous carbon materials are advocated for application in the ef process the macrostructure of carbon electrodes with high porosity can bond with oxygen in ooh which favours h2o2 generation on the cathode surface that is further catalysed to oh thereby boosting the elimination of edcs in the ef process however the dull rate of h2o2 production and stringent control of solution ph in the range of 2 5 3 5 is the stunting disadvantages of the classical ef process complexation of fe occurs at higher ph along with the decomposition of h2o2 eq 17 which combinedly reduces the efficiency of the ef process dolatabadi et al 2021b alternatively when ph of the solution drops below 3 0 a dip in contaminant removal rate is observed ascribing to the limiting concentration of oh caused due to formation of oxonium ions a less potent radical species and scavenging effect of h eq 18 to eq 20 dolatabadi et al 2021a dolatabadi et al 2021b chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta tripolyphosphate etc have been used to prevent the precipitation of fe ions at circumneutral ph conditions during ef treatment deng et al 2020 furthermore the application of heterogeneous fenton s catalysts such as pyrite chalcopyrite etc has made it possible to operate the ef process under neutral and circumneutral ph ganiyu et al 2018 catalysts favouring the two electron reduction of oxygen are often applied in conjugation with an iron onto the cathode to enhance h2o2 generation that would subsequently produce copious amounts of homogenous oh in the bulk solution for instance 2 38 mg l of oh was detected after 60 min of electrolysis during heterogenous ef treatment of tetracycline using 80 mg l of fe2o3 ceo2 composite catalyst whereas only 0 51 mg l of oh was formed in the ao process without any catalyst for the same experimentation time zhang et al 2022 the generation of oh in such abundance causes rapid degradation of intractable edcs and drastically reduces the electrolysis period in a similar investigation 40 mg l of cofe2o4 catalysts resulted in 98 1 removal of 10 mg l of 2 4 dichlorophenol by employing a heterogenous ef process in 120 min wang et al 2021 thus the heterogenous ef process seems to be a feasible alternative for avoiding factitious regulation of electrolyte ph 17 2h2o2 2h2o o2 18 h2o2 h h3o2 19 h2o2 fe3 ho2 h fe2 20 oh h e h2o cell parameters like applied current density and initial pollutant concentration have a similar effect on the removal efficiency of the ef process as observed in eo due to analogous electrochemistry of both the ets in accordance a 5 min reaction time was required to completely oxidise 19 24 mg l of fungicide thiram via ef oxidation bdd anode at an applied current of 300 ma while almost twice the time was taken at an applied current of 50 ma under identical operating conditions thus affirming the positive effect of applied current on the degradation kinetics of pollutants mbaye et al 2022 the higher degradation rates at elevated applied current can be attributed to rapid generation of h2o2 at the cathode helping in the swifter formation of oh in large numbers availability of oh in more significant numbers certainly increases the opportunity of radical pollutant interaction leading to rapid mineralisation notably further expanding the current beyond 300 ma has an adverse effect on the degradation kinetics of pollutants it is believed that applying current above optimum during ef oxidation triggers many parasitic electrochemical reactions such as hydrogen evolution at the cathode and reduction of h2o2 to h2o that severely impacts the current efficiency of the treatment process mbaye et al 2022 hence operating the ef system at optimum current density is crucial for achieving higher removal efficiency of edcs and reducing power consumption the type of supporting electrolyte used in the ef system can also have a substantial impact on the overall removal efficiency of the treatment process the most preferred choice for supporting electrolytes in fenton based ets is na2so4 due to its relatively appropriate behaviour when compared to chloride and nitrate salts moreover highly reactive so4 eo 2 6 v vs normal hydrogen electrode can also be generated homogeneously in the solution as a result of sulphate ion electrolysis that can boost the degradation rate of contaminants however doltabadi and co workers found that increasing the dosage of na2so4 beyond an optimum value of 7 1 g l adversely impacted the removal of dmp by ef process as sulphate ion can start competing with oh to produce so4 which is relatively less reactive and more selective than the oh dolatabadi et al 2021a on the other hand when nacl is employed as a supporting electrolyte energy consumption of the ef system is increased due to the formation of active chlorine species such as hclo clo clo2 clo3 and clo4 which requires extra energy for their formation intriguingly titchou and co researchers observed that nacl restricted the toc removal of direct red 23 dye due to the formation of resistant organochlorine compounds and short chained carboxylic acids titchou et al 2022 instead using a mixture of na2so4 and nacl 3 1 as supporting electrolytes was found to be more effective in attaining swifter decolourisation and higher mineralisation of direct red 23 in the ef process this was probably due to the bleaching effect of hclo and infusion of so4 in the bulk solution that facilitated greater toc removal therefore specific electrolytes optimum current density and other cell parameters should be carefully controlled during the ef treatment to ameliorate the performance efficiency of the system 4 other emerging electrochemical technologies and hybrid systems for the removal of edcs from aqueous environments in some ets instead of h2o2 precursors like peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds are used to produce highly reactive so4 achieved by cleaving of the peroxide bond of the persulfate molecule by direct electrolysis or via reduced metals metal oxides and metallic composites lee et al 2020 moreover so4 is strongly selective towards the degradation of organic pollutants such as phenol dyes antibiotics and other electron abundant contaminants at the same time oh radical is non selective and thus prone to involvement in unwanted side reactions that may lower the treatment efficiency of the electrochemical system zhi et al 2020 besides the relatively long half life of so4 in comparison to oh gives them greater opportunity to come in contact with target pollutants and ultimately mineralise them zhi et al 2020 for instance eo with bdd anode and ss cathode of 1078 μg l of atrazine solution resulted in 36 3 degradation in 30 min whereas the addition of persulfate ion elevated the removal efficiency to 78 2 and degradation rate constant of 0 05 min 1 for the same electrolysis duration bu et al 2018 clearly so4 was responsible for accelerating the pace of degradation of atrazine also the reaction rate for so4 mediated eo was higher than that reported by komtchou and co workers during the degradation of atrazine solution with an initial concentration of 100 μg l via ef process bdd anode and carbon plate cathode wherein removal efficiency of 69 89 was achieved in 90 min with a degradation rate of 0 01 min 1 komtchou et al 2017 it is evident that so4 based ets are a plausible alternative to traditional ets and can be conjugated with oh to manifest superior performance electro peroxone e peroxone process in another emerging et that synergistically combines eo and ozonation process for rapid and efficient mitigation of emcs fig 6 in this process the cathode generated h2o2 interacts with o3 to produce oh that enhances the removal of refractory pollutants resistant to conventional ozone process yao et al 2019 moreover ozonation of bromide containing wastewater often produces carcinogenic bromate as a by product which is effectively avoided during the e peroxone process through quenching of hypobromous acid by in situ generated oh yao et al 2019 since a copious amount of oh is generated in the e peroxone process along with o3 a very high removal efficiency can be obtained in a short time interval that can significantly boost the energy efficiency of the treatment system this was visualised during the treatment of synthetic wastewater containing 40 mg l of diuron herbicide wherein the complete removal of diuron was accomplished in just 10 min of experimentation asgari et al 2021 moreover during the 90 min operation 41 3 of cod was removed at an energy consumption rate of 0 08 kwh g of cod removed which was much less than that consumed by ozonation 0 12 kwh g and electrolysis process 0 21 kwh g asgari et al 2021 one major advantage of the e peroxne process over the other fenton based ets is that they don t rely on the catalyst for activating oh which combined with high degradation rates and low energy requirement makes them an ideal ets when dealing with a large volume of wastewater moreover the bulk of biorefractory pollutants in the aqueous medium could be removed by using hybrid technologies which combine electrochemical approaches with additional biological or chemical treatments in this context a hybrid electrochemical reactor fabricated by de vidales et al 2014 combined uv light irradiation and ultrasound with an eo reactor fitted with a bdd anode and ss cathode for eliminating progesterone hormone progesterone initial concentration of 100 mg l was almost completely mineralised in 40 min by applying a current density of 30 ma cm2 along with ultrasound irradiation at 24 khz wave with 200 w of ultrasonic power and uv treatment at 254 nm wavelength with 4 w of power de vidales et al 2014 in fact in one investigation ec eo sequential treatment was found effective in inhibiting the viruses infesting the water samples thus exemplifying the versatility and effectiveness of combined and hybrid electrochemical systems in treating a wide spectrum of contaminants heffron et al 2019 however the expensive materials used as anode in eo are despised by many environmentalists as they are not sustainable for application beyond the laboratory das et al 2019 2021 therefore it becomes necessary to economise the treatment of ets by merging them with biological treatment das et al 2021 das et al 2021 the microbial fuel cell mfc is one innovative bio treatment technology that produces energy from wastewater which can be exploited for auxiliary usages das et al 2022 lately orthodox dual chamber mfcs have been tuned to execute fenton s oxidation in the cathodic chamber this mfc fenton integration the so called bio electro fenton bef system does not require an external power supply to drive the fenton s reaction making it a lucrative technique for the cost effective remediation of emcs sathe et al 2022 the efficacy of such a bef system was illustrated during the investigation by sathe et al 2021 the fe activated carbon based bef system reduced 10 mg l of sodium dodecyl sulphate surfactant solution by 87 4 within 4 h and parallelly produced power with a maximum power density of 105 67 mw m2 no doubt the bef is a relatively greener wastewater remediation technology than the conventional ef systems with the potential to develop into a full scale technology therefore an important hybrid strategy for the removal of edcs and other micropollutants from wastewater is biological treatment combined with ets however further research is required to develop a comprehensive knowledge of the microbiota s biodegradation process and the crucial variables that increase the effectiveness of edcs disintegration also it is essential to characterise and quantify the secondary metabolites and by products that are generated throughout the biodegradation process since at times they might be more toxic and persistent than the parent substances 5 treatment cost advantages and disadvantages of electrochemical technologies the most notable benefit of the ets over other conventional and advanced wastewater treatment systems is their capacity to mineralise a variety of resistant xenobiotic compounds at a comparatively faster rate to demonstrate in 60 min only 30 of np initial concentration 50 mg l could be degraded through ozonation while the ef process removed 70 of np in the same contact time thus affirming the higher potency of eo treatment barrera díaz et al 2018 along with eliminating stubborn emcs eo and ef have been effective at eradicating antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes however ef oxidation is preferred over eo because of shorter contact time and higher removal rate at a relatively lower poised potential this tenet was evidenced by chen and his colleagues while performing ef oxidation of wastewater the ef oxidation current density 21 5 ma cm2 fe ii 56 mg l of antibiotic resistant genes produced 3 8 4 1 5 2 and 4 8 log elimination for intracellular teta intracellular ampc extracellular teta and extracellular ampc respectively in 2 h chen et al 2020 by eradicating the microorganisms that are infesting the wastewater ets are able to simultaneously disinfect the wastewater and attenuate xenobiotic pollutants which can significantly lower the cost of disinfection recalcitrant organics are also oxidised rather quickly by chemical based treatment techniques such as ozonation uv h2o and other aops however when compared to ets the chemical based aops consume a lot more ex situ chemicals during the disintegration process moreover when compared to other sophisticated chemical treatments the chemicals employed in the ets particularly in the eo and ef procedures are relatively affordable and easily accessible for instance continuous ozone dosage of 120 mg l and chlorine dosage 9 5 mg l has to be sustained to degrade 4 mg l of tcs while eo of 10 mg l tcs required much cheaper na2so4 salt in a concentration of 21 mg l li 2021 mei et al 2021 further during ef 11 mg l of fe iii catalyst along with 7 mg l of na2so4 was sufficient for attenuating 50 mg l of tcs sires et al 2007 the role of in situ electrochemical generations of reactive oxygen species and catalyst regeneration can t be understated in making operations of ets almost chemical free furthermore the requirement for shipping and storing these chemicals is avoided by in situ production and electrochemical regeneration of chemicals in ets which lowers the operational cost of the treatment past investigations have estimated much lower operating costs for ets compared to aops like uv o3 treatment conventional fenton oxidation peroxone process and photocatalytic oxidation according to m rodríguez peña et al 2019 the most economical technology for decontaminating 4 np containing wastewater was eo with an approximated cost of 0 249 l followed by uv o3 0 270 l and ao process 0 455 l respectively barrera díaz et al 2018 felis and miksch 2015 rodríguez peña et al 2019 mousset et al 2021 formulated novel criteria for juxtaposing diverse aop for wastewater treatment using accumulated oxygen equivalent chemical oxidation dose accordingly when the cost incurred per gram of toc removed for 99 mineralisation of phenol initial concentration 137 5 mg l toc of 100 mg l was evaluated for different technologies by incorporating charges incurred for supplying electricity chemicals supplements and sludge handling the ef process emerged as the most cost efficient treatment alternative with an estimated operation cost of 0 033 g toc removed surprisingly ozonation turned out to be the most expensive among the considered aops with an exorbitant unit treatment cost of 1 16 g toc removed the photo electro fenton 0 19 g toc removed and conventional fenton oxidation 0 044 g toc removed were much cheaper than ozonation but still cost more than four times of the ef process mousset et al 2021 evidently the ef process is a more economically viable alternative for the advanced treatment of wastewater likewise in terms of recovering unit kg of phosphorous from the supernatant of anaerobic sludge fe electrode driven ec process amounted to 1 92 and the fe iii salt employing chemical precipitation cost 3 13 huang et al 2017 hence a significant cost saving can be achieved by replacing chemical coagulation with innovative electricity driven coagulation techniques reduced sludge generation particularly during eo and ef treatment is another significant benefit of these two processes as they tend to mineralise the target component rather than phase shift though adding fe ii ions in surfeit quantity can form a scum layer due to the generation of fe oh 3 flocs badellino et al 2007 on the other hand to coagulate contaminants in the wastewater ec promotes the electrochemical production of fe oh 3 however as pristine coagulants are electrochemically infused in situ in the wastewater a high degree of removal is achieved even at much lesser coagulant concentration which means sludge produced during ec is substantially smaller than that produced in the traditional coagulation process garcia segura et al 2017 other advantageous characteristics of ets making them ideal for the abatement of emcs from wastewater are their easy fabrication and operation equally effective in neutral and circumneutral ph and comparable performance while treating wastewater from different sources despite their robust performance and effective removal of refractory pollutants only a few investigations have explored the up scale application of ets this is because of the forbidding operating cost of electrochemical reactors which makes field scale applications still far from being realised the typical treatment cost of ets hybrid units and other advanced technologies reported in the literature is presented in table 5 the cost of catalyst and electrodes comprises the bulk of electrochemical reactor fabrication cost whereas the operating cost is chiefly due to the energy consumed in driving the electrochemical reactor kaur et al 2019 evaluated that ef oxidation of real textile wastewater incurred a charge of around 3 13 per m3 of wastewater which jumped to 5 76 for abating unit kg of cod this is much higher than the average cost of conventional wastewater treatment approximated to be about 0 28 m3 including nutrient removal molinos senante et al 2010 clearly at present maintenance and operation of electrochemically driven advanced oxidation of wastewater is quite taxing and still needs to bring down to compete with commercial wastewater treatment technologies since power tariffs and operation costs vary by location a more appropriate economic representation for the treatment cost of ets would be the amount of energy spent per unit of pollutant or kg of organics eliminated in this regard monteil et al 2019 approximated that a minimum of 0 39 w h energy will be consumed in subduing unit gram of toc from xenobiotics laden waste stream via ef and bef based treatments which is quite high and impractical for up scaled scenarios in addition the cost of electrode material is considered the most crucial capital expenditure in any ets the electrodes are susceptible to scaling leaching and corrosion under the influence of applied potential and need regular replacement brillas and garcia segura 2020 dos santos et al 2016 hence based on the lifetime of the specific electrode material an additional replacement charge must be accounted for while estimating the long term expenditure of these electrochemical systems stirling et al 2020 estimated that a ten fold reduction in the cost of bdd electrodes could vastly improve the affordability of et based reactors hence research efforts should be oriented towards decreasing the manufacturing cost of bdd electrodes and parallelly developing a cost effective substitute that can abet market implementation of these electrocatalytic devices furthermore the production of hazardous intermediates and metabolites as a result of partial mineralisation is a serious problem during the electrochemical degradation of biorefractory pollutants in one investigation when 20 mg l of bpa solution was treated using heterogeneous ef oxidation degradation intermediates like 4 isopropyl phenol phenol divinyloxyethane acetylacetone and isobutyric acid were identified in the effluent zhang et al 2020 likewise when the surfactant npeo breaks down degradation by products like 4 np and ethylene glycol are created that are more estrogenic than npeo itself da silva et al 2015 he et al 2020 these intermediates can further be mineralised into benign products like h2o and co2 by elongating the exposure time of the oxidation process nevertheless the mineralisation efficiency of eo and ef systems is limited by the pollutant concentration and hence the mineralisation efficiency reduces as the oxidation process progresses also when pollutant concentration becomes very less scavenging of reactive radicals takes place thus improvement in mineralisation efficiency is insignificant even after prolonged oxidation which makes the entire treatment uneconomical similar findings were reported when furosemide and ranitidine containing wastewater were subjected to oxidative degradation in a bio ef conjugated system it was observed that increasing the duration of electrolysis from one to eight hour inflated the treatment costs by five times for furosemide 56 82 and ranitidine 61 72 per unit gram toc removed olvera vargas et al 2016 hence in order to scale up these cutting edge treatment methods for widespread applications economic feasibility continues to be the prime objective prior to the discharge physicochemical characterisation of treated effluent should be conducted to identify any toxic intermediate by products that might have been formed due to the partial or incomplete oxidation of the target contaminants usually high end analytical devices such as liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms are employed to trace the degradation pathway of specific contaminants however while dealing with real wastewater where innumerable pollutants are present such an expensive analysis may not be economically viable in such scenarios a toxicity test can be used to estimate processed wastewater s ecotoxicity potential the microtox toxicity assay using vibrio fischeri is a standardised screening test that provides reliable results and has been employed to determine the toxicity of ef and eo treated biorefractory wastewater samples le et al 2017 phillips et al 2018 additionally the bioluminescence inhibition ratio higher value indicates greater toxicity can be calculated to quantify the toxicity of a wastewater sample alternatively green algae escherichia coli and several other microorganisms have also been used for estimating the toxicity and bioluminescence inhibition ratio of treated wastewater to a great effect ioannou ttofa et al 2019 wang et al 2018 6 life cycle analysis of electrochemical technologies to ensure the sustainable transition of technology it is necessary to determine the associated environmental impacts entailing its operation life cycle assessment lca is a tool that quantifies the environmental burden of a product or process for the entire working life and thus helps to select the alternative with the least impact on the ecosystem as far as ets are concerned most of the adverse effects are due to electricity consumption to illustrate for removing phenol from waste streams the ef process had the highest global warming potential gwp and ozone layer depletion potential odp when compared to adsorption and photocatalysis obviously because of excessive energy consumption magdy et al 2021 similarly the eo driven removal of perfluorooctanoic acids 1000 m3 wastewater was estimated to produce 84 9 kg co2 eq and 3 69 kg o3 eq which is significant in context to global warming and smog formation li et al 2022 moreover goyal and mondal 2022 concurred that electrode dissolution and power consumption were the two biggest contributors to gwp odp and fossil resource depletion in the ec process hence reducing the operational power demand is pivotal for elevating the environmental viability of these electrochemical systems in this respect efforts have been made to propel et via renewable sources like serra et al 2011 concluded that for degrading α methylphenylglycine the gwp and impacts in the terrestrial ecotoxicity category of solar driven photo fenton were at least seven folds and fourteen folds lower than that of the solar ef process respectively correspondingly the environmental penalty of the mfc powered bef process was found to be much milder than the eo of surfactant contaminated wastewater sathe et al 2021 some researchers have also advocated using heterogeneous fenton catalysts over homogenous catalysts as the former can reduce water footprint by up to 77 and have six folds less stress on marine life rodríguez et al 2016 further the deteriorating impacts of sludge generated in a homogeneous ef process can be reduced by recycling fe sludge as a heterogenous catalyst zhang et al 2022 nevertheless a more detailed assessment of environmental impacts needs to be undertaken for different configurations of individual and coupled et systems to understand the severity of impact in different environmental categories this feedback can then be utilised sustainably to mature electrochemically driven advanced oxidation technologies 7 future scope the ability of ao and ef processes to eliminate pollutants non selectively via in situ electrochemically produced oh makes them particularly effective in regulating the infiltration of emcs into hydric sources whereas the contaminant separation in ec is superior to that achieved in conventional chemical coagulation nonetheless these ets are merely laboratory showcases and have yet to prove their mettle in actual site applications the main problem with upscaling ets is the prohibitive power requirement and material cost to minimise these expenditures extensive research to develop affordable robust electrodes and efficient catalysts are necessary energy demand for operating ets can be subsidised through the use of renewable power sources the commercialisation of these esoteric technologies will be aided by more research on the comprehensive design of continuous flow energy efficient reactors for meeting practical requirements it is necessary to conduct more tests on pilot prototypes of ets to evaluate the behaviour of various cell characteristics and related operational challenges in the larger reactors this examination will contribute to a greater comprehension of the hydrodynamic and electrochemical behaviour of the degrading process which may be utilised to optimise electrochemical systems the analysis of the critical reactor components post experiment notably the electrodes can be investigated to unravel the reasons behind the performance drop understanding the deterioration of electrodes can aid in the development of more resilient electrodes with higher serviceability further leaching of the metallic anode is a persistent challenge faced in the eo and ef process which is usually mitigated through exorbitantly costly bdd and modified ti anodes this makes the electrochemical treatment of wastewater highly taxing also the technology readiness level of the anode based electrochemical treatment process is low 4 5 due to several operation difficulties encountered during up scaled experiments montiel et al 2021 hence more focus should be directed on searching for suitable cost effective anode materials for replacing expensive electrodes that will improve the technology readiness levels of ets taking them closer to full scale adaptation investigations have been conducted of late on coupled electrochemical systems such as the photo eo process photo ef process ef peroxi coagulation etc to enhance the removal of persistent pollutants li et al 2017 2021 thor et al 2020 these systems have exhibited improved performance though at the expense of increased power consumption and or chemical supplements an integrated system combining biological processes with ets may be a superior hybridisation strategy since it can lower both the total power consumption and electrolysis time in this context energy free fenton s oxidation of contaminants in mfc has emerged as a potential alternative to the power intensive ef process in addition ets make complex organic chemicals biodegradable as these are broken down into simpler intermediates this is a desirable pre treatment step before the wastewater is subjected to biological treatment a variety of combinations such as up flow anaerobic sludge bed eo sequencing batch reactor eo ec membrane filtration and sequencing batch reactor ef have been successfully applied for the elimination of resistant pollutants ganzenko et al 2020 vinduja and balasubramanian 2013 nevertheless a lack of comprehensive knowledge on the functionalities of bio et integrated systems may result in the un optimised operation of these hybrid units additional explorations into the intricate elements of hybrid systems may aid in circumventing ets obstacles and accelerate their adoption in existing wastewater treatment infrastructure 8 conclusion the occurrence of edcs in various water sources poses an impending danger to the well being of humans and aquatic life many edcs have been detected in natural hydric sources ranging from 740 μg l bpa in groundwater to 0 002 μg l bpa in river water persistent and prolonged vulnerability of edcs may have devastating health effects including hormonal malfunctioning dysfunction of reproductive organs malignancy obesity and developmental disorders in children among others conventional wastewater treatment facilities are not intended to remove edcs from wastewater and are thus the primary source of edc discharge into natural receiving waters these edcs can be readily eradicated from polluted water via et driven treatments as organic pollutants are non selectively attacked utilizing very powerful oh and other reactive species in such systems many investigations have reported complete degradation of edcs using electrochemically driven advanced oxidation techniques moreover the toc removal efficiency in most cases was greater than 90 which reflects the robustness of et based treatments in mineralising these recalcitrant contaminants nonetheless the widespread deployment of ets is hindered by their excessive operating costs and energy requirements in order to address obstacles faced during the operation and scalability of ets researchers have combined et with other aops and biological systems in this sense hybrid methods such as bef ef eo mbr ec ef etc have shown promise in the eradication of emcs nonetheless such infant technologies are crude and need further refinement

11704,the promotion of proper forms of handwashing hw has been a continuing challenge the aim of this study was to give insights into existing home hw practices the objectives was to describe conditions and changes regarding critical hw practices including those involving after visiting toilet avt and before eating meals bem hw behavior discuss findings in relation to the hw behavior identified through national monitoring and understand key factors needed for improving hw programs and campaigns mobile phone based interviews were carried out in two rounds in april may 2020 round1 or r1 and january february 2021 round2 or r2 with data collected from five different areas based on interviews and focus group discussions out of 250 interviews the 242 cases that provided complete responses to hw questions in the two rounds were included approximately 80 of respondents collected water for domestic purposes from hand pumps inside their premises in round2 the relative proportions of recommended hw practices both hands soap water increased from round1 at p 01 as follows 81 of female respondents practiced general hw behavior in r2 as compared to 57 in r1 and 75 of male respondents practiced general hw as compared to 52 in r1 regarding avt practices 95 of female respondents practiced avt hw in r2 an increase from 60 in r1 and 96 of male respondents practiced avt hw in r2 an increase from 65 in r1 recommended bem practices in round2 increased to 11 6 from 5 8 among female respondents in round1 and to 15 7 from 11 6 among male respondents in round1 the duration of hw was found to be longer among female than male respondents although avt practices changed notably the bem practices did not show a significant difference between the two rounds the recommended hw practices of avt bem and sdg basic hygiene services of avt and bem associated with the same individuals were different at p 001 and we could not estimate or present one value results for hw practice or the sdg basic hygiene service level based on the two widely different critical hw practices avt versus bem behavior notably the data indicated continuing risks for the effectiveness of hw practices in rural bangladesh in particular the lack of access to facilities with running water for both hands gaps in the national monitoring efforts communication and other key factors were discussed as barriers a framework for more effective hw programs and additional research and development regarding hw practices within current contexts including how to overcome the barriers that exist are

bangladesh and most developing countries who unicef 2021 bangladesh bureau of statistics and unicef bangladesh 2019 according to the unicef bangladesh 2021 lessons learned report sustaining behavior changing programs and systematic monitoring as well as reporting on hw practices face notable constraints in bangladesh unicef bangladesh 2021 the covid 19 situation in bangladesh has created a desire in the environment and population research centre eprc to further understand the hw practices of local populations and in specific in localities where trust has been established with the centre in addition to having voluntary distributions of emergency soap and other relief measures among its project populations the eprc aims to share this information with key government and non government stakeholders hoque et al 2020 the eprc within its projects in rural bangladesh and in particular bilqis a hoque a leader of the study and a member of eprc have been directly involved in hw promotion

bangladesh in order to contribute to the creation of an enabling environment including elements that could empower people to become proactive in the adoption of the recommended hw practices as habit the objectives of this study are to i describe the existing conditions and changes regarding selected critical hw practices in the context of the pandemic ii examine the presentation of hw conditions based on a national monitoring approach and iii understand and discuss additional aspects necessary for improved hw programs with a focus on sustainable development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study setting bangladesh reached lower middle income status in 2015 up from its earlier low level of per capita gdp tenth lowest in the world in 1971 according to a 2019 national survey in rural areas improved sources of drinking water were present on 81 of premises pipe water supply was accessible to approximately 4 5 of the houses and 75 of the households in bangladesh had basic water and soap present hygiene facilities bangladesh bureau of statistics and unicef bangladesh 2019 global hand washing day using soap with high levels of participation has been an annual event since 2008 hand hygiene was included in the country s national hygiene promotion strategy for water supply and sanitation sector in bangladesh 2012 and a hand hygiene for all hh4a bangladesh road map and launch of a multi sectoral national campaign were initiated in 2021 additional background information regarding the context of hw practices was incorporated into this study based on the following we recognize that home hw has been shaped as a practice by culturally and or religiously learned patterns over the ages kiani and saeidi 2015 the most common popular belief regarding the hands in many african hindu jewish muslim and indian sub continental cultures including bangladesh india pakistan nepal bhutan sri lanka maldives and afghanistan is to consider the left hand unclean and use the clean right hand for offering receiving eating and gesticulating benedetta allegranzi et al 2009 hoque et al 1995 hand to mouth eating using the right hand is also a tradition among the majority of people in the indian sub continent however on many occasions the right hand can have a higher degree of contamination than the left hand bliqis et al 2022 hoque et al 1995 watutantrige et al 2012 at the same time the practice of islam has set forth as obligatory the two hand rubbing washing model of behavior before praying five times per day khan and yasir 2020 hw related publicity measures to prevent coronavirus infections were initiated by the government who unicef non government organizations newspapers mobile telephone operators ring tone public media social media television radio and other organizations during the time of this study unicef bangladesh 2021 hoque et al 2020 the common public media hw message included washing of hands for 20 s and very occasionally the television radio and ring tone media mentioned the importance of washing with both hands 2 2 study design and cohort the research studied hw practices under the ongoing national programs data were collected involving selected rural female and male participants and relevant literature by managing locally available resources through the eprc the study was conducted in five different rural areas districts in order to describe the overall situation the eprc has conducted education disaster risk management agricultural and or arsenic safe water supply projects in those five areas the research involved two parts i mobile phone based interviews regarding hw practices and use of hw facilities through two surveys rounds among the same populations figures 1 and 2 the first round round1 was done during april may 2020 and the second round round2 in january february 2021 together with ii eight focus group discussions fgds in february 2021 that were conducted to further understand the information obtained from the participants all fgd participants were provided with masks and hand sanitizers to ensure covid 19 precautions the study areas were located in five sub districts as follows kalia in extended coastal motlab in common inland assasuni in coastal sirajganj sadar in inland and sariakandi in flood prone inland environments map 1 a sample of female and male participants from different households who owned mobile phones were selected through convenience sampling for the phone interviews sampling of the households was done from the phone numbers of those households eprc had saved from its earlier records separate lists of men and women who owned mobile phones were prepared in every project area and 25 female and 25 male participants in each area were selected by lottery from those lists local leaders were asked to help in selecting participants for focus group discussions two fgds including one male and one female group per area with a total of eight fgds were conducted with the exception of the research site in kalia the participants were organized to have at least two representatives from locally designated categories as follows well to do average and poor respondents in every fgd the fgds involved in total 62 male and female participants with at least seven participants per fgd the ages of participants were between 20 and 54 years all had some schooling 3 10 years and all owned a mobile phone 2 3 development of instruments 2 3 1 semi structured questionnaire a semi structured interview tool with closed coded and other including outside the coded answers available for selection was developed to collect hw information based on earlier literature hoque 2019 and interest in the issue the interview instrument was designed to explore participants practices knowledge and views and access to facilities keeping in mind globally as well as nationally recommended hw practices the specific focus was on components of hw practices as recommended and on the sdg basic hygiene service the data collection tool included questions about sources of family income education knowledge about covid 19 symptoms and its home public health prevention and related ongoing national campaigns hw practices nationally recommended components of hw practices hw facilities used adoption of hw practices according to their nationally recommended components both hands soap water and other factors two critical hw practices hw after visiting toilet avt and hw before eating meals bem were a particular focus the data collection tool was pre tested with 12 male and female mobile phone owners in matlab and sirajganj who were then eliminated from the study population 2 3 2 focus group discussion guidelines the women s and men s discussions were arranged in different courtyards of houses male and female participants were invited to separate meetings in order to facilitate free and frank discussions the guidelines of fgds explored the following five aspects in particular i insights into the different critical hw practices with different components discussed facilities used challenges and additional views on identified aspects ii hw to prevent covid 19 based on the national communication campaign iii implementation of the recommended components of hw and why a handedness problem may exist iv facilities in use and roles regarding hw and v promotion of the recommended critical components of the hand hygiene for all campaign 2 3 3 ethical review although the eprc system has an ethical review committee erc we could not submit our documents to it during the planning period in round1 due to the first covid 19 quarantine we wanted to keep the questions and conditions of the two rounds the same and we did not approach the committee before round2 given that during this round researchers were still working from home nonetheless the standard consent form earlier approved by the eprc ethical committee was read out to every interviewee before each interview the form clearly informed participants that they could deny answering any question any part of a question or withdraw at any time from the interview along with a discussion of other basic issues 2 4 data collection and management 2 4 1 questionnaire data the data collectors were selected from staff members of eprc with at least five years of experience they were trained by selected researchers the training focused on the importance of the study its aims and objectives the use of mobile phone based interviews interview tools participant selection ethics and convenience and other related aspects all data collectors implemented 3 5 interviews among male and female participants in the neighborhood during the training the filled in questionnaires were discussed during the training participants were informed about the purpose of the study confidentiality approximate duration approximately 25 min and the interviewees right to not respond to questions or to end the interview at any time during the interview they could also complete the interview over two or more calls according to their convenience the responses were noted on paper and transcribed and the entered data were cleaned based on consistency and validity checks simple descriptive analysis was done based on spss version 19 during both rounds another team engaged in a quality check with repeated interviews with five men and five women in each area any discrepancies observed were discussed and corrected the interview data set was collected from 250 participants and included the same 121 female and 121 male respondents in rounds1 and 2 only interviews that gave answers to all hw related questions in the two surveys were included for analysis all of the questions included such factors as the main source of income in the household the wearing of masks and the practice of social distancing among other considerations descriptive chi square and normal tests were used to analyze the data regarding components of hw and facilities the components of recommended hw practices were simplified to include both hands soap water in the analysis objective 1 the presence or lack of conditions that were relevant to the national monitoring program was examined by comparing proportions of the compliance of hw practices and facilities to the recommended structures during the two rounds focusing on both female and male participants objective 2 the recommended structures included hw practices and facilities based on the sdg basic hygiene service and compliances were tested by normal tests for the comparison of proportions kirkwood and sterne 2003 it calculated comparisons of the two proportions measured regarding the same individuals using such comparisons as the information we require is contained in the counts for which the methods did not agree 2 4 2 focus group discussion fgd data and data management two research officers experienced with fgds were trained regarding the issues of interest and were assigned to conduct all of the fgds one of the two officers took notes during the fgds given that audio recordings of interviews were avoided because most of the female participants did not want to be recorded in this way the fgd team trained one female local project staff member from every area the women staff members were present in the respective female fgds and helped out as requested the fgd teams e mailed the transcript in the bangla language to the research team within 48 h the authors of this study met at the eprc head office to analyze the collected data in line with the four identified categories of particular interest the views expressed by the majority of participants regarding each aspect of each fgd were noted any additional special unusual or specific comments given by participants were recorded as well 2 5 potential limitations women participants were relatively more educated than is true at the national level and having mobile phones enabled them to have a level of access to communication and hw information that might be above the norm it has been observed elsewhere that self reported hw practices often overestimate their actual performance on the ground curtis et al 2011 ram 2013 for this reason the estimated sdg hygiene hw indicator at the basic service based on self reported data regarding hw facilities i e with the presence of both water and soap as compared to the joint monitoring program jmp observed facility level by the enumerators was felt to be higher than the actual situation i e the self reported data was not consistent with the actual level of hw facilities in addition several factors in the study areas may have influenced the respondents perceptions more than usual including the following i there were ongoing public mass communication programs on hw and other specific issues to prevent covid 19 ii both women and men were mostly in their houses due to limited mobility during the pandemic and iii the women owning mobile phones could have better access to information than most are likely to have this might suggest that the actual levels of critical hw behavior and their effectiveness in real terms throughout the country are likely to be significantly lower than the level shown in the case of this particular data set i e the levels of attainment in terms of behavior and facilities are not likely to be as high as reported 3 results in total 121 women and 121 men aged 20 54 years from the same 242 households out of 250 households gave answers to all of the questions about hw in the two mobile phone based interview rounds and thus their answers were included in the analysis approximately 18 7 of the female and 15 of the male respondents had no schooling and 18 of the female and 28 of the male respondents had more than 10 years of schooling approximately 80 of the female and male households 78 86 used hand tube wells groundwater source at their premises 3 had access to a piped water supply 0 5 with the remaining using various surface water sources for domestic purposes all households owned one or more mobile phones the quality of water in some domestic water sources in assasuni was saline but there was no mention of water quality as a barrier to hw practices almost all of the participants in the fgds discussed the increasing water collection burden on female members of families that related to increased hw a factor felt by all in the survey areas 3 1 hand washing practices and critical behaviors in general as well as after visiting toilet avt more than half of the participants claimed to wash both hands with soap and water as recommended with both hands soap water in round1 table 1 in round2 the percentages of recommended hw practices increased as compared to round1 as follows 81 of general hw increased from 57 among female participants 75 of general hw from 52 among male participants 95 of avt from 60 among female participants and 96 of avt from 65 among male participants a comparison of all proportions of the recommended hw both hands soap water against other methods single hand and or no soap for general and avt between round1 and round2 showed significant differences at p 01 among males and females by means of the chi square test this indicates that the reported recommended hw general and avt practices increased in a statistically significant way between round1 and round2 in round2 the percentage of hw before eating meals bem increased to 11 6 from 5 8 for women round1 and to 15 7 from 11 6 for men round1 however in round2 the percentage of recommended bem practices increased to 11 6 from 5 8 for women round1 and to 15 7 from 11 6 for male participants round1 the recommended bem practices therefore did not show a statistically significant difference between round1 and round2 at p 50 we should point out that within the same round avt or bem practices did not show statistically significant differences at p 10 among female and male participants however the chi square value of 17 505 was found during comparisons of proportions to be less than 20 s hw and equal to more than 20 s hw between female and male participants in the second round the value 17 505 is greater than 10 83 the 0 1 point for the chi squared distribution with degree of freedom p 001 indicating that the women may have washed their hands over a longer duration than did the men in this study it should be mentioned that in round2 80 of male and female participants claimed that cleaning hands through the use of sanitizers by all members of a family at home was not affordable or practicable when the participants were asked whether it was possible or not to implement the recommended hw practices more than 70 of men and women in the second round claimed that it would be not possible or would be difficult to practice see fig 4 further disconnects with recommended procedures were revealed regarding single handedness during the fgds all of the fgds claimed that as a part of local culture regardless of religious affiliation most people hw only the right hand before eating meals bem by bringing water in a jug or glass and washing on a bowl or plate in the dining place or inside the house photo 1 the belief is strongly held that left hand is dirty because it is used for post defecation cleaning therefore people do not accept or like bringing the left hand in contact with the right hand before eating in addition since only the right hand is used for eating the washing of only right hw was thought to be ok most of the participants in the fgds mentioned that after visiting toilet avt in contrast to bem the majorities of people wash both hands one hand after another hand with soap while holding and pouring water from the container by another hand photo 2 when asked why people were able to hw using both hands by rubbing scrubbing closely with water before islamic ablutions for their five prayers per day most of the bangladeshi people are muslim the consensus in 5 out of 8 fgds was that this behavior was a religious ritual and there was a need to purify before prayer to participants this behavior was not connected to real hw interpreted as health and or dirt cleaning promoted behaviors 3 2 facilities used during handwashing the sites and facilities used for the two critical hws during a single day were different in same house for most of the participants in the two rounds the sites and facilities used are shown in table 2 all participants reported the presence of fixed tube well pond or storage water or mobile water carried water in bucket jug glass or other container to the facility location for both avt and bem the use of a basin or bathroom for hw before eating meals bem was reported by about 6 of male and 2 of female participants during round1 and 8 of male and 9 of female participants during round2 soap was kept in the basin or bathroom sites regarding facilities of avt practices about 88 of female and 83 of male participants in round1 and 98 of female and 100 of male participants in round2 claimed that soap was present or they carried soap to the hw sites facilities from places inside the home however regarding facilities of bem practices it was reported that soap was present or carried by 13 of the female respondents and 18 of male respondents in round1 and 26 of female and 28 of male respondents in round2 respectively thus there was an important difference regarding the presence of soap when doing hw in avt versus bem contexts i e much more use in the context of avt the basin users and some bathroom users had access to running water during the hours in which there was a supply of running water as pipe water supply followed the intermittent water supply more than 95 of the participants did not have access to running water it should be pointed out that the venues except for basin and pond sites demanded one hand either for pumping using a hand pump or for pouring water using such implements as a jug mug or glass from water containers the majority of participants from five or more fgds declared the following the lack of access to a convenient facility for hw with running water hampers the washing of both hands frequent hw by all members of a family increases the water collection burden on women from tube wells or other unconnected water sources washing hands with soap requires an additional amount of water which further increases the water management burden on women there was a drainage problem of rinsed water there was a lack of affordability for soap the predominance of cultural and religious patterns conflicted with elements of the handedness component i e the recommended practice of washing both hands the lack of appropriate education and communication about the need for recommended hw processes such as how rubbing helps hw how soap kills the coronavirus how to wash both hands under hand pumped water and how to wash both hands while pouring water from glass mug by one hand was noted among other needed messages there was inadequate motivation for change in adopting all of the recommended critical hw practices based on these incompatibilities with real life what is actually done as opposed to what is recommended a female local government member ward 5 assasuni participant in an fgd said that the promotion of a dedicated defined facility for hw can help advance the recommended hw practices just as hand pumps did for safe water in rural areas however one fgd participant from sirajganj even thought that a dedicated facility for hw was an unusual idea commenting i have never seen a fixed place for all forms of hw in a day we usually wash hands outside or inside a house based on the location of where the need for hw is perceived and not on a facility an fgd participant from assasuni also stated i wash hands near my tube well because i do not want to burden my wife with water collection for hw she already has to collect drinking water for family i give the same advice to my children these perceptions would have to be dealt with if a dedicated facility for hw is to be promoted effectively 3 3 compliance to recommend hw practices and sdg basic hygiene service here compliance to recommend hw practices refer to all the critical hw practices includes the same recommended and promoted hw practices both hands soap water and the sdg basic hygiene service hw facility soap water in household the z values and p values found by normal test for comparison of two proportions regarding the same individuals compliances to the recommended hw practice and to the sdg basic hygiene service conditions are presented in table 3 and figure 3 the reported compliances to the recommended hw practices regarding avt and bem with respect to the same individuals statistically differed significantly p 001 among both female and male participants in round1 as well as round2 also the compliances to the sdg basic hygiene service related to the two critical hw practices in same individuals were found to be statistically significantly different p 001 in other words the compliance of two significantly different critical hws avt versus bem practices by an estimated single value or of the sdg basic hygiene service level by a single estimated value may contradict the real conditions found in these locations single estimated values may not represent well the true situation and some form of disaggregation will be needed if the real conditions are to be identified 3 4 hw promotion toward the prevention of covid 19 the majority of people in the country have increased their general knowledge about recommended hw practices through the covid 19 prevention campaign almost all participants mentioned the mobile phone operators ring tones during the first several months as well as radio and tv advertisements during the pandemic less frequently mentioned was government or non government institutional programs as information sources more than 70 of both female and male participants said in interviews that they washed hands more frequently during the covid 19 than before the pandemic however most of the participants in almost all of the fgds stated negligible sustained increase with regard to recommended practices for hw before eating meals bem and in its associated facilities during the pandemic the fgds also pointed out the communication weaknesses in covering rural or local contexts such as advertisements that showed hw under running water given that rural people rarely have access to running water the advertisements also do not explain how to do hand rubbing scrubbing of both hands with soap in order to remove covid 19 germs or other relevant points that might help rural or local residents move toward more effective hw practices 4 discussion this study has characterized prevailing procedures and identified challenges to achieve the recommended hw practices of washing both hands with soap and water and to achieve the hw facility indicator specified in sdg 6 2 1b in rural bangladesh the sdg target for hw is 100 of the population using a hw facility with soap and water at home sdg basic hygiene service in the five locations of the study area approximately 80 of the female and male participants households 78 86 used groundwater for hw purposes through hand tube wells tw at their premises overall the recommended general and avt practices of hw increased significantly between round1 approximately greater than 50 and round2 approximately greater than 81 at p 01 among both men and women however the adherence for recommended hw both hands soap water before eating meals bem was very low and remained very low less than 20 among both female and male groups during both rounds at p 10 this reinforced previous reports that changing the prevailing hw practices in certain contexts such as bem on a large scale had little success and that a significant gap between knowledge of what should be done and actual practice exists in addition the recommended hw practices of avt bem as well as of sdg basic services of avt and bem regarding the same individuals compliances were widely different at p 001 this research could not estimate and present one value for the recommended hw practice or sdg indicator facility level based on these two critical hw observations avt versus bem behavior it is also important to note that the matthew et al 2014 survey national survey reported that 71 4 of bangladesh rural household members used a basic service of hw facility bangladesh bureau of statistics and unicef bangladesh 2019 the bangladesh national hygiene survey 2018 reported that 55 and 40 respondents mentioned using water and soap after using the toilet and before eating respectively while 61 of hws were said to be located with water and soap within 30 feet of the latrine bangladesh bureau of statistics and informatics division ministry of planning 2020 the national hygiene survey did not estimate the level of sdg indicator facility level of hw the current study could not estimate one value for the recommended hw practice or sdg indicator facility level based on these two critical hw observations avt and bem in contrast national monitoring did attempt to determine the proportion of household members with fixed or mobile hw facilities water and or soap observed on premises in the dwelling yard or plot bangladesh bureau of statistics and unicef bangladesh 2019 in order to estimate the following household members with a handwashing facility on premises with soap and water available meet the sdg criteria for a basic handwashing facility it is important to note that the national monitoring dataset was not segregated between critical hw practices however in the current study the mobile phone based interview questionnaire data have been used and the data segregated over critical hws such as after visiting toilet avt and before eating meals bem thus the segregated data seems to bring us to different conclusions than is true if the data is not segregated in this way the pressing need is to determine evidence for the presence of water soap and location bundled into appropriate facilities that would actually allow the recommended hw behaviors to be realistically carried out according to the definition of facility in the matthew et al 2014 survey the inclusion of the mobile carried water by jug bucket or other container and or soap to the hw location in terms of the presence of those items at the facility could create confusion because those items are used for various purposes and are present in most of the houses the current study also found that the handedness aspect was found to be one of the main barriers in realizing the recommended hw practices the participants claimed that it was difficult to wash both hands while pouring water by one hand in absence of running water the washing of both hands with water and soap by rubbing scrubbing are components of the globally recommended hw as it creates the friction that helps lift dirt grease microbes and other contaminants and allows them to be rinsed off the hands hoque et al 1995a 1995b hoque et al 1995 curtis et al 2011 nuhu amin et al 2014 this means the existing definition of basic facility does not necessarily include an enabling mechanism for the recommended hw behavior we should note that recommended hw behavior would include the most effective use of tap water for example in bangladesh during the covid 19 pandemic a study reported that when hands were scrubbed and washed with soap under running tap water approximately 1 7 l of water per handwash were overused sayeed et al 2021 in addition to emphasizing the need for behavioral change effectively scrubbing both hands with soap and water better communication about the importance of hw without the overuse of water is important to prevent the wastage of water resources recently efforts are ongoing for the innovation and development of hw facilities in home environments unicef bangladesh 2021 kristyna et al 2013 bliqis et al 2022 the bangladesh national hygiene promotion strategy 2012 related to handwashing included hw with soap and water access to hw facilities and their maintenance behavior change communication bcc improved social norms community participation social marketing coordination among ministries departments ngos and other organizations advocacy with participation of women and religious leaders mobilization of local resources and other related issues all of which need to be realized on the ground however the strategy did not clearly state the importance of the washing of both hands or other aspects of behavior and facilities that may be easily overlooked without more specific ways to identify what is actually happening and for what reason to address the gap in data regarding the actual use of hw facilities and bring useful sdg proxy hygiene information to the forefront there are several immediate and longer term approaches that might be adopted these include a adapt the present focus to include running water for both hands and the presence of soap b incorporate the presence of further defined and improved hw facilities for all hw purposes in each household and c revisit the measurement methods based on local contexts hw related behavioral change programs must consider cultural economic environmental knowledge related and other key behavioral determinants of handwashing in real contexts sian white et al 2020 water aid international 2020 rabbi1 and dey 2013 aarin palomares 2020 the significant related finding regarding a total disconnect in concept and purpose between religious habits of washing both hands before prayer time left hand after visiting toilet hoque et al 1995 and right hand before eating meals in bangladesh hoque et al 1995 rabbi1 and dey 2013 implies that the knowledge base of hw purposes and its relation to germ reduction and disease prevention are lacking the multiplicity of ideas about hw purposes was further emphasized when fgd groups brought out that hw for religious purposes while classified as to purify was not the same process as that of real hw i e hw involving critical behaviors regarding health as is true elsewhere in south asia water aid international 2020 the overall reach of mass media has been high in bangladesh the knowledge about hw of over 20 s duration improved significantly between the two rounds of data collection however fgds revealed that information conveyed about the need for and how the steps in recommended hw practices help to make hands safe was not convincing to the general population it is important that communication and educational information are understood by and then motivate behavioral change across all communities water aid international 2020 difficulties in the affordability of soap and the volume of water required to rinse soap off have also been shown to discourage the use of soap for hw hoque et al 1995 hoque 2003 the duration of hw was found to be statistically longer among female than male participants in the study female hw practices were reported to be better than male practices elsewhere watutantrige et al 2012 however gender perspectives with regard to hw came up as a real concern when the issue about requirement of significantly increased volume of water collection for the washing of both hands with soap by all members was mentioned the landscape of the water gender hw nexus as has been described here needs more work to understand as well as the need to formulate related policies and programs while this study concentrated on the components practices and difficulties in hw with respect to the rural bangladesh population the paradigm presented in a schematic diagram figure 2 represents more abstract concepts which merit its consideration in all hw efforts whether for urban and rural population and whether in developed or developing countries if it is incorporated as a guiding concept it has the potential to address at least some of the barriers and difficulties and contribute toward obtaining real change regarding recommended hw practices interventions or programs that are matched to local contexts are expected to perform better than more generalized projects 5 conclusions the information gathered from the mobile phone based data and fgds conducted during this study reveals the complexity of hw practices of the communities with respect to the recommended critical hw practices together with the gaps in the mechanisms of monitoring of hw behavior and available facilities that conflict with the key recommendations from the prevailing national as well as sdg perspectives the recommended general and avt practices of hw increased significantly between 62 and 95 5 in round1 and round2 among both men and women but the adherence for recommended hw both hands soap water bem was remained very low between 7 and 13 6 among both female and male groups during both rounds the study also identifies the need for an expansion of the basic paradigm for hw to be utilized in other programs that have sustainable development as a goal the lack of access to appropriate facilities with running water for washing both hands gaps in the monitoring approach inadequate consideration of local social and cultural factors weak gender equality and equity a lack of appropriate communications and motivation and other issues were identified as barriers to sustainable hw behavior further research and development to address the above mentioned challenges are recommended the development and use of a different framework for discussions and future research efforts could shed further light on additional measures needed to effect the desired changes and ensure that the intended goals are actually met

11704,the promotion of proper forms of handwashing hw has been a continuing challenge the aim of this study was to give insights into existing home hw practices the objectives was to describe conditions and changes regarding critical hw practices including those involving after visiting toilet avt and before eating meals bem hw behavior discuss findings in relation to the hw behavior identified through national monitoring and understand key factors needed for improving hw programs and campaigns mobile phone based interviews were carried out in two rounds in april may 2020 round1 or r1 and january february 2021 round2 or r2 with data collected from five different areas based on interviews and focus group discussions out of 250 interviews the 242 cases that provided complete responses to hw questions in the two rounds were included approximately 80 of respondents collected water for domestic purposes from hand pumps inside their premises in round2 the relative proportions of recommended hw practices both hands soap water increased from round1 at p 01 as follows 81 of female respondents practiced general hw behavior in r2 as compared to 57 in r1 and 75 of male respondents practiced general hw as compared to 52 in r1 regarding avt practices 95 of female respondents practiced avt hw in r2 an increase from 60 in r1 and 96 of male respondents practiced avt hw in r2 an increase from 65 in r1 recommended bem practices in round2 increased to 11 6 from 5 8 among female respondents in round1 and to 15 7 from 11 6 among male respondents in round1 the duration of hw was found to be longer among female than male respondents although avt practices changed notably the bem practices did not show a significant difference between the two rounds the recommended hw practices of avt bem and sdg basic hygiene services of avt and bem associated with the same individuals were different at p 001 and we could not estimate or present one value results for hw practice or the sdg basic hygiene service level based on the two widely different critical hw practices avt versus bem behavior notably the data indicated continuing risks for the effectiveness of hw practices in rural bangladesh in particular the lack of access to facilities with running water for both hands gaps in the national monitoring efforts communication and other key factors were discussed as barriers a framework for more effective hw programs and additional research and development regarding hw practices within current contexts including how to overcome the barriers that exist are

acute respiratory infections associated with hw interventions ejemot nwadiaro et al 2015 gash et al 2013 matthew et al 2014 najnin et al 2019 in addition hw was associated with a lower risk of covid

have basic handwashing facilities leaving 1 9 billion without who unicef 2021 in fact these types of basic hw facilities are found significantly less frequently in rural areas than in urban areas in bangladesh and most developing countries who unicef 2021 bangladesh bureau of statistics and unicef bangladesh 2019 according to the unicef bangladesh 2021 lessons learned report sustaining behavior changing programs and systematic monitoring as well as reporting on hw practices face notable constraints in bangladesh unicef bangladesh 2021 the covid 19 situation in bangladesh has created a desire in the environment and population research centre eprc to further understand the hw practices of local populations and in specific in localities where trust has been established with the centre in addition to having voluntary distributions of emergency soap and other relief measures among its project populations the eprc aims to share this information with key government and non government stakeholders hoque et al 2020 the eprc within its projects in rural bangladesh and in particular bilqis a hoque a leader of the study and a member of eprc have been directly involved in hw promotion and research activities over a period of several decades hoque et al 1991 1995 2020 2015 bliqis et al 2022 this study aims to present insights into the existing behavior of hw in rural communities in bangladesh in order to contribute to the creation of an enabling environment including elements that could empower people to become proactive in the adoption of the recommended hw practices as habit the objectives of this study are to i describe the existing conditions and changes regarding selected critical hw practices in the context of the pandemic ii examine the presentation of hw conditions based on a national monitoring approach and iii understand and discuss additional aspects necessary for improved hw programs with a focus on sustainable development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study setting bangladesh reached lower middle income status in 2015 up from its earlier low level of per capita gdp tenth lowest in the world in 1971 according to a 2019 national survey in rural areas improved sources of drinking water were present on 81 of premises pipe water supply was accessible to approximately 4 5 of the houses and 75 of the households in bangladesh had basic water and soap present hygiene facilities bangladesh bureau of statistics and unicef bangladesh 2019 global hand washing day using soap with high levels of participation has been an annual event since 2008 hand hygiene was included in the country s national hygiene promotion strategy for water supply and sanitation sector in bangladesh 2012 and a hand hygiene for all hh4a bangladesh road map and launch of a multi sectoral national campaign were initiated in 2021 additional background information regarding the context of hw practices was incorporated into this study based on the following we recognize that home hw has been shaped as a practice by culturally and or religiously learned patterns over the ages kiani and saeidi 2015 the most common popular belief regarding the hands in many african hindu jewish muslim and indian sub continental cultures including bangladesh india pakistan nepal bhutan sri lanka maldives and afghanistan is to consider the left hand unclean and use the clean right hand for offering receiving eating and gesticulating benedetta allegranzi et al 2009 hoque et al 1995 hand to mouth eating using the right hand is also a tradition among the majority of people in the indian sub continent however on many occasions the right hand can have a higher degree of contamination than the left hand bliqis et al 2022 hoque et al 1995 watutantrige et al 2012 at the same time the practice of islam has set forth as obligatory the two hand rubbing washing model of behavior before praying five times per day khan and yasir 2020 hw related publicity measures to prevent coronavirus infections were initiated by the government who unicef non government organizations newspapers mobile telephone operators ring tone public media social media television radio and other organizations during the time of this study unicef bangladesh 2021 hoque et al 2020 the common public media hw message included washing of hands for 20 s and very occasionally the television radio and ring tone media mentioned the importance of washing with both hands 2 2 study design and cohort the research studied hw practices under the ongoing national programs data were collected involving selected rural female and male participants and relevant literature by managing locally available resources through the eprc the study was conducted in five different rural areas districts in order to describe the overall situation the eprc has conducted education disaster risk management agricultural and or arsenic safe water supply projects in those five areas the research involved two parts i mobile phone based interviews regarding hw practices and use of hw facilities through two surveys rounds among the same populations figures 1 and 2 the first round round1 was done during april may 2020 and the second round round2 in january february 2021 together with ii eight focus group discussions fgds in february 2021 that were conducted to further understand the information obtained from the participants all fgd participants were provided with masks and hand sanitizers to ensure covid 19 precautions the study areas were located in five sub districts as follows kalia in extended coastal motlab in common inland assasuni in coastal sirajganj sadar in inland and sariakandi in flood prone inland environments map 1 a sample of female and male participants from different households who owned mobile phones were selected through convenience sampling for the phone interviews sampling of the households was done from the phone numbers of those households eprc had saved from its earlier records separate lists of men and women who owned mobile phones were prepared in every project area and 25 female and 25 male participants in each area were selected by lottery from those lists local leaders were asked to help in selecting participants for focus group discussions two fgds including one male and one female group per area with a total of eight fgds were conducted with the exception of the research site in kalia the participants were organized to have at least two representatives from locally designated categories as follows well to do average and poor respondents in every fgd the fgds involved in total 62 male and female participants with at least seven participants per fgd the ages of participants were between 20 and 54 years all had some schooling 3 10 years and all owned a mobile phone 2 3 development of instruments 2 3 1 semi structured questionnaire a semi structured interview tool with closed coded and other including outside the coded answers available for selection was developed to collect hw information based on earlier literature hoque 2019 and interest in the issue the interview instrument was designed to explore participants practices knowledge and views and access to facilities keeping in mind globally as well as nationally recommended hw practices the specific focus was on components of hw practices as recommended and on the sdg basic hygiene service the data collection tool included questions about sources of family income education knowledge about covid 19 symptoms and its home public health prevention and related ongoing national campaigns hw practices nationally recommended components of hw practices hw facilities used adoption of hw practices according to their nationally recommended components both hands soap water and other factors two critical hw practices hw after visiting toilet avt and hw before eating meals bem were a particular focus the data collection tool was pre tested with 12 male and female mobile phone owners in matlab and sirajganj who were then eliminated from the study population 2 3 2 focus group discussion guidelines the women s and men s discussions were arranged in different courtyards of houses male and female participants were invited to separate meetings in order to facilitate free and frank discussions the guidelines of fgds explored the following five aspects in particular i insights into the different critical hw practices with different components discussed facilities used challenges and additional views on identified aspects ii hw to prevent covid 19 based on the national communication campaign iii implementation of the recommended components of hw and why a handedness problem may exist iv facilities in use and roles regarding hw and v promotion of the recommended critical components of the hand hygiene for all campaign 2 3 3 ethical review although the eprc system has an ethical review committee erc we could not submit our documents to it during the planning period in round1 due to the first covid 19 quarantine we wanted to keep the questions and conditions of the two rounds the same and we did not approach the committee before round2 given that during this round researchers were still working from home nonetheless the standard consent form earlier approved by the eprc ethical committee was read out to every interviewee before each interview the form clearly informed participants that they could deny answering any question any part of a question or withdraw at any time from the interview along with a discussion of other basic issues 2 4 data collection and management 2 4 1 questionnaire data the data collectors were selected from staff members of eprc with at least five years of experience they were trained by selected researchers the training focused on the importance of the study its aims and objectives the use of mobile phone based interviews interview tools participant selection ethics and convenience and other related aspects all data collectors implemented 3 5 interviews among male and female participants in the neighborhood during the training the filled in questionnaires were discussed during the training participants were informed about the purpose of the study confidentiality approximate duration approximately 25 min and the interviewees right to not respond to questions or to end the interview at any time during the interview they could also complete the interview over two or more calls according to their convenience the responses were noted on paper and transcribed and the entered data were cleaned based on consistency and validity checks simple descriptive analysis was done based on spss version 19 during both rounds another team engaged in a quality check with repeated interviews with five men and five women in each area any discrepancies observed were discussed and corrected the interview data set was collected from 250 participants and included the same 121 female and 121 male respondents in rounds1 and 2 only interviews that gave answers to all hw related questions in the two surveys were included for analysis all of the questions included such factors as the main source of income in the household the wearing of masks and the practice of social distancing among other considerations descriptive chi square and normal tests were used to analyze the data regarding components of hw and facilities the components of recommended hw practices were simplified to include both hands soap water in the analysis objective 1 the presence or lack of conditions that were relevant to the national monitoring program was examined by comparing proportions of the compliance of hw practices and facilities to the recommended structures during the two rounds focusing on both female and male participants objective 2 the recommended structures included hw practices and facilities based on the sdg basic hygiene service and compliances were tested by normal tests for the comparison of proportions kirkwood and sterne 2003 it calculated comparisons of the two proportions measured regarding the same individuals using such comparisons as the information we require is contained in the counts for which the methods did not agree 2 4 2 focus group discussion fgd data and data management two research officers experienced with fgds were trained regarding the issues of interest and were assigned to conduct all of the fgds one of the two officers took notes during the fgds given that audio recordings of interviews were avoided because most of the female participants did not want to be recorded in this way the fgd team trained one female local project staff member from every area the women staff members were present in the respective female fgds and helped out as requested the fgd teams e mailed the transcript in the bangla language to the research team within 48 h the authors of this study met at the eprc head office to analyze the collected data in line with the four identified categories of particular interest the views expressed by the majority of participants regarding each aspect of each fgd were noted any additional special unusual or specific comments given by participants were recorded as well 2 5 potential limitations women participants were relatively more educated than is true at the national level and having mobile phones enabled them to have a level of access to communication and hw information that might be above the norm it has been observed elsewhere that self reported hw practices often overestimate their actual performance on the ground curtis et al 2011 ram 2013 for this reason the estimated sdg hygiene hw indicator at the basic service based on self reported data regarding hw facilities i e with the presence of both water and soap as compared to the joint monitoring program jmp observed facility level by the enumerators was felt to be higher than the actual situation i e the self reported data was not consistent with the actual level of hw facilities in addition several factors in the study areas may have influenced the respondents perceptions more than usual including the following i there were ongoing public mass communication programs on hw and other specific issues to prevent covid 19 ii both women and men were mostly in their houses due to limited mobility during the pandemic and iii the women owning mobile phones could have better access to information than most are likely to have this might suggest that the actual levels of critical hw behavior and their effectiveness in real terms throughout the country are likely to be significantly lower than the level shown in the case of this particular data set i e the levels of attainment in terms of behavior and facilities are not likely to be as high as reported 3 results in total 121 women and 121 men aged 20 54 years from the same 242 households out of 250 households gave answers to all of the questions about hw in the two mobile phone based interview rounds and thus their answers were included in the analysis approximately 18 7 of the female and 15 of the male respondents had no schooling and 18 of the female and 28 of the male respondents had more than 10 years of schooling approximately 80 of the female and male households 78 86 used hand tube wells groundwater source at their premises 3 had access to a piped water supply 0 5 with the remaining using various surface water sources for domestic purposes all households owned one or more mobile phones the quality of water in some domestic water sources in assasuni was saline but there was no mention of water quality as a barrier to hw practices almost all of the participants in the fgds discussed the increasing water collection burden on female members of families that related to increased hw a factor felt by all in the survey areas 3 1 hand washing practices and critical behaviors in general as well as after visiting toilet avt more than half of the participants claimed to wash both hands with soap and water as recommended with both hands soap water in round1 table 1 in round2 the percentages of recommended hw practices increased as compared to round1 as follows 81 of general hw increased from 57 among female participants 75 of general hw from 52 among male participants 95 of avt from 60 among female participants and 96 of avt from 65 among male participants a comparison of all proportions of the recommended hw both hands soap water against other methods single hand and or no soap for general and avt between round1 and round2 showed significant differences at p 01 among males and females by means of the chi square test this indicates that the reported recommended hw general and avt practices increased in a statistically significant way between round1 and round2 in round2 the percentage of hw before eating meals bem increased to 11 6 from 5 8 for women round1 and to 15 7 from 11 6 for men round1 however in round2 the percentage of recommended bem practices increased to 11 6 from 5 8 for women round1 and to 15 7 from 11 6 for male participants round1 the recommended bem practices therefore did not show a statistically significant difference between round1 and round2 at p 50 we should point out that within the same round avt or bem practices did not show statistically significant differences at p 10 among female and male participants however the chi square value of 17 505 was found during comparisons of proportions to be less than 20 s hw and equal to more than 20 s hw between female and male participants in the second round the value 17 505 is greater than 10 83 the 0 1 point for the chi squared distribution with degree of freedom p 001 indicating that the women may have washed their hands over a longer duration than did the men in this study it should be mentioned that in round2 80 of male and female participants claimed that cleaning hands through the use of sanitizers by all members of a family at home was not affordable or practicable when the participants were asked whether it was possible or not to implement the recommended hw practices more than 70 of men and women in the second round claimed that it would be not possible or would be difficult to practice see fig 4 further disconnects with recommended procedures were revealed regarding single handedness during the fgds all of the fgds claimed that as a part of local culture regardless of religious affiliation most people hw only the right hand before eating meals bem by bringing water in a jug or glass and washing on a bowl or plate in the dining place or inside the house photo 1 the belief is strongly held that left hand is dirty because it is used for post defecation cleaning therefore people do not accept or like bringing the left hand in contact with the right hand before eating in addition since only the right hand is used for eating the washing of only right hw was thought to be ok most of the participants in the fgds mentioned that after visiting toilet avt in contrast to bem the majorities of people wash both hands one hand after another hand with soap while holding and pouring water from the container by another hand photo 2 when asked why people were able to hw using both hands by rubbing scrubbing closely with water before islamic ablutions for their five prayers per day most of the bangladeshi people are muslim the consensus in 5 out of 8 fgds was that this behavior was a religious ritual and there was a need to purify before prayer to participants this behavior was not connected to real hw interpreted as health and or dirt cleaning promoted behaviors 3 2 facilities used during handwashing the sites and facilities used for the two critical hws during a single day were different in same house for most of the participants in the two rounds the sites and facilities used are shown in table 2 all participants reported the presence of fixed tube well pond or storage water or mobile water carried water in bucket jug glass or other container to the facility location for both avt and bem the use of a basin or bathroom for hw before eating meals bem was reported by about 6 of male and 2 of female participants during round1 and 8 of male and 9 of female participants during round2 soap was kept in the basin or bathroom sites regarding facilities of avt practices about 88 of female and 83 of male participants in round1 and 98 of female and 100 of male participants in round2 claimed that soap was present or they carried soap to the hw sites facilities from places inside the home however regarding facilities of bem practices it was reported that soap was present or carried by 13 of the female respondents and 18 of male respondents in round1 and 26 of female and 28 of male respondents in round2 respectively thus there was an important difference regarding the presence of soap when doing hw in avt versus bem contexts i e much more use in the context of avt the basin users and some bathroom users had access to running water during the hours in which there was a supply of running water as pipe water supply followed the intermittent water supply more than 95 of the participants did not have access to running water it should be pointed out that the venues except for basin and pond sites demanded one hand either for pumping using a hand pump or for pouring water using such implements as a jug mug or glass from water containers the majority of participants from five or more fgds declared the following the lack of access to a convenient facility for hw with running water hampers the washing of both hands frequent hw by all members of a family increases the water collection burden on women from tube wells or other unconnected water sources washing hands with soap requires an additional amount of water which further increases the water management burden on women there was a drainage problem of rinsed water there was a lack of affordability for soap the predominance of cultural and religious patterns conflicted with elements of the handedness component i e the recommended practice of washing both hands the lack of appropriate education and communication about the need for recommended hw processes such as how rubbing helps hw how soap kills the coronavirus how to wash both hands under hand pumped water and how to wash both hands while pouring water from glass mug by one hand was noted among other needed messages there was inadequate motivation for change in adopting all of the recommended critical hw practices based on these incompatibilities with real life what is actually done as opposed to what is recommended a female local government member ward 5 assasuni participant in an fgd said that the promotion of a dedicated defined facility for hw can help advance the recommended hw practices just as hand pumps did for safe water in rural areas however one fgd participant from sirajganj even thought that a dedicated facility for hw was an unusual idea commenting i have never seen a fixed place for all forms of hw in a day we usually wash hands outside or inside a house based on the location of where the need for hw is perceived and not on a facility an fgd participant from assasuni also stated i wash hands near my tube well because i do not want to burden my wife with water collection for hw she already has to collect drinking water for family i give the same advice to my children these perceptions would have to be dealt with if a dedicated facility for hw is to be promoted effectively 3 3 compliance to recommend hw practices and sdg basic hygiene service here compliance to recommend hw practices refer to all the critical hw practices includes the same recommended and promoted hw practices both hands soap water and the sdg basic hygiene service hw facility soap water in household the z values and p values found by normal test for comparison of two proportions regarding the same individuals compliances to the recommended hw practice and to the sdg basic hygiene service conditions are presented in table 3 and figure 3 the reported compliances to the recommended hw practices regarding avt and bem with respect to the same individuals statistically differed significantly p 001 among both female and male participants in round1 as well as round2 also the compliances to the sdg basic hygiene service related to the two critical hw practices in same individuals were found to be statistically significantly different p 001 in other words the compliance of two significantly different critical hws avt versus bem practices by an estimated single value or of the sdg basic hygiene service level by a single estimated value may contradict the real conditions found in these locations single estimated values may not represent well the true situation and some form of disaggregation will be needed if the real conditions are to be identified 3 4 hw promotion toward the prevention of covid 19 the majority of people in the country have increased their general knowledge about recommended hw practices through the covid 19 prevention campaign almost all participants mentioned the mobile phone operators ring tones during the first several months as well as radio and tv advertisements during the pandemic less frequently mentioned was government or non government institutional programs as information sources more than 70 of both female and male participants said in interviews that they washed hands more frequently during the covid 19 than before the pandemic however most of the participants in almost all of the fgds stated negligible sustained increase with regard to recommended practices for hw before eating meals bem and in its associated facilities during the pandemic the fgds also pointed out the communication weaknesses in covering rural or local contexts such as advertisements that showed hw under running water given that rural people rarely have access to running water the advertisements also do not explain how to do hand rubbing scrubbing of both hands with soap in order to remove covid 19 germs or other relevant points that might help rural or local residents move toward more effective hw practices 4 discussion this study has characterized prevailing procedures and identified challenges to achieve the recommended hw practices of washing both hands with soap and water and to achieve the hw facility indicator specified in sdg 6 2 1b in rural bangladesh the sdg target for hw is 100 of the population using a hw facility with soap and water at home sdg basic hygiene service in the five locations of the study area approximately 80 of the female and male participants households 78 86 used groundwater for hw purposes through hand tube wells tw at their premises overall the recommended general and avt practices of hw increased significantly between round1 approximately greater than 50 and round2 approximately greater than 81 at p 01 among both men and women however the adherence for recommended hw both hands soap water before eating meals bem was very low and remained very low less than 20 among both female and male groups during both rounds at p 10 this reinforced previous reports that changing the prevailing hw practices in certain contexts such as bem on a large scale had little success and that a significant gap between knowledge of what should be done and actual practice exists in addition the recommended hw practices of avt bem as well as of sdg basic services of avt and bem regarding the same individuals compliances were widely different at p 001 this research could not estimate and present one value for the recommended hw practice or sdg indicator facility level based on these two critical hw observations avt versus bem behavior it is also important to note that the matthew et al 2014 survey national survey reported that 71 4 of bangladesh rural household members used a basic service of hw facility bangladesh bureau of statistics and unicef bangladesh 2019 the bangladesh national hygiene survey 2018 reported that 55 and 40 respondents mentioned using water and soap after using the toilet and before eating respectively while 61 of hws were said to be located with water and soap within 30 feet of the latrine bangladesh bureau of statistics and informatics division ministry of planning 2020 the national hygiene survey did not estimate the level of sdg indicator facility level of hw the current study could not estimate one value for the recommended hw practice or sdg indicator facility level based on these two critical hw observations avt and bem in contrast national monitoring did attempt to determine the proportion of household members with fixed or mobile hw facilities water and or soap observed on premises in the dwelling yard or plot bangladesh bureau of statistics and unicef bangladesh 2019 in order to estimate the following household members with a handwashing facility on premises with soap and water available meet the sdg criteria for a basic handwashing facility it is important to note that the national monitoring dataset was not segregated between critical hw practices however in the current study the mobile phone based interview questionnaire data have been used and the data segregated over critical hws such as after visiting toilet avt and before eating meals bem thus the segregated data seems to bring us to different conclusions than is true if the data is not segregated in this way the pressing need is to determine evidence for the presence of water soap and location bundled into appropriate facilities that would actually allow the recommended hw behaviors to be realistically carried out according to the definition of facility in the matthew et al 2014 survey the inclusion of the mobile carried water by jug bucket or other container and or soap to the hw location in terms of the presence of those items at the facility could create confusion because those items are used for various purposes and are present in most of the houses the current study also found that the handedness aspect was found to be one of the main barriers in realizing the recommended hw practices the participants claimed that it was difficult to wash both hands while pouring water by one hand in absence of running water the washing of both hands with water and soap by rubbing scrubbing are components of the globally recommended hw as it creates the friction that helps lift dirt grease microbes and other contaminants and allows them to be rinsed off the hands hoque et al 1995a 1995b hoque et al 1995 curtis et al 2011 nuhu amin et al 2014 this means the existing definition of basic facility does not necessarily include an enabling mechanism for the recommended hw behavior we should note that recommended hw behavior would include the most effective use of tap water for example in bangladesh during the covid 19 pandemic a study reported that when hands were scrubbed and washed with soap under running tap water approximately 1 7 l of water per handwash were overused sayeed et al 2021 in addition to emphasizing the need for behavioral change effectively scrubbing both hands with soap and water better communication about the importance of hw without the overuse of water is important to prevent the wastage of water resources recently efforts are ongoing for the innovation and development of hw facilities in home environments unicef bangladesh 2021 kristyna et al 2013 bliqis et al 2022 the bangladesh national hygiene promotion strategy 2012 related to handwashing included hw with soap and water access to hw facilities and their maintenance behavior change communication bcc improved social norms community participation social marketing coordination among ministries departments ngos and other organizations advocacy with participation of women and religious leaders mobilization of local resources and other related issues all of which need to be realized on the ground however the strategy did not clearly state the importance of the washing of both hands or other aspects of behavior and facilities that may be easily overlooked without more specific ways to identify what is actually happening and for what reason to address the gap in data regarding the actual use of hw facilities and bring useful sdg proxy hygiene information to the forefront there are several immediate and longer term approaches that might be adopted these include a adapt the present focus to include running water for both hands and the presence of soap b incorporate the presence of further defined and improved hw facilities for all hw purposes in each household and c revisit the measurement methods based on local contexts hw related behavioral change programs must consider cultural economic environmental knowledge related and other key behavioral determinants of handwashing in real contexts sian white et al 2020 water aid international 2020 rabbi1 and dey 2013 aarin palomares 2020 the significant related finding regarding a total disconnect in concept and purpose between religious habits of washing both hands before prayer time left hand after visiting toilet hoque et al 1995 and right hand before eating meals in bangladesh hoque et al 1995 rabbi1 and dey 2013 implies that the knowledge base of hw purposes and its relation to germ reduction and disease prevention are lacking the multiplicity of ideas about hw purposes was further emphasized when fgd groups brought out that hw for religious purposes while classified as to purify was not the same process as that of real hw i e hw involving critical behaviors regarding health as is true elsewhere in south asia water aid international 2020 the overall reach of mass media has been high in bangladesh the knowledge about hw of over 20 s duration improved significantly between the two rounds of data collection however fgds revealed that information conveyed about the need for and how the steps in recommended hw practices help to make hands safe was not convincing to the general population it is important that communication and educational information are understood by and then motivate behavioral change across all communities water aid international 2020 difficulties in the affordability of soap and the volume of water required to rinse soap off have also been shown to discourage the use of soap for hw hoque et al 1995 hoque 2003 the duration of hw was found to be statistically longer among female than male participants in the study female hw practices were reported to be better than male practices elsewhere watutantrige et al 2012 however gender perspectives with regard to hw came up as a real concern when the issue about requirement of significantly increased volume of water collection for the washing of both hands with soap by all members was mentioned the landscape of the water gender hw nexus as has been described here needs more work to understand as well as the need to formulate related policies and programs while this study concentrated on the components practices and difficulties in hw with respect to the rural bangladesh population the paradigm presented in a schematic diagram figure 2 represents more abstract concepts which merit its consideration in all hw efforts whether for urban and rural population and whether in developed or developing countries if it is incorporated as a guiding concept it has the potential to address at least some of the barriers and difficulties and contribute toward obtaining real change regarding recommended hw practices interventions or programs that are matched to local contexts are expected to perform better than more generalized projects 5 conclusions the information gathered from the mobile phone based data and fgds conducted during this study reveals the complexity of hw practices of the communities with respect to the recommended critical hw practices together with the gaps in the mechanisms of monitoring of hw behavior and available facilities that conflict with the key recommendations from the prevailing national as well as sdg perspectives the recommended general and avt practices of hw increased significantly between 62 and 95 5 in round1 and round2 among both men and women but the adherence for recommended hw both hands soap water bem was remained very low between 7 and 13 6 among both female and male groups during both rounds the study also identifies the need for an expansion of the basic paradigm for hw to be utilized in other programs that have sustainable development as a goal the lack of access to appropriate facilities with running water for washing both hands gaps in the monitoring approach inadequate consideration of local social and cultural factors weak gender equality and equity a lack of appropriate communications and motivation and other issues were identified as barriers to sustainable hw behavior further research and development to address the above mentioned challenges are recommended the development and use of a different framework for discussions and future research efforts could shed further light on additional measures needed to effect the desired changes and ensure that the intended goals are actually met
