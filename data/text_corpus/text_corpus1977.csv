9885,plastic film mulching is a widely used and effective field practice to improve crop water productivity cwp especially in arid and semiarid areas the positive effects of soil mulching on crop yields and cwp have been studied through numerous field experiments and simulations at the site scale however few studies have focused on assessing mulching effects at the regional scale the zhangye basin a typical arid region in the middle heihe river basin of northwest china was chosen as the focus of the present study the aquacrop model a water driven crop growth model was first calibrated and validated using field observations from three experimental stations and extended to the regional scale by considering the spatial heterogeneity of soil meteorology crop characteristics irrigation treatment and land use change three mulching practices under current irrigation schedules were simulated in the well validated model for a 20 year period 1995 2015 the results showed that plastic film mulching conserved soil water and significantly reduced nonproductive evaporation crop transpiration and yield were enhanced while evapotranspiration decreased under mulching compared to no mulching half film mulching and major film mulching with 70 coverage effectively improved cwps at the regional scale with respective average increases of 7 2 0 9 and 14 1 2 2 for seed maize and 4 1 0 7 and 7 8 1 0 for spring wheat the results demonstrated that the impacts of plastic film mulching on cwp varied with crop type and location in relation to water input the regional evaluation also identified one particular area ganzhou as the most suitable to apply plastic films especially to seed maize this study offers a better understanding of agronomic practices and helps improve cwp more effectively

basin 1 introduction agriculture is the largest freshwater consumer in the world accounting for nearly 70 of annual water withdrawals globally http www fao org land water databases and software aquastat with the developing economy and growing population the stress of water resource usage and the need for food production have increased global food production needs to increase by 50 to satisfy the demand for more than 9 billion people by 2050 fao et al 2017 water resource sustainability and food security have faced severe challenges water resources are scarcer and more likely to be influenced by human activities in arid and semiarid regions which have more water stress with respect to both ecosystems and social economies and more threats to food security hanjra and qureshi 2010 kahil et al 2015 wang et al 2012 to relieve or solve water scarcity increasing water productivity has become an important and effective method in most cases kang et al 2017 wallace 2000 crop water productivity cwp is defined as the crop yield produced per unit of water lost by evapotranspiration et which can be improved by increasing the crop yield with a given water usage or reducing water usage with a given yield molden 1997 singh et al 2006 steduto et al 2012 improving cwp at different scales to meet the water demand has been studied for many years such as deficit irrigation precision irrigation agronomic practices and soil management molden et al 2010 wallace and batchelor 1997 cooper et al 1987 pointed out that the most effective way to improve cwp under water deficit conditions was to reduce soil evaporation which made plastic film mulching the most direct way to reach this aim in arid and semiarid regions compared with other cover materials plastic films not only evidently reduce soil evaporation but also increase the soil temperature to obtain higher production chakraborty et al 2008 liu et al 2009 many studies have been conducted using plot and field experiments to assess the effects of plastic film mulching on crop water consumption and yields in arid and semiarid areas the results indicated that plastic film mulching effectively increased the yields and cwps of maize bu et al 2013 filipović et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 and wheat chakraborty et al 2008 li et al 1999 xie et al 2005 beyond field experimental studies numerical models such as aquacrop have been adopted to simulate the effect of soil mulching on cwp chukalla et al 2015 ćosić et al 2017 ran et al 2017 these studies mainly focused on a field scale while few of them at the regional scale took spatial heterogeneity into account han et al 2014 and zhang et al 2018 simulated the impacts of plastic film mulching on regional maize yields through the denitrification decomposition model in shaanxi and on the loess plateau respectively nouri et al 2019 assessed the effects of mulching and drip irrigation on virtual water in the upper litani basin using the aquacrop os model to the best of our knowledge studies evaluating the regional impact of plastic film mulching on soil moisture yield evapotranspiration and cwp for a long period over twenty years have not been reported the zhangye basin a typical arid river basin in northwest china was chosen to study the influence of agronomic practices on cwp the zhangye basin is one of the essential commercial grain production areas and the largest seed maize production base of china yang et al 2015 the zhangye basin is also the main water consumption area with the majority of the population in the heihe river basin hrb which is the second largest inland river basin in china cheng et al 2014 the study area faces not only the sustainability challenge between the food and water nexus of the oasis itself but also the conflict of agricultural activity and ecological security between the midstream and downstream parts of the river basin the objectives of this study are to 1 establish a long term distributed model based on aquacrop with full consideration of land use change and spatial heterogeneity 2 simulate the soil water content yield et and cwp for the zhangye basin 3 determine the sensitive parameters based on the global sensitivity analysis method for the aquacrop model 4 assess the effects of plastic film mulching on the cwps of seed maize and spring wheat and 5 identify the most suitable area for plastic film mulching application this work could help understand the impacts of management practices on cwp at the regional scale and provide important implications for promoting plastic film application in arid and semiarid areas thus spatial and quantitative analyses could contribute to improving cwp and reducing water consumption more effectively and precisely 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the zhangye basin is located midstream of the hrb and includes three administrative districts namely ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county the study area fig 1 has an area of approximately 9000 km2 with elevations ranging from 1290 m in the northwest to 2200 m in the southeast wu et al 2014 the major land use types are farmland and gobi desert and the main soil textures are loam and silty loam the zhangye basin has a typically arid continental climate with an average annual precipitation of approximately 120 mm mainly from june to september fig 2a and the annual reference evapotranspiration et0 is about 1200 mm the long term daily sunshine duration approximately 8 h and large day night temperature difference provide a suitable environment for crop growth the study area used to be the main production area of spring wheat and after 2002 the sown area of seed maize increased due to its high water productivity and economic profit fig 2c shi et al 2014 seed maize became the staple crop in the zhangye basin and its production accounted for more than 40 of the total national amount of maize seed chinese academy of agricultural engineering 2012 the growth periods of seed maize and spring wheat are generally from april to september and march to july respectively irrigation is needed to meet the gap between rainfall and crop water demands in the zhangye basin the mean annual net irrigation water consumption is 0 94 billion m3 in this region mainly relying on surface water however before 2000 the rapid development of agricultural activity in the midstream diverted excessive surface water from the heihe river leading to a significant decrease in river runoff and deterioration of the ecological environment downstream chen et al 2005 to help restore the downstream ecosystem a water reallocation plan has been implemented since late 2000 as a result the river discharge from midstream to downstream has been restricted under different hydrologic years cheng et al 2014 as limited surface water diversion hardly satisfies the need for irrigation the intensity of groundwater exploitation has increased leading to declines in the groundwater level and storage tian et al 2015a wu et al 2016 2 2 the fao crop model aquacrop aquacrop is a water driven crop growth model developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao that simulates crop biomass and yield responses to water the principle of aquacrop calculating crop yield evolves from the doorenbos and kassam 1979 approach 1 1 y y x k y 1 et et x where y and y x are the actual and maximum yields et and et x are the actual and maximum evapotranspiration and k y is a yield response factor describing the effect of a reduction in evapotranspiration on yield losses aquacrop simulates crop growth and final yield by following four simple steps in series at daily time steps 1 simulating crop foliage development using green canopy cover 2 estimating daily transpiration tr i based on a simple canopy growth and senescence model 3 calculating aboveground biomass production b from normalized water productivity wp and tri and 4 treating the final yield y as a function of the final biomass and harvest index hi 0 the version of aquacrop in this study is version 5 0 and the equations involved are as follows raes et al 2009b 2 tr i k s kc tr x cc et 0 i 3 b ks b wp i tr i et 0 i 4 y f hi hi 0 b where ks is the soil water stress coefficient kc tr x is the crop coefficient for maximum crop transpiration cc is the canopy cover adjusted by micro advective effects et 0 i is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 i is the day of the cropping period ks b is the cold stress coefficient for biomass production hi 0 is the reference harvest index and f hi is a multiplier considering various stresses that adjust the harvest index from hi 0 soil evaporation e is multiplied by reference evapotranspiration et 0 with the soil water evaporation coefficient ke and evaporation reduction coefficient of water stress kr 5 e kr ke et 0 field management practices such as mulching and tillage practices have been included in aquacrop by considering the interaction between the soil and crop the simulation of mulching is considered as the fraction of soil surface covered and evaporation prevented the soil water evaporation coefficient under mulching is adjusted into ke adj as shown in eq 6 raes et al 2009b 6 ke adj 1 f m per m 1 cc ke x where f m is the adjustment factor for the effect of mulch on soil evaporation which is close to 1 0 for plastic mulches allen et al 1998 per m is the percentage covered by the mulch and ke x is the maximum soil evaporation coefficient for fully wet and not shaded soil surfaces further details of the model concepts and structures are described in three companion papers hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009b steduto et al 2009 2 3 multisource data for the modeling the input requirements for the aquacrop model consist of climatic data crop soil and groundwater characteristics and management including field and irrigation management spatial information on land use and cropping structure was considered when establishing a distributed model table 1 2 3 1 meteorological zones the climate input data for aquacrop include daily precipitation the maximum and minimum temperature eto and the concentration of co2 the first three were directly derived from meteorological stations inside and near the study area zhangye linze gaotai and jinta stations eto was estimated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 through the aquacrop model itself and the co2 concentration was assumed to be the default value provided by the model which was the mean annual atmospheric co2 concentration measured in mauna loa since 1958 the study area was divided into four meteorological zones based on the thiessen polygon method singh et al 2006 2 3 2 cropping structure and crop growth period the cropping structure in the study area is complicated and it is difficult to obtain its spatial change every year according to the statistical data from 1995 to 2015 the staple crops in ganzhou linze and gaotai were spring wheat and seed maize hence the growth of these two crops was simulated and monocropping was assumed during the simulation period the area was divided into three zones based on crop growth periods we generalized the average crop growth periods of spring wheat and seed maize by analyzing yearly data from national agrometeorological stations and linze station fig 3 2 3 3 soil texture and hydraulic parameters the soil texture data collected in this study were composed of five layers 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 60 cm and 60 100 cm including the percentage of sand and clay in each layer the data were first resampled to 1 km 1 km grids which were used in the groundwater model the proportions of sand and clay of five layers and those soil textures were obtained for the grids from which three soil hydraulic parameters θ s θ fc θ wp were calculated as follows campbell 1974 koren et al 2003 7 θ s 0 00126 f sand 0 489 8 ψ s 7 74 e 0 0302 f sand 9 b 0 159 f clay 2 91 10 θ fc θ s ψ fc ψ s 1 b 11 θ wp θ s ψ wp ψ s 1 b where f sand and f clay are the percentages of soil sand and clay ψ s ψ fc and ψ wp represent the soil matric potential at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting points respectively kpa and b is the campbell slope ks was estimated by the rosetta program and cn was determined by the saturated conductivity of the topsoil thus we obtained the soil hydraulic parameters of five layers for the aquacrop model in each 1 km 1 km grid the soil hydraulic parameters of lowest soil layer 60 100 cm were assumed to be valid for subsoil due to the lack of soil texture data collected for deeper soil 100 cm 2 3 4 land use the simulated region was cultivated land so we collected land use maps of four years the spatial distribution of cultivated land did not change dramatically during the simulation period which was mostly located in the plain area and rarely in the piedmont area the growth of cultivated fields in ganzhou linze and gaotai slowed from 1995 to 2010 but accelerated after 2011 fig 2b considering the change in land use and land cover we separated the simulation period into four stages 1995 2002 2003 2006 2007 2009 and 2010 2015 2 3 5 groundwater depth the water volume of capillary rise from groundwater in the area with a shallow groundwater depth has been considered in the aquacrop model which is related to groundwater depth soil texture and hydraulic properties raes et al 2015 the groundwater model used in this study was based on wu et al 2014 and its simulation period was extended from 1995 to 2015 the spatial resolution was 1 km 1 km and the monthly groundwater level and depth were simulated aquacrop only considers the condition where groundwater depth is less than 10 m hence there was no groundwater input file for the areas where the groundwater depth exceeded 10 m 2 3 6 field and irrigation management most of the cultivated land in the study area was irrigated farmland flood irrigation has been the traditional irrigation method for years zhang et al 2006 when simulating mulching we selected synthetic plastic mulches as the types of surface mulch in the aquacrop model and the fraction of soil evaporation reduction was set to 100 f m 1 chukalla et al 2015 the irrigation schedule is composed of irrigation time irrigation frequency and irrigation water quota three irrigation schedule zones and their irrigation times were derived from the literature collected and are shown in fig 3 with limited information about the spring wheat irrigation schedule in gaotai we assumed that the spring wheat irrigation time and frequency in gaotai were the same as those in linze this assumption was based on the similarity of elevation and climate conditions between gaotai and linze the irrigation norm in different hydrological years was calculated from annual water management reports table 2 and divided by the irrigation frequency to obtain the irrigation water quota furthermore winter irrigation has been widely applied in the study area to ensure crop emergence the winter irrigation depth in the model was approximately 100 mm xie et al 2005 which often occurred on 25th october 2 4 model setup and simulation due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil meteorology and other data we established a distributed model to simulate crop growth at the basin scale as aquacrop is a one dimensional model we generated thousands of simulated units fig 4 by first overlaying cultivated land distribution and groundwater model grids through a geographic information system and then combining zonal meteorological crop growth the irrigation schedule and field management data table 1 each simulated unit with an irregular shape was assumed to be homogenous and the input variables were the same the numbers of simulated units in the four periods were 3558 3723 3935 and 3979 consistent with the increase in the cultivated area in recent years the lateral movement of soil water can be neglected due to the flat terrain therefore the combination of several one dimensional simulated units could represent the regional distributed model the simulation period was from 1995 to 2015 depending on sufficient data collected as we generalized the date of winter irrigation in the previous year the model running period was from 25th october 1994 to the end of the crop growth period of 2015 the initial water content of the soil profile was set as the field capacity when winter irrigation occurred 2 5 model calibration and validation the model was first calibrated and validated using experimental data at the field scale and then its performance was evaluated at the basin scale at the field scale soil hydraulic parameters were the first to be calibrated and validated with the aim of observed soil water contents through the parameter estimation pest doherty 1994 method with good simulation results for soil water contents crop parameters were further adjusted with the aim of observed canopy cover biomass and yield successively the trial and error method was selected to calibrate influential crop parameters following singh et al 2006 hsiao et al 2009 and li and ren 2019 the noninfluential parameters were assigned the default values from the aquacrop reference manual raes et al 2009a and values collected from previous studies for the basin scale annual crop yield data over the simulation period of 1995 2015 and etwatch remote sensing data liu et al 2011 wu et al 2012 from 2000 to 2014 were collected for comparison with the model outputs according to the data collected from three experimental sites ganzhou and linze had complete records of the soil water content crop canopy cover aboveground biomass and yield while gaotai lacked canopy cover and biomass data table 3 foliage development is expressed through canopy cover instead of leaf area index lai in aquacrop as lai was more commonly measured than canopy cover at the field scale empirical relationships between canopy cover and lai for maize eq 10 and wheat eq 11 were adopted to make full use of the observed data hsiao et al 2009 nielsen et al 2012 12 cc 1 005 1 exp 0 6 lai 1 2 13 cc 0 94 1 exp 0 43 lai 0 52 we selected several statistical indicators to evaluate the simulations objectively and synthetically including the root mean square error rmse jamieson et al 1991 willmott s index of agreement d and mean bias error mbe willmott and matsuura 2005 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 15 nrmse 1 o 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 100 16 d 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 17 mbe 1 n i 1 n p i o i where o i and p i are the observed and simulated values o is the mean value of the observations and n is the number of observed simulated values 2 6 plastic film mulching effect analysis to further assess the effects of plastic film mulching on cwp three mulching practices were considered in the model no mulching with per m 0 m0 half film mulching with per m 50 m1 and major film mulching with per m 70 m2 the major film mulching percentage was based on ran et al 2017 and shen et al 2019 the current irrigation schedule was applied when simulating the three mulching practices the unit simulated outputs were summarized into irrigation zones which were twenty one in this study fig 4 we first compared the soil water contents under different mulching practices the average topsoil 0 30 cm simulated water contents of the crop growth period were calculated because mulching practices have a more significant effect on the topsoil water content than on other depths wang et al 2016b furthermore simulated crop yield et and cwp under different mulching percentages were compared at the county scale 2 7 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis will help understand the impacts of parameters on model results identify the model s most influential parameters and then calibrate the model better and more effectively cariboni et al 2007 vanuytrecht et al 2014 for complex nonlinear models only global sensitivity analysis can provide the relevant information on the sensitivity of model results to the whole range of variation of model input parameters varella et al 2010 the parameters in aquacrop are mainly categorized into soil hydraulic parameters and crop parameters the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast saltelli 1999 was selected as a global sensitivity analysis method in this study and has already been applied to aquacrop and other crop growth models li and ren 2019 vanuytrecht et al 2014 xing et al 2017 the first order index s i and the total sensitivity index st i were used to measure the main contribution of each single parameter x i to the total output variance and the interaction effects involving parameter x i respectively these two sensitivity indices are defined as follows 18 s i v i v y 19 st i v y v i v y the values of s i and st i range from 0 to 1 higher values indicate that parameter x i has more effects on the model results parameter x i is considered influential when s i 0 05 or st i 0 10 dejonge et al 2012 vanuytrecht et al 2014 xing et al 2017 2 7 1 parameter ranges and distribution the soil profile can be divided into five horizons in aquacrop the soil hydraulic parameters include the saturated water content θ s field capacity θ fc permanent wilting point θ wp saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of each soil layer and the curve number cn of the topsoil the soil profile and soil texture of the three sites were generalized based on the soil texture or soil particle composition from previous studies the ranges of the soil hydraulic parameters table s1 were determined following saxton and rawls 2006 except cn which was given a range related to the ks of the topsoil the ranges of most crop parameters table s2 were determined by the aquacrop reference manual raes et al 2009a and the remaining parameter ranges fluctuated from the default values or values in previous papers due to the unknown distributions of most parameters uniform parameter distributions were assigned in this study the assumption was based on that model output sensitivity depends primarily on the assigned parameter ranges rather than on the distribution helton 1993 2 7 2 sensitivity experiment setting the number of model runs required for a complete sensitivity analysis per climate crop soil meteorology combination is defined as follows saltelli 1999 wang et al 2013 20 c n n s n n r 2 m ω max 1 where ns is the sample size of each parameter n is the number of parameters nr is the number of search curves with hyperspace m is the interaction factor and ѡ max is the maximum frequency in this study the numbers of parameters subjected to the sensitivity analysis were 21 for the soil hydraulic parameters and 43 for the crop parameters the crop canopy cover aboveground biomass and yield were analyzed for the crop parameters while the soil water contents were analyzed for the soil hydraulic parameters the sensitivity analysis results are reliable when the sample size of each parameter is larger than 65 for the efast method saltelli 1999 li and ren 2019 discussed the sample size in detail and thus ns was set to 513 n r 1 m 4 ѡ max 64 in this study we first defined the number of parameters and their ranges and distributions simlab ver 2 2 1 software tarantola 2005 was used to generate sets of crop parameters through monte carlo sampling matlab software was then used to read the parameter sets generate the input file for soil sol and crop cro modules and call the aquacrop plug in ascav50 to run the simulations in batches after model executions the results were extracted and reorganized for simlab analysis finally the s i and st i of each parameter were calculated using simlab for each experimental site the numbers of model runs in the soil hydraulic parameter and crop parameter sensitivity analysis were 10773 and 23085 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation results at the experimental stations fig 5 demonstrates good calibration and validation results for the soil water contents at the three experimental stations the mbe values for the soil water content simulation were 0 01 cm3 cm 3 and 0 00 cm3 cm 3 during the calibration and validation periods respectively the mbe showed that the simulated soil water content was not obviously overestimated or underestimated the d values were greater than 0 90 in the two simulation periods indicating a good simulation of the soil water content the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters are listed in table s3 fig 6 and fig s1 illustrate the calibration and validation results for green canopy cover aboveground biomass and yield at the three experimental stations the mbe values for seed maize green canopy cover and aboveground biomass were close to 0 during the calibration and validation periods indicating good agreement for both canopy cover and biomass and the model did not overestimate or underestimate the observations the simulated yield underestimated the observed values with mbes of 1 19 ton ha 1 and 0 13 ton ha 1 during the calibration and validation periods respectively the statistical indicators showed that the model performed well in simulating seed maize green canopy cover and yield with moderately good performance for aboveground biomass the larger error in biomass simulation was attributed to the constant value of wp in aquacrop during the whole crop growth period which changed in different growth stages based on field observations ran et al 2018 similar to seed maize the comparison process was applied to spring wheat crop parameter calibration and validation the mbe values during calibration periods for green canopy cover aboveground biomass and yield were 5 31 0 76 ton ha 1 and 0 43 ton ha 1 respectively the corresponding values were 2 3 0 51 ton ha 1 and 0 09 ton ha 1 during the validation period these mbe values indicated that the model slightly overestimated green canopy cover and yield during calibration and underestimated these values during validation the statistical variables especially the high d values indicated that the calibrated model had a good prediction of canopy cover biomass and yield the main calibrated crop parameters are listed in table 4 and the remaining crop parameters were set as default values raes et al 2009a 3 2 regional validation 3 2 1 crop yield fig 7 shows the comparison between the simulated crop yields and annual yields collected from statistical yearbooks at the county scale the mean nrmse values were 10 1 for seed maize yield and 11 0 for spring wheat respectively the other statistical indicators are listed in table 5 showing good performance in modeling crop yield at the basin scale 3 2 2 cwps fig 8 presents the spatial distribution of simulated seed maize and spring wheat cwps in 2015 there was an obvious spatial difference in the simulated cwps which were lower in the southeastern part than in the northwestern part for both seed maize and spring wheat the simulated seed maize cwp also showed a similar spatial pattern as han et al 2019 furthermore the results were upscaled to the county extent and validated due to the changing number of simulated units and limited information collected during the simulation period the average cwps at ganzhou linze and gaotai for seed maize were 1 62 kg m 3 1 80 kg m 3 and 1 74 kg m 3 respectively and those for spring wheat were 1 46 kg m 3 1 37 kg m 3 and 1 48 kg m 3 respectively our model outputs were reasonable compared with previous studies fig 9 which were also in the range of global and cwps of maize 1 1 2 7 kg m 3 and wheat 0 6 1 7 kg m 3 foley et al 2019 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 3 2 3 et et simulations were compared to the etwatch data to crosscheck the model performance the main crop was seed maize during the simulation period so maize monocropping was assumed in the study area as the etwatch data were monthly the model simulation period was lengthened from 1st april to 30th september to obtain monthly simulated et values as presented in fig 10a the et values simulated by aquacrop were higher than those simulated by etwatch owing to our assumption that all farmlands planted seed maize other local hydrological model simulation outputs were also compared to validate our regional model fig 10b the aquacrop model simulation period was lengthened from 1st january to 31st december to obtain annual simulated et values tian et al 2015b and sun et al 2018 simulated the mean annual et values for farmland in the middle and lower heihe river basin by gsflow 2000 2012 and gsflow gehm 2000 2012 wu et al 2015 estimated that the et of cultivated land in the study area was 450 mm and it was 490 mm on average in li et al 2016 the comparison results indicated that our regional model was reliable in simulating et in summary the model that was well calibrated and validated at the experimental stations also performed well in simulating crop yields et and cwp at the basin scale the model provides a basis for further analysis of the effects of plastic film mulching on crop yield et and cwp at the basin scale 3 3 sensitivity analysis results 3 3 1 soil hydraulic parameters crop aboveground biomass or yield is often used as the objective variable in previous studies on soil hydraulic parameter sensitivity analysis for the aquacrop model however the values of soil hydraulic parameters have a direct impact on the simulated soil water content rather than the aboveground biomass and yield in this study the direct contribution of soil hydraulic parameters to the soil water content was determined the results fig 11 showed that the most sensitive soil hydraulic parameter was θ fc in each soil layer at each experimental station followed by θ wp θ fc represents the maximum amount of water that a well drained soil can hold against gravitational forces which directly affects the redistribution of soil water total available soil water drainage and capillary rise simulation in aquacrop vanuytrecht et al 2014 found that the most sensitive soil hydraulic parameters for the yields of maize and winter wheat were θ fc and θ wp through the efast method in aquacrop silvestro et al 2017 also drew the same conclusion when considering winter wheat at the three experimental stations which is consistent with our results although the sensitivity analysis results showed that θ fc and θ wp were the most sensitive soil parameters the difference of them the total available soil water was used to simulate water stress and should be noticed 3 3 2 crop parameters based on the first order sensitivity index the most sensitive crop parameters for seed maize green canopy cover were zx mat and sen at stations 1 2 and 3 respectively the abbreviations are illustrated in table s2 the most sensitive crop parameter was wp for the aboveground biomass at all experimental stations and was mat for the yield except at gaotai station the highest total sensitivity index parameter for the green canopy cover and yield was the same as the first order sensitivity index the aboveground biomass at stations 1 2 and 3 was most sensitive to wp mat and sen respectively it was found that the first order sensitivity index results were slightly different from the total sensitivity index because the latter considered the interaction between parameters baroni and tarantola 2014 the other sensitive crop parameters of seed maize are listed in table 6 although the rank may vary among stations the influential parameters were similar among these parameters ccx is involved in the canopy cover developmental process and crop phenology parameters flo sen mat have impacts on the duration of canopy senescence and crop yield formation based on the model principle vanuytrecht et al 2014 found that the most sensitive crop parameter for wheat and maize yield was mat under different climate crop soil and meteorology combinations zx affects the growth of crop roots and the root depth at each time step influences the soil total available water at that time which furthermore influences crop growth kctrx and wp affect the simulation of crop transpiration and aboveground biomass through eq 2 and eq 3 hilen is the crop parameter related to the harvest index calculation during yield formation which affects the final yield through eq 4 for spring wheat green canopy cover and yield the most sensitive crop parameter was mat from the first order sensitivity index at the three experimental stations the aboveground biomass was most sensitive to wp at stations 1 and 2 and to zx at station 3 according to the total sensitivity index the highest value for spring wheat green canopy cover was zx at stations 1 and 3 but was mat at station 2 the aboveground biomass and yield results were consistent with the first order sensitivity index the other influential crop parameters of spring wheat are shown in table s4 among these crop parameters cgc determines the rate of canopy cover expansion jin et al 2018 found that the maximum dry biomass and yield of spring wheat were sensitive to kctrx wp ccx zx and hio in aquacrop based the efast method which is similar to our results xing et al 2017 found that wp mat and kctrx were sensitive crop parameters for winter wheat aboveground biomass and flo psen and mat were sensitive crop parameters for yield although there were some differences between the winter wheat and spring wheat studied in our case previous studies still provide support for our results to some extent the influential crop parameters identified by the efast method were slightly different between seed maize and spring wheat this is because the various climate and irrigation inputs resulted in diverse environmental conditions which could influence the sensitivity results vanuytrecht et al 2014 moreover mohammadi et al 2016 discussed the different results of sensitivity analysis with various irrigation treatments which could be used to interpret the sensitivity variation among the three stations in our study 3 4 effects of plastic film mulching on cwp 3 4 1 the effect on the soil water content the average topsoil water contents increased with higher coverage of plastic films as shown in fig 12 compared to no mulching the average soil water contents of half film mulching and major film mulching under the present irrigation schedules were improved by 4 60 and 8 83 respectively during the seed maize growth period and by 2 63 and 4 78 respectively during the spring wheat growth period the soil water content improvements after plastic film mulching were mainly due to the reduction in soil evaporation with soil surface coverage chakraborty et al 2008 the results also showed that seed maize generally had higher soil water contents than spring wheat in the crop growth period the reasons are as follows first there was more rainfall that occurred in the maize growth period which covered almost the entire rainy season second due to the longer growth period april to september seed maize consumes more water and requires more irrigation input than spring wheat for seed maize the average soil water contents of linze and gaotai were typically higher than those of ganzhou because of the lower irrigation amount and infrequent timing there were no obvious differences in the average soil water contents during the spring wheat growth period among the three counties except for the luocheng district in gaotai which was markedly lower this result could be explained by the heterogeneity of the soil texture the main soil texture in luocheng district was sandy loam with low field capacity and a poor water holding capacity the outliers in fig 12a were caused by the highest annual precipitation that occurred during the simulation period 3 4 2 effects on et and yield table 7 shows that soil mulching decreased et and had opposite effects on its components e and t during the seed maize growth period the total et under half film mulching and major film mulching decreased by 5 57 and 10 70 respectively compared to no mulching the extent of the reduction in et was smaller for spring wheat with corresponding values of 3 50 and 6 60 respectively there was an evident decrease in soil evaporation when the soil surface was covered by plastic film half film mulching and major film mulching reduced soil evaporation by more than 30 and 50 respectively the soil evaporation reduction during spring wheat growth periods under mulching ranged from 39 6 to 71 1 which were larger than that of seed maize 32 5 53 8 the reason could be that spring wheat is sown earlier with lower temperature and less precipitation leading to longer periods of emergence stage than seed maize canopy cover was small and soil evaporation dominated et during the early stages resulting in a stronger soil evaporation reduction for spring wheat bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 however the total transpiration slightly increased in this work we believe that the higher soil water content under soil mulching could offer more water for crop growth and then enhance crop transpiration which is consistent with xie et al 2005 it should be noted that the proportional reduction in soil evaporation due to the presence of mulch was set to 1 in aquacrop as mentioned previously the model did not consider the damage caused to the plastic mulch by pests or diseases as a consequence the simulated soil evaporation reduction may be greater than in reality plastic film mulching enhanced crop yields and its positive effect was more apparent when a greater soil area was covered by plastic films as reported in table 7 furthermore the results revealed that soil mulching was more influential on seed maize yield than on spring wheat yield the difference in production improvements can be attributed to the higher potential yield of seed maize seed maize a c4 crop has a faster rate of photosynthesis process than spring wheat which is a c3 species qin et al 2015 in the aquacrop model the main difference between c3 and c4 crop parameters was expressed as wp which was 30 35 gm 2 for c4 crops and 15 20 gm 2 for c3 crops respectively the values affected the simulated aboveground biomass and further affected the final yield on the other hand maize is more sensitive to water stress than wheat daryanto et al 2016 ma et al 2018 plastic film mulching could help conserve more soil water to be used for crop transpiration and reduce the threat of water stress to seed maize the average soil water contents during the seed maize growth period were apparently higher than those of spring wheat indicating much more water for seed maize uptake and growth it is worth noting that the aquacrop model lacks consideration of soil temperature so the simulated yield in mulching cases may be underestimated overall the impacts of plastic film mulching on soil evaporation were more significant than those on other model outputs as shown in table 7 3 4 3 the effect on cwp fig 13 presents the cwp improvements under plastic film mulching varying from 5 0 to 19 3 for seed maize and from 2 7 to 10 4 for spring wheat respectively the regional average increases of seed maize and spring wheat cwps by half film mulching were 7 2 0 9 and 4 1 0 7 respectively with the respective corresponding increases by major film mulching were 14 1 2 2 and 7 8 1 0 the comparison showed that plastic film mulching improved cwp effectively which confirmed the results of local field experiments ma 2016 song et al 2021 wang et al 2016b xie et al 2005 found that full film mulching improved spring wheat cwps by 7 6 and 6 4 in two experimental years under similar irrigation input with our simulation wang et al 2016a observed that seed maize cwp under half film mulching was 9 3 higher than that without no mulching under high irrigation treatment due to limited experimental data in the study area data from a nearby experimental station namely shiyanghe station was also collected fan et al 2017 found that plastic film mulching with 90 coverage enhanced seed maize cwps by 19 3 on average spring wheat cwps under full film mulching increased by ranges of 7 5 27 3 and 3 2 19 8 in two year experiments yang et al 2018 there exist some differences between model results and experimental data due to water input levels mulching coverage soil properties and other factors the aquacrop model is still able to simulate plastic film mulching in comparison with field studies detailed cwp values the effects of mulching and their deviations of each district are provided in table s5 and s6 the improvements were attributed to increasing crop yield and decreasing et under soil mulching as discussed above however the amplitudes of the benefits from plastic film mulching on seed maize cwp were larger than those on spring wheat the reason could be the longer growth period of seed maize with higher average temperature and more rainfall leading to more unproductive e decreasing under mulching as a consequence the greater yield increases and et reduction brought out a more significant improvement in seed maize cwp than in spring wheat additionally the distributed model helped us identify the areas more suitable for applying plastic film mulching especially for seed maize half film mulching improved the seed maize cwp by 7 4 0 9 7 3 0 7 and 6 8 0 8 in ganzhou linze and gaotai respectively with corresponding values of 15 5 1 8 13 8 1 9 and 12 9 1 9 for major film mulching in comparison to no mulching the results showed that seed maize cwp in ganzhou benefitted the most from soil mulching the reason could be attributed to the spatial differences in water input the positive effect showed a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest with increasing irrigation amount of seed maize which is consistent with the finding of qin et al 2015 the crop growth in the study area relies mainly on irrigation which determines the water input level the higher water input for seed maize may be near the optimal range and crops obtain actual yields close to potential outputs hence the effect of mulching on seed maize cwp was weakened with high levels of irrigation from another perspective the irrigation amounts used in our simulation were generalized based on local water management reports and the irrigation depth for mulching practices may be too high which agrees with yang et al 2015 thus plastic film mulching is more suitable for deficit irrigation conditions than full irrigation however the spring wheat cwp gains under half and major film mulching were comparable at approximately 4 1 and 7 8 respectively the reason could be the smaller difference in the spring wheat irrigation level in the study area other agronomic practices should be included to enhance spring wheat cwp in the future to summarize plastic film mulching improved cwps in this arid region however the impacts were crop specific and were related to the irrigation amount the simulated results showed that seed maize was more adaptive for applying soil mulching than spring wheat at the basin scale a higher cwp will help reduce the total water consumption and irrigation water volumes to a larger extent the study area the middle reach of the hrb will release much more water for the downstream ecosystem 4 conclusions to study the effects of plastic film mulching on crop water productivity in arid areas we chose the zhangye basin as a typical arid basin to explore the impacts at the regional scale the distributed aquacrop model was established fully considering heterogeneity after soil and crop parameter calibration and validation using field experimental data different proportions of soil covered by plastic films were considered in the well validated model compared to no mulching half film mulching and major film mulching with 70 soil coverage conserved soil water and significantly reduced the soil evaporation by more than 30 and 50 respectively plastic film mulching decreased total et while slightly increasing crop transpiration the crop yields and cwps were improved by mulching and the positive effects were enhanced with increasing mulched soil area however the impacts of mulching on cwps varied spatially and were more pronounced on seed maize than on spring wheat the benefits of major film mulching to seed maize cwp were 15 5 1 8 13 8 1 9 and 12 9 1 9 in ganzhou linze and gaotai respectively with a corresponding value of 7 8 1 0 for spring wheat cwp throughout the zhangye basin the increases in cwps were mainly due to the reduction in et and showed a decreasing trend with increasing irrigation amount it is noteworthy that the irrigation events used in the simulation were full irrigation conditions which may lead to a minor increase in cwps deficit irrigation conditions should be considered in future work it is important to note that although plastic films improve cwps and crop yields plastic residues have caused a series of environmental problems such as soil hardness soil organisms change and unsustainable farmland use kirkham et al 2020 liu et al 2014 sun et al 2018 in recent years the local government has promoted plastic film recycling by regulations and economic subsidies li et al 2021 with increasing attention to environmental protection more measures such as improving mulch films quality and developing degradable plastic films are taken to alleviate plastic pollution qian et al 2018 this research provides a quantitative and spatial assessment of plastic film mulching application which helps better understand management practices the findings of the study show the potential of mulching for water savings and determine the suitable area and crop for applying plastic films the results could contribute to improving cwp more effectively and ensuring food security in arid regions there are some limitations associated with this study only seed maize and spring wheat as staple crops in the study area were simulated and monocropping was assumed in our regional simulation due to a lack of knowledge about cropping pattern changes the effects of plastic film mulching on other crops such as potatoes could be included and compared with this study in addition field management practices including plastic film mulching have costs associated with materials and labor thus economic analysis will be required to assess agronomic technology more comprehensively these

9885,plastic film mulching is a widely used and effective field practice to improve crop water productivity cwp especially in arid and semiarid areas the positive effects of soil mulching on crop yields and cwp have been studied through numerous field experiments and simulations at the site scale however few studies have focused on assessing mulching effects at the regional scale the zhangye basin a typical arid region in the middle heihe river basin of northwest china was chosen as the focus of the present study the aquacrop model a water driven crop growth model was first calibrated and validated using field observations from three experimental stations and extended to the regional scale by considering the spatial heterogeneity of soil meteorology crop characteristics irrigation treatment and land use change three mulching practices under current irrigation schedules were simulated in the well validated model for a 20 year period 1995 2015 the results showed that plastic film mulching conserved soil water and significantly reduced nonproductive evaporation crop transpiration and yield were enhanced while evapotranspiration decreased under mulching compared to no mulching half film mulching and major film mulching with 70 coverage effectively improved cwps at the regional scale with respective average increases of 7 2 0 9 and 14 1 2 2 for seed maize and 4 1 0 7 and 7 8 1 0 for spring wheat the results demonstrated that the impacts of plastic film mulching on cwp varied with crop type and location in relation to water input the regional evaluation also identified one particular area ganzhou as the most suitable to apply plastic films especially to seed maize this study offers a better understanding of agronomic practices and helps improve cwp more effectively

kahil et al 2015 wang et al 2012 to relieve or solve water scarcity increasing water productivity has become an important and effective method in most cases kang et al 2017 wallace 2000 crop water productivity cwp is defined as the crop yield produced per unit of water lost by evapotranspiration et which can be improved by increasing the crop yield with a given water usage or reducing water usage with a given yield molden 1997 singh et al 2006 steduto et al 2012 improving cwp at different scales to meet the water demand has been studied for many years such as deficit irrigation precision irrigation agronomic practices and soil management molden et al 2010 wallace and batchelor 1997 cooper et al 1987 pointed out that the most effective way to improve cwp under water deficit conditions was to reduce soil evaporation which made plastic film mulching the most direct way to reach this aim in arid and semiarid regions compared with other cover materials plastic films not only evidently reduce soil evaporation but also increase the soil temperature to obtain higher production chakraborty et al 2008 liu et al 2009 many studies have been conducted using plot and field experiments to assess the effects of plastic film mulching on crop water consumption and yields in arid and semiarid areas the results indicated that plastic film mulching effectively increased the yields and cwps of maize bu et al 2013 filipović et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 and wheat chakraborty et al 2008 li et al 1999 xie et al 2005 beyond field experimental studies numerical models such as aquacrop have been adopted to simulate the effect of soil mulching on cwp chukalla et al 2015 ćosić et al 2017 ran et al 2017 these studies mainly focused on a field scale while few of them at the regional scale took spatial heterogeneity into account han et al 2014 and zhang et al 2018 simulated the impacts of plastic film mulching on regional maize yields through the denitrification decomposition model in shaanxi and on the loess plateau respectively nouri et al 2019 assessed the effects of mulching and drip irrigation on virtual water in the upper litani basin using the aquacrop os model to the best of our knowledge studies evaluating the regional impact of plastic film mulching on soil moisture yield evapotranspiration and cwp for a long period over twenty years have not been reported the zhangye basin a typical arid river basin in northwest china was chosen to study the influence of agronomic practices on cwp the zhangye basin is one of the essential commercial grain production areas and the largest seed maize production base of china yang et al 2015 the zhangye basin is also the main water consumption area with the majority of the population in the heihe river basin hrb which is the second largest inland river basin in china cheng et al 2014 the study area faces not only the sustainability challenge between the food and water nexus of the oasis itself but also the conflict of agricultural activity and ecological security between the midstream and downstream parts of the river basin the objectives of this study are to 1 establish a long term distributed model based on aquacrop with full consideration of land use change and spatial heterogeneity 2 simulate the soil water content yield et and cwp for the zhangye basin 3 determine the sensitive parameters based on the global sensitivity analysis method for the aquacrop model 4 assess the effects of plastic film mulching on the cwps of seed maize and spring wheat and 5 identify the most suitable area for plastic film mulching application this work could help understand the impacts of management practices on cwp at the regional scale and provide important implications for promoting plastic film application in arid and semiarid areas thus spatial and quantitative analyses could contribute to improving cwp and reducing water consumption more effectively and precisely 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the zhangye basin is located midstream of the hrb and includes three administrative districts namely ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county the study area fig 1 has an area of approximately 9000 km2 with elevations ranging from 1290 m in the northwest to 2200 m in the southeast wu et al 2014 the major land use types are farmland and gobi desert and the main soil textures are loam and silty loam the zhangye basin has a typically arid continental climate with an average annual precipitation of approximately 120 mm mainly from june to september fig 2a and the annual reference evapotranspiration et0 is about 1200 mm the long term daily sunshine duration approximately 8 h and large day night temperature difference provide a suitable environment for crop growth the study area used to be the main production area of spring wheat and after 2002 the sown area of seed maize increased due to its high water productivity and economic profit fig 2c shi et al 2014 seed maize became the staple crop in the zhangye basin and its production accounted for more than 40 of the total national amount of maize seed chinese academy of agricultural engineering 2012 the growth periods of seed maize and spring wheat are generally from april to september and march to july respectively irrigation is needed to meet the gap between rainfall and crop water demands in the zhangye basin the mean annual net irrigation water consumption is 0 94 billion m3 in this region mainly relying on surface water however before 2000 the rapid development of agricultural activity in the midstream diverted excessive surface water from the heihe river leading to a significant decrease in river runoff and deterioration of the ecological environment downstream chen et al 2005 to help restore the downstream ecosystem a water reallocation plan has been implemented since late 2000 as a result the river discharge from midstream to downstream has been restricted under different hydrologic years cheng et al 2014 as limited surface water diversion hardly satisfies the need for irrigation the intensity of groundwater exploitation has increased leading to declines in the groundwater level and storage tian et al 2015a wu et al 2016 2 2 the fao crop model aquacrop aquacrop is a water driven crop growth model developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao that simulates crop biomass and yield responses to water the principle of aquacrop calculating crop yield evolves from the doorenbos and kassam 1979 approach 1 1 y y x k y 1 et et x where y and y x are the actual and maximum yields et and et x are the actual and maximum evapotranspiration and k y is a yield response factor describing the effect of a reduction in evapotranspiration on yield losses aquacrop simulates crop growth and final yield by following four simple steps in series at daily time steps 1 simulating crop foliage development using green canopy cover 2 estimating daily transpiration tr i based on a simple canopy growth and senescence model 3 calculating aboveground biomass production b from normalized water productivity wp and tri and 4 treating the final yield y as a function of the final biomass and harvest index hi 0 the version of aquacrop in this study is version 5 0 and the equations involved are as follows raes et al 2009b 2 tr i k s kc tr x cc et 0 i 3 b ks b wp i tr i et 0 i 4 y f hi hi 0 b where ks is the soil water stress coefficient kc tr x is the crop coefficient for maximum crop transpiration cc is the canopy cover adjusted by micro advective effects et 0 i is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 i is the day of the cropping period ks b is the cold stress coefficient for biomass production hi 0 is the reference harvest index and f hi is a multiplier considering various stresses that adjust the harvest index from hi 0 soil evaporation e is multiplied by reference evapotranspiration et 0 with the soil water evaporation coefficient ke and evaporation reduction coefficient of water stress kr 5 e kr ke et 0 field management practices such as mulching and tillage practices have been included in aquacrop by considering the interaction between the soil and crop the simulation of mulching is considered as the fraction of soil surface covered and evaporation prevented the soil water evaporation coefficient under mulching is adjusted into ke adj as shown in eq 6 raes et al 2009b 6 ke adj 1 f m per m 1 cc ke x where f m is the adjustment factor for the effect of mulch on soil evaporation which is close to 1 0 for plastic mulches allen et al 1998 per m is the percentage covered by the mulch and ke x is the maximum soil evaporation coefficient for fully wet and not shaded soil surfaces further details of the model concepts and structures are described in three companion papers hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009b steduto et al 2009 2 3 multisource data for the modeling the input requirements for the aquacrop model consist of climatic data crop soil and groundwater characteristics and management including field and irrigation management spatial information on land use and cropping structure was considered when establishing a distributed model table 1 2 3 1 meteorological zones the climate input data for aquacrop include daily precipitation the maximum and minimum temperature eto and the concentration of co2 the first three were directly derived from meteorological stations inside and near the study area zhangye linze gaotai and jinta stations eto was estimated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 through the aquacrop model itself and the co2 concentration was assumed to be the default value provided by the model which was the mean annual atmospheric co2 concentration measured in mauna loa since 1958 the study area was divided into four meteorological zones based on the thiessen polygon method singh et al 2006 2 3 2 cropping structure and crop growth period the cropping structure in the study area is complicated and it is difficult to obtain its spatial change every year according to the statistical data from 1995 to 2015 the staple crops in ganzhou linze and gaotai were spring wheat and seed maize hence the growth of these two crops was simulated and monocropping was assumed during the simulation period the area was divided into three zones based on crop growth periods we generalized the average crop growth periods of spring wheat and seed maize by analyzing yearly data from national agrometeorological stations and linze station fig 3 2 3 3 soil texture and hydraulic parameters the soil texture data collected in this study were composed of five layers 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 60 cm and 60 100 cm including the percentage of sand and clay in each layer the data were first resampled to 1 km 1 km grids which were used in the groundwater model the proportions of sand and clay of five layers and those soil textures were obtained for the grids from which three soil hydraulic parameters θ s θ fc θ wp were calculated as follows campbell 1974 koren et al 2003 7 θ s 0 00126 f sand 0 489 8 ψ s 7 74 e 0 0302 f sand 9 b 0 159 f clay 2 91 10 θ fc θ s ψ fc ψ s 1 b 11 θ wp θ s ψ wp ψ s 1 b where f sand and f clay are the percentages of soil sand and clay ψ s ψ fc and ψ wp represent the soil matric potential at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting points respectively kpa and b is the campbell slope ks was estimated by the rosetta program and cn was determined by the saturated conductivity of the topsoil thus we obtained the soil hydraulic parameters of five layers for the aquacrop model in each 1 km 1 km grid the soil hydraulic parameters of lowest soil layer 60 100 cm were assumed to be valid for subsoil due to the lack of soil texture data collected for deeper soil 100 cm 2 3 4 land use the simulated region was cultivated land so we collected land use maps of four years the spatial distribution of cultivated land did not change dramatically during the simulation period which was mostly located in the plain area and rarely in the piedmont area the growth of cultivated fields in ganzhou linze and gaotai slowed from 1995 to 2010 but accelerated after 2011 fig 2b considering the change in land use and land cover we separated the simulation period into four stages 1995 2002 2003 2006 2007 2009 and 2010 2015 2 3 5 groundwater depth the water volume of capillary rise from groundwater in the area with a shallow groundwater depth has been considered in the aquacrop model which is related to groundwater depth soil texture and hydraulic properties raes et al 2015 the groundwater model used in this study was based on wu et al 2014 and its simulation period was extended from 1995 to 2015 the spatial resolution was 1 km 1 km and the monthly groundwater level and depth were simulated aquacrop only considers the condition where groundwater depth is less than 10 m hence there was no groundwater input file for the areas where the groundwater depth exceeded 10 m 2 3 6 field and irrigation management most of the cultivated land in the study area was irrigated farmland flood irrigation has been the traditional irrigation method for years zhang et al 2006 when simulating mulching we selected synthetic plastic mulches as the types of surface mulch in the aquacrop model and the fraction of soil evaporation reduction was set to 100 f m 1 chukalla et al 2015 the irrigation schedule is composed of irrigation time irrigation frequency and irrigation water quota three irrigation schedule zones and their irrigation times were derived from the literature collected and are shown in fig 3 with limited information about the spring wheat irrigation schedule in gaotai we assumed that the spring wheat irrigation time and frequency in gaotai were the same as those in linze this assumption was based on the similarity of elevation and climate conditions between gaotai and linze the irrigation norm in different hydrological years was calculated from annual water management reports table 2 and divided by the irrigation frequency to obtain the irrigation water quota furthermore winter irrigation has been widely applied in the study area to ensure crop emergence the winter irrigation depth in the model was approximately 100 mm xie et al 2005 which often occurred on 25th october 2 4 model setup and simulation due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil meteorology and other data we established a distributed model to simulate crop growth at the basin scale as aquacrop is a one dimensional model we generated thousands of simulated units fig 4 by first overlaying cultivated land distribution and groundwater model grids through a geographic information system and then combining zonal meteorological crop growth the irrigation schedule and field management data table 1 each simulated unit with an irregular shape was assumed to be homogenous and the input variables were the same the numbers of simulated units in the four periods were 3558 3723 3935 and 3979 consistent with the increase in the cultivated area in recent years the lateral movement of soil water can be neglected due to the flat terrain therefore the combination of several one dimensional simulated units could represent the regional distributed model the simulation period was from 1995 to 2015 depending on sufficient data collected as we generalized the date of winter irrigation in the previous year the model running period was from 25th october 1994 to the end of the crop growth period of 2015 the initial water content of the soil profile was set as the field capacity when winter irrigation occurred 2 5 model calibration and validation the model was first calibrated and validated using experimental data at the field scale and then its performance was evaluated at the basin scale at the field scale soil hydraulic parameters were the first to be calibrated and validated with the aim of observed soil water contents through the parameter estimation pest doherty 1994 method with good simulation results for soil water contents crop parameters were further adjusted with the aim of observed canopy cover biomass and yield successively the trial and error method was selected to calibrate influential crop parameters following singh et al 2006 hsiao et al 2009 and li and ren 2019 the noninfluential parameters were assigned the default values from the aquacrop reference manual raes et al 2009a and values collected from previous studies for the basin scale annual crop yield data over the simulation period of 1995 2015 and etwatch remote sensing data liu et al 2011 wu et al 2012 from 2000 to 2014 were collected for comparison with the model outputs according to the data collected from three experimental sites ganzhou and linze had complete records of the soil water content crop canopy cover aboveground biomass and yield while gaotai lacked canopy cover and biomass data table 3 foliage development is expressed through canopy cover instead of leaf area index lai in aquacrop as lai was more commonly measured than canopy cover at the field scale empirical relationships between canopy cover and lai for maize eq 10 and wheat eq 11 were adopted to make full use of the observed data hsiao et al 2009 nielsen et al 2012 12 cc 1 005 1 exp 0 6 lai 1 2 13 cc 0 94 1 exp 0 43 lai 0 52 we selected several statistical indicators to evaluate the simulations objectively and synthetically including the root mean square error rmse jamieson et al 1991 willmott s

further assess the effects of plastic film mulching on cwp three mulching practices were considered in the model no mulching with per m 0 m0 half film mulching with per m 50 m1 and major film mulching with per m 70 m2 the major film mulching percentage was based on ran et al 2017 and shen et al 2019 the current irrigation schedule was applied when simulating the three mulching practices the unit simulated outputs were summarized into irrigation zones which were twenty one in this study fig 4 we first compared the soil water contents under different mulching practices the average topsoil 0 30 cm simulated water contents of the crop growth period were calculated because mulching practices have a more significant effect on the topsoil water content than on other depths wang et al 2016b furthermore simulated crop yield et and cwp under different mulching percentages were compared at the county scale 2 7 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis will help understand the impacts of parameters on model results identify the model s most influential parameters and then calibrate the model better and more effectively cariboni et al 2007 vanuytrecht et al 2014 for complex nonlinear models only global sensitivity analysis can provide the relevant information on the sensitivity of model results to the whole range of variation of model input parameters varella et al 2010 the parameters in aquacrop are mainly categorized into soil hydraulic parameters and crop parameters the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast saltelli 1999 was selected as a global sensitivity analysis method in this study and has already been applied to aquacrop and other crop growth models li and ren 2019 vanuytrecht et al 2014 xing et al 2017 the first order index s i and the total sensitivity index st i were used to measure the main contribution of each single parameter x i to the total output variance and the interaction effects involving parameter x i respectively these two sensitivity indices are defined as follows 18 s i v i v y 19 st i v y v i v y the values of s i and st i range from 0 to 1 higher values indicate that parameter x i has more effects on the model results parameter x i is considered influential when s i 0 05 or st i 0 10 dejonge et al 2012 vanuytrecht et al 2014 xing et al 2017 2 7 1 parameter ranges and distribution the soil profile can be divided into five horizons in aquacrop the soil hydraulic parameters include the saturated water content θ s field capacity θ fc permanent wilting point θ wp saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of each soil layer and the curve number cn of the topsoil the soil profile and soil texture of the three sites were generalized based on the soil texture or soil particle composition from previous studies the ranges of the soil hydraulic parameters table s1 were determined following saxton and rawls 2006 except cn which was given a range related to the ks of the topsoil the ranges of most crop parameters table s2 were determined by the aquacrop reference manual raes et al 2009a and the remaining parameter ranges fluctuated from the default values or values in previous papers due to the unknown distributions of most parameters uniform parameter distributions were assigned in this study the assumption was based on that model output sensitivity depends primarily on the assigned parameter ranges rather than on the distribution helton 1993 2 7 2 sensitivity experiment setting the number of model runs required for a complete sensitivity analysis per climate crop soil meteorology combination is defined as follows saltelli 1999 wang et al 2013 20 c n n s n n r 2 m ω max 1 where ns is the sample size of each parameter n is the number of parameters nr is the number of search curves with hyperspace m is the interaction factor and ѡ max is the maximum frequency in this study the numbers of parameters subjected to the sensitivity analysis were 21 for the soil hydraulic parameters and 43 for the crop parameters the crop canopy cover aboveground biomass and yield were analyzed for the crop parameters while the soil water contents were analyzed for the soil hydraulic parameters the sensitivity analysis results are reliable when the sample size of each parameter is larger than 65 for the efast method saltelli 1999 li and ren 2019 discussed the sample size in detail and thus ns was set to 513 n r 1 m 4 ѡ max 64 in this study we first defined the number of parameters and their ranges and distributions simlab ver 2 2 1 software tarantola 2005 was used to generate sets of crop parameters through monte carlo sampling matlab software was then used to read the parameter sets generate the input file for soil sol and crop cro modules and call the aquacrop plug in ascav50 to run the simulations in batches after model executions the results were extracted and reorganized for simlab analysis finally the s i and st i of each parameter were calculated using simlab for each experimental site the numbers of model runs in the soil hydraulic parameter and crop parameter sensitivity analysis were 10773 and 23085 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation results at the experimental stations fig 5 demonstrates good calibration and validation results for the soil water contents at the three experimental stations the mbe values for the soil water content simulation were 0 01 cm3 cm 3 and 0 00 cm3 cm 3 during the calibration and validation periods respectively the mbe showed that the simulated soil water content was not obviously overestimated or underestimated the d values were greater than 0 90 in the two simulation periods indicating a good simulation of the soil water content the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters are listed in table s3 fig 6 and fig s1 illustrate the calibration and validation results for green canopy cover aboveground biomass and yield at the three experimental stations the mbe values for seed maize green canopy cover and aboveground biomass were close to 0 during the calibration and validation periods indicating good agreement for both canopy cover and biomass and the model did not overestimate or underestimate the observations the simulated yield underestimated the observed values with mbes of 1 19 ton ha 1 and 0 13 ton ha 1 during the calibration and validation periods respectively the statistical indicators showed that the model performed well in simulating seed maize green canopy cover and yield with moderately good performance for aboveground biomass the larger error in biomass simulation was attributed to the constant value of wp in aquacrop during the whole crop growth period which changed in different growth stages based on field observations ran et al 2018 similar to seed maize the comparison process was applied to spring wheat crop parameter calibration and validation the mbe values during calibration periods for green canopy cover aboveground biomass and yield were 5 31 0 76 ton ha 1 and 0 43 ton ha 1 respectively the corresponding values were 2 3 0 51 ton ha 1 and 0 09 ton ha 1 during the validation period these mbe values indicated that the model slightly overestimated green canopy cover and yield during calibration and underestimated these values during validation the statistical variables especially the high d values indicated that the calibrated model had a good prediction of canopy cover biomass and yield the main calibrated crop parameters are listed in table 4 and the remaining crop parameters were set as default values raes et al 2009a 3 2 regional validation 3 2 1 crop yield fig 7 shows the comparison between the simulated crop yields and annual yields collected from statistical yearbooks at the county scale the mean nrmse values were 10 1 for seed maize yield and 11 0 for spring wheat respectively the other statistical indicators are listed in table 5 showing good performance in modeling crop yield at the basin scale 3 2 2 cwps fig 8 presents the spatial distribution of simulated seed maize and spring wheat cwps in 2015 there was an obvious spatial difference in the simulated cwps which were lower in the southeastern part than in the northwestern part for both seed maize and spring wheat the simulated seed maize cwp also showed a similar spatial pattern as han et al 2019 furthermore the results were upscaled to the county extent and validated due to the changing number of simulated units and limited information collected during the simulation period the average cwps at ganzhou linze and gaotai for seed maize were 1 62 kg m 3 1 80 kg m 3 and 1 74 kg m 3 respectively and those for spring wheat were 1 46 kg m 3 1 37 kg m 3 and 1 48 kg m 3 respectively our model outputs were reasonable compared with previous studies fig 9 which were also in the range of global and cwps of maize 1 1 2 7 kg m 3 and wheat 0 6 1 7 kg m 3 foley et al 2019 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 3 2 3 et et simulations were compared to the etwatch data to crosscheck the model performance the main crop was seed maize during the simulation period so maize monocropping was assumed in the study area as the etwatch data were monthly the model simulation period was lengthened from 1st april to 30th september to obtain monthly simulated et values as presented in fig 10a the et values simulated by aquacrop were higher than those simulated by etwatch owing to our assumption that all farmlands planted seed maize other local hydrological model simulation outputs were also compared to validate our regional model fig 10b the aquacrop model simulation period was lengthened from 1st january to 31st december to obtain annual simulated et values tian et al 2015b and sun et al 2018 simulated the mean annual et values for farmland in the middle and lower heihe river basin by gsflow 2000 2012 and gsflow gehm 2000 2012 wu et al 2015 estimated that the et of cultivated land in the study area was 450 mm and it was 490 mm on average in li et al 2016 the comparison results indicated that our regional model was reliable in simulating et in summary the model that was well calibrated and validated at the experimental stations also performed well in simulating crop yields et and cwp at the basin scale the model provides a basis for further analysis of the effects of plastic film mulching on crop yield et and cwp at the basin scale 3 3 sensitivity analysis results 3 3 1 soil hydraulic parameters crop aboveground biomass or yield is often used as the objective variable in previous studies on soil hydraulic parameter sensitivity analysis for the aquacrop model however the values of soil hydraulic parameters have a direct impact on the simulated soil water content rather than the aboveground biomass and yield in this study the direct contribution of soil hydraulic parameters to the soil water content was determined the results fig 11 showed that the most sensitive soil hydraulic parameter was θ fc in each soil layer at each experimental station followed by θ wp θ fc represents the maximum amount of water that a well drained soil can hold against gravitational forces which directly affects the redistribution of soil water total available soil water drainage and capillary rise simulation in aquacrop vanuytrecht et al 2014 found that the most sensitive soil hydraulic parameters for the yields of maize and winter wheat were θ fc and θ wp through the efast method in aquacrop silvestro et al 2017 also drew the same conclusion when considering winter wheat at the three experimental stations which is consistent with our results although the sensitivity analysis results showed that θ fc and θ wp were the most sensitive soil parameters the difference of them the total available soil water was used to simulate water stress and should be noticed 3 3 2 crop parameters based on the first order sensitivity index the most sensitive crop parameters for seed maize green canopy cover were zx mat and sen at stations 1 2 and 3 respectively the abbreviations are illustrated in table s2 the most sensitive crop parameter was wp for the aboveground biomass at all experimental stations and was mat for the yield except at gaotai station the highest total sensitivity index parameter for the green canopy cover and yield was the same as the first order sensitivity index the aboveground biomass at stations 1 2 and 3 was most sensitive to wp mat and sen respectively it was found that the first order sensitivity index results were slightly different from the total sensitivity index because the latter considered the interaction between parameters baroni and tarantola 2014 the other sensitive crop parameters of seed maize are listed in table 6 although the rank may vary among stations the influential parameters were similar among these parameters ccx is involved in the canopy cover developmental process and crop phenology parameters flo sen mat have impacts on the duration of canopy senescence and crop yield formation based on the model principle vanuytrecht et al 2014 found that the most sensitive crop parameter for wheat and maize yield was mat under different climate crop soil and meteorology combinations zx affects the growth of crop roots and the root depth at each time step influences the soil total available water at that time which furthermore influences crop growth kctrx and wp affect the simulation of crop transpiration and aboveground biomass through eq 2 and eq 3 hilen is the crop parameter related to the harvest index calculation during yield formation which affects the final yield through eq 4 for spring wheat green canopy cover and yield the most sensitive crop parameter was mat from the first order sensitivity index at the three experimental stations the aboveground biomass was most sensitive to wp at stations 1 and 2 and to zx at station 3 according to the total sensitivity index the highest value for spring wheat green canopy cover was zx at stations 1 and 3 but was mat at station 2 the aboveground biomass and yield results were consistent with the first order sensitivity index the other influential crop parameters of spring wheat are shown in table s4 among these crop parameters cgc determines the rate of canopy cover expansion jin et al 2018 found that the maximum dry biomass and yield of spring wheat were sensitive to kctrx wp ccx zx and hio in aquacrop based the efast method which is similar to our results xing et al 2017 found that wp mat and kctrx were sensitive crop parameters for winter wheat aboveground biomass and flo psen and mat were sensitive crop parameters for yield although there were some differences between the winter wheat and spring wheat studied in our case previous studies still provide support for our results to some extent the influential crop parameters identified by the efast method were slightly different between seed maize and spring wheat this is because the various climate and irrigation inputs resulted in diverse environmental conditions which could influence the sensitivity results vanuytrecht et al 2014 moreover mohammadi et al 2016 discussed the different results of sensitivity analysis with various irrigation treatments which could be used to interpret the sensitivity variation among the three stations in our study 3 4 effects of plastic film mulching on cwp 3 4 1 the effect on the soil water content the average topsoil water contents increased with higher coverage of plastic films as shown in fig 12 compared to no mulching the average soil water contents of half film mulching and major film mulching under the present irrigation schedules were improved by 4 60 and 8 83 respectively during the seed maize growth period and by 2 63 and 4 78 respectively during the spring wheat growth period the soil water content improvements after plastic film mulching were mainly due to the reduction in soil evaporation with soil surface coverage chakraborty et al 2008 the results also showed that seed maize generally had higher soil water contents than spring wheat in the crop growth period the reasons are as follows first there was more rainfall that occurred in the maize growth period which covered almost the entire rainy season second due to the longer growth period april to september seed maize consumes more water and requires more irrigation input than spring wheat for seed maize the average soil water contents of linze and gaotai were typically higher than those of ganzhou because of the lower irrigation amount and infrequent timing there were no obvious differences in the average soil water contents during the spring wheat growth period among the three counties except for the luocheng district in gaotai which was markedly lower this result could be explained by the heterogeneity of the soil texture the main soil texture in luocheng district was sandy loam with low field capacity and a poor water holding capacity the outliers in fig 12a were caused by the highest annual precipitation that occurred during the simulation period 3 4 2 effects on et and yield table 7 shows that soil mulching decreased et and had opposite effects on its components e and t during the seed maize growth period the total et under half film mulching and major film mulching decreased by 5 57 and 10 70 respectively compared to no mulching the extent of the reduction in et was smaller for spring wheat with corresponding values of 3 50 and 6 60 respectively there was an evident decrease in soil evaporation when the soil surface was covered by plastic film half film mulching and major film mulching reduced soil evaporation by more than 30 and 50 respectively the soil evaporation reduction during spring wheat growth periods under mulching ranged from 39 6 to 71 1 which were larger than that of seed maize 32 5 53 8 the reason could be that spring wheat is sown earlier with lower temperature and less precipitation leading to longer periods of emergence stage than seed maize canopy cover was small and soil evaporation dominated et during the early stages resulting in a stronger soil evaporation reduction for spring wheat bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 however the total transpiration slightly increased in this work we believe that the higher soil water content under soil mulching could offer more water for crop growth and then enhance crop transpiration which is consistent with xie et al 2005 it should be noted that the proportional reduction in soil evaporation due to the presence of mulch was set to 1 in aquacrop as mentioned previously the model did not consider the damage caused to the plastic mulch by pests or diseases as a consequence the simulated soil evaporation reduction may be greater than in reality plastic film mulching enhanced crop yields and its positive effect was more apparent when a greater soil area was covered by plastic films as reported in table 7 furthermore the results revealed that soil mulching was more influential on seed maize yield than on spring wheat yield the difference in production improvements can be attributed to the higher potential yield of seed maize seed maize a c4 crop has a faster rate of photosynthesis process than spring wheat which is a c3 species qin et al 2015 in the aquacrop model the main difference between c3 and c4 crop parameters was expressed as wp which was 30 35 gm 2 for c4 crops and 15 20 gm 2 for c3 crops respectively the values affected the simulated aboveground biomass and further affected the final yield on the other hand maize is more sensitive to water stress than wheat daryanto et al 2016 ma et al 2018 plastic film mulching could help conserve more soil water to be used for crop transpiration and reduce the threat of water stress to seed maize the average soil water contents during the seed maize growth period were apparently higher than those of spring wheat indicating much more water for seed maize uptake and growth it is worth noting that the aquacrop model lacks consideration of soil temperature so the simulated yield in mulching cases may be underestimated overall the impacts of plastic film mulching on soil evaporation were more significant than those on other model outputs as shown in table 7 3 4 3 the effect on cwp fig 13 presents the cwp improvements under plastic film mulching varying from 5 0 to 19 3 for seed maize and from 2 7 to 10 4 for spring wheat respectively the regional average increases of seed maize and spring wheat cwps by half film mulching were 7 2 0 9 and 4 1 0 7 respectively with the respective corresponding increases by major film mulching were 14 1 2 2 and 7 8 1 0 the comparison showed that plastic film mulching improved cwp effectively which confirmed the results of local field experiments ma 2016 song et al 2021 wang et al 2016b xie et al 2005 found that full film mulching improved spring wheat cwps by 7 6 and 6 4 in two experimental years under similar irrigation input with our simulation wang et al 2016a observed that seed maize cwp under half film mulching was 9 3 higher than that without no mulching under high irrigation treatment due to limited experimental data in the study area data from a nearby experimental station namely shiyanghe station was also collected fan et al 2017 found that plastic film mulching with 90 coverage enhanced seed maize cwps by 19 3 on average spring wheat cwps under full film mulching increased by ranges of 7 5 27 3 and 3 2 19 8 in two year experiments yang et al 2018 there exist some differences between model results and experimental data due to water input levels mulching coverage soil properties and other factors the aquacrop model is still able to simulate plastic film mulching in comparison with field studies detailed cwp values the effects of mulching and their deviations of each district are provided in table s5 and s6 the improvements were attributed to increasing crop yield and decreasing et under soil mulching as discussed above however the amplitudes of the benefits from plastic film mulching on seed maize cwp were larger than those on spring wheat the reason could be the longer growth period of seed maize with higher average temperature and more rainfall leading to more unproductive e decreasing under mulching as a consequence the greater yield increases and et reduction brought out a more significant improvement in seed maize cwp than in spring wheat additionally the distributed model helped us identify the areas more suitable for applying plastic film mulching especially for seed maize half film mulching improved the seed maize cwp by 7 4 0 9 7 3 0 7 and 6 8 0 8 in ganzhou linze and gaotai respectively with corresponding values of 15 5 1 8 13 8 1 9 and 12 9 1 9 for major film mulching in comparison to no mulching the results showed that seed maize cwp in ganzhou benefitted the most from soil mulching the reason could be attributed to the spatial differences in water input the positive effect showed a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest with increasing irrigation amount of seed maize which is consistent with the finding of qin et al 2015 the crop growth in the study area relies mainly on irrigation which determines the water input level the higher water input for seed maize may be near the optimal range and crops obtain actual yields close to potential outputs hence the effect of mulching on seed maize cwp was weakened with high levels of irrigation from another perspective the irrigation amounts used in our simulation were generalized based on local water management reports and the irrigation depth for mulching practices may be too high which agrees with yang et al 2015 thus plastic film mulching is more suitable for deficit irrigation conditions than full irrigation however the spring wheat cwp gains under half and major film mulching were comparable at approximately 4 1 and 7 8 respectively the reason could be the smaller difference in the spring wheat irrigation level in the study area other agronomic practices should be included to enhance spring wheat cwp in the future to summarize plastic film mulching improved cwps in this arid region however the impacts were crop specific and were related to the irrigation amount the simulated results showed that seed maize was more adaptive for applying soil mulching than spring wheat at the basin scale a higher cwp will help reduce the total water consumption and irrigation water volumes to a larger extent the study area the middle reach of the hrb will release much more water for the downstream ecosystem 4 conclusions to study the effects of plastic film mulching on crop water productivity in arid areas we chose the zhangye basin as a typical arid basin to explore the impacts at the regional scale the distributed aquacrop model was established fully considering heterogeneity after soil and crop parameter calibration and validation using field experimental data different proportions of soil covered by plastic films were considered in the well validated model compared to no mulching half film mulching and major film mulching with 70 soil coverage conserved soil water and significantly reduced the soil evaporation by more than 30 and 50 respectively plastic film mulching decreased total et while slightly increasing crop transpiration the crop yields and cwps were improved by mulching and the positive effects were enhanced with increasing mulched soil area however the impacts of mulching on cwps varied spatially and were more pronounced on seed maize than on spring wheat the benefits of major film mulching to seed maize cwp were 15 5 1 8 13 8 1 9 and 12 9 1 9 in ganzhou linze and gaotai respectively with a corresponding value of 7 8 1 0 for spring wheat cwp throughout the zhangye basin the increases in cwps were mainly due to the reduction in et and showed a decreasing trend with increasing irrigation amount it is noteworthy that the irrigation events used in the simulation were full irrigation conditions which may lead to a minor increase in cwps deficit irrigation conditions should be considered in future work it is important to note that although plastic films improve cwps and crop yields plastic residues have caused a series of environmental problems such as soil hardness soil organisms change and unsustainable farmland use kirkham et al 2020 liu et al 2014 sun et al 2018 in recent years the local government has promoted plastic film recycling by regulations and economic subsidies li et al 2021 with increasing attention to environmental protection more measures such as improving mulch films quality and developing degradable plastic films are taken to alleviate plastic pollution qian et al 2018 this research provides a quantitative and spatial assessment of plastic film mulching application which helps better understand management practices the findings of the study show the potential of mulching for water savings and determine the suitable area and crop for applying plastic films the results could contribute to improving cwp more effectively and ensuring food security in arid regions there are some limitations associated with this study only seed maize and spring wheat as staple crops in the study area were simulated and monocropping was assumed in our regional simulation due to a lack of knowledge about cropping pattern changes the effects of plastic film mulching on other crops such as potatoes could be included and compared with this study in addition field management practices including plastic film mulching have costs associated with materials and labor thus economic analysis will be required to assess agronomic technology more comprehensively these

9886,the projected increasing food demand in the coming decades will require substantial water and energy resources practical approaches are expected to propose to realize enhancing crop production while towards sustainable development in shallow groundwater area this study integrates a process based model multi objectives and fuzzy theory into optimization model to optimize crops water allocation pattern under uncertainties of water diversion and groundwater the process based model considers the water exchange between soil and groundwater water stress and salt stress on crops and ground water level changes the multi objectives defined in this study balances the conflicts of maximizing crop production maximizing water use efficiency and minimizing energy consumption the uncertain amount of water diversion and groundwater is presented as fuzzy numbers the optimized water allocation pattern of 3 crops in 12 water supply response units in hetao irrigation district show that the crop yield does not necessarily reach to the highest potential value though wheat and maize are allocated more water than sunflower and have larger possibility to reach high crop yield significant energy investment is needed for extracting and purifying groundwater to ensure relatively high crop production at the case of possible low available water uncertainties of water diversion and groundwater will cause a greater range of ground water level in wheat field a high risk of water stress in sunflower field and a high risk of very severe salinization in wheat field the different changing directions of three sub objectives demonstrate that optimal water allocation has no uniform rule but changes with available water keywords shallow groundwater area optimization uncertainty risk sustainable agricultural development 1 introduction human food demand is projected to substantially increase as a result of growing population and social economy development davis et al 2017 li et al 2019a 2019b the increasing food demand will require large amount of water and energy resources which may not be able to keep pace with human growing food demand davis et al 2016 tian et al 2018 sustainable development is called for frequently and urgently in recent years in terms of enhancing food production and minimizing its impacts on water and energy resources ren et al 2021 recent work has provided promising water use strategies in irrigated areas that face frequent water shortage or have limited access to water resource hoekstra et al 2012 brauman et al 2016 elliott et al 2014 the reasonable water allocation pattern balancing multiple resources is also urgently demanded in shallow groundwater area better integrating food production and the usage of water and energy resources is significant in shallow groundwater area featured with shallow ground water level and possible soil salinization xu et al 2012 although groundwater is a reliable and stable water source for agriculture to potentially improve crop production haile et al 2019 banks et al 2020 overexploitation may threaten vulnerable shallow aquifers shekhar et al 2015 du et al 2020 haile et al 2019 siarkos et al 2021 and engender competition for water or energy between agriculture and other sectors saleh et al 2011 the intricate relationship between water energy food and its significance has been highlighted in the water energy food security nexus conference held in bonn germany in 2011 hoff 2011 this insight has been recognized as an important evaluation pattern for sustainable intensification pathways in multiscale regions ringler et al 2013 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 lee et al 2020 ding et al 2021 wu et al 2021 kamrani et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a 2018b zhang and ren 2021 zeng et al 2019 si et al 2019 recent work in shallow groundwater area has assessed the trade off between groundwater conservation and crop production zhang et al 2018a 2018b and discussed the exploitation potential of groundwater with concerns of salinization and ecological water demand li et al 2019a 2019b however limited case study examples incorporated available water resource including surface water and groundwater energy consumption soil salinization and crop growth to propose optimal water allocation pattern from a large scale available water is an important factor limiting agricultural development uncertain available water caused by unpredictable climate variability or human activities enhances difficulties in formulating sustainable strategies li et al 2019a 2019b like how to optimally allocate water under uncertainties to address uncertainties existing in systems it is necessary to introduce probability distribution functions of uncertain indices or other simplified distribution curves in light of limited access to effective data into decision making process as handling methods of multiple uncertainties have been developed yu et al 2020 tabatabaie and murthy 2020 although determining confidence level and risk preference may offer policy makers preferred strategy ji et al 2020 it is essential that deciders can see all possibilities created by multi uncertainties moreover the accompanying environmental impacts of given plans and uncertainties relate to applicability of the scheme and are expected to be included radmehr et al 2020 namany et al 2019 thus requiring process based model synthesizing into comprehensive model this study aims to 1 propose optimal agricultural water allocation pattern in shallow groundwater area with consideration of saving water and energy resource under uncertainties 2 analyze impacts of proposed strategy on crops growth and environment such as ground water level soil salinization and water stress on crops in order to achieve the above study aims this study integrates a process based model multi objectives and fuzzy theory into optimization model to identify the optimal water allocation pattern for 3 major crops in 12 water supply response units of shallow groundwater area in doing this this study will 1 determine the groundwater and water diversion distribution that is mostly suitable in each unit and analyze whole water use process such as actual evapotranspiration groundwater phreatic soil water content etc 2 deeply reveal the relationship between crop production energy consumption and water use efficiency 3 examine accompanying environmental problems resulting from optimized water allocating pattern and uncertainties such as ground water level changes and soil salinization problems the developed comprehensive model contains the balance of water energy food detailed crop growth process and uncertainties the optimized water allocation can leave shallow groundwater area less susceptible to uncertain available water to some extent thereby offering reference strategy for agricultural sustainable development in shallow groundwater area 2 study area 2 1 study area hetao irrigation district hid is located in the west of inner mongolia autonomous region 40º13 42º28 n 105º12 109º53 e in china fig 1 arid and semi arid region with a typical temperate continental semiarid and monsoon climate sun 2014 the annually average temperature is 6 10 с with maximum and minimum temperature at around 23 72 с mostly occurring in july and 9 58 с mostly occurring in january in this area the annually average precipitation is less than 250 mm mostly concentrating from june to september while the annual evaporation reaches to 2011 2300 mm xue et al 2018 according to local canal system distribution land use distribution irrigation condition soil characteristics and administrative division hid is divided into 12 water supply response units luo et al 2021 where the crop and soil condition are assumed to be consistent in each water supply response unit hid is an important commodity grain base of china more than 80 planted area is used for growing wheat maize and sunflower which are selected as study crops in this study the meteorological drought year 2011 is regarded as the crop growth context the irrigation for local agriculture development depends on the water diversion from the yellow river in the past 30 years the amount of water diversion from the yellow river from april to september is 2 324 4 036 billion m3 perennial water diversion makes much water seep down into groundwater and raises local ground water level resulting in frequent water exchange between surface soil water and groundwater long term experimental observations show that the average annual groundwater depth is fluctuating between 1 5 m and 3 m xu et al 2010 sun et al 2016 and the groundwater recharge offers crops around 1 3 of total water consumption xu et al 2010 sun et al 2016 vertical water exchange predominates in hid resulting from the flat terrain with the mean slope at 0 05 and poor drainage substantial salt carried with irrigation water and groundwater phreatic is remained in shallow soil owing to intense evaporation and poor salt drainage negatively influencing vegetation growing the hydrological process in 12 water supply response units is shown in fig 2 there are uncertainties in the water diversion in crop growing season and groundwater availability caused by stochastic climate variability and unmanageable human activities attainable limited effective data are insufficient to analyze probability distributions such as the gaussian distribution thus they are expressed as fuzzy numbers according to fuzzy theory triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are simplistically approximate shapes of probability distribution curves and are drawn in supplementary figs s3 and s4 month to month 2 2 water supply priority during water allocation process the priorities among 12 water supply response units and among 3 crops should be concerned in this study the determination of priority among water supply response units is based on farmland area annual maximum ndvi potential farmland productivity agricultural output value and grain yield in each unit the evaluation method is ahp topsis and the priority values reference the study of luo et al 2021 supplementary table s1 the priority among three crops in each unit is achieved by using the coefficient of variation method with considerations of the change of yield economic benefits and irrigation water productivity under different drought scenarios supplementary table s2 2 3 problem statement agricultural development in hetao irrigation district depends on the amount of available water as mentioned above hetao irrigation district has the following five features 1 the priorities of 12 water supply response units are different due to different terrain conditions and potential farmland productivity 2 the priorities of 3 main crops are different in each water supply response unit due to different planting area and agricultural output value 3 the growth of crops is affected by both water stress and salt stress 4 the water diversion from the yellow river and the available groundwater are uncertain that can be expressed as fuzzy numbers 5 exploiting and purifying groundwater requires a certain amount of energy 6 there is a certain contradiction between improving crop yield and water use efficiency therefore the problem is how to optimally allocate available water including uncertain water diversion and uncertain groundwater to 3 crops in 12 water supply response units on the basis of ensuring crop production and saving water and energy resources 3 model development in order to solve the above problem this study aims to optimize the irrigation water of 3 crops including wheat maize and sunflower in 12 water supply response units from the perspective of water energy food it is the water that connects energy and food in agricultural system water is the foundation of crops growth and food security the extraction and purification of groundwater will consume certain energy therefore maximizing crop production improving water use efficiency and saving energy resource are set as three sub objectives which are contradictory to some extent the crop yield is calculated by jensen water production function and considering the priorities of different water supply response units and different crops the water use efficiency is the ratio of total crop production to the total water consumption the total energy consumption is the sum of the energy used to purify groundwater and that used to extract groundwater four constraints are included related to available water food security soil water content and non negative constraints according to the fuzzy theory the uncertain water diversion and available groundwater are presented as fuzzy numbers thus the multi objective fuzzy optimization model is established which is solved by genetic algorithm on matlab r2019a the weights of three objectives are determined by ahp method finally the optimized alternatives water stress salt stress the conflicts of multi objectives and uncertainties in the system are analyzed in the later sections the system framework of this study is as shown in fig 3 3 1 notations in order to clearly present the signs in formulas the parameters and definitions is provided in table 1 3 2 objective functions the objective functions are determined from the perspective of water food energy nexus consisting of the weighted crop production food water use efficiency water and the total energy consumption energy as follows 3 2 1 maximize the sum of weighted crop production the total crop production is essential for food security and farmers benefits in hid the following objective function is the sum of weighted crop production in each water supply response unit the product of the crop production and the weight 1a q t y i 1 12 j 1 3 d i g i j a i j y i j the crop yield is affected by soil water stress and salt stress soil water comes from irrigation precipitation

water demand pumping groundwater is necessary to supply additional water for crops growth and guarantee crop yield however the salt content of groundwater in hid is higher than the standard for irrigation that makes more salt introduced in shallow soil therefore the energy consumption mainly includes the energy for pumping and purifying groundwater minimizing the total energy consumption is for two purposes 1 avoiding over exploitation of groundwater 2 saving energy resource the total energy consumption is expressed as 1q e i 1 12 j 1 3 t 1 t q i j t a i j 10000 p w q w 1000 q s p p s p

shown in supplementary figs s1 and s2 the maximum value of fuzzy numbers is the possible maximum value pvmax the value with the highest frequency is the maximum possible value mpv and the minimum value of fuzzy numbers is the possible minimum value pvmin in fact the fuzziness of available water will lead to the fuzziness of other obtained indicators related to crops growth the strong nonlinearity of the established model may lead the fuzzy indicators nonlinear which may be non standard triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers gonzalez gonzalez et al 2014 however pvmax mpv and pvmin values theoretically must exist in each standard or non standard fuzzy number therefore this study simplifies indicators fuzzification as triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy number formed by pvmax mpv and pvmin values without considering nonlinearities of fuzzy numbers 4 1 water allocation fig 4 shows the water allocation of 12 water supply response units under uncertainties among three crops the groundwater is more allocated to wheat in may and june while the water diversion is reliably allocated to maize in may and july the fuzzy ratio of water allocation for maize to total water diversion is 50 01 57 48 67 77 which means over half of water diversion is allocated to maize fig s6 and this proportion will increase under the case of possible low water diversion it can be seen that the uncertain space of diversion allocation of maize is smaller than other two crops wheat and maize are allocated more water diversion and groundwater resource because they have relatively high priorities for ensuring food security and higher water use efficiencies than that of sunflower crop water allocation is not always less or equal to the crop demand water which may differ with many researches on precise irrigation jo and shin 2021 supplementary fig s4 it is the local traditional water diversion modes large water diversion in april and may that causes this phenomenon in april wheat and may maize the amount of water diversion exceeds the crops water demand high irrigation amount can greatly supplement soil water and largely raise the ground water level thus providing a good soil environment for crops growth in the later stages for example the water allocation in june and july is less than crop highest water demand while the water consumption of crops reaches to the maximum values because of high soil water storage and phreatic evaporation in early stages the difference between optimized water allocation and water demand of crops indicates suggestions for managers that wheat in april and maize in may should be paid more attention and can be allocated more water in fields the water diversion is the main source of water allocation in hid supplementary fig s6 under the condition of pvmax the irrigation water for crops growth in hid is all from the yellow river diversion even in the case of pvmin the yellow river diversion accounts for more than 60 of the total water allocation of each crop the rank of total water allocation amount of three crops is maize sunflower wheat sunflower has relatively high water allocation because of its large planting area in addition the crop yield does not always reach to the maximum values it can be seen in supplementary fig s6 that the yield of maize is all lower than the maximum yield in 12 water supply response units the maximum yield of maize is 95 95 96 10 96 85 of ym in yigan water supply unit and the minimum is 94 30 93 82 93 52 of ym in tongji water supply unit the yield is the optimal value after balancing the yield water use efficiency and energy consumption the wheat has higher possibilities to reach the maximum yield in the west of hid and the sunflower has higher possibilities to get the maximum yield in the east of hid comparison of water allocation among 12 water supply response units supplementary fig s5 different water supply response units have significant difference in water allocation of water diversion and groundwater in hetao irrigation district the water diversion and groundwater are mainly allocated to huangji unit no 4 yongji unit no 5 and fengji unit no 6 the water diversion allocated to these three units is all over 12 of total available water diversion at pvmin mpv and pvmax cases moreover the groundwater allocated to yongji unit no 5 reaches to the maximum value with 16 08 24 29 and 14 54 of total available groundwater in hetao irrigation district the reason behind the allocating difference may be that these water supply units have better soil and climate condition resulting in relatively high water use efficiency and water supply priorities compared with these three units tongji unit no 10 changji unit no 11 and tabu unit no 12 have significantly lower water allocation this is the result after optimization from the perspective of the whole hetao irrigation district which may be inapplicable in real world owing to unfairness 4 2 ground water level agricultural irrigation is the main factor of raising ground water level in hid as shown in fig 5 the ground water level rises first and then decreases steadily mostly reaching to the highest value in may this annual variation is similar with the study results of ren et al 2017 in hid among of three crops the water level in the wheat field fluctuates the most with the highest level less than 1 m may and june and the lowest level closing to 6 m june and july the raise of ground water level may increase the salt content of the shallow soil the drop of the ground water level in the wheat field mainly comes from two aspects the first is the decrease of irrigation reduces infiltration from surface into groundwater the second is that groundwater exploitation reduces the ground water level compared with wheat and maize the ground water level in sunflower field maintains a relatively stable changing trend due to its lower water allocation 4 3 water stress risk fig 6 shows fuzzy values of soil water stress coefficients k s w of crops in each month theoretically it seems more reasonable for fuzzy numbers of water stress coefficients to be acute triangles with smallest value at pvmin condition and largest value at pvmax condition naveena et al 2021 however the water stress coefficient of sunflower in september at pvmax condition is less than that at mpv condition whose fuzzy number is an obtuse triangle we believe that it is the tradeoff during water allocation process that causes the aberrance the optimization framework does not only consider one kind of crop or just single time but contains the whole growth periods of three kinds of crops in 12 water supply response units therefore from the perspective of overall optimization although the total available water is at a high level it is still possible that the water allocation of one crop at one time is small after the overall tradeoff in fact under uncertainties the water allocation result is not just one value but a set of solutions the optimized result obtained in this study is only one scheme in the solution set accurately speaking the boundary of water stress conforms to a certain probability distribution the boundary in fuzzy numbers in this study is approximately equal to the true boundary value although the optimized boundary obtained in this study is not completely accurate the relatively accurate results have certain reference value under the risk of low available water water stress could bring some negative effects on crops growth in fig 6 the relatively large soil water stress coefficients low water stress can be observed in maize field the fuzzy numbers in april june and july approach to straight lines the water stress coefficient in each month is all higher than 0 9 that means that water allocation could meet the need of maize in most cases the wheat may be under water stress in july compared with wheat and maize the sunflower has the lowest water stress coefficients which are all lower than 1 in the whole growth period that means the sunflower has 100 probabilities of being water stressed slightly or severely with the possible minimum value at 0 37 4 4 salinization risk the fig 7 shows the soil salinization risk of crops in each month according to the classification standard of soil salinization in hid table 2 and the crops salinization tolerance what should be pointed out is that the soil is already severely salinized s at the initial growth period april or june the severe salinization exceeds the tolerance thresholds of maize and sunflower and makes these two crops under salt stress at initial growth period the fuzzy numbers of soil salt content in maize and sunflower fields are all in severe salinization region s this means the probabilities of severe salinization in maize and sunflower fields are both 100 in wheat field the soil salt content changes greatly the initial soil salt content in wheat field is lower than 7 g kg and lower than the salinization tolerance threshold of wheat thus the wheat growth is not affected by salinization in the early growth stage however the increase of ground water level in wheat field inevitably lead to the increase of soil salt content in may and june fig 5 and the possible maximum soil salt content in wheat field exceeds the salinization tolerance threshold of wheat in may june and july leading the condition of wheat soil changing from severe salinization s to very severe salinization vs how to calculate the risk of extremely severe soil salinization in wheat fields the fuzzy number in this paper is essentially a simplification of probability distribution the fuzzy numbers of wheat in may june and july in fig 7 are obtuse triangles that is the possible minimum value is greater than the maximum possible value it is due to the overlapping part between probability distributions of possible minimum values and maximum possible value mpv and the tradeoff in water allocation process the reason is the same as 4 3 section presented in this section it is assumed that obtuse triangle fuzzy numbers are caused by the randomness of the possible minimum available water amount and uncertain allocation patterns therefore the perpendicular line of the triangle the dashed line in the figure is considered as the minimum boundary of the obtuse triangular fuzzy number the risk value of very severe salinization in wheat field is the ratio of the area of very severe salinization to the area of right triangle after calculation the probability risk value of wheat soil reaching to the level of extremely severe salinization vs in may june and july is 2 02 5 24 and 4 72 respectively the soil salinization in wheat field is at the highest level in june actually the initial soil salt content has large impacts on the salt stress level of crops in the later growth period if the initial soil salt content is less than 5 g kg later soil salt content will not exceed the salinization tolerance threshold of wheat that means the wheat will not be salt stressed in the whole growth period therefore it is suggested that local managers can try to take measures to decrease the initial soil salt content of wheat to avoid severe soil salinization problems 4 5 analysis in whole growth period this study takes fengji water supply response unit as an example to show the whole hydrological process during the whole growth period shown in fig 8 the following analysis will take wheat as an example in the case of pvmin the groundwater resource is an important source for crops growth which is largely extracted in may and june the critical growing period of wheat in the case of pvmax the yellow river diversion becomes larger making the ground water level largely rise with the value even less than 1 m high ground water level increases the groundwater recharge in june both of high ground water level and more groundwater recharge lead to the increase of the soil salt content which exceeds 12 g kg in may june and july resulting in the soil condition at very severe salinization that means although high soil water content can ensure that crops are not affected by drought stress crop roots are still possibly affected by salt stress for example the water allocation of wheat in june is higher than the water demand however due to salt stress the actual water consumption is less than the possible highest water consumption and the final yield is also less than the maximum yield therefore in a sense the optimization at crop scale is a balance between water stress and salt stress the controlling of the soil salt content in most cases the soil salt content shows a steadily rising trend from the initial growth stage to the final growth period shown in figs 7 and 8 which is similar with the study of ren et al 2017 in hid due to the damage of high soil salt content to crops growth wang et al 2012 some researchers set the maximum soil salt accumulation as a constraint in optimization models li et al 2020a 2020b zhang et al 2019a 2020 mahmoodi eshkaftaki and rafiee 2020 to control the increase of soil salt content however decreasing the soil salt content will need more water to discharge soil salts into groundwater by irrigation infiltration or drain the salt through the drainage which is not conductive to the improvement of water use efficiency especially when available water is limited actually the large increase in soil salt content mainly happens in conditions with high ground water level the optimal ground water level may be helpful for controlling the excessive soil salt accumulation ren et al 2016 4 6 objectives fig 9 shows the changing trend of three objective functions with the total water allocation the objective 1 related to the total crop production in hid increases firstly and then steadily keep stable with the total water allocation the objective 2 the total water use efficiency of hid firstly increases to a peak value and then decreases slowly and steadily the objective 3 total energy consumption increases gradually as the total water allocation increases it can be seen that the total water allocation in the case of pvmax and mpv is very close however all the water allocation at pvmax case is from the yellow river while some water allocation at mpv case is from groundwater resource fig 4 the total yield at pvmax case is lower than that at mpv case because 1 the total water allocation at pvmax case is a little lower than that at mpv case 2 the higher ground water level at pvmax case will increase soil salinization problems which may bring salt stress to crops object 3 is the total energy consumption which reaches to 0 247 92 kw h and 259 26 kw h at pvmax mpv and pvmin case energy consumption is proportional to the amount of groundwater eq 1p at pvmin case maize is the biggest energy consumer occupying 52 08 of total energy consumption while wheat and sunflower account for 25 52 and 22 41 of total energy consumption at mpv case sunflower uses the largest groundwater 44 32 of the total energy consumption because more water diversion is allocated to maize and wheat to guarantee food security the tradeoff among three objectives the multi objective tradeoff is well reflected in this study the three objective functions include two max objectives and one min objective the total objective values at pvmax mpv and pvmin cases were 0 43 0 40 and 0 38 respectively however each sub objective value does not get larger with the increase of available water instead these three sub objectives change in different directions for example in the case of pvmax the amount of yellow river diversion and groundwater resources are enough to ensure the total crop yield to get a high value that means in this case it is possible for the total yield value target 1 to be higher than the total yield value target 1 at mpv case it is also possible for the overall wue to reach to a high value higher than the wue at pvmin case however the optimized result is that the total crop yield at pvmax case is lower than that at mpv case and the wue is also lower than that at pvmin and mpv cases it is the lowest groundwater extraction that makes the overall objective value at pvmax reach to the highest value based on the above it can be imagined that the surface with three sub objective values as the first second and third dimensions and the overall objective value as the fourth dimension may be curved and more convex fig 10 4 7 uncertainties this study mainly considers the uncertainties from available water including water diversion from the yellow river and groundwater resources the pvmax case adopted the possible maximum values of the yellow river diversion and groundwater resource the corresponding generated result is the maximax value liu and iwamura 1998a 1998b in the same way the pvmin case adopted the possible minimum values of the yellow river diversion and groundwater resource in which the obtained allocation result is the minimin value these two cases are both extreme cases in fact except for explicit uncertainties from available water the system also has potential uncertainties during water allocation process in general the reduction of available water may reduce crop yield and bring a threat to crop growth however crops have different sensitivities to water deficit at different growth stages yang et al 2021 different allocation schemes may differently affect the crops growth therefore which brings a potential uncertainty to crops growth in another word even though available water is a deterministic value the total crop yield water use efficiency and total energy consumption are all fluctuating in a certain range these values are uncertain caused by uncertain allocation schemes the allocation scheme presented in this study is the optimized result with balances among multi crops multi units multi growth stages the proper water allocation can actually reduce the yield reduction risk caused by possible water shortage therefore the optimized water allocation pattern in this study has already artificially avoided the risk of crop loss caused by improper water allocation this is also a suggestion that facing with uncertain available water local managers should try their best to seek optimal water allocation patterns to avoid the waste of water resources caused by unreasonable water allocation the water stress risk and salinization risk in this study are all based on optimization with integrating the spatial integrity and time integrity in hid and are possible to be less than the risk values under non optimal water allocation patterns 4 8 limitation there are some limitations in this study 1 it should be mentioning the potential limitation of established model and the corresponding data they are based on field experiments long term observation and empirical functions these data and functions may misrepresent the agricultural system response and adaption to climate variability moreover the limitation of data accuracy will inevitably lead to some deviations and different sensitivities of indicators to systems will generate different degrees of deviations 2 the optimized water allocation scheme is realized through genetic algorithm it is infinitely close to the globally optimal solution by increasing iterations 3000 times in this study 3 this study assumes that the hydrological process in each crop field is independent this simplification improves computation efficiency on the basis of certain accuracy however the fragmented land use pattern of wheat maize and sunflower in hetao irrigation district generates lateral water exchange among different fields leading to redistribution of the ground water level soil water salt content etc xiao et al 2021 the lateral water exchange is ignored in this study more work is needed to incorporate highly accurate simulation in optimization models 5 conclusions this study optimizes the available agricultural water allocation pattern of 3 crops in 12 water supply response units in hetao irrigation district through an integrated model this integrated model integrates process based crop growth model and fuzzy multi objectives optimization model the rounded analysis is presented including optimized water allocation pattern and its impacts on ground water level and the whole crop growth process the water stress risk and soil salinization stress are both discussed which caused by uncertain available water the amount of water diversion and groundwater and uncertain water allocation pattern the multi objectives defined in this study balances the conflicts of maximizing crop production maximizing water use efficiency and minimizing energy consumption after this trade off the optimized results show that the crop yield does not necessarily reach to the highest potential value though wheat and maize are allocated more water than sunflower and have larger possibility to reach high crop yield significant energy investment is needed for extracting and purifying groundwater to maintain relatively high crop production at the case of possible low available water under uncertainties of water diversion and groundwater optimized water allocation pattern will cause a greater range of ground water level in wheat field and indicates a high risk of water stress in sunflower field and a high risk of very severe salinization in wheat field the different changing directions of three sub objectives demonstrate that optimal water allocation has no uniform rule but changes with available water the established model seeks to maximize the benefits such as maximize crop production maximize water use efficiency and minimize energy consumption of the whole hetao irrigation district without considering the fairness of different response units the obtained result in this study is an ideal water allocation pattern compared with real world solutions additionally this study also indicates the importance of furtherly analyzing ecological environment affected by optimal water allocation pattern the changed soil salinization level and ground water level inevitably have influences on local ecosystem which are desired to be undertaken in the future study credit authorship contribution statement

9886,the projected increasing food demand in the coming decades will require substantial water and energy resources practical approaches are expected to propose to realize enhancing crop production while towards sustainable development in shallow groundwater area this study integrates a process based model multi objectives and fuzzy theory into optimization model to optimize crops water allocation pattern under uncertainties of water diversion and groundwater the process based model considers the water exchange between soil and groundwater water stress and salt stress on crops and ground water level changes the multi objectives defined in this study balances the conflicts of maximizing crop production maximizing water use efficiency and minimizing energy consumption the uncertain amount of water diversion and groundwater is presented as fuzzy numbers the optimized water allocation pattern of 3 crops in 12 water supply response units in hetao irrigation district show that the crop yield does not necessarily reach to the highest potential value though wheat and maize are allocated more water than sunflower and have larger possibility to reach high crop yield significant energy investment is needed for extracting and purifying groundwater to ensure relatively high crop production at the case of possible low available water uncertainties of water diversion

risk sustainable agricultural development 1 introduction human food demand is projected to substantially increase as a result of growing population and social economy development davis et al 2017 li et al 2019a 2019b the increasing food demand will require large amount of water and energy resources which may not be able to keep pace with human growing food demand davis et al 2016 tian et al 2018 sustainable development is called for frequently and urgently in recent years in terms of enhancing food production and minimizing its impacts on water and energy resources ren et al 2021 recent work has provided promising water use strategies in irrigated areas that face frequent water shortage or have limited access to water resource hoekstra et al 2012 brauman et al 2016 elliott et al 2014 the reasonable water allocation pattern balancing multiple resources is also urgently demanded in shallow groundwater area better integrating food production and the usage of water and energy resources is significant in shallow groundwater area featured with shallow ground water level and possible soil salinization xu et al 2012 although groundwater is a reliable and stable water source for agriculture to potentially improve crop production haile et al 2019 banks et al 2020 overexploitation may threaten vulnerable shallow aquifers shekhar et al 2015 du et al 2020 haile et al 2019 siarkos et al 2021 and engender competition for water or energy between agriculture and other sectors saleh et al 2011 the intricate relationship between water energy food and its significance has been highlighted in the water energy food security nexus conference held in bonn germany in 2011 hoff 2011 this insight has been recognized as an important evaluation pattern for sustainable intensification pathways in multiscale regions ringler et al 2013 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 lee et al 2020 ding et al 2021 wu et al 2021 kamrani et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a 2018b zhang and ren 2021 zeng et al 2019 si et al 2019 recent work in shallow groundwater area has assessed the trade off between groundwater conservation and crop production zhang et al 2018a 2018b and discussed the exploitation potential of groundwater with concerns of salinization and ecological water demand li et al 2019a 2019b however limited case study examples incorporated available water resource including surface water and groundwater energy consumption soil salinization and crop growth to propose optimal water allocation pattern from a large scale available water is an important factor limiting agricultural development uncertain available water caused by unpredictable climate variability or human activities enhances difficulties in formulating sustainable strategies li et al 2019a 2019b like how to optimally allocate water under uncertainties to address uncertainties existing in systems it is necessary to introduce probability distribution functions of uncertain indices or other simplified distribution curves in light of limited access to effective data into decision making process as handling methods of multiple uncertainties have been developed yu et al 2020 tabatabaie and murthy 2020 although determining confidence level and risk preference may offer policy makers preferred strategy ji et al 2020 it is essential that deciders can see all possibilities created by multi uncertainties moreover the accompanying environmental impacts of given plans and uncertainties relate to applicability of the scheme and are expected to be included radmehr et al 2020 namany et al 2019 thus requiring process based model synthesizing into comprehensive model this study aims to 1 propose optimal agricultural water allocation pattern in shallow groundwater area with consideration of saving water and energy resource under uncertainties 2 analyze impacts of proposed strategy on crops growth and environment such as ground water level soil salinization and water stress on crops in order to achieve the above study aims this study integrates a process based model multi objectives and fuzzy theory into optimization model to identify the optimal water allocation pattern for 3 major crops in 12 water supply response units of shallow groundwater area in doing this this study will 1 determine the groundwater and water diversion distribution that is mostly suitable in each unit and analyze whole water use process such as actual evapotranspiration groundwater phreatic soil water content etc 2 deeply reveal the relationship between crop production energy consumption and water use efficiency 3 examine accompanying environmental problems resulting from optimized water allocating pattern and uncertainties such as ground water level changes and soil salinization problems the developed comprehensive model contains the balance of water energy food detailed crop growth process and uncertainties the optimized water allocation can leave shallow groundwater area less susceptible to uncertain available water to some extent thereby offering reference strategy for agricultural sustainable development in shallow groundwater area 2 study area 2 1 study area hetao irrigation district hid is located in the west of inner mongolia autonomous region 40º13 42º28 n 105º12 109º53 e in china fig 1 arid and semi arid region with a typical temperate continental semiarid and monsoon climate sun 2014 the annually average temperature is 6 10 с with maximum and minimum temperature at around 23 72 с mostly occurring in july and 9 58 с mostly occurring in january in this area the annually average precipitation is less than 250 mm mostly concentrating from june to september while the annual evaporation reaches to 2011 2300 mm xue et al 2018 according to local canal system distribution land use distribution irrigation condition soil characteristics and administrative division hid is divided into 12 water supply response units luo et al 2021 where the crop and soil condition are assumed to be consistent in each water supply response unit hid is an important commodity grain base of china more than 80 planted area is used for growing wheat maize and sunflower which are selected as study crops in this study the meteorological drought year 2011 is regarded as the crop growth context the irrigation for local agriculture development depends on the water diversion from the yellow river in the past 30 years the amount of water diversion from the yellow river from april to september is 2 324 4 036 billion m3 perennial water diversion makes much water seep down into groundwater and raises local ground water level resulting in frequent water exchange between surface soil water and groundwater long term experimental observations show that the average annual groundwater depth is fluctuating between 1 5 m and 3 m xu et al 2010 sun et al 2016 and the groundwater recharge offers crops around 1 3 of total water consumption xu et al 2010 sun et al 2016 vertical water exchange predominates in hid resulting from the flat terrain with the mean slope at 0 05 and poor drainage substantial salt carried with irrigation water and groundwater phreatic is remained in shallow soil owing to intense evaporation and poor salt drainage negatively influencing vegetation growing the hydrological process in 12 water supply response units is shown in fig 2 there are uncertainties in the water diversion in crop growing season and groundwater availability caused by stochastic climate variability and unmanageable human activities attainable limited effective data are insufficient to analyze probability distributions such as the gaussian distribution thus they are expressed as fuzzy numbers according to fuzzy theory triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are simplistically approximate shapes of probability distribution curves and are drawn in supplementary figs s3 and s4 month to month 2 2 water supply priority during water allocation process the priorities among 12 water supply response units and among 3 crops should be concerned in this study the determination of priority among water supply response units is based on farmland

et al 2021 supplementary table s1 the priority among three crops in each unit is achieved by using the coefficient of variation method with considerations of the change of yield economic benefits and irrigation water productivity under different drought scenarios supplementary table s2 2 3 problem statement agricultural development in hetao irrigation district depends on the amount of available water as mentioned above hetao irrigation district has the following five features 1 the priorities of 12 water supply response units are different due to different terrain conditions and potential farmland productivity 2 the priorities of 3 main crops are different in each water supply response unit due to different planting area and agricultural output value 3 the growth of crops is affected by both water stress and salt stress 4 the water diversion from the yellow river and the available groundwater are uncertain that can be expressed as fuzzy numbers 5 exploiting and purifying groundwater requires a certain amount of energy 6 there is a certain contradiction between improving crop yield and water use efficiency therefore the problem is how to optimally allocate available water including uncertain water diversion and uncertain groundwater to 3 crops in 12 water supply response units on the basis of ensuring crop production and saving water and energy resources 3 model development in order to solve the above problem this study aims to optimize the irrigation water of 3 crops including wheat maize and sunflower in 12 water supply response units from the perspective of water energy food it is the water that connects energy and food in agricultural system water is the foundation of crops growth and food security the extraction and purification of groundwater will consume certain energy therefore maximizing crop production improving water use efficiency and saving energy resource are set as three sub objectives which are contradictory to some extent the crop yield is calculated by jensen water production function and considering the priorities of different water supply response units and different crops the water use efficiency is the ratio of total crop production to the total water consumption the total energy consumption is the sum of the energy used to purify groundwater and that used to extract groundwater four constraints are included related to available water food security soil water content and non negative constraints according to the fuzzy theory the uncertain water diversion and available groundwater are presented as fuzzy numbers thus the multi objective fuzzy optimization model is established which is solved by genetic algorithm on matlab r2019a the weights of three objectives are determined by ahp method finally the optimized alternatives water stress salt stress the conflicts of multi objectives and uncertainties in the system are analyzed in the later sections the system framework of this study is as shown in fig 3 3 1

water food energy nexus consisting of the weighted crop production food water use efficiency water and the total energy consumption energy as follows 3 2 1 maximize the sum of weighted crop production

water demand pumping groundwater is necessary to supply additional water for crops growth and guarantee crop yield however the salt content of groundwater in hid is higher than the standard for irrigation that makes more salt introduced in shallow soil therefore the energy consumption mainly includes the energy for pumping and purifying groundwater minimizing the total energy consumption is

shown in supplementary figs s1 and s2 the maximum value of fuzzy numbers is the possible maximum value pvmax the value with the highest frequency is the maximum possible value mpv and the minimum value of fuzzy numbers is the possible minimum value pvmin in fact the fuzziness of available water will lead to the fuzziness of other obtained indicators related to crops growth the strong nonlinearity of the established model may lead the fuzzy indicators nonlinear which may be non standard triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers gonzalez gonzalez et al 2014 however pvmax mpv and pvmin values theoretically must exist in each standard or non standard fuzzy number therefore this study simplifies indicators fuzzification as triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy number formed by pvmax mpv and pvmin values without considering nonlinearities of fuzzy numbers 4 1 water allocation fig 4 shows the water allocation of 12 water supply response units under uncertainties among three crops the groundwater is more allocated to wheat in may and june while the water diversion is reliably allocated to maize in may and july the fuzzy ratio of water allocation for maize to total water diversion is 50 01 57 48 67 77 which means over half of water diversion is allocated to maize fig s6 and this proportion will increase under the case of possible low water diversion it can be seen that the uncertain space of diversion allocation of maize is smaller than other two crops wheat and maize are allocated more water diversion and groundwater resource because they have relatively high priorities for ensuring food security and higher water use efficiencies than that of sunflower crop water allocation is not always less or equal to the crop demand water which may differ with many researches on precise irrigation jo and shin 2021 supplementary fig s4 it is the local traditional water diversion modes large water diversion in april and may that causes this phenomenon in april wheat and may maize the amount of water diversion exceeds the crops water demand high irrigation amount can greatly supplement soil water and largely raise the ground water level thus providing a good soil environment for crops growth in the later stages for example the water allocation in june and july is less than crop highest water demand while the water consumption of crops reaches to the maximum values because of high soil water storage and phreatic evaporation in early stages the difference between optimized water allocation and water demand of crops indicates suggestions for managers that wheat in april and maize in may should be paid more attention and can be allocated more water in fields the water diversion is the main source of water allocation in hid supplementary fig s6 under the condition of pvmax the irrigation water for crops growth in hid is all from the yellow river diversion even in the case of pvmin the yellow river diversion accounts for more than 60 of the total water allocation of each crop the rank of total water allocation amount of three crops is maize sunflower wheat sunflower has relatively high water allocation because of its large planting area in addition the crop yield does not always reach to the maximum values it can be seen in supplementary fig s6 that the yield of maize is all lower than the maximum yield in 12 water supply response units the maximum yield of maize is 95 95 96 10 96 85 of ym in yigan water supply unit and the minimum is 94 30 93 82 93 52 of ym in tongji water supply unit the yield is the optimal value after balancing the yield water use efficiency and energy consumption the wheat has higher possibilities to reach the maximum yield in the west of hid and the sunflower has higher possibilities to get the maximum yield in the east of hid comparison of water allocation among 12 water supply response units supplementary fig s5 different water supply response units have significant difference in water allocation of water diversion and groundwater in hetao irrigation district the water diversion and groundwater are mainly allocated to huangji unit no 4 yongji unit no 5 and fengji unit no 6 the water diversion allocated to these three units is all over 12 of total available water diversion at pvmin mpv and pvmax cases moreover the groundwater allocated to yongji unit no 5 reaches to the maximum value with 16 08 24 29 and 14 54 of total available groundwater in hetao irrigation district the reason behind the allocating difference may be that these water supply units have better soil and climate condition resulting in relatively high water use efficiency and water supply priorities compared with these three units tongji unit no 10 changji unit no 11 and tabu unit no 12 have significantly lower water allocation this is the result after optimization from the perspective of the whole hetao irrigation district which may be inapplicable in real world owing to unfairness 4 2 ground water level agricultural irrigation is the main factor of raising ground water level in hid as shown in fig 5 the ground water level rises first and then decreases steadily mostly reaching to the highest value in may this annual variation is similar with the study results of ren et al 2017 in hid among of three crops the water level in the wheat field fluctuates the most with the highest level less than 1 m may and june and the lowest level closing to 6 m june and july the raise of ground water level may increase the salt content of the shallow soil the drop of the ground water level in the wheat field mainly comes from two aspects the first is the decrease of irrigation reduces infiltration from surface into groundwater the second is that groundwater exploitation reduces the ground water level compared with wheat and maize the ground water level in sunflower field maintains a relatively stable changing trend due to its lower water allocation 4 3 water stress risk fig 6 shows fuzzy values of soil water stress coefficients k s w of crops in each month theoretically it seems more reasonable for fuzzy numbers of water stress coefficients to be acute triangles with smallest value at pvmin condition and largest value at pvmax condition naveena et al 2021 however the water stress coefficient of sunflower in september at pvmax condition is less than that at mpv condition whose fuzzy number is an obtuse triangle we believe that it is the tradeoff during water allocation process that causes the aberrance the optimization framework does not only consider one kind of crop or just single time but contains the whole growth periods of three kinds of crops in 12 water supply response units therefore from the perspective of overall optimization although the total available water is at a high level it is still possible that the water allocation of one crop at one time is small after the overall tradeoff in fact under uncertainties the water allocation result is not just one value but a set of solutions the optimized result obtained in this study is only one scheme in the solution set accurately speaking the boundary of water stress conforms to a certain probability distribution the boundary in fuzzy numbers in this study is approximately equal to the true boundary value although the optimized boundary obtained in this study is not completely accurate the relatively accurate results have certain reference value under the risk of low available water water stress could bring some negative effects on crops growth in fig 6 the relatively large soil water stress coefficients low water stress can be observed in maize field the fuzzy numbers in april june and july approach to straight lines the water stress coefficient in each month is all higher than 0 9 that means that water allocation could meet the need of maize in most cases the wheat may be under water stress in july compared with wheat and maize the sunflower has the lowest water stress coefficients which are all lower than 1 in the whole growth period that means the sunflower has 100 probabilities of being water stressed slightly or severely with the possible minimum value at 0 37 4 4 salinization risk the fig 7 shows the soil salinization risk of crops in each month according to the classification standard of soil salinization in hid table 2 and the crops salinization tolerance what should be pointed out is that the soil is already severely salinized s at the initial growth period april or june the severe salinization exceeds the tolerance thresholds of maize and sunflower and makes these two crops under salt stress at initial growth period the fuzzy numbers of soil salt content in maize and sunflower fields are all in severe salinization region s this means the probabilities of severe salinization in maize and sunflower fields are both 100 in wheat field the soil salt content changes greatly the initial soil salt content in wheat field is lower than 7 g kg and lower than the salinization tolerance threshold of wheat thus the wheat growth is not affected by salinization in the early growth stage however the increase of ground water level in wheat field inevitably lead to the increase of soil salt content in may and june fig 5 and the possible maximum soil salt content in wheat field exceeds the salinization tolerance threshold of wheat in may june and july leading the condition of wheat soil changing from severe salinization s to very severe salinization vs how to calculate the risk of extremely severe soil salinization in wheat fields the fuzzy number in this paper is essentially a simplification of probability distribution the fuzzy numbers of wheat in may june and july in fig 7 are obtuse triangles that is the possible minimum value is greater than the maximum possible value it is due to the overlapping part between probability distributions of possible minimum values and maximum possible value mpv and the tradeoff in water allocation process the reason is the same as 4 3 section presented in this section it is assumed that obtuse triangle fuzzy numbers are caused by the randomness of the possible minimum available water amount and uncertain allocation patterns therefore the perpendicular line of the triangle the dashed line in the figure is considered as the minimum boundary of the obtuse triangular fuzzy number the risk value of very severe salinization in wheat field is the ratio of the area of very severe salinization to the area of right triangle after calculation the probability risk value of wheat soil reaching to the level of extremely severe salinization vs in may june and july is 2 02 5 24 and 4 72 respectively the soil salinization in wheat field is at the highest level in june actually the initial soil salt content has large impacts on the salt stress level of crops in the later growth period if the initial soil salt content is less than 5 g kg later soil salt content will not exceed the salinization tolerance threshold of wheat that means the wheat will not be salt stressed in the whole growth period therefore it is suggested that local managers can try to take measures to decrease the initial soil salt content of wheat to avoid severe soil salinization problems 4 5 analysis in whole growth period this study takes fengji water supply response unit as an example to show the whole hydrological process during the whole growth period shown in fig 8 the following analysis will take wheat as an example in the case of pvmin the groundwater resource is an important source for crops growth which is largely extracted in may and june the critical growing period of wheat in the case of pvmax the yellow river diversion becomes larger making the ground water level largely rise with the value even less than 1 m high ground water level increases the groundwater recharge in june both of high ground water level and more groundwater recharge lead to the increase of the soil salt content which exceeds 12 g kg in may june and july resulting in the soil condition at very severe salinization that means although high soil water content can ensure that crops are not affected by drought stress crop roots are still possibly affected by salt stress for example the water allocation of wheat in june is higher than the water demand however due to salt stress the actual water consumption is less than the possible highest water consumption and the final yield is also less than the maximum yield therefore in a sense the optimization at crop scale is a balance between water stress and salt stress the controlling of the soil salt content in most cases the soil salt content shows a steadily rising trend from the initial growth stage to the final growth period shown in figs 7 and 8 which is similar with the study of ren et al 2017 in hid due to the damage of high soil salt content to crops growth wang et al 2012 some researchers set the maximum soil salt accumulation as a constraint in optimization models li et al 2020a 2020b zhang et al 2019a 2020 mahmoodi eshkaftaki and rafiee 2020 to control the increase of soil salt content however decreasing the soil salt content will need more water to discharge soil salts into groundwater by irrigation infiltration or drain the salt through the drainage which is not conductive to the improvement of water use efficiency especially when available water is limited actually the large increase in soil salt content mainly happens in conditions with high ground water level the optimal ground water level may be helpful for controlling the excessive soil salt accumulation ren et al 2016 4 6 objectives fig 9 shows the changing trend of three objective functions with the total water allocation the objective 1 related to the total crop production in hid increases firstly and then steadily keep stable with the total water allocation the objective 2 the total water use efficiency of hid firstly increases to a peak value and then decreases slowly and steadily the objective 3 total energy consumption increases gradually as the total water allocation increases it can be seen that the total water allocation in the case of pvmax and mpv is very close however all the water allocation at pvmax case is from the yellow river while some water allocation at mpv case is from groundwater resource fig 4 the total yield at pvmax case is lower than that at mpv case because 1 the total water allocation at pvmax case is a little lower than that at mpv case 2 the higher ground water level at pvmax case will increase soil salinization problems which may bring salt stress to crops object 3 is the total energy consumption which reaches to 0 247 92 kw h and 259 26 kw h at pvmax mpv and pvmin case energy consumption is proportional to the amount of groundwater eq 1p at pvmin case maize is the biggest energy consumer occupying 52 08 of total energy consumption while wheat and sunflower account for 25 52 and 22 41 of total energy consumption at mpv case sunflower uses the largest groundwater 44 32 of the total energy consumption because more water diversion is allocated to maize and wheat to guarantee food security the tradeoff among three objectives the multi objective tradeoff is well reflected in this study the three objective functions include two max objectives and one min objective the total objective values at pvmax mpv and pvmin cases were 0 43 0 40 and 0 38 respectively however each sub objective value does not get larger with the increase of available water instead these three sub objectives change in different directions for example in the case of pvmax the amount of yellow river diversion and groundwater resources are enough to ensure the total crop yield to get a high value that means in this case it is possible for the total yield value target 1 to be higher than the total yield value target 1 at mpv case it is also possible for the overall wue to reach to a high value higher than the wue at pvmin case however the optimized result is that the total crop yield at pvmax case is lower than that at mpv case and the wue is also lower than that at pvmin and mpv cases it is the lowest groundwater extraction that makes the overall objective value at pvmax reach to the highest value based on the above it can be imagined that the surface with three sub objective values as the first second and third dimensions and the overall objective value as the fourth dimension may be curved and more convex fig 10 4 7 uncertainties this study mainly considers the uncertainties from available water including water diversion from the yellow river and groundwater resources the pvmax case adopted the possible maximum values of the yellow river diversion and groundwater resource the corresponding generated result is the maximax value liu and iwamura 1998a 1998b in the same way the pvmin case adopted the possible minimum values of the yellow river diversion and groundwater resource in which the obtained allocation result is the minimin value these two cases are both extreme cases in fact except for explicit uncertainties from available water the system also has potential uncertainties during water allocation process in general the reduction of available water may reduce crop yield and bring a threat to crop growth however crops have different sensitivities to water deficit at different growth stages yang et al 2021 different allocation schemes may differently affect the crops growth therefore which brings a potential uncertainty to crops growth in another word even though available water is a deterministic value the total crop yield water use efficiency and total energy consumption are all fluctuating in a certain range these values are uncertain caused by uncertain allocation schemes the allocation scheme presented in this study is the optimized result with balances among multi crops multi units multi growth stages the proper water allocation can actually reduce the yield reduction risk caused by possible water shortage therefore the optimized water allocation pattern in this study has already artificially avoided the risk of crop loss caused by improper water allocation this is also a suggestion that facing with uncertain available water local managers should try their best to seek optimal water allocation patterns to avoid the waste of water resources caused by unreasonable water allocation the water stress risk and salinization risk in this study are all based on optimization with integrating the spatial integrity and time integrity in hid and are possible to be less than the risk values under non optimal water allocation patterns 4 8 limitation there are some limitations in this study 1 it should be mentioning the potential limitation of established model and the corresponding data they are based on field experiments long term observation and empirical functions these data and functions may misrepresent the agricultural system response and adaption to climate variability moreover the limitation of data accuracy will inevitably lead to some deviations and different sensitivities of indicators to systems will generate different degrees of deviations 2 the optimized water allocation scheme is realized through genetic algorithm it is infinitely close to the globally optimal solution by increasing iterations 3000 times in this study 3 this study assumes that the hydrological process in each crop field is independent this simplification improves computation efficiency on the basis of certain accuracy however the fragmented land use pattern of wheat maize and sunflower in hetao irrigation district generates lateral water exchange among different fields leading to redistribution of the ground water level soil water salt content etc xiao et al 2021 the lateral water exchange is ignored in this study more work is needed to incorporate highly accurate simulation in optimization models 5 conclusions this study optimizes the available agricultural water allocation pattern of 3 crops in 12 water supply response units in hetao irrigation district through an integrated model this integrated model integrates process based crop growth model and fuzzy multi objectives optimization model the rounded analysis is presented including optimized water allocation pattern and its impacts on ground water level and the whole crop growth process the water stress risk and soil salinization stress are both discussed which caused by uncertain available water the amount of water diversion and groundwater and uncertain water allocation pattern the multi objectives defined in this study balances the conflicts of maximizing crop production maximizing water use efficiency and minimizing energy consumption after this trade off the optimized results show that the crop yield does not necessarily reach to the highest potential value though wheat and maize are allocated more water than sunflower and have larger possibility to reach high crop yield significant energy investment is needed for extracting and purifying groundwater to maintain relatively high crop production at the case of possible low available water under uncertainties of water diversion and groundwater optimized water allocation pattern will cause a greater range of ground water level in wheat field and indicates a high risk of water stress in sunflower field and a high risk of very severe salinization in wheat field the different changing directions of three sub objectives demonstrate that optimal water allocation has no uniform rule but changes with available water the established model seeks to maximize the benefits such as maximize crop production maximize water use efficiency and minimize energy consumption of the whole hetao irrigation district without considering the fairness of different response units the obtained result in this study is an ideal water allocation pattern compared with real world solutions additionally this study also indicates the importance of furtherly analyzing ecological environment affected by optimal water allocation pattern the changed soil salinization level and ground water level inevitably have influences on local ecosystem which are desired to be undertaken in the future study credit authorship contribution statement

9887,winter wheat production has been constrained by groundwater shortage in north china plain adoption of a suitable saline water irrigation program and fertilizer management can save water and improve yield a three year field experiment was conducted in bohai lowland plain to identify the effects of fertilizer application saline water irrigation quantity and irrigation water salinity on wheat yield water productivity and soil properties manure and chemical fertilizer were used as basal fertilizer saline water irrigation quantities were 80 mm irrigation at jointing stage and 160 mm irrigation at jointing and grain filling stages 80 mm per irrigation irrigation water salinity levels were 2 0 6 0 and 8 8 ds m 1 results showed that greater irrigation quantities improved grain yield by 15 1 regardless of irrigation water salinity with chemical fertilizer in dry year as shown by the increase in 1000 kernel weight manure increased grain yield compared with chemical fertilizer by 15 3 37 5 and 12 3 in three seasons 2017 2020 mainly by increasing spike number regardless of saline water irrigation quantity or irrigation water salinity increases in grain yield and aboveground

2016 meanwhile salinity significantly affects wheat production in areas that border the bohai sea yang 2008 groundwater from the deep aquifer has been used for irrigation over the past 30 years to maintain high grain yield this practice has resulted in groundwater overexploitation and continuing depletion of the water table van oort et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 to address this situation

application stage of deficit irrigation with salinity 3 g l 1 was at the jointing stage the tassel stage and the grouting stage wu and wang 2009 however there is limited understanding of the combined

efficiently used as soil amendment in farmlands guo et al 2020 munir et al 2012 found that farm manure reduced soil ec decreased the sodium adsorption ratio sar and lowered ph and increased soil nitrogen content available phosphorus and extractable potassium thus reducing the harmful effects of saline water irrigation organic fertilizer in contrast to chemical fertilizer significantly increased soil organic carbon accumulation cai et al 2019 and reduced soil organic carbon stability by increasing labile carbon fractions luan et al 2019 pot experiments with daily irrigation using saline water indicated that the application of farmyard manure produced 29 more wheat dry matter yield than applications of inorganic fertilizer ahmed et al 2010 huang et al 2019 showed that when sweet corn was alternately irrigated with brackish water 0 2 6 and 10 ds m 1 and fresh water biochar amendment increased the effectiveness of saline irrigation few studies have focused on the effects

naresh et al 1993 during the three seasons 41 3 80 4 mm 0 0 mm and 3 7 5 5 mm of the precipitation fell from october 1st to wheat sowing fig 1 so all plots were irrigated with 80 mm fresh water before sowing in the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons to ensure seed germination and promote tilling the same dose of urea 450 kg ha 1 was used for all treatments during wheat jointing stage apart from

layer was greater for q2 and q3 than for q1 respectively by 38 8 and 68 9 soil ec increased greatly over the three years of the experiment with continuous saline water irrigation 3 2 2 soil organic matter soil organic matter in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased for f1 over f2 in each season especially during 2018 2019 fig 8 soil organic matter in the 0 20 cm soil layer was 11 61 g kg 1 for f2 and 12 47 g kg 1 for f1 an increase of 7 4 during 2017 2018 soil organic matter in the 0 20 cm layer was 10 10 g kg 1 for f2 and 13 90 g kg 1 for f1 a significantly increase of 37 6 during 2018 2019 soil

three seasons there were no significant differences in soil available phosphorus and soil available potassium between fertilizer treatments saline water irrigation quantities or irrigation water salinities soil available phosphorus in the 0 160 cm soil layer decreased over the experimental period probably due to insufficient phosphate in fertilizer i e plant phosphate absorption exceeded phosphate supplied by the fertilizer 3 3 comprehensive evaluation of yield and water use efficiency heatmap analysis indicated that the control plot f2w1q1 and f1w1q1 were included in a small cluster during 2017 2018 f1w1q1 had greater grain yield and swd than the control in 2017 2018 f1w1q3 f2w1q2 and the control were in a large cluster and the 1000 kernel weights for f1w1q3 and f2w1q2 were less than the control in 2017 2018 water productivity wpc wuec and wpi grain yield kernels per spike and aboveground biomass for f1w1q1 f1w1q2 and f1w1q3 were greater than for the control in 2018 2019 f2w1q2 f2w1q3 and the control were in a small cluster for similarity in water productivity yield yield components swd and et in 2019 2020 f1w1q1 had higher values of wpc wpi grain yield spike number

the control f1w1q3 had higher values of water productivity aboveground biomass kernels per spike grain yield and spike number and lower values of harvest index and 1000 kernel weight than the control fig 10 entropy topsis analysis was used to identify which treatment of the twelve was optimal in terms of greater yield and water productivity the top three entropy weights in each season were wpi spike number and grain yield in 2017 2018 harvest index 1000 kernel weight wpc and wpi in 2018 2019 and wpi wpc and kernels per spike in 2019 2020 and the top three entropy weights in 3 year average were wpi wpc and et table 4 treatments that are considered to be better have a greater value of the comprehensive evaluation index c for 2017 2018 the top three treatments were ranked f1w1q3 f1w1q2 f1w1q1 for 2018 2019 the top three treatments were ranked f1w1q3 f1w1q2 f1w2q2 for 2019 2020 the top three treatments were ranked f1w1q1 f1w1q3 f2w1q1 the optimal treatment was determined to be f1w1q3 by analyzing c value of 3 year average the worst treatment was f2w2q2 the comprehensive evaluation index for f1 was greater than for f2 w1 had a obviously greater value of c than w2 for 2017 2018 and 2019 2020 the value of c for w1 was slightly greater than for w2 for f1 for 2018 2019 table 5 4 discussion 4 1 yield and water productivity response to deficit irrigation with saline water under various precipitation levels chemical fertilizer has been widely used as base fertilizer for winter wheat production in the north china plain our results indicated that in 2018 2019 a quantity of 160 mm saline water produced a greater wheat yield for treatments with 2 6 and 8 8 ds m 1 irrigation water salinity than a saline water irrigation quantity of 80 mm saline water winter wheat is more sensitive to water stress than salt stress in a dry year the increase in wheat yield for the higher irrigation quantity was due to the increase in 1000 kernel weight grain weight depends on the grain filling rate and duration which are sensitive to precipitation soil water content and air temperature li et al 2019 from the wheat anthesis stage to wheat harvest in june precipitation was 35 7 mm 1 0 mm and 62 2 mm in 2017 2018 wet year 2018 2019 dry year and 2019 2020 normal year irrigation was the main source of soil water in the dry year wuegy and wuebm between irrigation quantities were no significant difference in dry year which may be due to the relatively higher yield aboveground biomass and evapotranspiration with the increased irrigation amount in the wet and normal years irrigation water salinity and irrigation quantity were not limiting factors for wheat growth and yield under deficit irrigation a suitably small quantity of saline water for irrigation can increase wpc and wuec similar to fresh water deficit irrigation li et al 2021 mainly due to the significant decrease in evapotranspiration and the small increase or decrease in grain yield and aboveground biomass the relationship between irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration is positively linear rathore et al 2017 or exponential ren et al 2021 grain yield and wpc were similar under deficit irrigation regardless of irrigation water salinity which differs from the results obtained from sufficient irrigation as described in feng et al 2017 we showed that the saline water threshold of winter wheat can be increased from 6 ds m 1 to 8 8 ds m 1 under deficit irrigation however wheat yield in the dry year and water productivity in the wet and normal years changed with saline irrigation quantities using chemical fertilizer 4 2 the effects of manure on the saline water threshold with deficit irrigation wheat yield obviously decreased as irrigation water salinity increased for the manure treatments in 2017 2018 mainly due to increased 1000 kernel weight irrigation water salinity did not affect wheat yield or water productivity under deficit irrigation and manure treatments in the dry and normal years a greater irrigation quantity for the same irrigation water salinity significantly reduced both wpc and wpi in the manure treatments mostly due to increased evapotranspiration manure improves soil hydraulic conductivity and changes soil water distribution affecting crop water use wang et al 2017 similar to zhang et al 2021 the increase in grain yield from 6 t ha 1 chemical fertilizer treatments to 6 t ha 1 manure treatments was obtained primarily by increase in spike number and to a lesser extent by increase in the number of kernels per spike high spike density increases solar radiation interception and thus promotes photosynthesis in wheat population m zhang et al 2020 spike number is constrained by soil water content especially at the maximum tillering stages meena et al 2019 results showed that soil water depletion was higher for manure treatments than for chemical fertilizer treatments from the wheat sowing to jointing stages our data indicated that the accumulation of aboveground biomass was positively correlated with kernels per spike similar to the finding of wang et al 2020 manure clearly promoted wpc wuec and wpi mainly by increases in yield and aboveground biomass this result differs from that of wang et al 2021 who found that manure increased water productivity more than chemical fertilizer because of lower et in contrast to chemical fertilizer manure increased the saline water threshold of winter wheat from 6 ds m 1 to 8 8 ds m 1 under deficit irrigation which mainly depend on increased yield and water productivity 4 3 soil properties response to saline water and fertilizer under deficit irrigation an increase in soil salt content reduces soil water infiltration and changes the hydro chemical characteristics of the soil yang et al 2020 as irrigation water salinity increased soil organic matter in the 0 20 cm soil layer first decreased and then increased in 2017 2019 and successively decreased in 2019 2020 soil organic carbon is very important in the formation and stabilization of 0 25 2 0 mm soil aggregates which improves soil structure guo et al 2018 some studies have found that soil dissolved organic carbon increased as soil salinity increased which due to the reduced microbial activity decreased the decomposition rate of organic carbon and accelerated the release of dissolved organic matter from soil aggregates qu et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 however other studies have found that salinity was negatively correlated with soil organic matter which can be explained by an increase in salinity decreasing plant production morrissey et al 2014 usman et al 2016 soil ec continuously increased with the saline water irrigation in three wheat seasons we found that salt stress decreased the accumulation of soil organic matter probably through reduced plant productivity but that low salt stress increased the accumulation of soil organic matter possibly by decreasing microbial activity ding et al 2021 found that soil salinity decreased by 37 and sodicity decreased by 34 for a combination of deep tillage and organic soil amendment in contrast with no tillage and unamended soils our results are consistent with this finding soil ec in the 0 160 cm soil layer decreased and soil organic matter in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased for manure treatments over chemical fertilizer treatments organic amendments combined with inorganic fertilizer application significantly increase soil water retention due to an increase in soil organic carbon content zhou et al 2020 manure significantly increased soil water depletion in the dry year mainly due to increased soil water retention under saline irrigation soil organic matter promotes soil water retention by altering soil aggregation and changing pore size distribution nieder and benbi 2008 moreover soil organic matter promotes microbial metabolic activity and nutrient cycling by affecting the populations of bacteria fungi and actinomyces in rhizosphere soils li et al 2020 and then soil organic matter facilitated the nitrogen uptake in winter wheat which decreased available nitrogen no3 n in the soil after wheat harvest milkereit et al 2021 also found that manure rapidly increased diversity of bacterial taxa related to nitrogen cycle moreover topsoil soc and nutrient supply have been found to be positively correlated with crop yield liang et al 2021 wang et al 2010 4 4 comprehensive evaluation based on heatmaps and entropy topsis high crop yield is the goal of arable farmers and a high level of water productivity is important in ensuring efficient use of water resources in agriculture however it is difficult to maximize yield and maintain water productivity while simultaneously minimizing water use heatmap analysis indicated that grain yield and water productivity for f1w1q1 and f1w1q3 were greater than for the control we used entropy topsis analysis to determine the weight of each evaluation index in order to increase the reliability of our results comprehensive entropy topsis analysis of crop yield and water productivity for three seasons having different precipitation patterns showed that of the twelve treatments the combination of manure 80 mm saline water irrigation quantity and 8 8 ds m 1 irrigation water salinity f1w1q3 was relatively optimal this result provides a scientific basis for a rational saline water irrigation and fertilizer management protocol for winter wheat production in the north china plain 5 conclusion wheat yield and water productivity were not significantly influenced by irrigation water salinity under deficit irrigation combined with the use of chemical fertilizer an increase in saline irrigation quantity from 80 mm irrigation at wheat jointing stage to 160 mm irrigation at wheat jointing and grain filling stages 80 mm per irrigation significantly increased 1000 kernel weight by 9 2 thereby increasing wheat yield by 15 1 under chemical fertilizer in a dry year we recommend the use of 80 mm saline water irrigation in wet or normal years and 160 mm in dry years for stable yields and increased water productivity when using chemical fertilizer the type of fertilizer was the primary factor that limited wheat yield rather than saline irrigation quantity and irrigation water salinity manure use increased the saline water threshold from 6 ds m 1 to 8 8 ds m 1 when compared to chemical fertilizer mainly by increasing wheat yield and water productivity manure increased grain yield by 15 3 37 5 and 12 3 and wpc by 5 6 33 7 and 8 6 in the three seasons irrigation water salinity of 6 0 and 8 8 ds m 1 decreased organic matter in the 0 20 cm soil layer from 2 0 ds m 1 salinity by 19 4 and 13 1 for deficit irrigation with saline water manure increased soil organic matter in the 0 20 cm layer by 7 4 37 6 and 16 5 in the three seasons and increased soil water depletion in the 0 160 cm layer by 29 5 151 0 and 25 2 meanwhile it decreased soil ec in the 0 160 cm layer by 30 2 18 7 and 6 0 and soil nitrate nitrogen in the 0 160 cm layer by 68 8 54 3 and 63 7 after wheat harvest in the three seasons thus the use of manure increased winter wheat yield and water productivity when compared to the use of chemical fertilizer heatmaps and entropy topsis analysis indicated that the combination of manure 80 mm saline water irrigation quantity and 8 8 ds m 1 irrigation water salinity f1w1q3 was the relatively optimal method of field management to ensure high yield and good water productivity with saline water irrigation the rate of decrease in soil ec lessened each year for manure treatments when compared with chemical fertilizer treatments the greater effects of manure on wheat yield water

9887,winter wheat production has been constrained by groundwater shortage in north china plain adoption of a suitable saline water irrigation program and fertilizer management can save water and improve yield a three year field experiment was conducted in bohai lowland plain to identify the effects of fertilizer application saline water irrigation quantity and irrigation water salinity on wheat yield water productivity and soil properties manure and chemical fertilizer were used as basal fertilizer saline water irrigation quantities were 80 mm irrigation at jointing stage and 160 mm irrigation at jointing and grain filling stages 80 mm per irrigation irrigation water salinity levels were 2 0 6 0 and 8 8 ds m 1 results showed that greater irrigation quantities improved grain yield

3 37 5 and 12 3 in three seasons 2017 2020 mainly by increasing spike number regardless of saline water irrigation quantity or irrigation water salinity increases in grain yield and aboveground biomass led to higher water productivity saline water irrigation threshold increased from 6 0 to 8 8 ds m 1 with deficit irrigation and manure fertilizer due to the stable high yield irrigation water salinity of 6 0 and 8 8 ds m 1 decreased organic matter 0 20 cm by 19 4 and 13 1 compared with salinity of 2 0 ds m 1 manure increased soil organic matter 0 20 cm by 20 5 and soil water depletion 0 160 cm by 68 6 compared with chemical fertilizer and reduced soil ec by 18 3 and no3 n by 62 2 at 0 160 cm soil depth heatmaps and entropy topsis analysis showed that the optimum field management for high yield and water saving was obtained with the combination of manure fertilizer and saline water irrigation quantity of 80 mm with salinity 8 8 ds m 1 keywords saline water irrigation quantity irrigation water salinity grain yield water productivity soil properties 1 introduction scarce water resources are a major constraint on sustainable wheat production in the north china plain liu et al 2016 meanwhile salinity significantly affects wheat production in areas that border the bohai sea yang 2008 groundwater from the deep aquifer has been used for irrigation over the past 30 years to maintain high grain yield this practice has resulted in groundwater overexploitation and continuing depletion of the water table van oort et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 to address this situation researchers have sought the use of alternative water resources such as saline water sewage water and other poor quality water and have developed new management practices to reduce groundwater overexploitation kang et al 2010 singh et al 2012 xu et al 2013 the use of saline water for irrigation has increased globally kiremit and arslan 2016 saline water is available in different regions of the world and has been successfully used for irrigation when properly scheduled rhoades et al 1992 salinity can seriously limit crop productivity and crop quality seleiman and kheir 2018 by reducing net photosynthesis perveen et al 2013 limiting the rate of leaf growth wang and nii 2000 and decreasing the dry matter of leaves stems and roots chartzoulakis and klapaki 2000 the threshold salinity

been achieved with sufficient irrigation when water salinity was 3 3 6 8 ds m 1 ma et al 2008 wang et al 2015 interaction effects between water salinity and irrigation regimes for wheat were studied by jiang et al 2012 they found that maximum grain yield and water productivity were obtained with 300 mm of water and salinity of 3 2 ds m 1 shani and dudley 2001 showed that crop yields were unaffected by salinity levels at low irrigation quantities mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 found that full irrigation with salinity 5 0 ds m 1 and 65 of full irrigation with salinity 7 5 ds m 1 did not reduce wheat yield for in furrow planting deficit irrigation can save water reduce wheat yield loss and be applied with increased irrigation water salinity yu et al 2020 found a win win relationship between wheat yield and water productivity under deficit irrigation winter wheat is water sensitive at the jointing stage during the winter wheat growth period in the north china plain the optimal application stage of deficit irrigation with salinity 3 g l 1 was at the jointing stage the tassel stage and the grouting stage wu and wang 2009 however there is limited understanding of the combined effects of deficit irrigation and irrigation water salinity on wheat yield or water productivity when seasonal precipitation varies salinity stress can inhibit crop water and nutrient uptake by decreasing osmotic potential of soil khalifeie and mohammadi nejad 2012 salinity also affects the physical and chemical properties of soil such as fertility van hoorn et al 2001 organic matter content mavi et al 2012 and water retention capacity sun et al 2021 amelioration strategies for salt affected soil such as the application of manure biochar or gypsum are intended to mitigate soil salt accumulation in the root zone to levels that do not affect root water uptake and to maintain or improve the chemical and physical properties of the soil mukhopadhyay et al 2021 wu et al 2021 the zero growth in fertilizer strategy recommended the use of manure to substitute synthetic fertilizer x y zhang et al 2020 however only 20 40 of the global nitrogen stored in livestock manure 80 140 tg y was efficiently used as soil amendment in farmlands guo et al 2020 munir et al 2012 found that farm manure reduced soil ec decreased the sodium adsorption ratio sar and lowered ph and increased soil nitrogen content available phosphorus and extractable potassium thus reducing the harmful effects of saline water irrigation organic fertilizer in contrast to chemical fertilizer significantly increased soil organic carbon accumulation cai et al 2019 and reduced soil organic carbon stability by increasing labile carbon fractions luan et al 2019 pot experiments with daily irrigation using saline water indicated that the application of farmyard manure produced 29 more wheat dry matter yield than applications of inorganic fertilizer ahmed et al 2010 huang et al 2019 showed that when sweet corn was alternately irrigated with brackish water 0 2 6 and 10 ds m 1 and fresh water biochar amendment increased the effectiveness of saline irrigation few studies have focused on the effects of manure application on wheat yield and water productivity using deficit irrigation with saline water in field the main objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the effect of irrigation water

three seasons there were no significant differences in soil available phosphorus and soil available potassium between fertilizer treatments saline water irrigation quantities or irrigation water salinities soil available phosphorus in the 0 160 cm soil layer decreased over the experimental period probably due to insufficient phosphate in fertilizer i e plant phosphate absorption exceeded phosphate supplied by the fertilizer 3 3 comprehensive evaluation of yield and water use efficiency heatmap analysis indicated that the control plot f2w1q1 and f1w1q1 were included in a small cluster during 2017 2018 f1w1q1 had greater grain yield and swd than the control in 2017 2018 f1w1q3 f2w1q2 and the control were in a large cluster and the 1000 kernel weights for f1w1q3 and f2w1q2 were less than the control in 2017 2018 water productivity wpc wuec and wpi grain yield kernels per spike and aboveground biomass for f1w1q1 f1w1q2 and f1w1q3 were greater than for the control in 2018 2019 f2w1q2 f2w1q3 and the control were in a small cluster for similarity in water productivity yield yield components swd and et in 2019 2020 f1w1q1 had higher values of wpc wpi grain yield spike number

fig 10 entropy topsis analysis was used to identify which treatment of the twelve was optimal in terms of greater yield and water productivity the top three entropy weights in each season were wpi spike number and grain yield in 2017 2018 harvest index 1000 kernel weight wpc and wpi in 2018 2019 and wpi wpc and kernels per spike in 2019 2020 and the top three entropy weights in 3 year average were wpi wpc and et table 4 treatments that are considered to be better have a greater value of the comprehensive evaluation index c for 2017 2018 the top three treatments were ranked f1w1q3 f1w1q2 f1w1q1 for 2018 2019 the top three treatments were ranked f1w1q3 f1w1q2 f1w2q2 for 2019 2020 the top three treatments were ranked f1w1q1 f1w1q3 f2w1q1 the optimal treatment was determined to be f1w1q3 by analyzing c value of 3 year average the worst treatment was f2w2q2 the comprehensive evaluation index for f1 was greater than for f2 w1 had a obviously greater value of c than w2 for 2017 2018 and 2019 2020 the value of c for w1 was slightly greater than for w2 for f1 for 2018 2019 table 5 4 discussion 4 1 yield and water productivity response to deficit irrigation with saline water under various precipitation levels chemical fertilizer has been widely used as base fertilizer for winter wheat production in the north china plain our results indicated that in 2018 2019 a quantity of 160 mm saline water produced a greater wheat yield for treatments with 2 6 and 8 8 ds m 1 irrigation water salinity than a saline water irrigation quantity of 80 mm saline water winter wheat is more sensitive to water stress than salt stress in a dry year the increase in wheat yield for the higher irrigation quantity was due to the increase in 1000 kernel weight grain weight depends on the grain filling rate and duration which are sensitive to precipitation soil water content and air temperature li et al 2019 from the wheat anthesis stage to wheat harvest in june precipitation was 35 7 mm 1 0 mm and 62 2 mm in 2017 2018 wet year 2018 2019 dry year and 2019 2020 normal year irrigation was the main source of soil water in the dry year wuegy and wuebm between irrigation quantities were no significant difference in dry year which may be due to the relatively higher yield aboveground biomass and evapotranspiration with the increased irrigation amount in the wet and normal years irrigation water salinity and irrigation quantity were not limiting factors for wheat growth and yield under deficit irrigation a suitably small quantity of saline water for irrigation can increase wpc and wuec similar to fresh water deficit irrigation li et al 2021 mainly due to the significant decrease in evapotranspiration and the small increase or decrease in grain yield and aboveground biomass the relationship between irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration is positively linear rathore et al 2017 or exponential ren et al 2021 grain yield and wpc were similar under deficit irrigation regardless of irrigation water salinity which differs from the results obtained from sufficient irrigation as described in feng et al 2017 we showed that the saline water threshold of winter wheat can be increased from 6 ds m 1 to 8 8 ds m 1 under deficit irrigation however wheat yield in the dry year and water productivity in the wet and normal years changed with saline irrigation quantities using chemical fertilizer 4 2 the effects of manure on the saline water threshold with deficit irrigation wheat yield obviously decreased as irrigation water salinity increased for the manure treatments in 2017 2018 mainly due to increased 1000 kernel weight irrigation water salinity did not affect wheat yield or water productivity under deficit irrigation and manure treatments in the dry and normal years a greater irrigation quantity for the same irrigation water salinity significantly reduced both wpc and wpi in the manure treatments mostly due to increased evapotranspiration manure improves soil hydraulic conductivity and changes soil water distribution affecting crop water use wang et al 2017 similar to zhang et al 2021 the increase in grain yield from 6 t ha 1 chemical fertilizer treatments to 6 t ha 1 manure treatments was obtained primarily by increase in spike number and to a lesser extent by increase in the number of kernels per spike high spike density increases solar radiation interception and thus promotes photosynthesis in wheat population m zhang et al 2020 spike number is constrained by soil water content especially at the maximum tillering stages meena et al 2019 results showed that soil water depletion was higher for manure treatments than for chemical fertilizer treatments from the wheat sowing to jointing stages our data indicated that the accumulation of aboveground biomass was positively correlated with kernels per spike similar to the finding of wang et al 2020 manure clearly promoted wpc wuec and wpi mainly by increases in yield and aboveground biomass this result differs from that of wang et al 2021 who found that manure increased water productivity more than chemical fertilizer because of lower et in contrast to chemical fertilizer manure increased the saline water threshold of winter wheat from 6 ds m 1 to 8 8 ds m 1 under deficit irrigation which mainly depend on increased yield and water productivity 4 3 soil properties response to saline water and fertilizer under deficit irrigation an increase in soil salt content reduces soil water infiltration and changes the hydro chemical characteristics of the soil yang et al 2020 as irrigation water salinity increased soil organic matter in the 0 20 cm soil layer first decreased and then increased in 2017 2019 and successively decreased in 2019 2020 soil organic carbon is very important in the formation and stabilization of 0 25 2 0 mm soil aggregates which improves soil structure guo et al 2018 some studies have found that soil dissolved organic carbon increased as soil salinity increased which due to the reduced microbial activity decreased the decomposition rate of organic carbon and accelerated the release of dissolved organic matter from soil aggregates qu et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 however other studies have found that salinity was negatively correlated with soil organic matter which can be explained by an increase in salinity decreasing plant production morrissey et al 2014 usman et al 2016 soil ec continuously increased with the saline water irrigation in three wheat seasons we found that salt stress decreased the accumulation of soil organic matter probably through reduced plant productivity but that low salt stress increased the accumulation of soil organic matter possibly by decreasing microbial activity ding et al 2021 found that soil salinity decreased by 37 and sodicity decreased by 34 for a combination of deep tillage and organic soil amendment in contrast with no tillage and unamended soils our results are consistent with this finding soil ec in the 0 160 cm soil layer decreased and soil organic matter in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased for manure treatments over chemical fertilizer treatments organic amendments combined with inorganic fertilizer application significantly increase soil water retention due to an increase in soil organic carbon content zhou et al 2020 manure significantly increased soil water depletion in the dry year mainly due to increased soil water retention under saline irrigation soil organic matter promotes soil water retention by altering soil aggregation and changing pore size distribution nieder and benbi 2008 moreover soil organic matter promotes microbial metabolic activity and nutrient cycling by affecting the populations of bacteria fungi and actinomyces in rhizosphere soils li et al 2020 and then soil organic matter facilitated the nitrogen uptake in winter wheat which decreased available nitrogen no3 n in the soil after wheat harvest milkereit et al 2021 also found that manure rapidly increased diversity of bacterial taxa related to nitrogen cycle moreover topsoil soc and nutrient supply have been found to be positively correlated with crop yield liang et al 2021 wang et al 2010 4 4 comprehensive evaluation based on heatmaps and entropy topsis high crop yield is the goal of arable farmers and a high level of water productivity is important in ensuring efficient use of water resources in agriculture however it is difficult to maximize yield and maintain water productivity while simultaneously minimizing water use heatmap analysis indicated that grain yield and water productivity for f1w1q1 and f1w1q3 were greater than for the control we used entropy topsis analysis to determine the weight of each evaluation index in order to increase the reliability of our results comprehensive entropy topsis analysis of crop yield and water productivity for three seasons having different precipitation patterns showed that of the twelve treatments the combination of manure 80 mm saline water irrigation quantity and 8 8 ds m 1 irrigation water salinity f1w1q3 was relatively optimal this result provides a scientific basis for a rational saline water irrigation and fertilizer management protocol for winter wheat production in the north china plain 5 conclusion wheat yield and water productivity were not significantly influenced by irrigation water salinity under deficit irrigation combined with the use of chemical fertilizer an increase in saline irrigation quantity from 80 mm irrigation at wheat jointing stage to 160 mm irrigation at wheat jointing and grain filling stages 80 mm per irrigation significantly increased 1000 kernel weight by 9 2 thereby increasing wheat yield by 15 1 under chemical fertilizer in a dry year we recommend the use of 80 mm saline water irrigation in wet or normal years and 160 mm in dry years for stable yields and increased water productivity when using chemical fertilizer the type of fertilizer was the primary factor that limited wheat yield rather than saline irrigation quantity and irrigation water salinity manure use increased the saline water threshold from 6 ds m 1 to 8 8 ds m 1 when compared to chemical fertilizer mainly by increasing wheat yield and water productivity manure increased grain yield by 15 3 37 5 and 12 3 and wpc by 5 6 33 7 and 8 6 in the three seasons irrigation water salinity of 6 0 and 8 8 ds m 1 decreased organic matter in the 0 20 cm soil layer from 2 0 ds m 1 salinity by 19 4 and 13 1 for deficit irrigation with saline water manure increased soil organic matter in the 0 20 cm layer by 7 4 37 6 and 16 5 in the three seasons and increased soil water depletion in the 0 160 cm layer by 29 5 151 0 and 25 2 meanwhile it decreased soil ec in the 0 160 cm layer by 30 2 18 7 and 6 0 and soil nitrate nitrogen in the 0 160 cm layer by 68 8 54 3 and 63 7 after wheat harvest in the three seasons thus the use of manure increased winter wheat yield and water productivity when compared to the use of chemical fertilizer heatmaps and entropy topsis analysis indicated that the combination of manure 80 mm saline water irrigation quantity and 8 8 ds m 1 irrigation water salinity f1w1q3 was the relatively optimal method of field management to ensure high yield and good water productivity with saline water irrigation the rate of decrease in soil ec lessened each year for manure treatments when compared with chemical fertilizer treatments the greater effects of manure on wheat yield water

9888,to optimize the irrigation scheduling of field crops to maximize irrigation water productivity requires expert knowledge of the crop development and its productive response to water deficit implementing this idea with commodities such as barley whose current global profitability is low and more specifically in areas where the availability of water resources for irrigation is limited requires a proper decision support system in this research aquacrop and mopeco models were used to compute and compare both the crop water production and irrigation water productivity functions generated by several irrigation strategies provided by each model for the typical irrigated crop barley grown in the area furthermore we evaluated both models performance with a 3 year field experiment applying the methodology of optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water ordil in barley crop the results obtained from the production functions show that gross irrigation water depths giwd of more than 310 mm can be useful to attain the potential crop yield depending on the criteria considered to generate the irrigation scheduling however with less giwd available the simulated barley development was subjected to water deficit leading to a reduction in both crop yield and irrigation water productivity thus mopeco simulated higher crop yields and irrigation water productivity values than those obtained by aquacrop being between 16 and 27 for crop yields and between 8 0 and 27 5 for irrigation water productivity under similar giwd levels these differences are mainly due to how the irrigation strategies are outlined in the two models and the different evapotranspiration methodologies they deploy finally both models provided performed appropriately in simulating final crop yield errors lower than 0 50 103 kg ha 1 as well as canopy cover and aboveground biomass evolution in the case of aquacrop whose goodness of fit indicators were close to 0 90 or higher in terms of crop evapotranspiration aquacrop simulated a 12 higher average value than mopeco it can be concluded that both models are complementary and their use will depend on the necessities of the final user thus mopeco offers a wider range of irrigation strategies while aquacrop offers a more detailed information about the physiological response of the crop during its development being the results of the simulations accurate enough in both models keywords improved crop models parameterization crop water production function irrigation water productivity ordil water scarcity 1 introduction worldwide cereal crops occupy around 51 of the total growing area in spain the seventh largest cereal producer in europe with a production of 5 8 million mg in almost 2 6 million ha of cereal planted area faostat 2019 these commodities especially barley are a key alternative for field agricultural systems in semiarid regions such as the centre and south of spain where there is a clear tendency towards water resource scarcity cramer et al 2020 reductions in irrigation water abstraction in both guadiana and júcar rivers basins in castilla la mancha clm region spain are already a fact applying deficit irrigation techniques di either sustained sdi or regulated rdi fereres and soriano 2007 during crop growth would allow for irrigation strategies that are able to improve crop irrigated water use without causing significant yield losses this methodology would help mitigate climate change effects maximize the production per unit of water consumed developing more resilient agricultural systems and limiting desertification several papers on the barley crop response to water deficit have reported that the end of the vegetative period flowering and yield formation are the most sensitive stages affecting the final crop yield and harvest quality abrha et al 2012 acevedo et al 2002 cossani et al 2009 giunta et al 1993 ugarte et al 2007 barley crop water requirements in clm are around 400 500 mm according to cycle length which varies between 155 and 210 days pardo et al 2020 with the average irrigation water requirements being 250 mm jcrmo 2020 thus the yield of irrigated barley is between 4 and 5 times higher than under rainfed conditions itap 2020 however the current low profitability of this crop and the increasing tendency of the water authority to limit the volume of water for irrigation in the area chg 2020 chj 2020 are forcing growers and technicians to adopt optimal irrigation techniques to reduce the use of irrigation water with the aim of maximizing economic irrigation water productivity pardo et al 2020 several authors have developed algorithms for optimizing irrigation scheduling based on the crop development and its productive response to water deficit garcía et al 2020 kloss et al 2012 kuschel otárola et al 2018 schütze et al 2012 as well as on the real time readings obtained from weather stations and soil moisture sensors installed in the field domínguez niño et al 2020 one of these methodologies is called optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water ordil domínguez et al 2012a leite et al 2015 the main objective of which is to maximize yield at harvest when the amount of available water is lower than the typical irrigation requirements of the crop pardo et al 2020 this methodology is based on the total available volume of irrigation water at the beginning of the irrigation season the sensitivity of the crop to water deficit at its different development stages the evolution of climatic conditions the amount of water received by the crop at each phenological stage and the amount of irrigation water remaining for the following phenological stages until physiological maturity crop simulation models when calibrated and validated can be used as decision support systems for the management of crops farms or agricultural systems among other functions these models calculate the crop water requirements determine the irrigation scheduling and simulate crop yields according to the amount of irrigation water supplied during crop development de wit et al 2019 pereira et al 2003 stöckle et al 2014 mopeco ortega álvarez et al 2004 and aquacrop steduto et al 2009 were designed to be used by researchers and also by technicians and advanced farmers both models are based on fao methodology allen et al 1998 doorenbos and kassam 1979 and the number of parameters required for the simulation of annual crops is low compared with other models as reported by lópez urrea et al 2020 who parameterizated the two models for a barley crop using the data set of a three year experiment carried out in albacete province in the clm region mopeco offers several options and tools that may be useful for the management of actual irrigated farms such as ordil the effect of irrigation uniformity on final yield lópez mata et al 2010 or the optimal distribution of crops depending on the available amount of irrigation water and cultivable area lópez mata et al 2016 aquacrop is able to more precisely simulate the development of annual crops and their final biomass depending on the climatic conditions and availability of water in the soil during the growing cycle providing irrigation scheduling strategies such as full irrigation or allowing a certain soil water depletion level at which an irrigation event is applied therefore the main aim of this research was to assess how operational are both models generating irrigation water scheduling and the model responses with the ordil methodology for barley crop under the semiarid climatic conditions of clm to achieve this aim the following partial objectives were proposed 1 to improve the parametrization of both models for a barley crop developed by lópez urrea et al 2020 determining the average length of the different growing stages of this crop for the different irrigated areas of clm 2 to compute and compare the crop water production functions generated by the tools and strategies provided by each model for the typical conditions of clm 3 to evaluate the accuracy of mopeco and aquacrop models by comparing their results with those obtained in a three year experiment conducted in albacete where the ordil methodology was applied to a barley crop pardo et al 2020 2 material and methods 2 1 description of crop models approach simulation the aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 maintains the original concept proposed in fao 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 but in this case it estimates biomass production from actual crop transpiration through the normalized water productivity wp parameter steduto et al 2012 since the model separates soil evaporation from crop transpiration as is also done by fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2021a crop cycle length is determined by days after sowing das or calculated by using the growing degree days methodology gdd ºc finally crop yield is estimated from the biomass production and the harvest index several stress coefficients soil water air temperature soil fertility and soil salinity are used to adjust the daily green canopy cover crop transpiration above ground biomass and yield formation aquacrop model is now designed to be used with annual crops whose conservative crop parameters are provided in the aquacrop software for many species maize barley wheat cotton rice soybean potato sunflower tomato among others vanuytrecht et al 2014 aquacrop can be used to report the role of different soil climate systems in water limited crop production as well as the analysis of different scenarios such as climate change water supply crop type field management etc vanuytrecht et al 2014 in addition the aquacrop plug in program raes et al 2017 and aquacrop gis lorite et al 2013 together with aquacrop os the open source version foster et al 2017 allow the simulation time to be significantly reduced when both a larger number of simulations are carried out and interpretation and analysis of the results is complex vanuytrecht et al 2014 mopeco was conceived to optimize the gross margin of farms through the use of deficit irrigation strategies de juan et al 1996 it is based on fao 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 and fao 56 allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2020 2021b methodologies for the simulation of yield the model determines the ratio between actual and potential maximum crop evapotranspiration eta and etm respectively for each growing stage domínguez et al 2011 where soil evaporation and crop transpiration components are not separated similarly to aquacrop the crop development is simulated using both das and gdd yields for different amounts of irrigated water supplied to the crop are used to determine the yield vs irrigation depth function the simulation of the irrigation water allocation during the growing period is determined by the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology ordi maximizes yield for a certain water deficit target by determining the eta etm ratios to be applied at each growing stage domínguez et al 2012a under real management conditions where climatic conditions for the growing period are unknown and the amount of available irrigation water is limited mopeco uses the ordil methodology leite et al 2015 both methodologies have been applied to different crops maize domínguez et al 2012a onion domínguez et al 2012b garlic domínguez et al 2013 sánchez virosta et al 2020 carrot carvalho et al 2014 melon leite et al 2015 potato martínez romero et al 2019 and barley pardo et al 2020 2 1 1 aquacrop model irrigation water scheduling when the actual crop evapotranspiration eta is calculated the aquacrop model separates the soil water evaporative component from the crop transpiration steduto et al 2009 thus this model takes into account both the water inputs net irrigation rainfall and capillary rise and outputs runoff deep percolation and eta at the crop root zone in order to compute a daily soil water balance an accurate description of the soil water movement is made by dividing soil depth into several compartments with the thickness of each one being variable according to user specifications the aquacrop manual raes et al 2018 shows a detailed description and the algorithms used to calculate the soil water balance from that balance aquacrop model simulates the irrigation management in three alternative ways a by resolving the net irrigation water requirements of the crop keeping the soil water depletion at the root zone above a threshold which is delimited by the user generally 50 of the readily available water raw these requirements do not take into account the irrigation uniformity effect b by considering a previously designed irrigation schedule where each irrigation event is specified by the user thus date of irrigation event net irrigation depth and the quality of water electric conductivity ecw must be given for each irrigation event c by allowing aquacrop to automatically generate an irrigation schedule according to the criteria established by the user in the third alternative users define in aquacrop the way an irrigation event must be simulated thus two criteria are considered i when the irrigation event has to be triggered irrigation time criterion itc and ii how much water has to be applied through the irrigation system irrigation depth criterion idc being specified to either all the crop cycle or a certain period of time the itc can be established by the user who either fixes a constant number of interval days between irrigation events or selects a soil water depletion threshold either mm of water or of raw the idc also offers two options namely to refill the soil water content up to field capacity or to fix a constant net irrigation depth mm the former option allows over irrigation for avoiding the effect of a low uniformity of irrigation or under irrigation erratic rainfall distribution to be considered finally in this third method which also considers water quality users cannot generate an irrigation schedule coordinating two different options for each criterion along the crop cycle either the itc or idc graphically users may compose their own irrigation strategy according to the crop growth stage initial development mid season flowering and late season and the different soil water stress thresholds mainly leaf expansion growth stomatal closure and canopy senescence finally the model distinguishes between different wetted soil fractions depending on the irrigation system considered thus the percentage of the wetted soil surface fluctuates from 100 sprinkler border and basin irrigation to 0 subsurface drip irrigation with intermediate values for other irrigation systems 30 100 in furrow irrigation and 15 40 in trickle drip micro irrigation 2 1 2 mopeco model irrigation water scheduling mopeco calculates the daily soil water content in the root area following the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 balancing inputs net irrigation precipitation and deep water reached by roots and outputs runoff crop evapotranspiration and deep percolation domínguez et al 2011 in this sense mopeco computes the total available water taw in the root zone understanding taw as the difference in soil water content between field capacity and permanent wilting point and considers a depletion fraction p threshold which is the fraction of taw that a crop can extract without suffering water stress allen et al 1998 domínguez et al 2011 in addition the mopeco irrigation scheduling module requires as input data i the interval of maximum and minimum irrigation depth that can be supplied by the irrigation system per irrigation event mid and mid respectively ii minimum and maximum number of interval days to trigger an irrigation event iii maximum level of soil water content that can be refilled by an irrigation event taw with the aim of decreasing or avoiding percolation when there is unexpected rainfall after an irrigation event thus three situations can be distinguished a maintaining no water deficit along the crop cycle when the soil water content is always higher than p and the irrigation water depth per event is calculated in order to refill the soil water content in an intermediate point between field capacity and 1 p taw taw selected by the user b reaching a certain global water deficit level for the complete crop cycle global eta etm ratio defined by the user with mopeco aiming to determine the water deficit level to be caused to the crop at each phenological stage in order to maximize final yield and c distributing a certain volume of irrigation water during the crop cycle according to the water deficit level for each phenological stage that maximizes yield without exceeding the limited volume according to the progress of climatic conditions in situations b and c mopeco calculates the daily accumulated eta etm ratio from the beginning up to the end of each growth stage if the daily accumulated eta etm ratio at a certain date is higher than the eta etm target ratio for that stage mopeco does not apply any irrigation unless the maximum number of days without water supply irrigation or rainfall is reached or the daily eta etm ratio reaches a minimum value fixed by the user 0 35 is recommended to avoid excessive depletion of soil moisture domínguez et al 2011 the global eta etm ratio of each crop growth stage is established following the ordi and ordil methodologies domínguez et al 2012a leite et al 2015 pardo et al 2020 which produces the highest crop yield for a certain overall deficit target or for a limited irrigation water volume using non linear optimization software such as solver microsoft 2018 mopeco is sometimes unable to attain the target deficit rate proposed for each growth stage by the user or by the optimizer in these cases the irregular distribution of rainfall and or the high soil water content at the beginning of the simulation are the main causes of this mismatch between the objective and the final deficit rate 2 1 3 model parameterization lópez urrea et al 2020 described in detail the parameterization of both models table 1 for barley crop growth under different irrigation regimes using the data of a three year experiment from 2011 to 2013 conducted under the semiarid conditions of albacete province fig 2 2 2 description of the study area the study area is located in southeast spain in a semiarid area where around 70 of water resources used for irrigated crops are from groundwater domínguez and de juan 2008 the three main affected aquifers are eastern mancha western mancha and campo de montiel whose irrigated area is around 350 000 ha distributed over 29 000 km2 fig 1 irrigated barley crop is usually managed under a sprinkler irrigation system because the seasonal average rainfall is between 300 and 350 mm year 1 from september to june and with high reference evapotranspiration 1150 mm year 1 domínguez et al 2013 the typical soils in this area are characterized by shallow depths 0 40 0 55 m which are limited by a somewhat fragmented limestone sedimentary rock they have a slightly basic ph 7 5 8 5 low organic matter content 1 2 1 6 and their general texture is classified as loam or sandy clay loam soils domínguez and de juan 2008 2 3 crop cycle length influenced by climatic variability to determine the average length of the barley crop cycle as well as its development stages in the study area 28 crop phenological monitoring studies carried out by the irrigation advisory service ias of clm siar clm 2014 were used this monitoring work included the four main irrigable areas fig 1 over 11 cropping seasons where short cycle varieties of barley sowed at commercial field which mean area ranging between 5 and 75 ha were mainly studied since they are mostly grown under irrigated conditions sowing date by mid january and harvest date at the end of june the bbch scale bleiholder et al 2001 was used to determine the phenological growth stages of barley related to the input parameters required by both models canopy development mid season and late season for aquacrop kc and ky coefficients for mopeco table a1 annex the thermal time duration of the barley growth stages in terms of accumulated gdd was obtained for both models aquacrop establishes three different methods to calculate gdd mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 with the first method raes et al 2018 being used for simulations while mopeco uses the double triangulation method sevacherian et al 1977 which is suitable in the area the mean accumulated gdd value for each growth stage of barley was calculated taking into account the base temperature tb and the upper temperature tu thresholds combining a set of values reported from several studies from 0 ºc to 10 ºc and from 20 ºc to 38 ºc for tb and tu respectively lópez bellido 1991 juskiw et al 2001 araya et al 2010 abrha et al 2012 and those shown in table 1 the selected final threshold values were derived from the lowest standard deviation and coefficient of variation gdd data for all monitoring barley growth stages 2 4 typical meteorological year a typical meteorological year tmy represents the conditions considered typical over a long period of time and consists of 12 months selected from individual years and concatenated to form a complete year with daily values pardo et al 2020 in this study an intermediate tmy tmyintermediate determined by leite et al 2015 with a weather station located in the experimental area albacete southeast spain fig 2 was used the main values computed for tmyintermediate were 1212 mm year 1 and 289 mm year 1 for reference evapotranspiration eto computed using the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and precipitation respectively 2 5 simulating the crop barley yield response to irrigation management using the gdd methodology already described and applied for a tmyintermediate in the study area leite et al 2015 the crop barley yield and irrigation water productivity iwp expressed as kg of commercial crop yield per m 3 of irrigation water supplied to the crop response to irrigation scheduling were simulated with aquacrop and mopeco the derived crop water and iwp water production functions were compared to evaluate the performance of both irrigation scheduling tools four irrigation strategies is were designed to be implemented in the aquacrop model is1 aq is2 aq is3 aq and is4 aq fig 2 the four strategies were considered as sustained irrigation through the simulated crop cycle in two of the is strategies is1 aq and is2 aq a time criterion was fixed with an interval time between 1 and 27 days where odd days were used obtaining 14 simulations for each is fig 2 table 2 the depth criteria of these is was different is1 aq applied at each irrigation event 23 5 mm of gross water depth while is2 aq refilled the soil water content up to field capacity minus 10 mm as a margin for unexpected rainfall events the other two is strategies is3 aq and is4 aq considered the irrigation event was triggered when a certain soil water content was depleted represented as mm being 12 simulations per each is fig 2 table 2 and following the same irrigation depth criteria previously described i e to apply 23 5 mm per irrigation event is3 aq and to refill up to field capacity minus 10 mm is4 aq the gross irrigation depth of 23 5 mm was established since it is the most widely used according to the representative farm area and the daily irrigation time normally used in addition barley crop yield was also simulated under rainfed conditions in order to find the ordinate of the crop water production function finally the regulated deficit irrigation scheduling taking into account crop growth stages was not analysed because of the huge number of combinations which may be derived surpassing in this case the goals for managing this model by an intermediate user in the case of mopeco two irrigation strategies were performed is1 ordi and is2 ordil fig 2 the first strategy established an optimized regulated deficit irrigation with ten global eta etm ratio objectives between 1 00 y 0 55 fig 2 table 2 to simulate the ordil irrigation strategies is2 ordil ten gross irrigation water amounts were fixed as the input data model which derived in different global eta etm ratios table 2 in the former is the maximum simulated irrigation water amount had a global eta etm ratio equal to 1 00 i e the same total irrigation depth simulated in is1 ordi 312 mm and the rest of simulations were run for irrigation depths differentiated at intervals of 20 mm table 2 a total of 15 and 2 days were established as maximum and minimum intervals between irrigation events when no rainfall occurs the gross irrigation water depth per event was set between 4 and 30 mm fig 2 for the simulations the sowing date was january 13th the maximum root depth was 1 0 m although its development was limited by the root restrictive layer 0 40 m the physical and hydraulic soil characteristics were those measured by pardo et al 2020 which are representative of this production area both models were run in gdd mode using the average gdd for each growth stage from the gdd methodology previously described and using the parameterized coefficients shown in table 1 in this work a value equal to 85 of irrigation efficiency was established corresponding to a sprinkler irrigation system the initial soil water content was established at 80 of field capacity in the case of aquacrop the simulated dry matter yield outputs were normalized to standard commercial yields 12 of moisture content since yield outputs computed by mopeco are given as commercial yield 2 6 experimental dataset using the ordil methodology evaluating the performance of the aquacrop and mopeco models as well as their inter comparison we used several irrigation schedules generated by ordil methodology with a limited total irrigation depth pardo et al 2020 pardo et al 2020 conducted the field trials in 2015 2016 and 2017 on an experimental farm located in albacete se spain its geographic coordinates are 1 53 58 w 38 56 42 n and the altitude is 695 m above mean sea level five treatments of ordil irrigation strategies were carried out to analyse their effects on both iwp and crop yield in the shakira barley cultivar a control treatment no water deficit nd received the full crop water requirements following lópez urrea et al 2020 while the other four irrigation treatments received a percentage of the net typical irrigation water requirements t100 100 t90 90 t80 80 and t70 70 which were adjusted to 2500 m3 ha 1 pardo et al 2020 all irrigation schedules were obtained from pardo et al 2020 those authors carried out four optimizations during the crop cycle length one per each ky stage table 1 in order to maximize crop yield according to the water deficit in terms of eta etm applied to each barley ky stage the soil of the experimental plot classified as clay loam was a shallow soil 0 40 m of average soil depth whose available water content was 0 124 cm3 cm 3 0 313 cm3 cm 3 for field capacity and 0 189 cm3 cm 3 for permanent wilting point during the three experimental cropping seasons eto was between 12 5 and 25 0 higher than the tmyintermediate 400 mm while the total precipitation was lower for 2015 and 2016 experimental seasons around 20 and slightly higher for 2017 season 5 with respect to the tmyintermediate 165 mm pardo et al 2020 real time eta etm optimizations for each ky crop stage were fitted to the weather conditions occurring during the current year the total water received by crop rainfall and irrigation and crop yield obtained for each treatment and experimental seasons are shown in table 3 pardo et al 2020 in addition for each irrigation treatment during the three experimental seasons both the total crop biomass and the leaf area index lai evolutions were measured approximately every 15 days in two subplots of each treatment two samples of 0 5 0 5 m were collected and measured per treatment by using an electronic meter device li cor 3100 c licor inc lincoln ne to determine lai and were introduced into an oven at 70 c up to constant weight for crop biomass crop canopy cover cc was estimated from the measured lai using the ritchie equation ritchie et al 1985 where the extinction coefficient was established as 0 60 1 cc 1 exp k lai where cc is canopy cover k is extinction coefficient lai is leaf area index 2 7 statistical analysis to evaluate the irrigation schedule tools and model performance several evaluation indices were performed to estimate the goodness of fit for both simulated crop water and the iwp water production function of each is cwpf and iwppf respectively with the gross irrigation water depth giwd being the dependent variable in both functions curvilinear and lineal models were used to fit these functions saseendran et al 2015 stewart and hagan 1973 since a portion of the applied water is not used in evapotranspiration and is lost in different process fereres and soriano 2007 thus the coefficient of determination r2 the significance of both model parameters and r2 p value as well as the standard error se of estimate of the regression model were analysed statgraphics centurion xvii software was used to calculate these statistics 2 z a b giwd c giwd 2 3 z a b giwd where z is the commercial crop yield y kg ha 1 or irrigation water productivity iwp kg m 3 a b c are the model s coefficients giwd is the gross irrigation water depth mm with respect to the performance of both models in simulating three experimental trials under ordi methodology the evaluation indices used to determine the goodness of fit of the simulations were root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe efficiency model ef and index of agreement d willmott 1982 4 rmse n 1 s i o i 2 1 2 where rmse is the root mean square error n is the number of observations si and oi are the simulated and observed values respectively 5 mbe n 1 i 1 n s i o i where mbe is the mean bias error 6 ef 1 s i o i 2 o i o 2 where ef is the efficiency model 7 d 1 s i o i 2 s i o o i o 2 where d is the index of agreement rmse was used to analyse the variance of the error which ranges from 0 to positive infinity with the former indicating good and the latter poor model performance the mbe expresses the average size of the estimated errors and was used to indicate the under or overestimations of the model finally the ef and d statistics non dimensional were used as the indicator of model quality where values close to 1 mean there is a good agreement ef ranges between to 1 while d index ranges between 0 and 1 these statistics were computed using the number of independent observations for each treatment for canopy cover and biomass progression only with aquacrop however those statistics were calculated for standard commercial yield 12 of water content with the data set obtained from the five treatments during the three experimental seasons both aquacrop as mopeco finally the differences between observed and simulated yield values were computed to estimate the performance model following the criteria established by a number of authors differences between simulated and observed data lower than 10 and with more than 70 of cases achieving the former percentage domínguez et al 2012c farahani et al 2009 heng et al 2009 lópez urrea et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 duration of barley growing stages in castilla la mancha analysing the barley growth stages with all monitoring field data the lowest values of standard deviation and coefficient of variation were obtained with a temperature combination of 2 ºc and 28 ºc as tb and tu thresholds respectively these temperatures are similar to those proposed by lópez bellido 1991 and araya et al 2010 and the same as those of abrha et al 2012 and lópez urrea et al 2020 these results strengthen the values stipulated by the authors previously cited whose studies were carried out under similar climatic conditions the mean length of barley crop stages for clm conditions are shown in table 4 the methodologies used by both crop models computing the required thermal time for reaching each development stages showed similar values when the barley crop attained the same phenological stage i e bbch scales 39 71 and 89 obtaining differences lower than 4 0 in this sense the accumulated gdd progression at the different crop growth stages either those used by mopeco or by aquacrop was similar in all monitored cropping seasons table a2 annex with the gdd variability decreasing represented as coefficient of variation table 4 with time as has also been observed by other authors using gdd lancaster et al 1996 marinaccio et al 2015 pereira et al 2015 piccinni et al 2009 ruiz corral et al 2002 analysing variability in days after sowing there were differences in duration of between 2 and 11 days for the stages established by both crop models these numbers of days represent as a maximum around 7 with respect to the total crop growth length 150 days thus these variation results can be considered as acceptable following the same criteria given by domínguez et al 2012c in a maize crop cultivated in the same production area finally the average thermal time values calculated for the three main phenological stages used by the aquacrop model table 4 were very similar to those calibrated by lópez urrea et al 2020 these authors parameterized the conservative parameters time to maximum canopy cover and length of the harvest index accumulation as 619 gdd and 675 gdd respectively taking into account that the crop canopy development stage cndv is the same as the first previous parameter described cndv was 13 4 higher this difference for the crop stage may be acceptable since the highest variations are usually found in the first crop growth stage table 4 conversely the second conservative parameter is represented as the gdd remainder between late season lssn table 4 and cndv obtaining 680 gdd which is very close to the stage parameterized by lópez urrea et al 2020 therefore the average thermal time reported in table 4 will be used to simulate the crop cycle length under the conditions of tmyintermediate 3 2 crop vs irrigation water production function obtained by the different irrigation tools provided by the models the four irrigation strategies simulated by aquacrop with a tmyintermediate reached a maximum yield of 11 70 103 kg ha 1 is1 aq is2 aq is3 aq and is4 aq table 2 fig 3a in the same way and as expected similar maximum yields were simulated by mopeco for the two irrigation strategies simulated ordi and ordil table 2 fig 3a although the mopeco model was calibrated for a ym 9 00 103 kg ha 1 table 1 according to the results obtained in the experiments carried out by lópez urrea et al 2020 the ym is not a constant value and depends on many factors such as climatic conditions soil characteristics and crop management sadras et al 2015 consequently this value must be adapted for the conditions of the farm and the year where the simulations were or will be carried out in this sense and in order to achieve a proper comparison between both models the maximum yield obtained by aquacrop was considered as ym for mopeco the barley yield simulated by using aquacrop under rainfed conditions in a tmyintermediate was 2 80 103 kg ha 1 table 2 this value as well as the maximum simulated yield can be considered appropriate according to the crop statistics and field trials carried out in this area itap 2020 mapa 2020 with respect to mopeco the rainfed condition was not simulated since simulated yields are unreliable when the computed eta etm ratio for one or more development stages is lower than 0 5 as happens under rainfed conditions domínguez et al 2012a doorenbos and kassam 1979 overall all iss simulated by both models showed that the maximum yield was reached when gross irrigation water depth giwd was between 300 and 390 mm table 2 fig 3a in the case of aquacrop and excepting is1 all iss simulated yields were close to 11 70 103 kg ha 1 when giwd was higher than 350 mm table 2 while slightly lower giwd values ranging between 300 and 330 mm decreased by yield around 12 in contrast the two iss simulated by mopeco ordi and ordil obtained the maximum yield supplying 312 mm of giwd table 2 simulating giwd lower than 300 mm both crop models showed that barley crop was subjected to water deficit eta etm ratio lower than 1 table 2 nonetheless all iss simulated by mopeco attained crop yields between 16 and 27 higher than those obtained by aquacrop considering similar giwd applications fig 3a analysing the is simulated by aquacrop is1 applying irrigation depths fixed at 23 5 mm per event with an interval time between irrigation events of 1 7 days showed that is not feasible at either economic or environmental level in this simulated interval time deep percolation was highly significant between 88 and 2800 mm table 2 causing crop yield not to increase significantly with a giwd of more than 350 mm table 2 fig 3a thus is1 simulated around 18 less crop yield for a giwd interval between 300 and 390 mm on the other hand the irrigation scheduling managed by aquacrop using the readily available water in the soil raw as time criterion showed that depleting soil water up to a 34 mm and requiring giwd between 330 and 490 mm the simulated crop yield was close to the maximum yield obtaining eta etm ratios of around 0 95 table 2 whereas with depletion thresholds higher than 34 mm or by fixing interval time between irrigation events at more than 11 days the aquacrop model simulated significant decreases in crop yield with global eta etm ratios lower than 0 85 table 2 the aquacrop results simulating high frequency irrigation strategies interval irrigation events between 1 and 5 days or with a depletion threshold between 12 and 27 mm is2 aq and is4 aq respectively obtained average irrigation depths from 3 mm to 12 mm per irrigation event table 2 these irrigation schedules are not useful according to the typical irrigation amount per event although they attained the largest eta etm ratios 0 97 table 2 finally is4 aq also simulated irrigation scheduling with low frequency of irrigation events from 3 to 10 events along crop growth cycle table 2 whose average irrigation depths per event were between 25 and 88 higher than the objective irrigation water depth 23 5 mm and consequently eta etm ratios were lower than 0 88 table 2 regarding the two iss simulated by mopeco both showed that crop yield and eta etm ratio had a similar behaviour since the giwds and miwds simulated in each case were very close table 2 obtaining almost overlapping production function curves fig 3a comparing the number of irrigation events simulated by both models and under a similar eta etm ratio value the strategies performed by mopeco provided more frequent irrigation events than aquacrop in the case of the simulated eta and comparing data with similar eta etm ratios table 2 aquacrop computed around 14 above mopeco because of the different method of calculating evapotranspiration in general the calculated iwp values ranged between 0 184 kg m 3 and 5 435 kg m 3 table 2 the iwp simulated by aquacrop showed a higher variability than mopeco from 0 184 kg m 3 to 4 921 kg m 3 vs from 3 619 kg m 3 to 5 435 kg m 3 respectively table 2 fig 3 thus the iwp differences for the four iss simulated by aquacrop were significant with giwd lower than 200 mm up to 20 less while these differences were between 9 5 and 15 with giwd above 200 mm fig 3b excepting is1 whose calculated iwp tended to drop off significantly with respect to the rest of iss values lower than 3 0 kg m 3 fig 3b in contrast the iwp computed by mopeco had a similar behaviour under the same giwd differences lower than 1 0 fig 3b as was also shown with the simulated crop yield fig 3a overall the mopeco model computed higher iwp giwd relationships than those calculated by aquacrop being between 8 0 and 27 5 on average when water deficit was triggered the production and iwp function curves obtained with mopeco contained those generated with aquacrop fig 3 the main reason for this is the way to outline the different iss where the iss considered for aquacrop were sustained throughout the crop cycle whereas the iss simulated by mopeco established regulated irrigation management based on the water deficit sensibility of each crop growth stage similar differences between ordi and sustained deficit irrigation sdi strategies were computed by the mopeco model optimizing the deficit irrigation strategies for maize in the same area domínguez et al 2012a the models derived from the simulated iss with both aquacrop and mopeco showed that crop yield water production functions had a high goodness of fit with the second degree polynomial model r2 0 92 table a3 annex while iwp giwd relationships for all iss were faithfully fitted to a linear model table a3 annex the selected curvilinear model as well as their parameter values for each is were in most cases highly significant with standard errors of the model ranging between 0 17 103 and 0 85 103 kg ha 1 table a3 annex where the iss generated by aquacrop simulated a 67 larger standard error than mopeco in the case of linear models errors were around 0 01 kg m 3 for the iss simulated by mopeco and between 0 06 kg m 3 and 0 19 kg m 3 for those generated with aquacrop fig 3b finally the curvilinear model adjusted to is4 showed that the squared term had no significance being a linear relationship that would achieve highly significant model coefficients trout and dejonge 2017 in a field trial with maize during four cropping seasons derived consistent and highly significant fits of crop water production functions to a curvilinear model these authors relating crop yield vs evapotranspiration with the former model obtained similar results despite several studies having projected linear relationships in field crops doorenbos and kassam 1979 fereres and soriano 2007 saseendran et al 2015 steduto et al 2007 tanner and sinclair 1983 in this sense reasons such as evaporation losses decreasing as water deficit limits transpiration could partly explain those results trout and dejonge 2017 3 3 simulation by aquacrop of the data from the ordil experimental field tests validation of the results and comparison with mopeco outputs overall the aquacrop model performance simulating the irrigation scheduling derived from different ordil levels was appropriate during the three experimental seasons the progression of the main crop growth variables simulated by aquacrop canopy cover cc aboveground biomass agb as well as final crop yield y followed a tendency close to the measured data fig 4 table 5 the calculated evaluation indices between observed and simulated data showed that cc was underestimated with mbe values between 0 6 and 7 1 and whose variance of error values were around 11 0 for all treatments being the highest computed values for the three water deficit treatments table 5 most values of ef and d were close to 0 90 or higher excepting two treatments during the 2016 cropping season 80 and 70 table 5 where the observed cc during the senescence stage in these treatments had a higher variability than the rest of treatments fig 4d e nevertheless aquacrop had a good goodness of fit in this crop growth parameter this slight underestimation of the cc by aquacrop also resulted in the same trend at that of the measured agb data fig 4 reporting errors ranging from 0 76 103 to 2 17 103 kg ha 1 table 5 conversely to the cc evaluation indices agb bias for the simulations of 2016 treatments showed to be slightly lower than the rest of experimental years table 5 in this case the method to estimate the crop evaporative demand by the model could partially explain these results in spite of everything goodness of fit indicators were similar to those computed for cc in this research with respect to the simulated crop yield aquacrop simulated values close to those observed including the standard deviation values table 5 thus the percentage of deviation between both simulated and observed values for all treatments was within 10 table 5 obtaining errors between 0 26 103 and 0 46 103 kg ha 1 with high ef and d values table 5 the crop yield evaluation indices computed between the data simulated by mopeco vs the observed data showed similar results to those obtained with aquacrop with the rmse values being somewhat lower table 5 pardo et al 2020 extensively discussed testing the mopeco model with the ordil methodology concluding that ym is the most important variable to fit the potential crop yield to the actual yield according to phenological stage duration suitable parameterization of kc and ky and optimal volume water distribution along the crop cycle depending on the actual weather conditions comparing the former results with those reported by lópez urrea et al 2020 who parameterized this model for barley under the same climate conditions it is worth noting that all evaluation parameters used to test both models were similar thus these findings confirm the suitability of barley parameterization in aquacrop and mopeco and in addition the different irrigation strategies developed by ordil methodology and tested in the field were faithfully replicated by the models in terms of evaporative demand simulated by both models the accumulated maximum and actual crop evapotranspiration etm and eta respectively simulated by aquacrop were respectively around 17 and 8 higher than those obtained by mopeco table 6 in this sense both the total actual crop transpiration ta and the total actual soil evaporation ea values simulated by aquacrop were not satisfied in any irrigation treatment without water deficit i e nd and 100 over 2500 during the three seasons table 6 however the eta etm ratio values calculated by mopeco for nd treatment were fully satisfied excepting the second experimental season with 0 96 table 6 in this sense lópez urrea et al 2020 reported differences in the eta and etm simulated by the models this research shows again that as water levels are reduced the differences in simulated eta and etm across crop models are larger mean values from 4 and 15 for nd to 11 and 20 for 70 respectively table 6 the main factors that might explain these differences are the single and dual kc approaches coded in mopeco and aquacrop models respectively the eta etm ratio simulated for nd treatment by mopeco was almost matched in the three seasons 1 0 table 6 while aquacrop failed to reach ratios higher than 0 85 because of the low simulated actual evaporation since actual transpiration was close to the maximum table 6 runoff the simulation of this variable by both models showed large differences being between 76 and 190 lower for aquacrop if the aquacrop model considered the same water outtake by runoff as mopeco the eta etm ratio simulated by both models would be reduced from 12 to 8 as the mean value for the three seasons table 7 updating kcb barley pereira et al 2021b updated the basal crop coefficient kcb of field crops such as grain legumes oil crops and small grain cereals in this case kcb for barley was determined as 1 00 changing this value in the crop transpiration coefficient kctr 1 10 table 1 and simulating once again all treatments the new mean differences in eta etm ratio between the two models were around 8 table 7 attaining 4 mean difference when the same runoff value was considered table 7 this change in kctr value did not generate a lower simulated yield for the different treatments obtaining mean differences of around 1 table 7 therefore this sensitivity analysis on modifying kctr for aquacrop would allow differences in eta etm ratios between the two crop models to be reduced without significant effects on simulating crop yield and being close to the actual yield data finally pohanková et al 2018 testing the performance of several crop models with spring barley simulated cumulative eta from sowing to maturity with aquacrop between 350 and 400 mm in three locations of czech republic although both climate conditions and the crop cycle lengths given in days are different to those in this research the eta simulated by these authors were similar to those shown in table 6 in addition they calculated the actual crop transpiration ta as 78 of eta on average being close to values found in the present paper around 75 for aquacrop 4 conclusions the aquacrop and mopeco models can be used to evaluate the effect of various irrigation schedules on crop yield and the water productivity response given that when both are well calibrated they show no differences the results obtained by the aquacrop model allowed us to compare its performance with a larger number of measured barley growth variables aboveground biomass canopy cover and crop yield than mopeco only crop yield to generate these results aquacrop requires a large number of parameters making its management somewhat more difficult than mopeco the range of simulations obtained by aquacrop is higher than mopeco since under semiarid conditions it is able to simulate rainfed crop growth thus when the accumulated eta etm ratio is lower than 0 5 in one or more crop growth stages mopeco s results may not be suitable although aquacrop software has different options for building an automatic schedule irrigation the optimized irrigation scheduling based on ordi and ordil methodologies provided by mopeco attained significant irrigation water productivity iwp thus considering the hypothesis of this research the iwp simulated by mopeco was between 8 0 and 28 0 higher than aquacrop with different irrigation water amounts applied to the crop therefore if mopeco is properly parameterized this methodology can be of great help in establishing irrigation scheduling in areas with limited water resources to improve the iwp conversely aquacrop users must be sufficiently qualified to plan an irrigation strategy whose iwp levels can be similar than those reached by mopeco especially under deficit irrigation conditions the effects of four irrigation strategies proposed by ordil methodology in both canopy cover and aboveground biomass evolution as well as the final yield of barley crop during three field seasons were appropriately simulated by aquacrop therefore the water deficit levels established by ordil for each crop barley development stage were in suitable ranges for simulating this crop with aquacrop finally we consider that a combination of both crop models may be especially interesting for analysis of the crop s physiological behaviour in response to an optimized deficit irrigation strategy coded by mopeco nevertheless soil evaporation and crop transpiration data should be used with caution given the differences in findings between the crop models

9888,to optimize the irrigation scheduling of field crops to maximize irrigation water productivity requires expert knowledge of the crop development and its productive response to water deficit implementing this idea with commodities such as barley whose current global profitability is low and more specifically in areas where the availability of water resources for irrigation is limited requires a proper decision support system in this research aquacrop and mopeco models were used to compute and compare both the crop water production and irrigation water productivity functions generated by several irrigation strategies provided by each model for the typical irrigated crop barley grown in the area furthermore we evaluated both models performance with a 3 year field experiment applying the methodology of optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water ordil in barley crop the results obtained from the production functions show that gross irrigation water depths giwd of more than 310 mm can be useful to attain the potential crop yield depending on the criteria considered to generate the irrigation scheduling however with less giwd available the simulated barley development was subjected to water deficit leading to a reduction in both crop yield and irrigation water productivity thus mopeco simulated higher crop yields and irrigation water productivity values than those obtained by aquacrop being between 16 and 27 for crop yields and between 8 0 and 27 5 for irrigation water productivity under similar giwd levels these differences are mainly due to how the irrigation strategies are outlined in the two models and the different evapotranspiration methodologies they deploy finally both models provided performed appropriately in simulating final crop yield errors lower than 0 50 103 kg ha 1 as well as canopy cover and aboveground biomass evolution in the case of aquacrop whose goodness of fit indicators were close to 0 90 or higher in terms of crop evapotranspiration aquacrop simulated a 12 higher average value than mopeco it can be concluded that both models are complementary and their use will depend on the necessities of the final user thus mopeco offers a wider range of irrigation strategies while aquacrop offers a more detailed information about the physiological response of the crop during its development being the results of the simulations accurate enough in both models keywords improved crop models parameterization crop water production function irrigation water productivity ordil water scarcity 1 introduction worldwide cereal crops occupy around 51 of the total growing area in spain the seventh largest cereal producer in europe with a production of 5 8 million mg in almost 2 6 million ha of cereal planted area faostat 2019 these commodities especially barley are a key alternative for field agricultural systems in semiarid regions such as the centre and south of spain where there is a clear tendency towards water resource scarcity cramer et al 2020 reductions in irrigation water abstraction in both guadiana and júcar rivers basins in castilla la mancha clm region spain are already a fact applying deficit irrigation techniques di either sustained sdi or regulated rdi fereres and soriano 2007 during crop growth would allow for irrigation strategies that are able to improve crop irrigated water use without causing significant yield losses this methodology would help mitigate climate change effects maximize the production per unit of water consumed developing more resilient agricultural systems and limiting desertification several papers on the barley crop response to water deficit have reported that the end of the vegetative period flowering and yield formation are the most sensitive stages affecting the final crop yield and harvest quality abrha et al 2012 acevedo et al 2002 cossani et al 2009 giunta et al 1993 ugarte et al 2007 barley crop water requirements in clm are around 400 500 mm according to cycle length which varies between 155 and 210 days pardo et al 2020 with the average irrigation water requirements being 250 mm jcrmo 2020 thus the yield of irrigated barley is between 4 and 5 times higher than under rainfed conditions itap 2020 however the current low profitability of this crop and the increasing tendency of the water authority to limit the volume of water for irrigation in the area chg 2020 chj 2020 are forcing growers and technicians to adopt optimal irrigation techniques to reduce the use of irrigation water with the aim of maximizing economic irrigation water productivity pardo et al 2020 several authors have developed algorithms for optimizing irrigation scheduling based on the crop development and its productive response to water deficit garcía et al 2020 kloss et al 2012 kuschel otárola et al 2018 schütze et al 2012 as well as on the real time readings obtained from weather stations and soil moisture sensors installed in the field domínguez niño et al 2020 one of these methodologies is called optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water ordil domínguez et al 2012a leite et al 2015 the main objective of which is to maximize yield at harvest when the amount of available water is lower than the typical irrigation requirements of the crop pardo et al 2020 this methodology is based on the total available volume of irrigation water at the beginning of the irrigation season the sensitivity of the crop to water deficit at its different development stages the evolution of climatic conditions the amount of water received by the crop at each phenological stage and the amount of irrigation water remaining for the following phenological stages until physiological maturity crop simulation models when calibrated and validated can be used as decision support systems for the management of crops farms or agricultural systems among other functions these models calculate the crop water requirements determine the irrigation scheduling and simulate crop yields according to the amount of irrigation water supplied during crop development de wit et al 2019 pereira et al 2003 stöckle et al 2014 mopeco ortega álvarez et al 2004 and aquacrop steduto et al 2009 were designed to be used by researchers and also by technicians and advanced farmers both models are based on fao methodology allen et al 1998 doorenbos and kassam 1979 and the number of parameters required for the simulation of annual crops is low compared with other models as reported by lópez urrea et al 2020 who parameterizated the two models for a barley crop using the data set of a three year experiment carried out in albacete province in the clm region mopeco offers several options and tools that may be useful for the management of actual irrigated farms such as ordil the effect of irrigation uniformity on final yield lópez mata et al 2010 or the optimal distribution of crops depending on the available amount of irrigation water and cultivable area lópez mata et al 2016 aquacrop is able to more precisely simulate the development of annual crops and their final biomass depending on the climatic conditions and availability of water in the soil during the growing cycle providing irrigation scheduling strategies such as full irrigation or allowing a certain soil water depletion level at which an irrigation event is applied therefore the main aim of this research was to assess how operational are both models generating irrigation water scheduling and the model responses with the ordil methodology for barley crop under the semiarid climatic conditions of clm to achieve this aim the following partial objectives were proposed 1 to improve the parametrization of both models for a barley crop developed by lópez urrea et al 2020 determining the average length of the different growing stages of this crop for the different irrigated areas of clm 2 to compute and compare the crop water production functions generated by the tools and strategies provided by each model for the typical conditions of clm 3 to evaluate the accuracy of mopeco and aquacrop models by comparing their results with those obtained in a three year experiment conducted in albacete where the ordil methodology was applied to a barley crop pardo et al 2020 2 material and methods 2 1 description of crop models approach simulation the aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 maintains the original concept proposed in fao 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 but in this case it estimates biomass production from actual crop transpiration through the normalized water productivity wp parameter steduto et al 2012 since the model separates soil evaporation from crop transpiration as is also done by fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2021a crop cycle length is determined by days after sowing das or calculated by using the growing degree days methodology gdd ºc finally crop yield is estimated from the biomass production and the harvest index several stress coefficients soil water air temperature soil fertility and soil salinity are used to adjust the daily green canopy cover crop transpiration above ground biomass and yield formation aquacrop model is now designed to be used with annual crops whose conservative crop parameters are provided in the aquacrop software for many species maize barley wheat cotton rice soybean potato sunflower tomato among others vanuytrecht et al 2014 aquacrop can be used to report the role of different soil climate systems in water limited crop production as well as the analysis of different scenarios such as climate change water supply crop type field management etc vanuytrecht et al 2014 in addition the aquacrop plug in program raes et al 2017 and aquacrop gis lorite et al 2013 together with aquacrop os the open source version foster et al 2017 allow the simulation time to be significantly reduced when both a larger number of simulations are carried out and interpretation and analysis of the results is complex vanuytrecht et al 2014 mopeco was conceived to optimize the gross margin of farms through the use of deficit irrigation strategies de juan et al 1996 it is based on fao 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 and fao 56 allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2020 2021b methodologies for the simulation of yield the model determines the ratio between actual and potential maximum crop evapotranspiration eta and etm respectively for each growing stage domínguez et al 2011 where soil evaporation and crop transpiration components are not separated similarly to aquacrop the crop development is simulated using both das and gdd yields for different amounts of irrigated water supplied to the crop are used to determine the yield vs irrigation depth function the simulation of the irrigation water allocation during the growing period is determined by the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology ordi maximizes yield for a certain water deficit target by determining the eta etm ratios to be applied at each growing stage domínguez et al 2012a under real management conditions where climatic conditions for the growing period are unknown and the amount of available irrigation water is limited mopeco uses the ordil methodology leite et al 2015 both methodologies have been applied to different crops maize domínguez et al 2012a onion domínguez et al 2012b garlic domínguez et al 2013 sánchez virosta et al 2020 carrot carvalho et al 2014 melon leite et al 2015 potato martínez romero et al 2019 and barley pardo et al 2020 2 1 1 aquacrop model irrigation water scheduling when the actual crop evapotranspiration eta is calculated the aquacrop model separates the soil water evaporative component from the crop transpiration steduto et al 2009 thus this model takes into account both the water inputs net irrigation rainfall and capillary rise and outputs runoff deep percolation and eta at the crop root zone in order to compute a daily soil water balance an accurate description of the soil water movement is made by dividing soil depth into several compartments with the thickness of each one being variable according to user specifications the aquacrop manual raes et al 2018 shows a detailed description and the algorithms used to calculate the soil water balance from that balance aquacrop model simulates the irrigation management in three alternative ways a by resolving the net irrigation water requirements of the crop keeping the soil water depletion at the root zone above a threshold which is delimited by the user generally 50 of the readily available water raw these requirements do not take into account the irrigation uniformity effect b by considering a previously designed irrigation schedule where each irrigation event is specified by the user thus date of irrigation event net irrigation depth and the quality of water electric conductivity ecw must be given for each irrigation event c by allowing aquacrop to automatically generate an irrigation schedule according to the criteria established by the user in the third alternative users define in aquacrop the way an irrigation event must be simulated thus two criteria are considered i when the irrigation event has to be triggered irrigation time criterion itc and ii how much water has to be applied through the irrigation system irrigation depth criterion idc being specified to either all the crop cycle or a certain period of time the itc can be established by the user who either fixes a constant number of interval days between irrigation events or selects a soil water depletion threshold either mm of water or of raw the idc also offers two options namely to refill the soil water content up to field capacity or to fix a constant net irrigation depth mm the former option allows over irrigation for avoiding the effect of a low uniformity of irrigation or under irrigation erratic rainfall distribution to be considered finally in this third method which also considers water quality users cannot generate an irrigation schedule coordinating two different options for each criterion along the crop cycle either the itc or idc graphically users may compose their own irrigation strategy according to the crop growth stage initial development mid season flowering and late season and the different soil water stress thresholds mainly leaf expansion growth stomatal closure and canopy senescence finally the model distinguishes between different wetted soil fractions depending on the irrigation system considered thus the percentage of the wetted soil surface fluctuates from 100 sprinkler border and basin irrigation to 0 subsurface drip irrigation with intermediate values for other irrigation systems 30 100 in furrow irrigation and 15 40 in trickle drip micro irrigation 2 1 2 mopeco model irrigation water scheduling mopeco calculates the daily soil water content in the root area following the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 balancing inputs net irrigation precipitation and deep water reached by roots and outputs runoff crop evapotranspiration and deep percolation domínguez et al 2011 in this sense mopeco computes the total available water taw in the root zone understanding taw as the difference in soil water content between field capacity and permanent wilting point and considers a depletion fraction p threshold which is the fraction of taw that a crop can extract without suffering water stress allen et al 1998 domínguez et al 2011 in addition the mopeco irrigation scheduling module requires as input data i the interval of maximum and minimum irrigation depth that can be supplied by the irrigation system per irrigation event mid and mid respectively ii minimum and maximum number of interval days to trigger an irrigation event iii maximum level of soil water content that can be refilled by an irrigation event taw with the aim of decreasing or avoiding percolation when there is unexpected rainfall after an irrigation event thus three situations can be distinguished a maintaining no water deficit along the crop cycle when the soil water content is always higher than p and the irrigation water depth per event is calculated in order to refill the soil water content in an intermediate point between field capacity and 1 p taw taw selected by the user b reaching a certain global water deficit level for the complete crop cycle global eta etm ratio defined by the user with mopeco aiming to determine the water deficit level to be caused to the crop at each phenological stage in order to maximize final yield and c distributing a certain volume of irrigation water during the crop cycle according to the water deficit level for each phenological stage that maximizes yield without exceeding the limited volume according to the progress of climatic conditions in situations b and c mopeco calculates the daily accumulated eta etm ratio from the beginning up to the end of each growth stage if the daily accumulated eta etm ratio at a certain date is higher than the eta etm target ratio for that stage mopeco does not apply any irrigation unless the maximum number of days without water supply irrigation or rainfall is reached or the daily eta etm ratio reaches a minimum value fixed by the user 0 35 is recommended to avoid excessive depletion of soil moisture domínguez et al 2011 the global eta etm ratio of each crop growth stage is established following the ordi and ordil methodologies domínguez et al 2012a leite et al 2015 pardo et al 2020 which produces the highest crop yield for a certain overall deficit target or for a limited irrigation water volume using non linear optimization software such as solver microsoft 2018 mopeco is sometimes unable to attain the target deficit rate proposed for each growth stage by the user or by the optimizer in these cases the irregular distribution of rainfall and or the high soil water content at the beginning of the simulation are the main causes of this mismatch between the objective and the final deficit rate 2 1 3 model parameterization lópez urrea et al 2020 described in detail the parameterization of both models table 1 for barley crop growth under different irrigation regimes using the data of a three year experiment from 2011 to 2013 conducted under the semiarid conditions of albacete province fig 2 2 2 description of the study area the study area is located in southeast spain in a semiarid area where around 70 of water resources used for irrigated crops are from groundwater domínguez and de juan 2008 the three main affected aquifers are eastern mancha western mancha and campo de montiel whose irrigated area is around 350 000 ha distributed over 29 000 km2 fig 1 irrigated barley crop is usually managed under a sprinkler irrigation system because the seasonal average rainfall is between 300 and 350 mm year 1 from september to june and with high reference evapotranspiration 1150 mm year 1 domínguez et al 2013 the typical soils in this area are characterized by shallow depths 0 40 0 55 m which are limited by a somewhat fragmented limestone sedimentary rock they have a slightly basic ph 7 5 8 5 low organic matter content 1 2 1 6 and their general texture is classified as loam or sandy clay loam soils domínguez and de juan 2008 2 3 crop cycle length influenced by climatic variability to determine the average length of the barley crop cycle as well as its development stages in the study area 28 crop phenological monitoring studies carried out by the irrigation advisory service ias of clm siar clm 2014 were used this monitoring work included the four main irrigable areas fig 1 over 11 cropping seasons where short cycle varieties of barley sowed at commercial field which mean area ranging between 5 and 75 ha were mainly studied since they are mostly grown under irrigated conditions sowing date by mid january and harvest date at the end of june the bbch scale bleiholder et al 2001 was used to determine the phenological growth stages of barley related to the input parameters required by both models canopy development mid season and late season for aquacrop kc and ky coefficients for mopeco table a1 annex the thermal time duration of the barley growth stages in terms of accumulated gdd was obtained for both models aquacrop establishes three different methods to calculate gdd mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 with the first method raes et al 2018 being used for simulations while mopeco uses the double triangulation method sevacherian et al 1977 which is suitable in the area the mean accumulated gdd value for each growth stage of barley was calculated taking into account the base temperature tb and the upper temperature tu thresholds combining a set of values reported from several studies from 0 ºc to 10 ºc and from 20 ºc to 38 ºc for tb and tu respectively lópez bellido 1991 juskiw et al 2001 araya et al 2010 abrha et al 2012 and those shown in table 1 the selected final threshold values were derived from the lowest standard deviation and coefficient of variation gdd data for all monitoring barley growth stages 2 4 typical meteorological year a typical meteorological year tmy represents the conditions considered typical over a long period of time and consists of 12 months selected from individual years and concatenated to form a complete year with daily values pardo et al 2020 in this study an intermediate tmy tmyintermediate determined by leite et al 2015 with a weather station located in the experimental area albacete southeast spain fig 2 was used the main values computed for tmyintermediate were 1212 mm year 1 and 289 mm year 1 for reference evapotranspiration eto computed using the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and precipitation respectively 2 5 simulating the crop barley yield response to irrigation management using the gdd methodology already described and applied for a tmyintermediate in the study area leite et al 2015 the crop barley yield and irrigation water productivity iwp expressed as kg of commercial crop yield per m 3 of irrigation water supplied to the crop response to irrigation scheduling were simulated with aquacrop and mopeco the derived crop water and iwp water production functions were compared to evaluate the performance of both irrigation scheduling tools four irrigation strategies is were designed to be implemented in the aquacrop model is1 aq is2 aq is3 aq and is4 aq fig 2 the four strategies were considered as sustained irrigation through the simulated crop cycle in two of the is strategies is1 aq and is2 aq a time criterion was fixed with an interval time between 1 and 27 days where odd days were used obtaining 14 simulations for each is fig 2 table 2 the depth criteria of these is was different is1 aq applied at each irrigation event 23 5 mm of gross water depth while is2 aq refilled the soil water content up to field capacity minus 10 mm as a margin for unexpected rainfall events the other two is strategies is3 aq and is4 aq considered the irrigation event was triggered when a certain soil water content was depleted represented as mm being 12 simulations per each is fig 2 table 2 and following the same irrigation depth criteria previously described i e to apply 23 5 mm per irrigation event is3 aq and to refill up to field capacity minus 10 mm is4 aq the gross irrigation depth of 23 5 mm was established since it is the most widely used according to the representative farm area and the daily irrigation time normally used in addition barley crop yield was also simulated under rainfed conditions in order to find the ordinate of the crop water production function finally the regulated deficit irrigation scheduling taking into account crop growth stages was not analysed because of the huge number of combinations which may be derived surpassing in this case the goals for managing this model by an intermediate user in the case of mopeco two irrigation strategies were performed is1 ordi and is2 ordil fig 2 the first strategy established an optimized regulated deficit irrigation with ten global eta etm ratio objectives between 1 00 y 0 55 fig 2 table 2 to simulate the ordil irrigation strategies is2 ordil ten gross irrigation water amounts were fixed as the input data model which derived in different global eta etm ratios table 2 in the former is the maximum simulated irrigation water amount had a global eta etm ratio equal to 1 00 i e the same total irrigation depth simulated in is1 ordi 312 mm and the rest of simulations were run for irrigation depths differentiated at intervals of 20 mm table 2 a total of 15 and 2 days were established as maximum and minimum intervals between irrigation events when no rainfall occurs the gross irrigation water depth per event was set between 4 and 30 mm fig 2 for the simulations the sowing date was january 13th the maximum root depth was 1 0 m although its development was limited by the root restrictive layer 0 40 m the physical and hydraulic soil characteristics were those measured by pardo et al 2020 which are representative of this production area both models were run in gdd mode using the average gdd for each growth stage from the gdd methodology previously described and using the parameterized coefficients shown in table 1 in this work a value equal to 85 of irrigation efficiency was established corresponding to a sprinkler irrigation system the initial soil water content was established at 80 of field capacity in the case of aquacrop the simulated dry matter yield outputs were normalized to standard commercial yields 12 of moisture content since yield outputs computed by mopeco are given as commercial yield 2 6 experimental dataset using the ordil methodology evaluating the performance of the aquacrop and mopeco models as well as their inter comparison we used several irrigation schedules generated by ordil methodology with a limited total irrigation depth pardo et al 2020 pardo et al 2020 conducted the field trials in 2015 2016 and 2017 on an experimental farm located in albacete se spain its geographic coordinates are 1 53 58 w 38 56 42 n and the altitude is 695 m above mean sea level five treatments of ordil irrigation strategies were carried out to analyse their effects on both iwp and crop yield in the shakira barley cultivar a control treatment no water deficit nd received the full crop water requirements following lópez urrea et al 2020 while the other four irrigation treatments received a percentage of the net typical irrigation water requirements t100 100 t90 90 t80 80 and t70 70 which were adjusted to 2500 m3 ha 1 pardo et al 2020 all irrigation schedules were obtained from pardo et al 2020 those authors carried out four optimizations during the crop cycle length one per each ky stage table 1 in order to maximize crop yield according to the water deficit in terms of eta etm applied to each barley ky stage the soil of the experimental plot classified as clay loam was a shallow soil 0 40 m of average soil depth whose available water content was 0 124 cm3 cm 3 0 313 cm3 cm 3 for field capacity and 0 189 cm3 cm 3 for permanent wilting point during the three experimental cropping seasons eto was between 12 5 and 25 0 higher than the tmyintermediate 400 mm while the total precipitation was lower for 2015 and 2016 experimental seasons around 20 and slightly higher for 2017 season 5 with respect to the tmyintermediate 165 mm pardo et al 2020 real time eta etm optimizations for each ky crop stage were fitted to the weather conditions occurring during the current year the total water received by crop rainfall and irrigation and crop yield obtained for each treatment and experimental seasons are shown in table 3 pardo et al 2020 in addition for each irrigation treatment during the three experimental seasons both the total crop biomass and the leaf area index lai evolutions were measured approximately every 15 days in two subplots of each treatment two samples of 0 5 0 5 m were collected and measured per treatment by using an electronic meter device li cor 3100 c licor inc lincoln ne to determine lai and were introduced into an oven at 70 c up to constant weight for crop biomass crop canopy cover cc was estimated from the measured lai using the ritchie equation ritchie et al 1985 where the extinction coefficient was established as 0 60 1 cc 1 exp k lai where cc is canopy cover k is extinction coefficient lai is leaf area index 2 7 statistical analysis to evaluate the irrigation schedule tools and model performance several evaluation indices were performed to estimate the goodness of fit for both simulated crop water and the iwp water production function of each is cwpf and iwppf respectively with the gross irrigation water depth giwd being the dependent variable in both functions curvilinear and lineal models were used to fit these functions saseendran et al 2015 stewart and hagan 1973 since a portion of the applied water is not used in evapotranspiration and is lost in different process fereres and soriano 2007 thus the coefficient of determination r2 the significance of both model parameters and r2 p value as well as the standard error se of estimate of the regression model were analysed statgraphics centurion xvii software was used to calculate these statistics 2 z a b giwd c giwd 2 3 z a b giwd where z is the commercial crop yield y kg ha 1 or irrigation water productivity iwp kg m 3 a b c are the model s coefficients giwd is the gross irrigation water depth mm with respect to the performance of both models in simulating three experimental trials under ordi methodology the evaluation indices used to determine the goodness of fit of the simulations were root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe efficiency model ef and index of agreement d willmott 1982 4 rmse n 1 s i o i 2 1 2 where rmse is the root mean square error n is the number of observations si and oi are the simulated and observed values respectively 5 mbe n 1 i 1 n s i o i where mbe is the mean bias error 6 ef 1 s i o i 2 o i o 2 where ef is the efficiency model 7 d 1 s i o i 2 s i o o i o 2 where d is the index of agreement rmse was used to analyse the variance of the error which ranges from 0 to positive infinity with the former indicating good and the latter poor model performance the mbe expresses the average size of the estimated errors and was used to indicate the under or overestimations of the model finally the ef and d statistics non dimensional were used as the indicator of model quality where values close to 1 mean there is a good agreement ef ranges between to 1 while d index ranges between 0 and 1 these statistics were computed using the number of independent observations for each treatment for canopy cover and biomass progression only with aquacrop however those statistics were calculated for standard commercial yield 12 of water content with the data set obtained from the five treatments during the three experimental seasons both aquacrop as mopeco finally the differences between observed and simulated yield values were computed to estimate the performance model following the criteria established by a number of authors differences between simulated and observed data lower than 10 and with more than 70 of cases achieving the former percentage domínguez et al 2012c farahani et al 2009 heng et al 2009 lópez urrea et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 duration of barley growing stages in castilla la mancha analysing the barley growth stages with all monitoring field data the lowest values of standard deviation and coefficient of variation were obtained with a temperature combination of 2 ºc and 28 ºc as tb and tu thresholds respectively these temperatures are similar to those proposed by lópez bellido 1991 and araya et al 2010 and the same as those of abrha et al 2012 and lópez urrea et al 2020 these results strengthen the values stipulated by the authors previously cited whose studies were carried out under similar climatic conditions the mean length of barley crop stages for clm conditions are shown in table 4 the methodologies used by both crop models computing the required thermal time for reaching each development stages showed similar values when the barley crop attained the same phenological stage i e bbch scales 39 71 and 89 obtaining differences lower than 4 0 in this sense the accumulated gdd progression at the different crop growth stages either those used by mopeco or by aquacrop was similar in all monitored cropping seasons table a2 annex with the gdd variability decreasing represented as coefficient of variation table 4 with time as has also been observed by other authors using gdd lancaster et al 1996 marinaccio et al 2015 pereira et al 2015 piccinni et al 2009 ruiz corral et al 2002 analysing variability in days after sowing there were differences in duration of between 2 and 11 days for the stages established by both crop models these numbers of days represent as a maximum around 7 with respect to the total crop growth length 150 days thus these variation results can be considered as acceptable following the same criteria given by domínguez et al 2012c in a maize crop cultivated in the same production area finally the average thermal time values calculated for the three main phenological stages used by the aquacrop model table 4 were very similar to those calibrated by lópez urrea et al 2020 these authors parameterized the conservative parameters time to maximum canopy cover and length of the harvest index accumulation as 619 gdd and 675 gdd respectively taking into account that the crop canopy development stage cndv is the same as the first previous parameter described cndv was 13 4 higher this difference for the crop stage may be acceptable since the highest variations are usually found in the first crop growth stage table 4 conversely the second conservative parameter is represented as the gdd remainder between late season lssn table 4 and cndv obtaining 680 gdd which is very close to the stage parameterized by lópez urrea et al 2020 therefore the average thermal time reported in table 4 will be used to simulate the crop cycle length under the conditions of tmyintermediate 3 2 crop vs irrigation water production function obtained by the different irrigation tools provided by the models the four irrigation strategies simulated by aquacrop with a tmyintermediate reached a maximum yield of 11 70 103 kg ha 1 is1 aq is2 aq is3 aq and is4 aq table 2 fig 3a in the same way and as expected similar maximum yields were simulated by mopeco for the two irrigation strategies simulated ordi and ordil table 2 fig 3a although the mopeco model was calibrated for a ym 9 00 103 kg ha 1 table 1 according to the results obtained in the experiments carried out by lópez urrea et al 2020 the ym is not a constant value and depends on many factors such as climatic conditions soil characteristics and crop management sadras et al 2015 consequently this value must be adapted for the conditions of the farm and the year where the simulations were or will be carried out in this sense and in order to achieve a proper comparison between both models the maximum yield obtained by aquacrop was considered as ym for mopeco the barley yield simulated by using aquacrop under rainfed conditions in a tmyintermediate was 2 80 103 kg ha 1 table 2 this value as well as the maximum simulated yield can be considered appropriate according to the crop statistics and field trials carried out in this area itap 2020 mapa 2020 with respect to mopeco the rainfed condition was not simulated since simulated yields are unreliable when the computed eta etm ratio for one or more development stages is lower than 0 5 as happens under rainfed conditions domínguez et al 2012a doorenbos and kassam 1979 overall all iss simulated by both models showed that the maximum yield was reached when gross irrigation water depth giwd was between 300 and 390 mm table 2 fig 3a in the case of aquacrop and excepting is1 all iss simulated yields were close to 11 70 103 kg ha 1 when giwd was higher than 350 mm table 2 while slightly lower giwd values ranging between 300 and 330 mm decreased by yield around 12 in contrast the two iss simulated by mopeco ordi and ordil obtained the maximum yield supplying 312 mm of giwd table 2 simulating giwd lower than 300 mm both crop models showed that barley crop was subjected to water deficit eta etm ratio lower than 1 table 2 nonetheless all iss simulated by mopeco attained crop yields between 16 and 27 higher than those obtained by aquacrop considering similar giwd applications fig 3a analysing the is simulated by aquacrop is1 applying irrigation depths fixed at 23 5 mm per event with an interval time between irrigation events of 1 7 days showed that is not feasible at either economic or environmental level in this simulated interval time deep percolation was highly significant between 88 and 2800 mm table 2 causing crop yield not to increase significantly with a giwd of more than 350 mm table 2 fig 3a thus is1 simulated around 18 less crop yield for a giwd interval between 300 and 390 mm on the other hand the irrigation scheduling managed by aquacrop using the readily available water in the soil raw as time criterion showed that depleting soil water up to a 34 mm and requiring giwd between 330 and 490 mm the simulated crop yield was close to the maximum yield obtaining eta etm ratios of around 0 95 table 2 whereas with depletion thresholds higher than 34 mm or by fixing interval time between irrigation events at more than 11 days the aquacrop model simulated significant decreases in crop yield with global eta etm ratios lower than 0 85 table 2 the aquacrop results simulating high frequency irrigation strategies interval irrigation events between 1 and 5 days or with a depletion threshold between 12 and 27 mm is2 aq and is4 aq respectively obtained average irrigation depths from 3 mm to 12 mm per irrigation event table 2 these irrigation schedules are not useful according to the typical irrigation amount per event although they attained the largest eta etm ratios 0 97 table 2 finally is4 aq also simulated irrigation scheduling with low frequency of irrigation events from 3 to 10 events along crop growth cycle table 2 whose average irrigation depths per event were between 25 and 88 higher than the objective irrigation water depth 23 5 mm and consequently eta etm ratios were lower than 0 88 table 2 regarding the two iss simulated by mopeco both showed that crop yield and eta etm ratio had a similar behaviour since the giwds and miwds simulated in each case were very close table 2 obtaining almost overlapping production function curves fig 3a comparing the number of irrigation events simulated by both models and under a similar eta etm ratio value the strategies performed by mopeco provided more frequent irrigation events than aquacrop in the case of the simulated eta and comparing data with similar eta etm ratios table 2 aquacrop computed around 14 above mopeco because of the different method of calculating evapotranspiration in general the calculated iwp values ranged between 0 184 kg m 3 and 5 435 kg m 3 table 2 the iwp simulated by aquacrop showed a higher variability than mopeco from 0 184 kg m 3 to 4 921 kg m 3 vs from 3 619 kg m 3 to 5 435 kg m 3 respectively table 2 fig 3 thus the iwp differences for the four iss simulated by aquacrop were significant with giwd lower than 200 mm up to 20 less while these differences were between 9 5 and 15 with giwd above 200 mm fig 3b excepting is1 whose calculated iwp tended to drop off significantly with respect to the rest of iss values lower than 3 0 kg m 3 fig 3b in contrast the iwp computed by mopeco had a similar behaviour under the same giwd differences lower than 1 0 fig 3b as was also shown with the simulated crop yield fig 3a overall the mopeco model computed higher iwp giwd relationships than those calculated by aquacrop being between 8 0 and 27 5 on average when water deficit was triggered the production and iwp function curves obtained with mopeco contained those generated with aquacrop fig 3 the main reason for this is the way to outline the different iss where the iss considered for aquacrop were sustained throughout the crop cycle whereas the iss simulated by mopeco established regulated irrigation management based on the water deficit sensibility of each crop growth stage similar differences between ordi and sustained deficit irrigation sdi strategies were computed by the mopeco model optimizing the deficit irrigation strategies for maize in the same area domínguez et al 2012a the models derived from the simulated iss with both aquacrop and mopeco showed that crop yield water production functions had a high goodness of fit with the second degree polynomial model r2 0 92 table a3 annex while iwp giwd relationships for all iss were faithfully fitted to a linear model table a3 annex the selected curvilinear model as well as their parameter values for each is were in most cases highly significant with standard errors of the model ranging between 0 17 103 and 0 85 103 kg ha 1 table a3 annex where the iss generated by aquacrop simulated a 67 larger standard error than mopeco in the case of linear models errors were around 0 01 kg m 3 for the iss simulated by mopeco and between 0 06 kg m 3 and 0 19 kg m 3 for those generated with aquacrop fig 3b finally the curvilinear model adjusted to is4 showed that the squared term had no significance being a linear relationship that would achieve highly significant model coefficients trout and dejonge 2017 in a field trial with maize during four cropping seasons derived consistent and highly significant fits of crop water production functions to a curvilinear model these authors relating crop yield vs evapotranspiration with the former model obtained similar results despite several studies having projected linear relationships in field crops doorenbos and kassam 1979 fereres and soriano 2007 saseendran et al 2015 steduto et al 2007 tanner and sinclair 1983 in this sense reasons such as evaporation losses decreasing as water deficit limits transpiration could partly explain those results trout and dejonge 2017 3 3 simulation by aquacrop of the data from the ordil experimental field tests validation of the results and comparison with mopeco outputs overall the aquacrop model performance simulating the irrigation scheduling derived from different ordil levels was appropriate during the three experimental seasons the progression of the main crop growth variables simulated by aquacrop canopy cover cc aboveground biomass agb as well as final crop yield y followed a tendency close to the measured data fig 4 table 5 the calculated evaluation indices between observed and simulated data showed that cc was underestimated with mbe values between 0 6 and 7 1 and whose variance of error values were around 11 0 for all treatments being the highest computed values for the three water deficit treatments table 5 most values of ef and d were close to 0 90 or higher excepting two treatments during the 2016 cropping season 80 and 70 table 5 where the observed cc during the senescence stage in these treatments had a higher variability than the rest of treatments fig 4d e nevertheless aquacrop had a good goodness of fit in this crop growth parameter this slight underestimation of the cc by aquacrop also resulted in the same trend at that of the measured agb data fig 4 reporting errors ranging from 0 76 103 to 2 17 103 kg ha 1 table 5 conversely to the cc evaluation indices agb bias for the simulations of 2016 treatments showed to be slightly lower than the rest of experimental years table 5 in this case the method to estimate the crop evaporative demand by the model could partially explain these results in spite of everything goodness of fit indicators were similar to those computed for cc in this research with respect to the simulated crop yield aquacrop simulated values close to those observed including the standard deviation values table 5 thus the percentage of deviation between both simulated and observed values for all treatments was within 10 table 5 obtaining errors between 0 26 103 and 0 46 103 kg ha 1 with high ef and d values table 5 the crop yield evaluation indices computed between the data simulated by mopeco vs the observed data showed similar results to those obtained with aquacrop with the rmse values being somewhat lower table 5 pardo et al 2020 extensively discussed testing the mopeco model with the ordil methodology concluding that ym is the most important variable to fit the potential crop yield to the actual yield according to phenological stage duration suitable parameterization of kc and ky and optimal volume water distribution along the crop cycle depending on the actual weather conditions comparing the former results with those reported by lópez urrea et al 2020 who parameterized this model for barley under the same climate conditions it is worth noting that all evaluation parameters used to test both models were similar thus these findings confirm the suitability of barley parameterization in aquacrop and mopeco and in addition the different irrigation strategies developed by ordil methodology and tested in the field were faithfully replicated by the models in terms of evaporative demand simulated by both models the accumulated maximum and actual crop evapotranspiration etm and eta respectively simulated by aquacrop were respectively around 17 and 8 higher than those obtained by mopeco table 6 in this sense both the total actual crop transpiration ta and the total actual soil evaporation ea values simulated by aquacrop were not satisfied in any irrigation treatment without water deficit i e nd and 100 over 2500 during the three seasons table 6 however the eta etm ratio values calculated by mopeco for nd treatment were fully satisfied excepting the second experimental season with 0 96 table 6 in this sense lópez urrea et al 2020 reported differences in the eta and etm simulated by the models this research shows again that as water levels are reduced the differences in simulated eta and etm across crop models are larger mean values from 4 and 15 for nd to 11 and 20 for 70 respectively table 6 the main factors that might explain these differences are the single and dual kc approaches coded in mopeco and aquacrop models respectively the eta etm ratio simulated for nd treatment by mopeco was almost matched in the three seasons 1 0 table 6 while aquacrop failed to reach ratios higher than 0 85 because of the low simulated actual evaporation since actual transpiration was close to the maximum table 6 runoff the simulation of this variable by both models showed large differences being between 76 and 190 lower for aquacrop if the aquacrop model considered the same water outtake by runoff as mopeco the eta etm ratio simulated by both models would be reduced from 12 to 8 as the mean value for the three seasons table 7 updating kcb barley pereira et al 2021b updated the basal crop coefficient kcb of field crops such as grain legumes oil crops and small grain cereals in this case kcb for barley was determined as 1 00 changing this value in the crop transpiration coefficient kctr 1 10 table 1 and simulating once again all treatments the new mean differences in eta etm ratio between the two models were around 8 table 7 attaining 4 mean difference when the same runoff value was considered table 7 this change in kctr value did not generate a lower simulated yield for the different treatments obtaining mean differences of around 1 table 7 therefore this sensitivity analysis on modifying kctr for aquacrop would allow differences in eta etm ratios between the two crop models to be reduced without significant effects on simulating crop yield and being close to the actual yield data finally pohanková et al 2018 testing the performance of several crop models with spring barley simulated cumulative eta from sowing to maturity with aquacrop between 350 and 400 mm in three locations of czech republic although both climate conditions and the crop cycle lengths given in days are different to those in this research the eta simulated by these authors were similar to those shown in table 6 in addition they calculated the actual crop transpiration ta as 78 of eta on average being close to values found in the present paper around 75 for aquacrop 4 conclusions the aquacrop and mopeco models can be used to evaluate the effect of various irrigation schedules on crop yield and the water productivity response given that when both are well calibrated they show no differences the results obtained by the aquacrop model allowed us to compare its performance with a larger number of measured barley growth variables aboveground biomass canopy cover and crop yield than mopeco only crop yield to generate these results aquacrop requires a large number of parameters making its management somewhat more difficult than mopeco the range of simulations obtained by aquacrop is higher than mopeco since under semiarid conditions it is able to simulate rainfed crop growth thus when the accumulated eta etm ratio is lower than 0 5 in one or more crop growth stages mopeco s results may not be suitable although aquacrop software has different options for building an automatic schedule irrigation the optimized irrigation scheduling based on ordi and ordil methodologies provided by mopeco attained significant irrigation water productivity iwp thus considering the hypothesis of this research the iwp simulated by mopeco was between 8 0 and 28 0 higher than aquacrop with different irrigation water amounts applied to the crop therefore if mopeco is properly parameterized this methodology can be of great help in establishing irrigation scheduling in areas with limited water resources to improve the iwp conversely aquacrop users must be sufficiently qualified to plan an irrigation strategy whose iwp levels can be similar than those reached by mopeco especially under deficit irrigation conditions the effects of four irrigation strategies proposed by ordil methodology in both canopy cover and aboveground biomass evolution as well as the final yield of barley crop during three field seasons were appropriately simulated by aquacrop therefore the water deficit levels established by ordil for each crop barley development stage were in suitable ranges for simulating this crop with aquacrop finally we consider that a combination of both crop models may be especially interesting for analysis of the crop s physiological behaviour in response to an optimized deficit irrigation strategy coded by mopeco nevertheless soil evaporation and crop transpiration data should be used with caution given the differences in findings between the crop models

9889,in this research the performance of satellite rainfall estimates sres for crop growth simulation was investigated rainfall products selected were chirps 2 0 cmorph 1 0 mswep 2 2 and rfe 2 0 in situ rainfall from 20 stations within the lake victoria basin in kenya served as reference rainfall products were evaluated for onset days rainfall depths dry spells and rainfall occurrence for four crop growth stages assessment was on a daily time step for the period 2012 2018 and on a point to pixel basis results showed that sres exhibit large variation in timing of rainfall arrival sres exhibited largest interannual and spatial spreads in representing dry spell length during the flowering stage with cmorph and chirps showing best and weakest results respectively bias of sres in representing dry spells was smaller during early growth stages detecting rainfall occurrence by the sres weakened as the growing season progressed mswep followed by rfe2 produced the best results in detecting rainfall events while falsely detected rainfall was frequent in chirps particularly in later growth stages sres generally performed better during a wet than a dry growing season sres indicated less bias in rainfall depths during the early stages of crop growth but deteriorated at later stages mswep and cmorph exhibited the least and highest interannual spread in relative bias respectively in associating biases to severe and extreme water stress based on crop water requirement satisfaction index effects were more prevailing in the ripening than flowering stages findings of this study suggest that sres can serve as input to crop growth modelling but validation of sres with rain gauge observed counterparts is essential keywords bias crop growth simulation crop growth

and plant genetics on crop development at plot or field scales thaler et al 2018 simulation approaches differ in complexity and input data requirements subject to intended use physically based crop

such approaches simulate crop growth e g biomass partitioning water use and development e g phenology across various cropping stages normally from seeding until physiological maturity despite

various variables influencing simulated crop growth characteristics soil moisture has been identified as one of the most important variables riha et al 1996 watson and challinor 2013 ban et al 2019 showed that soil moisture shortage is the most crucial crop growth limiting factor shortage of soil moisture causes reduction of growth and is commonly referred to as crop water stress effective rainfall the difference between rainwater and actual evapotranspiration aet that is retained in the rootzone for meeting crop water requirement wr ali and mubarak 2017 is the primary source of soil moisture under rainfed agriculture and thus the most critical meteorological input variable in crop growth analyses crop growth in relation to rainfall and water stress has been studied considering multiple rainfall characteristics as summarized in table 1 studies indicate that crop growth responses to rainfall vary for different crops subject to the crop growth stage and growth requirements for water most relevant rainfall characteristics that directly affect crop growth are rainfall onset to denote the start of the cropping season dry spell indicating periods without rainfall duration of rainy periods and rainfall intensity to indicate how much it rains and occurrence to indicate the frequency of rain events rainfall onset tadross et al 2007 and antecedent rainfall conditions affect soil moisture conditions and thus define the seeding time for rainfed agriculture yadav et al 2013 both rainfall arrival and antecedent soil moisture conditions are critical inter seasonal rainfall representations for crop emergence and establishment in crop growth simulations wrongly identified rainfall arrival by sres may result in incorrect timing of seeding in simulation applications and may cause uncertain simulated outputs misrepresenting dry spell length directly influences soil moisture storage from rainfall for all growth stages with propagation effects on crop simulation results under or over estimating rainfall depths could result in soil moisture shortages or cause waterlogging for crops respectively prolonged rainfall intervals and soil moisture shortages from pre flowering to grain filling can lead to late maturity or loss of grain production respectively in reality high rainfall can result in rotting or fungal infections affecting the ripening phase during the vegetative and flowering stages severe water stress affects leaf area development due to a decrease in the stomatal opening which limits co2 uptake leading to a reduced rate of photosynthesis osakabe et al 2014 crop growth simulations require rainfall characteristics to be well represented with accurate estimates so to make simulation results useful accuracy is the closeness of agreement between a measured and true value of the quantity being measured joint committee for guides in metrology 2012 however representing real world rainfall distributions and characteristics is challenging in crop growth simulations errors in rainfall representation propagate to simulated outputs mcmillan et al 2011 misrepresentation of rainfall characteristics cause uncertainty and possibly errors in simulated results through error propagation in this respect guo et al 2015 showed that errors in simulated soil moisture deficit can lead to decreased leaf water potential causing reduced leaf growth besides increasing dry matter allocation to the roots decreased root to shoot ratio and reduced biomass or retarded growth of non drought tolerant crops sah et al 2020 showed that soil moisture stress increases days to flowering days to maturity anthesis silk interval decreases total leaf number and loss of normal root architecture leading to reduced biomass errors in simulated soil saturation by excessive rainfall can lead to o2 restrictive conditions affecting plant growth development and survival parent et al 2008 comparing differences in growth and physiological performance of plants under soil waterlogging stress yang et al 2020 showed reduced photosynthesis during waterlogging that soon recovered on draining rainfall can be estimated using gauging networks herold et al 2016 tapiador et al 2012 but availability and quality of spatially temporal data often is a concern in countries where resources are limited to maintain an observation network a further constraint to the availability of rainfall data is that rain gauge networks often have a low gauge density with stations that are unevenly distributed in space with incomplete observation records by failure of automated recorders or observers behrangi et al 2011 to arrive at consistent and spatial temporal coherent time series rainfall from stations often is spatially and temporally interpolated the accuracy of spatially interpolated rainfall depends both on the gauge network density and the spatial coherence of the rainfall distribution beck et al 2017a spatial coherence describes the cross correlation between rainfall at different points in space and used to tell the uniformity of the rainfall distributions constraints on availability of rainfall data in crop growth simulations can be overcome by use of satellite rainfall estimates sres use of sres in crop growth simulations involves various methods including forcing replacing meteorological input variables derived from remote sensing data calibration adjusting model parameters and updating updating state variables e g soil moisture content vegetative biomass whenever remote sensing data is available ban et al 2019 in this study sres are evaluated as an alternative rainfall input data source in crop growth simulation a key advantage of using sres is the availability of consistent and spatially temporally coherent rainfall data series with large spatial coverages from continental to global and high temporal resolutions from monthly to 30 min xianghu et al 2014 whereas gauge networks provide point based rainfall data at locations where gauges are installed with the current advancement of satellite remote sensing instruments various gridded rainfall products have been developed with different design objectives input data sources spatial and temporal resolutions spatial coverage temporal spans and latencies beck et al 2017b four such products are selected for this study and include the climate prediction center morphing algorithm cmorph joyce et al 2004 the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations data chirps funk et al 2015 the african rainfall estimation algorithm rfe xie and arkin 1996 and the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017a products the concept behind these state of the art sres is information blending from passive microwave sensors with that from more frequent but indirect visible infrared sensors microwave sensors are commonly mounted on orbiting satellites while visible infrared sensors are commonly mounted on geostationary or low earth orbiting satellites thus blending takes advantage of their complementary strengths behrangi et al 2011 joyce et al 2004 sun et al 2018 tapiador et al 2012 some sres further consider active microwave and ground based information for calibration funk et al 2015 huffman et al 2007 xie et al 2017 sres exhibit significant uncertainty because of random and systematic errors the latter described as bias smith et al 2006 as argued in pan et al 2010 random errors tend to cancel out when estimates from the sres are considered at large temporal windows jobard et al 2011 unlike the sres bias smith et al 2006 bias in these products originates from sensor calibration uncertainties too low spatio temporal sampling frequencies resampling or retrieval errors amongst others aghakouchak et al 2012 maggioni et al 2013 and manifests in inaccurate estimates of rainfall depths occurrence and intensities gumindoga et al 2019 habib et al 2012 yang and luo 2014 so rainfall representations differ for each sre product with different error distributions as affected by land surface conditions latitude season and type of rainfall event hobouchian et al 2017 when sres serve as an input to a crop growth simulation errors propagate to cause uncertainty in simulated outcomes luetkemeier et al 2018 ramarohetra et al 2013 in the context of this study uncertainty refers to aspects of error in simulated crop growth outputs due to sre error propagation effects motivated by constraints of rainfall gauging networks and the potential of sres to be used in crop growth simulation there is a need to evaluate bias in sres their characteristics under various conditions and the effects of bias propagation in simulating crop growth e g luetkemeier et al 2018 ovando et al 2018 ramarohetra et al 2013 reynolds et al 2000 studies in hydrological applications have explored how bias is affected by topography dos reis et al 2017 gao and liu 2013 by different seasons and arid environments tan et al 2017 yang and luo 2014 in reproducing rainfall amount intensity and occurrence dinku et al 2011 whereas sres are considered for simulation applications consensus has been reached that sres require bias correction and or merging of sre products to improve rainfall representation and their reliability bhattacharya and solomatine 2015 haile et al 2012 a first step is thus to assess bias in each sre their representation of soil water conditions for crop development and to confirm their usability in crop growth simulation especially in rainfed agriculture studies by beck et al 2017b and behrangi et al 2011 on the use of sres in rainfall runoff modelling show that bias varies spatially and temporally for this study the specific objectives are to i evaluate the timing of sre rainfall arrival at the onset of the crop growth season ii assess errors of the sres in representing multi day rainfall depths iii assess the representation of prolonged periods of dry days iv evaluate rainfall detection occurrence errors for respective crop growth stages and v to relate errors in rainfall representation to crop growth water requirements this study explores if sres are fit for use in crop growth simulation by providing an evaluation of sre bias and bias error propagation into the water requirement satisfaction index with a focus on subsequent crop growth stages in this study

chisanga et al 2015 water requirements at respective growth stages are shown in supplementary materials section maize growth stages are the vegetative silking flowering and reproductive stages grain filling sah et al 2020 that are adopted in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in the lake victoria basin of kenya fig 1 that covers 43 368 km2 between 2 05 00 s to 1

africa acre africa all stations are automated weather stations aws the data series have daily observations and are for the period between january 2012 and december 2018 except for two stations toro farm and wiobiero where records started in april 2012 an inventory of the stations is provided in table 2 some stations are affected by data gaps but the available time series are of sufficiently long duration to serve the objectives of this study consistency and completeness checks of gauged rainfall time series were performed the missing rainfall records were not gap filled to avoid introducing possible errors in the gauged data series that serve as reference for the sres we note that none of these rain gauge stations have been used in tuning the algorithms for sre products selected for this

interest and mosaic the ½ h cmorph images to hourly equivalents finally it aggregates the hourly cmorph and 3 h mswep to daily totals nearest neighbour resampling cover and hart 1967 at a spatial grid size of 0 07 was used to arrive at directly comparable sre s rainfall estimates for reasons of brevity detailed assessment on the pixel size and resampling method are not shown 2 5 evaluation of sres in representing key rainfall characteristics for crop growth stage simulation we used the point to pixel approach to compare point rainfall estimates of rain gauge observations i e gauge funnel scale and the four sres at pixel scale for the period 2012 2018 this methodology has been widely used in assessing sres e g bhatti et al 2016 cavalcante et al 2020 mekonnen et al 2021 worqlul et al 2014 and assumes that sres at pixel scale are representative counterparts of rain gauge station observations days with missing rainfall estimates at the rain gauge stations were considered as missing in the sre time series for comparison the evaluation of the performances of the sres in representing key rainfall characteristics was tailored to three crop growth stages vegetative reproductive and ripening the early days of the vegetative stage was further assessed as initial adapting to the fao classification savva and frenken 2002 growth stage transitioning dates were kept unique for subsequent seasons and stations the start of a long rainfall period indicated by the gauge was adopted as the start of the wet season and of the maize growing season rainfall occurrence detection errors of sres were assessed using categorical error metrics measuring frequency of in correct predictions of a model and shifts in rainfall arrival dates the estimation errors of the sres were determined using the relative bias and crop water requirement satisfaction index wrsi eq 1 indicating the potential crop water stress during the growing period the ranking of the sre products in detecting and estimating rain rates for crop growth stage simulation was based on a multicriteria analysis of the metrics as summarized in table 4 1 wrsi aet wr 100 2 5 1 assessment of rainfall onset day and dry spell rainfall onset day is determined as the first rainfall occurrence centered on march 1 with a minimum cumulative rainfall depth of 20 mm in 3 days with no dry spell larger than 10 days within the next 21 days in a growing season the condition on dry spell length was added to ensure successful seeding long rains in the study area run from march through late october e g fig 2 so march 1 is used as the earliest date of seeding and april 30 as the latest date when maize could be planted to ensure maturity before the end of the growing season a rainfall event was considered as a day with rainfall above 0 85 mm the 0 85 mm d 1 threshold is not only a practical way of implementing rainfall events above 1 mm d 1 suggested by the world meteorological organization but also harmonizes with the measurement accuracy of rainfall time series obtained from aws for this study onset day as represented by each of the sres denoted as s o in date is determined and thereafter time shifts from rain gauge observed counterparts g o as reference is calculated so a negative s o g o value indicates an early arrival by the sre otherwise a late arrival dry spell is taken as the number of days between two rainfall events and thus its length was used to indicate the longest number of consecutive days with a rainfall amount below 0 85 mm on each day within a growth stage signifying periods of inadequate rainfall to moisten the soil for crop growth 2 5 2 assessment of rainfall occurrence bias in detecting rainfall occurrence by the sres was assessed using three categorical error metrics the probability of detection pod eq 2 false alarm ratio far eq 3 and critical success index csi eq 4 detailed in wilks 2006 a binary skill score yes no was adopted to determine these categorical error metrics as per contingency table 5 the pod indicates correctly detected rainfall occurrence far gives the proportion of falsely detected rainfall occurrence and csi indicates the fraction of the number of correctly detected rainfall occurrence by sres they range between 0 and 1 2 pod h h m best 1 worst 0 3 far fa h fa best 0 worst 1 4 csi h h m fa best 1 worst 0 2 5 3 assessment of rainfall depths rainfall depth was considered as the aggregated rainfall depth for a specific growth stage the magnitude by which sres deviate from rain gauge observed counterparts was evaluated using relative bias eq 5 and wrsi relative bias was selected as a measure of the systematic difference between sre and rain gauge estimates relative to gauged estimates smith et al 2006 a negative bias indicates underestimation by the sre a positive bias indicates overestimation 5 relative bias i 1 n s i g i i 1 n g i 100 where s i and g i are satellite and gauge rainfall estimates in mm at day i respectively n is the total number of days the wrsi as a measure of crop performance based on soil water availability to the crop during a growing season senay and verdin 2002 was used to assess the effects of soil water stress on crop growth wrsi values were determined using a crop water balance model in instat 3 37 software developed by statistical services centre and originally available at www ssc rdg ac uk the instat statistical package was selected because of its modest input data requirement and being less sophisticated compared to a full crop growth model respective index values were estimated using daily rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet soil water holding capacity swhc and a crop coefficient kc as inputs the swhc values in table 6 that indicate the maximum amount of water that a given soil can hold to serve crop growth were obtained from the soil and terrain database for kenya kensoter version 2 0 provided by isric international soil reference and information centre 2004 the widely accepted fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 that employs location specific solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed was used to compute pet in r instat r instat org software day of year averages of pet were used in cases where these input records were missing a crop coefficient was derived for each of the four maize growth stages considering a maize crop maturity of 180 days values were estimated based on the kc approach developed by allen et al 1998 in this approach kc values for initial and ripening crop growth stages were linearly interpolated to generate intermediate kc values for vegetative and flowering crop growth stages the calculated values were then used to construct the kc curve fig 3 the maize wrsi for a growing season was calculated as a ratio of aet to wr in mm for a specific station expressed in eq 1 the wr was calculated by multiplying pet by estimated kc values following eq 6 6 wr pet kc aet representing the actual water depth that is lost from the soil water storage by evapotranspiration was estimated through the soil water balance method incorporated in instat during a simulation soil water content is obtained through a mass balance eq 7 where soil water is monitored in a volume defined by swhc a detailed description is in masupha and moeletsi 2020 7 sw i sw i 1 p i aet i where sw is soil water content p is rainfall and i is the daily time step the wrsi is calculated daily and the cumulative potential of growth stress by soil water shortage during the growing season is given at the end of the cropping season an index value of 100 indicates no growth stress as the wr is fully satisfied by rainfall but decreases when rainfall is too low to satisfy the crop growth water requirement that as such causes soil water stress to crop growth impact of rainfall deficit on maize crop growth was interpreted based on the wrsi classification in table 7 after masupha and moeletsi 2020 3 results because inter seasonal rainfall patterns differ and thus affect seasonal crop growth cumulative rainfall received from the 20 rain gauge stations over the crop growing seasons of 2012 2018 is compared in fig 4 the figure shows that the cropping season of 2012 received most rain compared to other seasons in particular during the critical crop growing days before the 200th day from the start of the growing season the increase in the 2012 curve appeared to decline after the 200th day closely matching that for 2013 and 2018 however the 2012 cropping season exhibited the highest rainfall and thus also highest mean daily rainfall further analysis of rainfall shows that 2015 and 2016 had the least accumulated rainfall and were considered as dry crop growing seasons for critical crop growth days the aggregated rainfall recorded over 2015 and 2016 was higher than for 2014 and 2017 with least rainfall for 2014 the mean daily rainfall in 2014 was lower than that of 2017 by 0 3 mm in this study 2012 and 2014 were the wettest and driest crop growing seasons respectively 3 1 rainfall onset day representation fig 5 shows the distribution of mismatch in marking the start of the wet season rains for each of the four sres selected for this study any mismatch is considered bias that is specific to each sre product whereas fig 5 shows mismatch for all cropping seasons 2012 2018 we refer to the attached supplementary materials section for assessments of each year most differences in fig 5a do not exceed 5 days i e 54 for each sre misrepresentation of the rainfall onset by sres was found to be skewed towards early arrivals with shifts ranging between 6 and 27 days dominating it can be seen on the extremes that an sre could miss a rainfall onset by indicating an early or late arrival up to a shift of more than 27 days fig 5b for the dry growing season 2014 shows that the onset timing differences were dominantly within 5 days with infrequent late arrivals indicated by cmorph and mswep for the wet growing season fig 5c the differences were fairly distributed within 27 days during a wet cropping season whereas no sre was most preferred in representing rainfall onset rfe2 showed the least onset error followed by chirps the latter consistently showed no rainfall arrivals later than the gauged counterparts except during wet cropping seasons e g 2016 and 2017 mswep and cmorph products mainly indicated delays in rainfall arrivals 3 2 bias in representing dry spell length except for initial and ripening stages the box whisker plot in fig 6 shows that all sres differ with gauged observations in representing dry spell lengths at least 50 of chirps estimates showed less than five days dry spell lengths that was also reported in gauged observations during the initial stage a similar pattern by cmorph during ripening results indicate larger interquartile ranges during the flowering stage the median and mean dry spell lengths recorded by chirps are consistently higher than gauged observations throughout the four growth stages in contrast however the median of the product is aligned with gauged observations for the initial growth stage medians from the other sres were consistently lower than gauged observations for all growth stages compared to other sres chirps exhibited larger variations in dry spell length that increased in magnitude towards later growth stages except for the ripening growth stage rfe2 consistently indicated the lowest mean and median dry spell lengths all the sres showed a misfit in representing dry spell length reported at the gauge possibly owing to the inability of sres to indicate the minimum dry spell lengths from the gauge except for mswep during the vegetative stage the sres exhibited a skewed spread towards long dry spell lengths that was also reported in gauge observations while all sres had outliers at each growth stage cmorph and mswep had a larger number during vegetative and ripening stages the sres misrepresented the lowest dry spell length except rfe2 during the initial stage all sres except rfe2 could fairly show agreement with gauged observations on capturing the long dry spells during the initial crop growth stage for the vegetative stage only cmorph results agreed with gauged observations however no alignment was seen at later crop growth stages e g flowering and ripening for all sres fig 7 shows a comparison of the bias of each sre in representing the dry spells for the four crop growth stages with respect to the rain gauge observed counterparts most underestimations and overestimations do not exceed three days i e 40 by each sre in each growth stage results show that the differences are less frequent during the early growth stages i e initial and vegetative but increase later this is consistent with the short dry spell lengths seen during the initial and vegetative growth stages in fig 6 chirps tend to overestimate dry spell lengths for each growth stage rfe2 and mswep show underestimations for all four growth stages while cmorph show underestimations during the vegetative and flowering stages no distinct response is seen during the initial and ripening stages based on these distributions and sre biases chirps and rfe2 are least preferred for representing dry spell lengths whereas cmorph show a better performance than the other sres and is closely challenged by mswep it is prone to outliers 3 3 performance of sres in detecting rainfall occurrence rainfall occurrence detection for different crop growth stages is shown in fig 8 further results are available in the supplementary materials section results of a comparison between dry and wet cropping seasons are shown in fig 9 results show a decrease in median values of pod from early to later growth stages for all sres with an increase only realized at later stages specifically mswep showed the best detection capability with median pod values of 0 9 and 0 8 for initial and flowering stages respectively compared to other sres this product had the highest correctly detected rainfall occurrence during the wet cropping season fig 9b as for the rainfall detection pattern exhibited by mswep pod median values for rfe2 were consistently higher than those of chirps and cmorph the detection capability of the sres significantly dropped during dry cropping seasons the median pod value of rfe2 was 0 95 in the wet cropping season 2017 compared to 0 85 in the dry cropping season 2014 however rfe2 still outperformed the other sres in detecting rainfall during the dry cropping season for all except the flowering stage irrespective of seasonal variations chirps showed weak results in detecting rainfall events during the dry cropping season rainfall detection of the products showed a median pod above 0 25 for the flowering stage larger variations of pod values were seen in chirps compared to other sres comparison based on the fraction of correctly detected rainfall events shows that mswep and chirps reported the best and worst median csi values respectively as for the pod pattern the csi values deteriorated as the number of rainy days increased in terms of falsely detected rainfall chirps generally exhibited the best results this contradicts the other results on pod and csi the median far values of this product were 0 2 and 0 35 for early and late crop growth stages respectively mswep produced the weakest detection skill compared to the other sres with median far values ranging between 0 25 and 0 45 we found a large spread in far values during the late growth stages particularly in chirps compared to other sres results suggest that chirps recorded the largest spread in far fig 9a that conflicts with its best performance in all but the flowering stage except for later crop growth stages all the sres had a better performance during a wet than a dry cropping season in general detecting rainfall events by the sres deteriorated as the cropping season progressed this suggests good performance by sres to validate their usability in crop growth simulations because early growth stages are the most critical for crop growth analysis 3 4 bias in rainfall depth fig 10a compares the systematic differences in rainfall depths indicated by the sres with respect to gauged counterparts 2012 2018 for different crop growth stages further results are in the supplementary materials section sres underestimated rainfall depths during the initial growth stage based on median value of relative bias a similar result is shown for the wet 2012 and dry 2014 cropping season fig 10 b and c respectively when products are evaluated for the least bias during the initial growth stage chirps and rfe2 are preferred despite some underestimations only chirps shows underestimation during flowering and ripening stages an assessment of the individual sres over the cropping season shows that the underestimation by sres tends to reduce in the vegetative stage but becomes large in the flowering stage the vegetative growth stage unlike other stages experienced overestimates as shown by the sres except for mswep consistent underestimation of rainfall depths in mswep is noticed throughout three growth stages for the ripening stage the product occasionally overestimates gauged counterparts in both dry and wet cropping seasons mswep showed the least interannual spread despite its consistent underestimation while cmorph and chirps indicated the largest spread of relative bias during the early and late growth stages respectively except for the 2017 cropping season we found the least difference in rainfall depth between gauges and sres during the initial and vegetative crop stages this difference increases during the flowering and ripening stages a similar performance pattern is noticed during dry and wet cropping seasons for all but the vegetative growth stage where underestimation by the sres is common during a wet cropping season and the opposite is valid for a dry cropping season further analysis on soil moisture availability for crop growth at different growth stages was carried out using wrsi table 8 shows the frequencies of different water stress levels see definitions of episodes in table 7 based on the wrsi for each growth stage represented by each sre for all sres simulated crop water requirement was met for the initial growth stage for the earliest stages of crop growth any bias in estimated rainfall did not result in shortage of soil water it appeared that the net effect of bias in rainfall onset rainfall occurrence and rainfall depth did not cause a bias propagation effect resulting in soil water stress conditions over respective crop growing windows this is despite crops sensitivity to soil water at shallow depths for a shallow rooting depth index values decrease for vegetative flowering and ripening stages with cmorph recording the smallest value of 76 8 compared to the gauged counterpart at 75 9 as illustrated in the table cmorph overestimated the frequency of mild water stress episodes compared to the rain gauge while the other sres showed underestimations i e chirps and mswep missing to capture the episodes in the vegetative stage results show that the bias of sres in representing severe and extreme water stress episodes was more frequent in the ripening than flowering stages cmorph followed by rfe2 overestimated the frequency of extreme water stress episodes compared to gauged counterparts for the flowering stage in contrast chirps followed by mswep showed underestimations total crop failure indicated by crop growth simulations applying the sres would probably be expected at this stage except for chirps all sres overestimated the frequency of severe water stress episodes mswep followed by cmorph overestimated the frequency of extreme water stress episodes by 7 9 and 1 8 per cent respectively during the ripening stage chirps and rfe2 showed underestimations of 3 6 and 0 8 per cent respectively for this growth stage 4 discussion this study assessed sres in representing rainfall characteristics meant for crop growth simulation at different crop growth stages this study found that most differences in marking the start of the wet season rains by sres with respect to gauged counterparts do not exceed five days the representation of the onset day by the sres suggests applicability of sres as input in crop growth simulation whereas some skewness in misrepresentation of onset days by sres is shown towards early arrivals a possible explanation might be the false rains that are indicated by sres additionally the late arrivals can be associated with sres failing to detect rainfall occurrence reported at the rain gauges the missed and falsely detected rainfall also may cause the difference noticed in the representation of the onset days by sres during dry and wet growing seasons the wide variation in timing of rainfall arrival by the sres and the inability to identify a preferred sre product based on onset day representation implies that sres must be validated with gauged observations incorrect timing of seeding data in crop growth simulation due to incorrect rainfall arrival as indicated by an sre can lead to error propagation that affects simulation results in cases of dry direct seeding followed by delayed rainfall arrival by sres input in the crop growth simulations a reseeding would be required because seeds may fail to emerge due to soil moisture deficit intolerance even if the seeds emerge utilizing antecedent soil moisture they may quickly die leading to total crop failure in the simulation process sres indicating early arrival of rains can be beneficial but the seedling depends on subsequent rainfall patterns both in distribution and amounts this study compared the distribution and sre s bias on detecting dry spell lengths fig 6 and fig 7 larger interquartile ranges during the flowering stage were found suggesting that the dry spell length has more interannual variability during this stage another finding is that chirps showed large spreads that increased towards later growth stages i e flowering in representing dry spell length besides consistently overestimating the means and medians compared to gauged counterparts following guo et al 2015 and yadav et al 2013 maize crop is sensitive to moisture stress at the flowering stage so forcing a crop growth model with chirps rainfall could lead to simulated results indicating increased days to flowering reduced growth and biomass due to reduced soil moisture from long dry spells this aspect of sre performance makes the chirps product less preferred to other sres based on dry spell representation the infrequent bias in representing the dry spell lengths during initial and vegetative stages that increased in later stages is possibly caused by more frequent rainfall events at the start of cropping seasons dry spell appeared to be more frequent during later stages of crop growth than early stages this is partly in line with fall et al 2021 who showed dry spell occurrence is more frequent at the start and end of rainy seasons in senegal it should be noted that dry spell assessment was limited to sre s bias however further insights on the characteristics and extent to which they influence soil moisture for crop growth can be derived by using different dry spell indices e g based on accumulated rainfall during a specified period or intensities mswep followed by rfe2 exhibited the best results in detecting rainfall events as noted in previous studies e g beck et al 2019 xie and arkin 1996 both algorithms integrate rain gauge station data and this can explain the exhibited performance however we could not verify gauged observations for the current study in these two sres blending procedures rfe2 s best results in detecting rainfall events during the dry cropping season for all except the flowering stage can be attributed to the sensitivity of the algorithm as an infrared based sre that incorporates a temperature threshold to low rainfall rates that are predominant during dry periods mekonnen et al 2021 rfe2 is also extensively used for food security monitoring or to supplement ground rainfall observations in east africa by fewsnet jayanthi et al 2013 falsely detected rainfall and large variations in pod values were frequent in chirps particularly in later growth stages this weak performance indicates the product is less skillful in detecting extreme low and high rainfall depths experienced during early and late growth stages respectively since at later growth stages crops are at an advanced stage of development effects of the poor performance might be insignificant when a crop growth simulation uses chirps rainfall as input but simulation results are affected regardless according to funk et al 2015 chirps is a blended product of chirp and rain gauge stations data therefore a better rainfall detection capability would be expected than other sres which was not the case in this study a probable reason for this could be that only four rain gauge stations in and around the lake victoria basin were included in the blending procedure by product providers thus the study recommends incorporating omitted rain gauge stations data in blending procedures where applicable as one approach to improve sres detection capabilities a complete list of gauged observations that the chirps algorithm uses each month is accessible at the climate hazards center data repository https data chc ucsb edu the weaker rainfall detection capability shown by sres as the cropping season progressed might not be so critical for crop growth simulation because soil moisture becomes less critical towards the later growth stages however other approaches to improve sres algorithms in detecting rainfall events are essential some improvement might result from merging the sres to capitalize on their strengths for crop growth simulation sres generally performed better during a wet than a dry cropping season this is consistent with previous findings e g dinku et al 2011 dos reis et al 2017 tan et al 2017 yang and luo 2014 evaluating rainfall products over different seasons and arid environment and concluded that they are season dependent furthermore bias in rainfall depths varied per sre with no product showing a unique pattern of underestimation or overestimation in each crop growth stage however we found the least sres bias in rainfall depths during early crop growth stages that deteriorated at later stages mswep and cmorph respectively showed the least and highest interannual spreads from a perspective of a crop growth stage sensitivity to soil moisture deficits it is reasonable to argue that the sre s rainfall depth bias at later growth stages can be expected not to cause significant uncertainty in a crop growth simulated output when forced with sres rainfall sre s bias in representing severe and extreme water stress episodes was found more frequent during the ripening than flowering stages in relating errors in rainfall representation to crop growth water requirements though extreme and severe water stress episodes are harmful to crop growth in simulations the indicated bias frequencies during ripening pose an insignificant constraint to crop growth than it would during the initial stages wr calculated based on estimates from all the sres was satisfactory at the initial growth stages with insignificant biases which decreased from the vegetative stage the possible reason is that the wrsi values were determined at the onset of the cropping season when rainfall was considered sufficient to support crop growth the overestimations of frequency of extreme water stress episodes during the flowering stage by cmorph could be linked to its performance in detecting dry spell lengths as such crop growth simulations forced with cmorph rainfall might expect frequent episodes of soil moisture deficits and possible total crop failure during the flowering stage in this same growth stage chirps and mswep underestimated severe water stress episodes these findings suggest that further testing and assessments on use of sres in crop growth simulation is needed to assess how crop growth indicators such as leaf area index bio mass production and crop yield are affected the study demonstrated that i no sre is most preferred for representing rainfall onset ii cmorph showed the best performance in detecting dry spell lengths iii mswep followed by rfe2 produced the best results in detecting rainfall events and iv mswep and cmorph exhibited the least and highest interannual spreads in sre s rainfall depth bias respectively meant for crop growth simulations in lake victoria basin finally cmorph and rfe2 overestimated the frequency of extreme water stress episodes during flowering as a critical growth stage whereas chirps and mswep showed underestimations in relating sre s errors representation to crop water requirement this suggests that sres require bias correction and or an ensemble approach that capitalizes on best aspects of all the sres to get one merged product that improves rainfall representation and reliability for crop growth simulations 5 conclusions in this study the bias of four sres chirps cmorph mswep and rfe2 in representing multi day rainfall onset rainfall depths dry spells and rainfall occurrence for different crop growth stages was assessed the evaluation focused on relating the bias in rainfall representation by sres to crop water requirements for crop growth simulation the findings indicate that the timing of rainfall arrival by the sres widely varies regardless of the product larger interannual variability exists in representing dry spell lengths during the flowering stage with cmorph and chirps showing the best and weakest results the sres generally performed better during a wet than a dry cropping season in representing rainfall depths detecting rainfall events and dry spell lengths but their performance worsened as the cropping season progressed this study provides an assessment of the usability of sres in crop growth simulation while focusing on their bias in different crop growth stages where previous efforts focused on the entire cropping period a detailed physically based crop growth modelling approach is recommended to provide information on how crop growth is affected when sres are used instead of in situ rainfall estimates declaration of competing

9889,in this research the performance of satellite rainfall estimates sres for crop growth simulation was investigated rainfall products selected were chirps 2 0 cmorph 1 0 mswep 2 2 and rfe 2 0 in situ rainfall from 20 stations within the lake victoria basin in kenya served as reference rainfall products were evaluated for onset days rainfall depths dry spells and rainfall occurrence for four crop growth stages assessment was on a daily time step for the period 2012 2018 and on a point to pixel basis results showed that sres exhibit large variation in timing of rainfall arrival sres exhibited largest interannual and spatial spreads in representing dry spell length during the flowering stage with cmorph and chirps showing best and weakest results respectively bias of sres in representing dry spells was smaller during early growth stages detecting rainfall occurrence by the sres weakened as the growing season progressed mswep followed by rfe2 produced the best results in detecting rainfall events while falsely detected rainfall was frequent in chirps particularly in later growth stages sres generally performed better during a wet than a dry growing season sres indicated less bias in rainfall depths during the early stages of crop growth but deteriorated at later stages mswep and cmorph exhibited the least and highest interannual spread in relative bias respectively in associating biases to severe and extreme water stress based on crop water requirement satisfaction index effects were more prevailing in the ripening than flowering stages findings of this study suggest that sres can serve as input to crop growth modelling but validation of sres with rain gauge observed counterparts is essential keywords bias crop growth simulation crop growth stages lake victoria basin remote sensing satellite based rainfall 1 introduction crop growth simulation approaches commonly are used to assess the impact of environmental factors management practices and plant genetics on crop development at plot or field scales thaler et al 2018 simulation approaches differ in complexity and input data requirements subject to intended use physically based crop growth models which incorporate mathematical descriptions of the main crop growth processes provide quantitative descriptions of the mechanisms that cause crop growth and development hoogenboom 1991 such approaches simulate crop growth e g biomass partitioning water use and development e g phenology across various cropping stages normally from seeding until physiological maturity despite noticeable development on crop growth simulations since the mid 1960s duncan et al 1967 the limited availability and quality of input data remain challenging causing uncertainty in simulated outputs representation of crop growth processes in simulations requires an understanding of the role of i driving variables e g meteorological data ii state variables e g number of leaves that characterize the state of a crop growth system iii model parameters to parameterize relationships between driving and state variables e g soil characteristic data and iv output variables thaler et al 2018 among various variables influencing simulated crop growth characteristics soil moisture has been identified as one of the most important variables riha et al 1996 watson and challinor 2013 ban et al 2019 showed that soil moisture shortage is the most crucial crop growth limiting factor shortage of soil moisture causes reduction of growth and is commonly referred to as crop water stress effective rainfall the difference between rainwater and actual evapotranspiration aet that is retained in the rootzone for meeting crop water requirement wr ali and mubarak 2017 is the primary source of soil moisture under rainfed agriculture and thus the most critical meteorological input variable in crop growth analyses crop growth in relation to rainfall and water stress has been studied considering multiple rainfall characteristics as summarized in table 1 studies indicate that crop growth responses to rainfall vary for different crops subject to the crop growth stage and growth requirements for water most relevant rainfall characteristics that directly affect crop growth are rainfall onset to denote the start of the cropping season dry spell indicating periods without rainfall duration of rainy periods and rainfall intensity to indicate how much it rains and occurrence to indicate the frequency of rain events rainfall onset tadross et al 2007 and antecedent rainfall conditions affect soil moisture conditions and thus define the seeding time for rainfed agriculture yadav et al 2013 both rainfall arrival and antecedent soil moisture conditions are critical inter seasonal rainfall representations for crop emergence and establishment in crop growth simulations wrongly identified rainfall arrival by sres may result in incorrect timing of seeding in simulation applications and may cause uncertain simulated outputs misrepresenting dry spell length directly influences soil moisture storage from rainfall for all growth stages with propagation effects on crop simulation results under or over estimating rainfall depths could result in soil moisture shortages or cause waterlogging for crops respectively prolonged rainfall intervals and soil moisture shortages from pre flowering to grain filling can lead to late maturity or loss of grain production respectively in reality high rainfall can result in rotting or fungal infections affecting the ripening phase during the vegetative and flowering stages severe water stress affects leaf area development due to a decrease in the stomatal opening which limits co2 uptake leading to a reduced rate of photosynthesis osakabe et al 2014 crop growth simulations require rainfall characteristics to be well represented with accurate estimates so to make simulation results useful accuracy is the closeness of agreement between a measured and true value of the quantity being measured joint committee for guides in metrology 2012 however representing real world rainfall distributions and characteristics is challenging in crop growth simulations errors in rainfall representation propagate to simulated outputs mcmillan et al 2011 misrepresentation of rainfall characteristics cause uncertainty and possibly errors in simulated results through error propagation in this respect guo et al 2015 showed that errors in simulated soil moisture deficit can lead to decreased leaf water potential causing reduced leaf growth besides increasing dry matter allocation to the roots decreased root to shoot ratio and reduced biomass or retarded growth of non drought tolerant crops sah et al 2020 showed that soil moisture stress increases days to flowering days to maturity anthesis silk interval decreases total leaf number and loss of normal root architecture leading to reduced biomass errors in simulated soil saturation by excessive rainfall can lead to o2 restrictive conditions affecting plant growth development and survival parent et al 2008 comparing differences in growth and physiological performance of plants under soil waterlogging stress yang et al 2020 showed reduced photosynthesis during waterlogging that soon recovered on draining rainfall can be estimated using gauging networks herold et al 2016 tapiador et al 2012 but availability and quality of spatially temporal data often is a concern in countries where resources are limited to maintain an observation network a further constraint to the availability of rainfall data is that rain gauge networks often have a low gauge density with stations that are unevenly distributed in space with incomplete observation records by failure of automated recorders or observers behrangi et al 2011 to arrive at consistent and spatial temporal coherent time series rainfall from stations often is spatially and temporally interpolated the accuracy of spatially interpolated rainfall depends both on the gauge network density and the spatial coherence of the rainfall distribution beck et al 2017a spatial coherence describes the cross correlation between rainfall at different points in space and used to tell the uniformity of the rainfall distributions constraints on availability of rainfall data in crop growth simulations can be overcome by use of satellite rainfall estimates sres use of sres in crop growth simulations involves various methods including forcing replacing meteorological input variables derived from remote sensing data calibration adjusting model parameters and updating updating state variables e g soil moisture content vegetative biomass whenever remote sensing data is available ban et al 2019 in this study sres are evaluated as an alternative rainfall input data source in crop growth simulation a key advantage of using sres is the availability of consistent and spatially temporally coherent rainfall data series with large spatial coverages from continental to global and high temporal resolutions from monthly to 30 min xianghu et al 2014 whereas gauge networks provide point based rainfall data at locations where gauges are installed with the current advancement of satellite remote sensing instruments various gridded rainfall products have been developed with different design objectives input data sources spatial and temporal resolutions spatial coverage temporal spans and latencies beck et al 2017b four such products are selected for this study and include the climate prediction center morphing algorithm cmorph joyce et al 2004 the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations data chirps funk et al 2015 the african rainfall estimation algorithm rfe xie and arkin 1996 and the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017a products the concept behind these state of the art sres is information blending from passive microwave sensors with that from more frequent but indirect visible infrared sensors microwave sensors are commonly mounted on orbiting satellites while visible infrared sensors are commonly mounted on geostationary or low earth orbiting satellites thus blending takes advantage of their complementary strengths behrangi et al 2011 joyce et al 2004 sun et al 2018 tapiador et al 2012 some sres further consider active microwave and ground based information for calibration funk et al 2015 huffman et al 2007 xie et al 2017 sres exhibit significant uncertainty because of random and systematic errors the latter described as bias smith et al 2006 as argued in pan et al 2010 random errors tend to cancel out when estimates from the sres are considered at large temporal windows jobard et al 2011 unlike the sres bias smith et al 2006 bias in these products originates from sensor calibration uncertainties too low spatio temporal sampling frequencies resampling or retrieval errors amongst others aghakouchak et al 2012 maggioni et al 2013 and manifests in inaccurate estimates of rainfall depths occurrence and intensities gumindoga et al 2019 habib et al 2012 yang and luo 2014 so rainfall representations differ for each sre product with different error distributions as affected by land surface conditions latitude season and type of rainfall event hobouchian et al 2017 when sres serve as an input to a crop growth simulation errors propagate to cause uncertainty in simulated outcomes luetkemeier et al 2018 ramarohetra et al 2013 in the context of this study uncertainty refers to aspects of error in simulated crop growth outputs due to sre error propagation effects motivated by constraints of rainfall gauging networks and the potential of sres to be used in crop growth simulation there is a need to evaluate bias in sres their characteristics under various conditions and the effects of bias propagation in simulating crop growth e g luetkemeier et al 2018 ovando et al 2018 ramarohetra et al 2013 reynolds et al 2000 studies in hydrological applications have explored how bias is affected by topography dos reis et al 2017 gao and liu 2013 by different seasons and arid environments tan et al 2017 yang and luo 2014 in reproducing rainfall amount intensity and occurrence dinku et al 2011 whereas sres are considered for simulation applications consensus has been reached that sres require bias correction and or merging of sre products to improve rainfall representation and their reliability bhattacharya and solomatine 2015 haile et al 2012 a first step is thus to assess bias in each sre their representation of soil water conditions for crop development and to confirm their usability in crop growth simulation especially in rainfed agriculture studies by beck et al 2017b and behrangi et al 2011 on the use of sres in rainfall runoff modelling show that bias varies spatially and temporally for this study the specific objectives are to i evaluate the timing of sre rainfall arrival at the onset of the crop growth season ii assess errors of the sres in representing multi day rainfall depths iii assess the representation of prolonged periods of dry days iv evaluate rainfall detection occurrence errors for respective crop growth stages and v to relate errors in rainfall representation to crop growth water requirements this study explores if sres are fit for use in crop growth simulation by providing an evaluation of sre bias and bias error propagation into the water requirement satisfaction index with a focus on subsequent crop growth stages in this study

filling sah et al 2020 that are adopted in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in the lake victoria basin of kenya fig 1 that covers 43 368 km2 between 2 05 00 s to 1

africa acre africa all stations are automated weather stations aws the data series have daily observations and are for the period between january 2012 and december 2018 except for two stations toro farm and wiobiero where records started in april 2012 an inventory of the stations is provided in table 2 some stations are affected by data gaps but the available time series are of sufficiently long duration to serve the objectives of this study consistency and completeness checks of gauged rainfall time series were performed the missing rainfall records were not gap filled to avoid introducing possible errors in the gauged data series that serve as reference for the sres we note that none of these rain gauge stations have been used in tuning the algorithms for sre products selected for this

respective ftp sites imports the files in ilwis raster formats creates map lists of ½ and 3 h data and then mirror rotates them it subsequently subsets the images and reprojects to the study area of interest and mosaic the ½ h cmorph images to hourly equivalents finally it aggregates the hourly cmorph and 3 h mswep to daily totals nearest neighbour resampling cover and hart 1967 at a spatial grid size of 0 07 was used to arrive at directly comparable sre s rainfall estimates for reasons of brevity detailed assessment on the pixel size and resampling method are not shown 2 5 evaluation of sres in representing key rainfall characteristics for crop growth stage simulation we used the point to pixel approach to compare point rainfall estimates of rain gauge observations i e gauge funnel scale and the four sres at pixel scale for the period 2012 2018 this methodology has been widely used in assessing sres e g bhatti et al 2016 cavalcante et al 2020 mekonnen et al 2021 worqlul et al 2014 and assumes that sres at pixel scale are representative counterparts of rain gauge station observations days with missing rainfall estimates at the rain gauge stations were considered as missing in the sre time series for comparison the evaluation of the performances of the sres in representing key rainfall characteristics was tailored to three crop growth stages vegetative reproductive and ripening the early days of the vegetative stage was further assessed as initial adapting to the fao classification savva and frenken 2002 growth stage transitioning dates were kept unique for subsequent seasons and stations the start of a long rainfall period indicated by the gauge was adopted as the start of the wet season and of the maize growing season rainfall occurrence detection errors of sres were assessed using categorical error metrics measuring frequency of in correct predictions of a model and shifts in rainfall arrival dates the estimation errors of the sres were determined using the relative bias and crop water requirement satisfaction index wrsi eq 1 indicating the potential crop water stress during the growing period the ranking of the sre products in detecting and estimating rain rates for crop growth stage simulation was based on a multicriteria analysis of the metrics as summarized in table 4 1 wrsi aet wr 100 2 5 1 assessment of rainfall onset day and dry spell rainfall onset day is determined as the first rainfall occurrence centered on march 1 with a minimum cumulative rainfall depth of 20 mm in 3 days with no dry spell larger than 10 days within the next 21 days in a growing season the condition on dry spell length was added to ensure successful seeding long rains in the study area run from march through late october e g fig 2 so march 1 is used as the earliest date of seeding and april 30 as the latest date when maize could be planted to ensure maturity before the end of the growing season a rainfall event was considered as a day with rainfall above 0 85 mm the 0 85 mm d 1 threshold is not only a practical way of implementing rainfall events above 1 mm d 1 suggested by the world meteorological organization but also harmonizes with the measurement accuracy of rainfall time series obtained from aws for this study onset day as represented by each of the sres denoted as s o in date is determined and thereafter time shifts from rain gauge observed counterparts g o as reference is calculated so a negative s o g o value indicates an early arrival by the sre otherwise a late arrival dry spell is taken as the number of days between two rainfall events and thus its length was used to indicate the longest number of consecutive days with a rainfall amount below 0 85 mm on each day within a growth stage signifying periods of inadequate rainfall to moisten the soil for crop growth 2 5 2 assessment of rainfall occurrence bias in detecting rainfall occurrence by the sres was assessed using three categorical error metrics the probability of detection pod eq 2 false alarm ratio far eq 3 and critical success index csi eq 4 detailed in wilks 2006 a binary skill score yes no was adopted to determine these categorical error metrics as per contingency table 5 the pod indicates correctly detected rainfall occurrence far gives the proportion of falsely detected rainfall occurrence and csi indicates the fraction of the number of correctly detected rainfall occurrence by sres they range between 0 and 1 2 pod h h m best 1 worst 0 3 far fa h fa best 0 worst 1 4 csi h h m fa best 1 worst 0 2 5 3 assessment of rainfall depths rainfall depth was considered as the aggregated rainfall depth for a specific growth stage the magnitude by which sres deviate from rain gauge observed counterparts was evaluated using relative bias eq 5 and wrsi relative bias was selected as a measure of the systematic difference between sre and rain gauge estimates relative to gauged estimates smith et al 2006 a negative bias indicates underestimation by the sre a positive bias indicates overestimation 5 relative bias i 1 n s i g i i 1 n g i 100 where s i and g i are satellite and gauge rainfall estimates in mm at day i respectively n is the total number of days the wrsi as a measure of crop performance based on soil water availability to the crop during a growing season senay and verdin 2002 was used to assess the effects of soil water stress on crop growth wrsi values were determined using a crop water balance model in instat 3 37 software developed by statistical services centre and originally available at www ssc rdg ac uk the instat statistical package was selected because of its modest input data requirement and being less sophisticated compared to a full crop growth model respective index values were estimated using daily rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet soil water holding capacity swhc and a crop coefficient kc as inputs the swhc values in table 6 that indicate the maximum amount of water that a given soil can hold to serve crop growth were obtained from the soil and terrain database for kenya kensoter version 2 0 provided by isric international soil reference and information centre 2004 the widely accepted fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 that employs location specific solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed was used to compute pet in r instat r instat org software day of year averages of pet were used in cases where these input records were missing a crop coefficient was derived for each of the four maize growth stages considering a maize crop maturity of 180 days values were estimated based on the kc approach developed by allen et al 1998 in this approach kc values for initial and ripening crop growth stages were linearly interpolated to generate intermediate kc values for vegetative and flowering crop growth stages the calculated values were then used to construct the kc curve fig 3 the maize wrsi for a growing season was calculated as a ratio of aet to wr in mm for a specific station expressed in eq 1 the wr was calculated by multiplying pet by estimated kc values following eq 6 6 wr pet kc aet representing the actual water depth that is lost from the soil water storage by evapotranspiration was estimated through the soil water balance method incorporated in instat during a simulation soil water content is obtained through a mass balance eq 7 where soil water is monitored in a volume defined by swhc a detailed description is in masupha and moeletsi 2020 7 sw i sw i 1 p i aet i where sw is soil water content p is rainfall and i is the daily time step the wrsi is calculated daily and the cumulative potential of growth stress by soil water shortage during the growing season is given at the end of the cropping season an index value of 100 indicates no growth stress as the wr is fully satisfied by rainfall but decreases when rainfall is too low to satisfy the crop growth water requirement that as such causes soil water stress to crop growth impact of rainfall deficit on maize crop growth was interpreted based on the wrsi classification in table 7 after masupha and moeletsi 2020 3 results because inter seasonal rainfall patterns differ and thus affect seasonal crop growth cumulative rainfall received from the 20 rain gauge stations over the crop growing seasons of 2012 2018 is compared in fig 4 the figure shows that the cropping season of 2012 received most rain compared to other seasons in particular during the critical crop growing days before the 200th day from the start of the growing season the increase in the 2012 curve appeared to decline after the 200th day closely matching that for 2013 and 2018 however the 2012 cropping season exhibited the highest rainfall and thus also highest mean daily rainfall further analysis of rainfall shows that 2015 and 2016 had the least accumulated rainfall and were considered as dry crop growing seasons for critical crop growth days the aggregated rainfall recorded over 2015 and 2016 was higher than for 2014 and 2017 with least rainfall for 2014 the mean daily rainfall in 2014 was lower than that of 2017 by 0 3 mm in this study 2012 and 2014 were the wettest and driest crop growing seasons respectively 3 1 rainfall onset day representation fig 5 shows the distribution of mismatch in marking the start of the wet season rains for each of the four sres selected for this study any mismatch is considered bias that is specific to each sre product whereas fig 5 shows mismatch for all cropping seasons 2012 2018 we refer to the attached supplementary materials section for assessments of each year most differences in fig 5a do not exceed 5 days i e 54 for each sre misrepresentation of the rainfall onset by sres was found to be skewed towards early arrivals with shifts ranging between 6 and 27 days dominating it can be seen on the extremes that an sre could miss a rainfall onset by indicating an early or late arrival up to a shift of more than 27 days fig 5b for the dry growing season 2014 shows that the onset timing differences were dominantly within 5 days with infrequent late arrivals indicated by cmorph and mswep for the wet growing season fig 5c the differences were fairly distributed within 27 days during a wet cropping season whereas no sre was most preferred in representing rainfall onset rfe2 showed the least onset error followed by chirps the latter consistently showed no rainfall arrivals later than the gauged counterparts except during wet cropping seasons e g 2016 and 2017 mswep and cmorph products mainly indicated delays in rainfall arrivals 3 2 bias in representing dry spell length except for initial and ripening stages the box whisker plot in fig 6 shows that all sres differ with gauged observations in representing dry spell lengths at least 50 of chirps estimates showed less than five days dry spell lengths that was also reported in gauged observations during the initial stage a similar pattern by cmorph during ripening results indicate larger interquartile ranges during the flowering stage the median and mean dry spell lengths recorded by chirps are consistently higher than gauged observations throughout the four growth stages in contrast however the median of the product is aligned with gauged observations for the initial growth stage medians from the other sres were consistently lower than gauged observations for all growth stages compared to other sres chirps exhibited larger variations in dry spell length that increased in magnitude towards later growth stages except for the ripening growth stage rfe2 consistently indicated the lowest mean and median dry spell lengths all the sres showed a misfit in representing dry spell length reported at the gauge possibly owing to the inability of sres to indicate the minimum dry spell lengths from the gauge except for mswep during the vegetative stage the sres exhibited a skewed spread towards long dry spell lengths that was also reported in gauge observations while all sres had outliers at each growth stage cmorph and mswep had a larger number during vegetative and ripening stages the sres misrepresented the lowest dry spell length except rfe2 during the initial stage all sres except rfe2 could fairly show agreement with gauged observations on capturing the long dry spells during the initial crop growth stage for the vegetative stage only cmorph results agreed with gauged observations however no alignment was seen at later crop growth stages e g flowering and ripening for all sres fig 7 shows a comparison of the bias of each sre in representing the dry spells for the four crop growth stages with respect to the rain gauge observed counterparts most underestimations and overestimations do not exceed three days i e 40 by each sre in each growth stage results show that the differences are less frequent during the early growth stages i e initial and vegetative but increase later this is consistent with the short dry spell lengths seen during the initial and vegetative growth stages in fig 6 chirps tend to overestimate dry spell lengths for each growth stage rfe2 and mswep show underestimations for all four growth stages while cmorph show underestimations during the vegetative and flowering stages no distinct response is seen during the initial and ripening stages based on these distributions and sre biases chirps and rfe2 are least preferred for representing dry spell lengths whereas cmorph show a better performance than the other sres and is closely challenged by mswep it is prone to outliers 3 3 performance of sres in detecting rainfall occurrence rainfall occurrence detection for different crop growth stages is shown in fig 8 further results are available in the supplementary materials section results of a comparison between dry and wet cropping seasons are shown in fig 9 results show a decrease in median values of pod from early to later growth stages for all sres with an increase only realized at later stages specifically mswep showed the best detection capability with median pod values of 0 9 and 0 8 for initial and flowering stages respectively compared to other sres this product had the highest correctly detected rainfall occurrence during the wet cropping season fig 9b as for the rainfall detection pattern exhibited by mswep pod median values for rfe2 were consistently higher than those of chirps and cmorph the detection capability of the sres significantly dropped during dry cropping seasons the median pod value of rfe2 was 0 95 in the wet cropping season 2017 compared to 0 85 in the dry cropping season 2014 however rfe2 still outperformed the other sres in detecting rainfall during the dry cropping season for all except the flowering stage irrespective of seasonal variations chirps showed weak results in detecting rainfall events during the dry cropping season rainfall detection of the products showed a median pod above 0 25 for the flowering stage larger variations of pod values were seen in chirps compared to other sres comparison based on the fraction of correctly detected rainfall events shows that mswep and chirps reported the best and worst median csi values respectively as for the pod pattern the csi values deteriorated as the number of rainy days increased in terms of falsely detected rainfall chirps generally exhibited the best results this contradicts the other results on pod and csi the median far values of this product were 0 2 and 0 35 for early and late crop growth stages respectively mswep produced the weakest detection skill compared to the other sres with median far values ranging between 0 25 and 0 45 we found a large spread in far values during the late growth stages particularly in chirps compared to other sres results suggest that chirps recorded the largest spread in far fig 9a that conflicts with its best performance in all but the flowering stage except for later crop growth stages all the sres had a better performance during a wet than a dry cropping season in general detecting rainfall events by the sres deteriorated as the cropping season progressed this suggests good performance by sres to validate their usability in crop growth simulations because early growth stages are the most critical for crop growth analysis 3 4 bias in rainfall depth fig 10a compares the systematic differences in rainfall depths indicated by the sres with respect to gauged counterparts 2012 2018 for different crop growth stages further results are in the supplementary materials section sres underestimated rainfall depths during the initial growth stage based on median value of relative bias a similar result is shown for the wet 2012 and dry 2014 cropping season fig 10 b and c respectively when products are evaluated for the least bias during the initial growth stage chirps and rfe2 are preferred despite some underestimations only chirps shows underestimation during flowering and ripening stages an assessment of the individual sres over the cropping season shows that the underestimation by sres tends to reduce in the vegetative stage but becomes large in the flowering stage the vegetative growth stage unlike other stages experienced overestimates as shown by the sres except for mswep consistent underestimation of rainfall depths in mswep is noticed throughout three growth stages for the ripening stage the product occasionally overestimates gauged counterparts in both dry and wet cropping seasons mswep showed the least interannual spread despite its consistent underestimation while cmorph and chirps indicated the largest spread of relative bias during the early and late growth stages respectively except for the 2017 cropping season we found the least difference in rainfall depth between gauges and sres during the initial and vegetative crop stages this difference increases during the flowering and ripening stages a similar performance pattern is noticed during dry and wet cropping seasons for all but the vegetative growth stage where underestimation by the sres is common during a wet cropping season and the opposite is valid for a dry cropping season further analysis on soil moisture availability for crop growth at different growth stages was carried out using wrsi table 8 shows the frequencies of different water stress levels see definitions of episodes in table 7 based on the wrsi for each growth stage represented by each sre for all sres simulated crop water requirement was met for the initial growth stage for the earliest stages of crop growth any bias in estimated rainfall did not result in shortage of soil water it appeared that the net effect of bias in rainfall onset rainfall occurrence and rainfall depth did not cause a bias propagation effect resulting in soil water stress conditions over respective crop growing windows this is despite crops sensitivity to soil water at shallow depths for a shallow rooting depth index values decrease for vegetative flowering and ripening stages with cmorph recording the smallest value of 76 8 compared to the gauged counterpart at 75 9 as illustrated in the table cmorph overestimated the frequency of mild water stress episodes compared to the rain gauge while the other sres showed underestimations i e chirps and mswep missing to capture the episodes in the vegetative stage results show that the bias of sres in representing severe and extreme water stress episodes was more frequent in the ripening than flowering stages cmorph followed by rfe2 overestimated the frequency of extreme water stress episodes compared to gauged counterparts for the flowering stage in contrast chirps followed by mswep showed underestimations total crop failure indicated by crop growth simulations applying the sres would probably be expected at this stage except for chirps all sres overestimated the frequency of severe water stress episodes mswep followed by cmorph overestimated the frequency of extreme water stress episodes by 7 9 and 1 8 per cent respectively during the ripening stage chirps and rfe2 showed underestimations of 3 6 and 0 8 per cent respectively for this growth stage 4 discussion this study assessed sres in representing rainfall characteristics meant for crop growth simulation at different crop growth stages this study found that most differences in marking the start of the wet season rains by sres with respect to gauged counterparts do not exceed five days the representation of the onset day by the sres suggests applicability of sres as input in crop growth simulation whereas some skewness in misrepresentation of onset days by sres is shown towards early arrivals a possible explanation might be the false rains that are indicated by sres additionally the late arrivals can be associated with sres failing to detect rainfall occurrence reported at the rain gauges the missed and falsely detected rainfall also may cause the difference noticed in the representation of the onset days by sres during dry and wet growing seasons the wide variation in timing of rainfall arrival by the sres and the inability to identify a preferred sre product based on onset day representation implies that sres must be validated with gauged observations incorrect timing of seeding data in crop growth simulation due to incorrect rainfall arrival as indicated by an sre can lead to error propagation that affects simulation results in cases of dry direct seeding followed by delayed rainfall arrival by sres input in the crop growth simulations a reseeding would be required because seeds may fail to emerge due to soil moisture deficit intolerance even if the seeds emerge utilizing antecedent soil moisture they may quickly die leading to total crop failure in the simulation process sres indicating early arrival of rains can be beneficial but the seedling depends on subsequent rainfall patterns both in distribution and amounts this study compared the distribution and sre s bias on detecting dry spell lengths fig 6 and fig 7 larger interquartile ranges during the flowering stage were found suggesting that the dry spell length has more interannual variability during this stage another finding is that chirps showed large spreads that increased towards later growth stages i e flowering in representing dry spell length besides consistently overestimating the means and medians compared to gauged counterparts following guo et al 2015 and yadav et al 2013 maize crop is sensitive to moisture stress at the flowering stage so forcing a crop growth model with chirps rainfall could lead to simulated results indicating increased days to flowering reduced growth and biomass due to reduced soil moisture from long dry spells this aspect of sre performance makes the chirps product less preferred to other sres based on dry spell representation the infrequent bias in representing the dry spell lengths during initial and vegetative stages that increased in later stages is possibly caused by more frequent rainfall events at the start of cropping seasons dry spell appeared to be more frequent during later stages of crop growth than early stages this is partly in line with fall et al 2021 who showed dry spell occurrence is more frequent at the start and end of rainy seasons in senegal it should be noted that dry spell assessment was limited to sre s bias however further insights on the characteristics and extent to which they influence soil moisture for crop growth can be derived by using different dry spell indices e g based on accumulated rainfall during a specified period or intensities mswep followed by rfe2 exhibited the best results in detecting rainfall events as noted in previous studies e g beck et al 2019 xie and arkin 1996 both algorithms integrate rain gauge station data and this can explain the exhibited performance however we could not verify gauged observations for the current study in these two sres blending procedures rfe2 s best results in detecting rainfall events during the dry cropping season for all except the flowering stage can be attributed to the sensitivity of the algorithm as an infrared based sre that incorporates a temperature threshold to low rainfall rates that are predominant during dry periods mekonnen et al 2021 rfe2 is also extensively used for food security monitoring or to supplement ground rainfall observations in east africa by fewsnet jayanthi et al 2013 falsely detected rainfall and large variations in pod values were frequent in chirps particularly in later growth stages this weak performance indicates the product is less skillful in detecting extreme low and high rainfall depths experienced during early and late growth stages respectively since at later growth stages crops are at an advanced stage of development effects of the poor performance might be insignificant when a crop growth simulation uses chirps rainfall as input but simulation results are affected regardless according to funk et al 2015 chirps is a blended product of chirp and rain gauge stations data therefore a better rainfall detection capability would be expected than other sres which was not the case in this study a probable reason for this could be that only four rain gauge stations in and around the lake victoria basin were included in the blending procedure by product providers thus the study recommends incorporating omitted rain gauge stations data in blending procedures where applicable as one approach to improve sres detection capabilities a complete list of gauged observations that the chirps algorithm uses each month is accessible at the climate hazards center data repository https data chc ucsb edu the weaker rainfall detection capability shown by sres as the cropping season progressed might not be so critical for crop growth simulation because soil moisture becomes less critical towards the later growth stages however other approaches to improve sres algorithms in detecting rainfall events are essential some improvement might result from merging the sres to capitalize on their strengths for crop growth simulation sres generally performed better during a wet than a dry cropping season this is consistent with previous findings e g dinku et al 2011 dos reis et al 2017 tan et al 2017 yang and luo 2014 evaluating rainfall products over different seasons and arid environment and concluded that they are season dependent furthermore bias in rainfall depths varied per sre with no product showing a unique pattern of underestimation or overestimation in each crop growth stage however we found the least sres bias in rainfall depths during early crop growth stages that deteriorated at later stages mswep and cmorph respectively showed the least and highest interannual spreads from a perspective of a crop growth stage sensitivity to soil moisture deficits it is reasonable to argue that the sre s rainfall depth bias at later growth stages can be expected not to cause significant uncertainty in a crop growth simulated output when forced with sres rainfall sre s bias in representing severe and extreme water stress episodes was found more frequent during the ripening than flowering stages in relating errors in rainfall representation to crop growth water requirements though extreme and severe water stress episodes are harmful to crop growth in simulations the indicated bias frequencies during ripening pose an insignificant constraint to crop growth than it would during the initial stages wr calculated based on estimates from all the sres was satisfactory at the initial growth stages with insignificant biases which decreased from the vegetative stage the possible reason is that the wrsi values were determined at the onset of the cropping season when rainfall was considered sufficient to support crop growth the overestimations of frequency of extreme water stress episodes during the flowering stage by cmorph could be linked to its performance in detecting dry spell lengths as such crop growth simulations forced with cmorph rainfall might expect frequent episodes of soil moisture deficits and possible total crop failure during the flowering stage in this same growth stage chirps and mswep underestimated severe water stress episodes these findings suggest that further testing and assessments on use of sres in crop growth simulation is needed to assess how crop growth indicators such as leaf area index bio mass production and crop yield are affected the study demonstrated that i no sre is most preferred for representing rainfall onset ii cmorph showed the best performance in detecting dry spell lengths iii mswep followed by rfe2 produced the best results in detecting rainfall events and iv mswep and cmorph exhibited the least and highest interannual spreads in sre s rainfall depth bias respectively meant for crop growth simulations in lake victoria basin finally cmorph and rfe2 overestimated the frequency of extreme water stress episodes during flowering as a critical growth stage whereas chirps and mswep showed underestimations in relating sre s errors representation to crop water requirement this suggests that sres require bias correction and or an ensemble approach that capitalizes on best aspects of all the sres to get one merged product that improves rainfall representation and reliability for crop growth simulations 5 conclusions in this study the bias of four sres chirps cmorph mswep and rfe2 in representing multi day rainfall onset rainfall depths dry spells and rainfall occurrence for different crop growth stages was assessed the evaluation focused on relating the bias in rainfall representation by sres to crop water requirements for crop growth simulation the findings indicate that the timing of rainfall arrival by the sres widely varies regardless of the product larger interannual variability exists in representing dry spell lengths during the flowering stage with cmorph and chirps showing the best and weakest results the sres generally performed better during a wet than a dry cropping season in representing rainfall depths detecting rainfall events and dry spell lengths but their performance worsened as the cropping season progressed this study provides an assessment of the usability of sres in crop growth simulation while focusing on their bias in different crop growth stages where previous efforts focused on the entire cropping period a detailed physically based crop growth modelling approach is recommended to provide information on how crop growth is affected when sres are used instead of in situ rainfall estimates declaration of competing
