9905,response of faba bean to irrigation with wastewater obtained from different wastewater treatment plants along with the combined effect of wastewater and aphids on plant growth and aphid fitness were evaluated under greenhouse conditions results indicated that the ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids and macro elements were varied widely among wastewater resources and were higher than that of tap water seed germination percent did not significantly affect by wastewater but germination index was considerably influenced by some types of wastewaters plant growth was reduced by irrigation with wadi hassan wastewater and zarqa river leaf macro elements greatly varied between treatments aphid infestation reduced plant growth compared to the control plants treated with wastewater enhanced the abundance of aphids at different magnitudes while plant growth was equal and or better than that of infested control plants we conclude that the properly treated wastewater was not only as effective as fresh water in enhancing the plant growth but also mitigated the adverse consequence of high infestation level of aphids on the plant keywords aphis fabae faba bean wastewater plant growth seed germination 1 introduction water use is rising as a result of high population growth urban industrial and agricultural activities depletion of groundwater reserves together with climate change the gap between the supply and demand is reaching such alarming levels posing in some parts of the world a threat to human existence particularly in arid and semi arid regions of mediterranean basin lubello et al 2004 hamoda 2004 murray and ray 2010 therefore a long term water plan and future scenarios of water management considering both demand management and non conventional water resources mainly reclaimed wastewater should be adopted to decrease the gap between supply and request epa 2004 nash and de souza 2005 rak 2009 irrigated agriculture constitutes only 20 of the world s total arable land but the value of crop production from irrigated land is 40 of the world s total unesco 2017 the use of sewage wastewater in agriculture has a long history and is receiving renewed attention in the light of increased global water scarcity tzanakakis et al 2014 at the moment agricultural irrigation represents the highest demand for wastewater reuse in the world reaching up to 73 of the total water consumption waj 2006 treated wastewater is applied in agricultural sector and other ecosystem services without dilution or diluted with fresh water bataineh et al 2002 sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2003 banon et al 2011 bozdogan 2015 but water reuse standards vary by crop type reclaimed wastewater used for irrigation of non food crops is permitted more flexibility though it must be treated before use on food crops according to stricter requirements particularly for crops eaten uncooked al zboon and al ananzeh 2008 current estimates point out that up to 80 of vegetable production is irrigated with wastewater lai 2000 pedrero et al 2010 funmilola et al 2019 and at least 10 of the world s population consumes agricultural products initially grown with wastewater who 2006 depending on the countries in most of these cases the farmers irrigate with diluted untreated or partially treated wastewater in jordan approximately 98 6 of the total treated wastewater is utilized for irrigation while 1 4 is used for industrial activities which constitutes more than 15 of irrigation water shatanawi and shammout 2011 myszograj et al 2014 direct reuse of reclaimed wastewater is limited to the site s surrounding the existing treatment plants though the indirect reuse includes the discharge of treated effluent into surface water or groundwater aquifers legumes have been suggested as appropriate crops for the enhancement of bioproductivity and the reclamation of marginal lands because they yield good fodder protein rich seeds and enrich soil nitrogen in symbiotic association with rhizobium hungria and vargas 2000 el komy 2005 legume plants may utilize wastewater effluent and uptake heavy metal through extensive root system thus they serve as effective biological sieves inhibiting contamination of ground water sources chaudhary et al 2004 junior et al 2005 broad bean vicia faba fabales fabaceae is one of the oldest domesticated food legumes its importance in terms of food and agriculture is reflected by the occupied area worldwide 3 6 million hectares in more than 50 countries and gives a total production of 4 million tons per year mkhinini et al 2018 the body of the literature showed variable debates concerning the effect of wastewater on soil properties surface and groundwater pollution as well as microbial activities when applied for plant irrigation since the exciting outcomes are sometimes contradictory and not always useful to draw practical conclusions azbar et al 2004 dhouib et al 2005 mekki et al 2009 2012 becerra castro et al 2015 alghobar and suresha 2016 the risks of wastewater reuse in agriculture are extensive ranging from alterations in physicochemical and microbiological properties of soils ganoulis 2012 mosse et al 2012 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 to impacts on human health chiefly due to the reuse of raw or inadequately treated wastewater scott et al 2010 qadir et al 2010 bakopoulou et al 2011 other scientific works indicated that application of treated wastewater to the soil significantly boosted the soil fertility as a result of increasing amount of organic matter micro and macro elements and microbial activities peredes et al 2000 lesage meessen et al 2001 oved et al 2001 mendum and hirsch 2002 borken et al 2002 perkiomaki and fritze 2002 komilis et al 2005 in addition to the enhancement of growth and productivity of some plant species as indicated by seed germination yield components plant growth and protein and chlorophyll contents casa et al 2003 cereti et al 2004 paredes et al 2005 mekki et al 2013 divya et al 2015 however the quality of treated wastewater is not identical but depends to a great extent on the quality of the municipal water supply nature of the wastes added during use and the degree of treatment the wastewater has received pedrero et al 2010 unfortunately little attention has been paid for the interaction between plants irrigated with wastewater and phytophagous insects apart from some literatures dealing with the impact of wastewater on the population growth of insects tiroesele et al 2013 culliney et al 1986 culliney and pimentel 1986 however the combined effects of wastewater and aphids on the plant performance as well as the indirect effect of the plants grown with reclaimed wastewater on aphid fitness have not been investigated yet reduction in insect fitness may be predicted by reduced plant growth as a result of uptake and translocation of chemicals heavy metals and a wide array of organic chemicals babish et al 1981 mumma et al 1984 from the contaminated wastewater culliney et al 1986 jacobs 1981 ingestion of organic chemicals and heave metals accumulated in the plants and or reduced nutritional value of the plant changes in plant metabolism have been reported to affect phytophagous insects kennedy and booth 1959 lawton and mcneill 1979 such as increased restiveness of aphids in response to changes in sap composition harrewijn 1976 on the other hand nutrients in effluent are generally beneficial to plant growth and may influence the susceptibility to insect pests mumma et al 1984 culliney et al 1986 nutrients are vital for the growth and fitness of herbivorous insects it is evident that n has a positive effect on insect performance possibly due to increase in amino acids and decrease in the concentrations of carbon based defensive compound in the plant bala et al 2018 awmack and leatherm 2002 nevo and coll 2001 honek 1991 throop et al 2004 in the contrast increased levels of k reduced the aphid populations marwat et al 1985 myers et al 2005 as a result of enhanced secondary metabolism and declained carbohydrate accumulation ram and gupta 1988 p is an important component for population growth of phytophagous insects but higher amounts of p2o5 decrease the insect population through accumulation of phenols tannin lignin and terpenes that act as antifeedent or toxic to herbivores facknath and lalljee 2005 however identifying the causative factors responsible is usually extremely difficult due to the complex mixture of materials and chemicals found in sludge mumma et al 1984 therefore this study was performed to address the need for enhanced reuse of urban wastewater for agriculture to help conserve and expand available water supplies and contribute towards integrated management of urban water resources in arid nation where urban agriculture provides livelihood opportunities and food security the effect of irrigation with different types of reclaimed municipal wastewater was assessed in terms of the growth components and chemical contents of the faba bean plants whereas population growth fecundity rate and damage levels of aphids were used as indicators for the plant insect interaction 2 materials and methods 2 1 aphid culture and plant rearing a colony of the black bean aphid aphis fabae scopoli hemiptera aphididae was established from apterous individuals that originated from an open field in irbid district jordan aphids were reared on young broad bean plants grown in plastic pots 15 cm diameter filled with commercial potting soil the aphid culture was kept in organdy screened cages 80 60 x 60 cm in a growth room at temperatures of 25 3 c with 16 8 l d photoperiod a continuous supply of new greenhouse grown plants was provided as needed for the colony replenishment when old plants senesced due to high feeding pressure of aphids seeds of broad bean vicia faba var major variety were planted in 50 cavity plastic seedling trays 50 30 6 cm containing commercial potting soil after growing for several days in a clear greenhouse under natural light conditions at 25 3 c seedlings at the primary leaf stage were individually transplanted into larger plastic pots 15 cm diameter filled with commercial soil media plants were fertilized at weekly interval using 20 9 20 water soluble fertilizer n p k at the rate of 2 g per 1 l water and were irrigated as needed 2 2 wastewater reclaimed wastewater tested was brought from different sources secondary wastewater was collected from jordan university of science and technology s just treatment plant that treats every drop of wastewater output from campus and the university hospital in which fine suspended solids and residual organic materials remaining in the primary effluent are removed using aerobic biological treatment processes in the presence of oxygen it is designed to manage up to 2500 m3 of effluent per day a 132 000 m3 lined catchment area affectionately referred to as the duck pond water from the duck pond serves as a primary irrigation reserve for campus landscaping the second treated wastewater was obtained from wadi hassan treatment plant which received the effluents from the villages of an nuayyima shatana and kitm in which a preliminary and biological treatment extended aeration is used and tertiary treatment is provided by maturation ponds there are no specific industries that could be a significant source of pollution tertiary treatment is provided by maturation ponds treated wastewater may be chlorinated if required this wastewater treatment plant has a hydraulic load of 1140 7 m3 day water obtained from zarqa river is characterized by emergence of the effluents from industrial and samara treatment plant the samara in zarqa is the largest wastewater treatment plan in jordan that is designed to treat 364 000 m3 day of raw wastewater received from the two populated cities of greater amman and zarqa the samra wastewater treatment plant drains its effluent into the king talal dam through zarqa river which provides irrigation water for jordan valley industrial wastewater was brought from the textile factory at the prince hasan industrial city in irbid in which the effluents are treated by filtration and chemical processes without bacteriological degradation of waste tap water abstracted from groundwater wells was used as control material 2 3 germination test germination index and percentage were used to determine the effect of wastewater on seed vigor seeds of broad bean were planted in 50 cavity plastic seedling trays 50 30 0 6 cm containing commercial potting soil seeds in each tray were watered with relevant treated wastewater and fresh water as needed three seedling trays were used for each treatment germination of seeds was recorded each day for evidence of germination and continued until the germination ceased germination index was calculated as described in the association of official seed analysis using the following equation aosa 1983 germination index number of germinating seeds days of first count number of germinating seeds days of final count germination percentage an estimate of the viability of a population of seeds was calculated through dividing the number of germinated seeds on the total number of seeds ellis and roberts 1980 using the following equation germination percentage number of seed germinated total number of seeds tested x100 2 4 plant growth and plant aphid interaction to evaluate the effect of wastewater on the plant growth and plant aphid interaction plants of almost the same size were chosen when they reached the fourth true leaf stage two experiments were used in this study plants of each one was placed on benches in the greenhouse into two blocks one day prior to commencement of the experiment plants in the first experimental set were irrigated with equal amount of each type of reclaimed effluents at 3 day intervals for one month without aphid infestation in the second experimental set groups of 10 same aged late nymphal instars obtained from a synchronized colony were transferred to the upper portion of each plant using a fine moist camel hair brush aphid free plants were used as check material consequently all plants including control were covered individually with a ventilated clear plexi glass cylinder measuring 20 cm in diameter and 50 cm in height to avoid the aphid contamination between treatments and to prevent escape of aphids aphids were allowed to feed freely and produce offspring for one month and then the numbers of alive aphids per plant were counted and recorded both experimental sets were conducted in the greenhouse at 25 3 c and 14 10 h l d photoperiod 10 replicates were used for each treatment control plants in both experiments received tap water only at the end of experimental period plants in both experiments were cut just above the ground and were individually placed in plastic bags shoot fresh weight was measured in the laboratory using an electrical balance afterward plants were oven dried at 68 c for 48 h and shoot dry weight was weighed leaf area of individual plants was determined using a leaf area meter li 3000 area meter li cor inc lincoln ne dry leaves were randomly selected from five plants for each treatment finely grounded by mortar and thereafter analyzed for nitrogen phosphorous and potassium contents by using kjeldhal distilling unit kjeltec 8100 distillation tecator spectrophotometer and flame photometer respectively samples 1000 ml of each type of wastewater used in the investigation were analyzed in the laboratory for the ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and n p k contents to estimate the reproductive potential for the individual adult aphids on plants grown with wastewater from different origins plants at third true leaf stage were infested with 5 late instar nymphs attained from a synchronized colony introduced aphids were confined on the undersurface of the fully expanded third leaf using a clip on cage at the rate of one cage per plant the cages were made of a plastic petri dish 6 1 5 cm with two holes on the sides covered with fine mesh cloth for ventilation at maturity number of nymphs laid by alive adult aphids in each cage was recorded and removed at 24 h intervals until the death of all aphids 10 replicates were used for each treatment data were statistically analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova to compare the effect of each irrigation water source on plant growth characteristics and aphid reproduction the statistical analysis was performed for each parameter and the mean values were compared by using the f test and tukey s least significant differences at 5 probability level all statistical analyses were carried out using sas software version 9 2 sas 2000 to ensure that data came from a normal distribution standardized skewness and standardized kurtosis values were checked percentage values corresponding to cover value for each species were transformed by arcsine 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characteristics the chemical composition of treated wastewater used in this study is presented in table 1 it is evident that reclaimed wastewater of different resources exhibited diverse characteristics treated wastewater was generally alkaline in nature with ph values fluctuating between 7 7 and 11 03 depending on the source of wastewater the highest ph values were recorded for zarqa river 11 03 and industrial treated wastewater 10 16 while wadi hassan wastewater has the minimum 7 7 it is well known that the major effect of ec and tds on crop productivity is the inability of the plants to compete with ions present in the soil for water gupta et al 2015 all tested wastewaters has significantly greater salinity as the electrical conductivity ec values varied between 921 and 1715 μs 1 cm than fresh water 635 μs 1 cm table 1 zarqa river wastewater has the highest ec value 1715 μs 1 cm followed by wadi hassan just s and industrial wastewater respectively the tds of reclaimed wastewater appears to follow the same trend as observed for ec with the utmost value for zarqa river wastewater 1492 mg l 1 while industrial wastewater contained the lowest tds 797 mg l 1 table 1 normally ph is a routine measurement in irrigation water quality assessment that serves as an indicator for the acidity or basicity of water but is seldom a problem by itself however the normal ph range for irrigation water is from 6 5 to 8 4 while ph values outside this range are a good warning that the water is abnormal in quality fao 1992 our results indicated that the ec values for all types of treated wastewater lies in the range based on salinity classes of irrigation waters 780 2340 μs cm environment protection authority 1991 and it may be classified as medium to high saline water and thus permissible for irrigation with permeable soils and moderate leaching mahida 1981 in comparison with the standard guideline for irrigation water fao 1992 the mean tds content of treated effluents of all sources were low the tested wastewater showed considerably larger amounts of n p k than tap water where their concentration varied to some extent between treated wastewater table 1 nitrogen amount was almost equal in all wastewater ranging between 9 35 and 10 15 mg l 1 though it did not exceed 1 89 mg l 1 in fresh water however there were significant differences in p and k contents between the reclaimed wastewater wastewater collected from just s treatment plant has the uppermost p concentration 0 82 mg l but the lowest value was recorded for industrial wastewater 0 45 mg l however p was absent in fresh water treated wastewater had significantly higher concentration of k than fresh water which was more evident in treated wastewater from wadi hassan 51 49 k mg l followed by zarqa river just and industrial wastewater respectively this outcome comes to an agreement with angin et al 2005 nadav et al 2013 jahan et al 2019 akhkha et al 2019 hadji et al 2020 shan et al 2021 who concluded that treated sewage water is an important source of nutrients containing a considerable amount of n p and k however the physical and chemical properties of wastewater depend quantitatively and qualitatively on the original source of the water and the type of treatment 3 2 wastewater and seed germination seed germination traits i e cumulative germination percent gp and germination index gi have been investigated by many researchers as index for tolerance to contamination barua et al 2011 fendri et al 2013 huy and iwai 2018 gp of faba bean as affected by municipal treated wastewater from different sources is illustrated in table 2 results revealed that the gp was not significantly affected by any types of wastewater f 1 83 df 4145 p 0 15 in general irrigation with just s and zarqa river wastewater resulted in a slight decrease in gp but with no significant differences with other treatments germination index can be used as an indicator of phytotoxicity where the higher values represent a more rapid germination rate and show a better performance of germination wang et al 2004 irrigation with wadi hassan s wastewater caused the highest gi 3 14 where the lowest value 2 44 was monitored for seeds treated with just s wastewater however there were no significant differences between treatments apart from seeds watered with just s and wadi hassan wastewater f 4 46 df 4145 p 0 007 table 2 some workers investigated the effect of different wastewater types on seed germination of a variety of plants reuse of winery wastewater was reported to delay significantly the germination of different plant species although overall gp of all species was not affected mosse et al 2010 shrestha and niroula 2003 reported that the effluents from municipality sewage and dairy farming inhibited seed germination while shah udyog effluent promoted it effluent with ec less than 2250 μs cm was used successfully for irrigation of sunflowers with no adverse effect on seed germination and plant growth hussain et al 2010 zaki and shaaban 2015 which is to some extent agree with our results earlier studies indicated that the impact of wastewater on seed germination was not consistently and was dependent on the concentration of wastewater doke et al 2011 fendri et al 2013 rajesh et al 2013 2013 singh et al 2013 sinha and paul 2013 akhkha et al 2019 heidari and moradi 2019 kanwal et al 2020 irrigation with different plant effluents at lower concentration has been reported to promote seed germination of a variety of plants presumably due to presence of certain stimulatory toxicants that doesn t affect osmotic entry of water but accelerates the physiological processes of seed germination on the other hand higher concentrations exerted a negative impact on seed germination muthalagi and mala 2007 sinha and paul 2013 malaviya and sharma 2011 2016 huy and iwai 2018 such inhibitory effect of highly concentrated wastewater was attributed to the high amount of various organic and inorganic compounds including high salinity akbari et al 2007 krmz and bell 2012 rahman et al 2008 naseri et al 2012 yousofinia et al 2012 alawsy et al 2018 hadji et al 2020 haq et al 2021 in addition heavy metals chloride ion high phenolic compounds rusan et al 2015 decreased dissolved oxygen chinnusamy et al 2001 and or to absorption of higher dissolved solids have been proven to constrain seed germination singh et al 2007 3 3 wastewater and plant growth the effects of different types of treated wastewater on the growth rate of faba bean were found to be variable table 3 irrigation with reclaimed effluents originated from industrial and just s treatment plants for 30 days did not induce significant changes in the fresh and dry weights in addition to the leaf area compared to the plants treated with fresh water even with all wastewater tested contained greater concentrations of n p k than the control however plants irrigated with wastewater from zarqa river and wadi hassan treatment plants produced meaningfully less biomass f 4 25 df 4 45 p 0 006 for fresh weight f 6 35 df 4 45 p 0 0005 for dry weight and f 4 24 df 4 45 p 0 006 for leaf area than the control fresh weight was reduced by 23 5 and 12 6 for the plants receiving effluents from wadi hassan and zarqa river respectively in comparison with the control the same trend but at greater magnitude was observed for dry weight where it declined by 42 5 for wadi hassan wastewater and 37 5 for zarqa river water other than the plants irrigated with fresh water both treatments also showed up to 25 2 reduction in the leaf area when compared with control many workers have studied the influence of diverse types of treated wastewater on agronomic and physiological aspect of numerous agricultural crops but the consequences were variable results obtained by mkhinini et al 2018 showed that faba bean plants exposed to soils irrigated with treated wastewater produced significantly lesser shoots and root weight comparing to control plants irrigated with fresh water reuse of treated wastewater discharged from different sources in irrigation of a diversity of plants has been reported to have a detrimental impact on various growth parameters i e plant height root length leaf area dry matter and or yield hayet et al 2018 murillo et al 2000 hajihashemi et al 2020 however other studies showed that the source of irrigation wastewater did not significantly impact tomato yield traits gatta et al 2015 and young citrus trees rebou et al 2000 reduction in the plant growth as a result of wastewater application could be accredited to exposure to various contaminants present in treated wastewaters mainly high amounts of salts and heavy metals in the soil as reported by several investigators rusan et al 2007 khalid department of environmental sciences et al 2017 castro et al 2011 such contaminants may exert an adverse effect on the plant growth including inhibiting photosynthesis process changing the enzymatic activity diminishing the carbohydrates level and growth hormones in addition to destroying chloroplast marschner 1995 schaller 2003 hajihashemi et al 2020 in contrast irrigation with other types of treated wastewater has been proven to boost most growth and yield variables of various plants i e fresh and dry biomass leaf area index plant height number of leaves per plant and yield chiefly once used at low concentrations al zoubi et al 2008 moazzam khan et al 2009 tavassoli et al 2010 gupta et al 2015 bedbabis et al 2015 alghobar and suresha 2016 moradi et al 2016 jahan et al 2019 akhkha et al 2019 shan et al 2021 such enhanced plant preference was presumably attributed to the presence of considerable amount of organic matter and essential nutrients n p k ca s cu mn and zn in municipal wastewaters tarrason et al 2008 zavadi 2009 nath et al 2009 mousavi et al 2013 nissim et al 2015 al hadithy et al 2019 haq et al 2021 thus responses of the plant to irrigation with wastewater seem like to be specific to plant species quality of the municipal water supply nature of the waste s degree of wastewater treatment and experimental circumstances therefore proper crop cultivar selection should be considered before wastewater use kumawat et al 2001 plant tissue analysis shows the nutrient status of plants and provides a comprehensive idea about the status of soil nutrient supplies because the complexity of element reactions in soils hinders reliable diagnosis of nutrients availability to plants when based only on soil analyses olfs et al 2005 wastewater had higher concentrations of essential nutrients than fresh water although plants grown with any type of wastewater did not induce a significant escalation in n content compared with that of fresh water except for 9 reduction monitored for the industrial wastewater treatment f 3 64 df 4 45 p 0 029 table 4 however p concentration was significantly increased by up to 41 in industrial and just s wastewater treatments compared to tap water f 18 17 df 4 45 p 0 0001 though other treatments did not vary essentially from control table 4 wastewater originated from the zarqa river and wadi hassan treatment plants significantly elevated k content in plant leaf tissues in comparison with the control but was reduced by 24 for the plants grown in industrial wastewater f 27 38 df 4 45 p 0 0001 table 4 this result is in conflict with the findings of alizadeh et al 2001 tavassoli et al 2010 and haq et al 2021 who reported that reuse of treated wastewater from different origins improved significantly the macro elements contents in corn forage rice and vegetable crops respectively which was related to the present of sufficient nutrients in wastewater tunc and sahin 2015 such inadequate nutrient uptake may be partly attributed to ph and salinity of soil it is known that increasing soil ph led to a reduction in the uptake of n p and k where most plant nutrients are optimally available to plants within 6 5 7 5 ph range cruz et al 2018 bekmirzaev et al 2020 likewise the root growth is restricted by osmotic and ions toxic effects leading to a decrease in nutrient uptake and inhibition of the translocation of mineral nutrients especially k the total n in plant tissues was found to increases rapidly in response to n fertilization when plants are deficient however once n demand for growth is satisfied n concentrations increase slightly or do not increase at all rubio covarrubias et al 2009 3 4 wastewater and plant aphid interaction little attention was paid for the effect of wastewater on the plant insect interaction except for some sporadic literatures dealing with the impact of wastewater on the population growth of insects in this study the responses of faba bean as a result of exposure to wastewater and aphid infestation simultaneously are present in table 5 it is evident that the growth performance of aphid free plants irrigated with fresh water control was in general superior relative to other treatments infested plants grown with industrial and zarqa river wastewater as well as fresh water ranked in the second place exhibiting a significant reduction in fresh weight by up to 13 6 beyond the control f 46 43 df 5 54 p 0 0001 however fresh weight of the infested plants grown with just s and wadi hassan wastewater to aphid infested plants was the least about 35 inferior to the control a similar trend was observed for the dry weight but at different magnitudes table 5 control plants yielded the greatest dry weight relative to other treatments apart from that grown with zarqa river water followed by industrial wastewater f 16 17 df 5 54 p 0 0001 the dry weight was condensed by up to 30 for the infested plants irrigated with just s and zarqa river wastewater along with fresh water there were no significant differences in the leaf area between the control and infested plants that were irrigated by industrial and wadi hassan wastewater but it considerably diminished for the infested plants receiving just s and fresh water by up to 30 relative to the control f 20 77 df 5 54 p 0 0001 table 6 represents the population density of a fabae on the plants irrigated with reclaimed wastewater of different origins results indicated obviously that aphids significantly built up the greatest population on the plants irrigated with zarqa river water followed by that grown with industrial and wadi hassan wastewater f 199 25 df 4 45 p 0 0001 unpredictably the population growth of aphids was minimal on the plants receiving fresh water or just s wastewater constituting merely about half of the population created on zarqa river treatment reproductive potential of individual adult aphids is present in table 6 it is clear that irrigation with treated wastewater has a substantial influence on the average numbers of progeny produced by an individual but to different extent f 111 65 df 4 45 p 0 0001 the greatest fecundity rate was observed for aphids reared on the plants grown with wastewater from zarqa river 62 over the control while aphids kept on the plants irrigated with industrial and wadi hassan wastewater showed a moderate fecundity up to 35 over the control however the sizes of offspring were significantly reduced during the entire longevity by up to 38 5 and 49 8 for adults fed on the plants irrigated treated with wastewater from just s and wadi hassan plants respectively tiroesele et al 2013 reported that there was no obvious influence for effluent water on the reproduction of cowpea aphid aphis craccivora koch hemiptera aphididae despite the high n content in the sewage water indicating the existence of n does not always imply positive effect on aphid growth especially when other elements such as k are available at certain concentration levels though culliney et al 1986 monitored a marked reduction in survival and fecundity of green peach aphids myzus persicae sulzer hemiptera aphididae on collard plants irrigated with syracuse sludge wastewater with high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and cadmium as compared to populations on plants grown with groton sludge such reduction in aphid fitness was thought to be attributable to uptake and translocation of these chemicals from sludge by plants ultimately resulting in direct toxicity jastrow and koeppe 1980 sommers 1980 and or incidence of insect nutrients at suboptimal amount in the plant spiking the green peach aphid on bell peppers capsicum annuum solanales solanaceae with common pharmaceuticals cecs at environmentally relevant concentrations found in reclaimed wastewater displayed no discernible effects on aphid growth and survival or the key bacteria in their microbial community but plants were significantly reduced in the growth pennington et al 2018 in contrast cabbage looper trichoplusia ni hübner lepidoptera noctuidae was negatively affected by antibiotics through a plant matrix pennington et al 2017 the causative factors for the positive or negative effects of wastewater on the fecundity and population growth of aphids are extremely difficult to identify due to the complex mixture of materials and chemicals found in sludge furr et al 1976 mumma et al 1984 changes in plant metabolism may in turn affect phytophagous insects scheurer 1976 lawton and mcneill 1979 it has been reported that n correlated positively with aphid growth by increasing essential amino acids in the plant de valpine and rosenheim 2008 throop et al 2004 gash 2012 but the negative impact of k on the population growth of insect was not compatible with the results of n p and k contents in the leaf tissues found in this study 4 conclusion our results suggest that the undiluted municipal wastewater originated from industrial and just s treatment plants were as effective as fresh water in enhancing the growth of faba bean and could be re used as effective as freshwater however effluents should be subjected to a periodic control for any source of pathogens and potentially hazardous chemicals accumulated in soils and or plants in general application of reclaimed effluents significantly improved the population growth and fecundity of aphids except for just s wastewater in the face of a recognizable increase in aphid abundance on plants irrigated with most tested wastewater there was no further reduction in plant growth compared to infested plants receiving only fresh water but boosted plant performance was observed for the plants grown with industrial and zarqa river wastewater further studies are worthwhile to identify the response of faba beans and aphids to the treated wastewaters under field conditions and the magnitude of the heavy metals in plants especially in the edible grains declaration of

9905,response of faba bean to irrigation with wastewater obtained from different wastewater treatment plants along with the combined effect of wastewater and aphids on plant growth and aphid fitness were evaluated under greenhouse conditions results indicated that the ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids and macro elements were varied widely among wastewater resources and were higher than that of tap water seed germination percent did not significantly affect by wastewater but germination index was considerably influenced by some types of wastewaters plant growth was reduced by irrigation with wadi hassan wastewater and zarqa river leaf macro elements greatly varied between treatments aphid infestation reduced plant growth compared to the control plants treated with wastewater enhanced the abundance of aphids at different magnitudes while plant growth was equal and or better than that of infested control plants we conclude that the properly treated wastewater was not only as effective as fresh water in enhancing the plant growth but also mitigated the adverse consequence of high infestation level of aphids on the plant keywords aphis fabae faba bean wastewater plant growth seed germination 1 introduction water use is rising as a result of high population growth urban industrial and agricultural activities depletion of groundwater reserves together with climate change the gap between the supply and demand is reaching such alarming levels posing in some parts of the world a threat to human existence particularly in arid and semi arid regions of mediterranean basin lubello et al 2004 hamoda 2004 murray and ray 2010 therefore a long term water plan and future scenarios of water management considering both demand management and non conventional water resources mainly reclaimed wastewater should be adopted to decrease the gap between supply and request epa 2004 nash and de souza 2005 rak 2009 irrigated agriculture constitutes only 20 of the world s total arable land but the value of crop production from irrigated land is 40 of the world s total unesco 2017 the use of sewage wastewater in agriculture has a long history and is receiving renewed attention in the light of increased global water scarcity tzanakakis et al 2014 at the moment agricultural irrigation represents the highest demand for wastewater reuse in the world reaching up to 73 of the total water consumption waj 2006 treated wastewater is applied in agricultural sector and other ecosystem services without dilution or diluted with fresh water bataineh et al 2002 sakellariou makrantonaki et al 2003 banon et al 2011 bozdogan 2015 but water reuse standards vary by crop type reclaimed wastewater used for irrigation of non food crops is permitted more flexibility though it must be treated before use on food crops according to stricter requirements particularly for crops eaten uncooked al zboon and al ananzeh 2008 current estimates point out that up to 80 of vegetable production is irrigated with wastewater lai 2000 pedrero et al 2010 funmilola et al 2019 and at least 10 of the world s population consumes agricultural products initially grown with wastewater who 2006 depending on the countries in most of these cases the farmers irrigate with diluted untreated or partially treated wastewater in jordan approximately 98 6 of the total treated wastewater is utilized for irrigation while 1 4 is used for industrial activities which constitutes more than 15 of irrigation water shatanawi and shammout 2011 myszograj et al 2014 direct reuse of reclaimed wastewater is limited to the site s surrounding the existing treatment plants though the indirect reuse includes the discharge of treated effluent into surface water or groundwater aquifers legumes have been suggested as appropriate crops for the enhancement of bioproductivity and the reclamation of marginal lands because they yield good fodder protein rich seeds and enrich soil nitrogen in symbiotic association with rhizobium hungria and vargas 2000 el komy 2005 legume plants may utilize wastewater effluent and uptake heavy metal through extensive root system thus they serve as effective biological sieves inhibiting contamination of ground water sources chaudhary et al 2004 junior et al 2005 broad bean vicia faba fabales fabaceae is one of the oldest domesticated food legumes its importance in terms of food and agriculture is reflected by the occupied area worldwide 3 6 million hectares in more than 50 countries and gives a total production of 4 million tons per year mkhinini et al 2018 the body of the literature showed variable debates concerning the effect of wastewater on soil properties surface and groundwater pollution as well as microbial activities when applied for plant irrigation since the exciting outcomes are sometimes contradictory and not always useful to draw practical conclusions azbar et al 2004 dhouib et al 2005 mekki et al 2009 2012 becerra castro et al 2015 alghobar and suresha 2016 the risks of wastewater reuse in agriculture are extensive ranging from alterations in physicochemical and microbiological properties of soils ganoulis 2012 mosse et al 2012 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 to impacts on human health chiefly due to the reuse of raw or inadequately treated wastewater scott et al 2010 qadir et al 2010 bakopoulou et al 2011 other scientific works indicated that application of treated wastewater to the soil significantly boosted the soil fertility as a result of increasing amount of organic matter micro and macro elements and microbial activities peredes et al 2000 lesage meessen et al 2001 oved et al 2001 mendum and hirsch 2002 borken et al 2002 perkiomaki and fritze 2002 komilis et al 2005 in addition to the enhancement of growth and productivity of some plant species as indicated by seed germination yield components plant growth and protein and chlorophyll contents casa et al 2003 cereti et al 2004 paredes et al 2005 mekki et al 2013 divya et al 2015 however the quality of treated wastewater is not identical but depends to a great extent on the quality of the municipal water supply nature of the wastes added during use and the degree of treatment the wastewater has received pedrero et al 2010 unfortunately little attention has been paid for the interaction between plants irrigated with wastewater and phytophagous insects apart from some literatures dealing with the impact of wastewater on the population growth of insects tiroesele et al 2013 culliney et al 1986 culliney and pimentel 1986 however the combined effects of wastewater and aphids on the plant performance as well as the indirect effect of the plants grown with reclaimed wastewater on aphid fitness have not been investigated yet reduction in insect fitness may be predicted by reduced plant growth as a result of uptake and translocation of chemicals heavy metals and a wide array of organic chemicals babish et al 1981 mumma et al 1984 from the contaminated wastewater culliney et al 1986 jacobs 1981 ingestion of organic chemicals and heave metals accumulated in the plants and or reduced nutritional value of the plant changes in plant metabolism have been reported to affect phytophagous insects kennedy and booth 1959 lawton and mcneill 1979 such as increased restiveness of aphids in response to changes in sap composition harrewijn 1976 on the other hand nutrients in effluent are generally beneficial to plant growth and may influence the susceptibility to insect pests mumma et al 1984 culliney et al 1986 nutrients are vital for the growth and fitness of herbivorous insects it is evident that n has a positive effect on insect performance possibly due to increase in amino acids and decrease in the concentrations of carbon based defensive compound in the plant bala et al 2018 awmack and leatherm 2002 nevo and coll 2001 honek 1991 throop et al 2004 in the contrast increased levels of k reduced the aphid populations marwat et al 1985 myers et al 2005 as a result of enhanced secondary metabolism and declained carbohydrate accumulation ram and gupta 1988 p is an important component for population growth of phytophagous insects but higher amounts of p2o5 decrease the insect population through accumulation of phenols tannin lignin and terpenes that act as antifeedent or toxic to herbivores facknath and lalljee 2005 however identifying the causative factors responsible is usually extremely difficult due to the complex mixture of materials and chemicals found in sludge mumma et al 1984 therefore this study was performed to address the need for enhanced reuse of urban wastewater for agriculture to help conserve and expand available water supplies and contribute towards integrated management of urban water resources in arid nation where urban agriculture provides livelihood opportunities and food security the effect of irrigation with different types of reclaimed municipal wastewater was assessed in terms of the growth components and chemical contents of the faba bean plants whereas population growth fecundity rate and damage levels of aphids were used as indicators for the plant insect interaction 2 materials and methods 2 1 aphid culture and plant rearing a colony of the black bean aphid aphis fabae scopoli hemiptera aphididae was established from apterous individuals that originated from an open field in irbid district jordan aphids were reared on young broad bean plants grown in plastic pots 15 cm diameter filled with commercial potting soil the aphid culture was kept in organdy screened cages 80 60 x 60 cm in a growth room at temperatures of 25 3 c with 16 8 l d photoperiod a continuous supply of new greenhouse grown plants was provided as needed for the colony replenishment when old plants senesced due to high feeding pressure of aphids seeds of broad bean vicia faba var major variety were planted in 50 cavity plastic seedling trays 50 30 6 cm containing commercial potting soil after growing for several days in a clear greenhouse under natural light conditions at 25 3 c seedlings at the primary leaf stage were individually transplanted into larger plastic pots 15 cm diameter filled with commercial soil media plants were fertilized at weekly interval using 20 9 20 water soluble fertilizer n p k at the rate of 2 g per 1 l water and were irrigated as needed 2 2 wastewater reclaimed wastewater tested was brought from different sources secondary wastewater was collected from jordan university of science and technology s just treatment plant that treats every drop of wastewater output from campus and the university hospital in which fine suspended solids and residual organic materials remaining in the primary effluent are removed using aerobic biological treatment processes in the presence of oxygen it is designed to manage up to 2500 m3 of effluent per day a 132 000 m3 lined catchment area affectionately referred to as the duck pond water from the duck pond serves as a primary irrigation reserve for campus landscaping the second treated wastewater was obtained from wadi hassan treatment plant which received the effluents from the villages of an nuayyima shatana and kitm in which a preliminary and biological treatment extended aeration is used and tertiary treatment is provided by maturation ponds there are no specific industries that could be a significant source of pollution tertiary treatment is provided by maturation ponds treated wastewater may be chlorinated if required this wastewater treatment plant has a hydraulic load of 1140 7 m3 day water obtained from zarqa river is characterized by emergence of the effluents from industrial and samara treatment plant the samara in zarqa is the largest wastewater treatment plan in jordan that is designed to treat 364 000 m3 day of raw wastewater received from the two populated cities of greater amman and zarqa the samra wastewater treatment plant drains its effluent into the king talal dam through zarqa river which provides irrigation water for jordan valley industrial wastewater was brought from the textile factory at the prince hasan industrial city in irbid in which the effluents are treated by filtration and chemical processes without bacteriological degradation of waste tap water abstracted from groundwater wells was used as control material 2 3 germination test germination index and percentage were used to determine the effect of wastewater on seed vigor seeds of broad bean were planted in 50 cavity plastic seedling trays 50 30 0 6 cm containing commercial potting soil seeds in each tray were watered with relevant treated wastewater and fresh water as needed three seedling trays were used for each treatment germination of seeds was recorded each day for evidence of germination and continued until the germination ceased germination index was calculated as described in the association of official seed analysis using the following equation aosa 1983 germination index number of germinating seeds days of first count number of germinating seeds days of final count germination percentage an estimate of the viability of a population of seeds was calculated through dividing the number of germinated seeds on the total number of seeds ellis and roberts 1980 using the following equation germination percentage number of seed germinated total number of seeds tested x100 2 4 plant growth and plant aphid interaction to evaluate the effect of wastewater on the plant growth and plant aphid interaction plants of almost the same size were chosen when they reached the fourth true leaf stage two experiments were used in this study plants of each one was placed on benches in the greenhouse into two blocks one day prior to commencement of the experiment plants in the first experimental set were irrigated with equal amount of each type of reclaimed effluents at 3 day intervals for one month without aphid infestation in the second experimental set groups of 10 same aged late nymphal instars obtained from a synchronized colony were transferred to the upper portion of each plant using a fine moist camel hair brush aphid free plants were used as check material consequently all plants including control were covered individually with a ventilated clear plexi glass cylinder measuring 20 cm in diameter and 50 cm in height to avoid the aphid contamination between treatments and to prevent escape of aphids aphids were allowed to feed freely and produce offspring for one month and then the numbers of alive aphids per plant were counted and recorded both experimental sets were conducted in the greenhouse at 25 3 c and 14 10 h l d photoperiod 10 replicates were used for each treatment control plants in both experiments received tap water only at the end of experimental period plants in both experiments were cut just above the ground and were individually placed in plastic bags shoot fresh weight was measured in the laboratory using an electrical balance afterward plants were oven dried at 68 c for 48 h and shoot dry weight was weighed leaf area of individual plants was determined using a leaf area meter li 3000 area meter li cor inc lincoln ne dry leaves were randomly selected from five plants for each treatment finely grounded by mortar and thereafter analyzed for nitrogen phosphorous and potassium contents by using kjeldhal distilling unit kjeltec 8100 distillation tecator spectrophotometer and flame photometer respectively samples 1000 ml of each type of wastewater used in the investigation were analyzed in the laboratory for the ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and n p k contents to estimate the reproductive potential for the individual adult aphids on plants grown with wastewater from different origins plants at third true leaf stage were infested with 5 late instar nymphs attained from a synchronized colony introduced aphids were confined on the undersurface of the fully expanded third leaf using a clip on cage at the rate of one cage per plant the cages were made of a plastic petri dish 6 1 5 cm with two holes on the sides covered with fine mesh cloth for ventilation at maturity number of nymphs laid by alive adult aphids in each cage was recorded and removed at 24 h intervals until the death of all aphids 10 replicates were used for each treatment data were statistically analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova to compare the effect of each irrigation water source on plant growth characteristics and aphid reproduction the statistical analysis was performed for each parameter and the mean values were compared by using the f test and tukey s least significant differences at 5 probability level all statistical analyses were carried out using sas software version 9 2 sas 2000 to ensure that data came from a normal distribution standardized skewness and standardized kurtosis values were checked percentage values corresponding to cover value for each species were transformed by arcsine 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characteristics the chemical composition of treated wastewater used in this study is presented in table 1 it is evident that reclaimed wastewater of different resources exhibited diverse characteristics treated wastewater was generally alkaline in nature with ph values fluctuating between 7 7 and 11 03 depending on the source of wastewater the highest ph values were recorded for zarqa river 11 03 and industrial treated wastewater 10 16 while wadi hassan wastewater has the minimum 7 7 it is well known that the major effect of ec and tds on crop productivity is the inability of the plants to compete with ions present in the soil for water gupta et al 2015 all tested wastewaters has significantly greater salinity as the electrical conductivity ec values varied between 921 and 1715 μs 1 cm than fresh water 635 μs 1 cm table 1 zarqa river wastewater has the highest ec value 1715 μs 1 cm followed by wadi hassan just s and industrial wastewater respectively the tds of reclaimed wastewater appears to follow the same trend as observed for ec with the utmost value for zarqa river wastewater 1492 mg l 1 while industrial wastewater contained the lowest tds 797 mg l 1 table 1 normally ph is a routine measurement in irrigation water quality assessment that serves as an indicator for the acidity or basicity of water but is seldom a problem by itself however the normal ph range for irrigation water is from 6 5 to 8 4 while ph values outside this range are a good warning that the water is abnormal in quality fao 1992 our results indicated that the ec values for all types of treated wastewater lies in the range based on salinity classes of irrigation waters 780 2340 μs cm environment protection authority 1991 and it may be classified as medium to high saline water and thus permissible for irrigation with permeable soils and moderate leaching mahida 1981 in comparison with the standard guideline for irrigation water fao 1992 the mean tds content of treated effluents of all sources were low the tested wastewater showed considerably larger amounts of n p k than tap water where their concentration varied to some extent between treated wastewater table 1 nitrogen amount was almost equal in all wastewater ranging between 9 35 and 10 15 mg l 1 though it did not exceed 1 89 mg l 1 in fresh water however there were significant differences in p and k contents between the reclaimed wastewater wastewater collected from just s treatment plant has the uppermost p concentration 0 82 mg l but the lowest value was recorded for industrial wastewater 0 45 mg l however p was absent in fresh water treated wastewater had significantly higher concentration of k than fresh water which was more evident in treated wastewater from wadi hassan 51 49 k mg l followed by zarqa river just and industrial wastewater respectively this outcome comes to an agreement with angin et al 2005 nadav et al 2013 jahan et al 2019 akhkha et al 2019 hadji et al 2020 shan et al 2021 who concluded that treated sewage water is an important source of nutrients containing a considerable amount of n p and k however the physical and chemical properties of wastewater depend quantitatively and qualitatively on the original source of the water and the type of treatment 3 2 wastewater and seed germination seed germination traits i e cumulative germination percent gp and germination index gi have been investigated by many researchers as index for tolerance to contamination barua et al 2011 fendri et al 2013 huy and iwai 2018 gp of faba bean as affected by municipal treated wastewater from different sources is illustrated in table 2 results revealed that the gp was not significantly affected by any types of wastewater f 1 83 df 4145 p 0 15 in general irrigation with just s and zarqa river wastewater resulted in a slight decrease in gp but with no significant differences with other treatments germination index can be used as an indicator of phytotoxicity where the higher values represent a more rapid germination rate and show a better performance of germination wang et al 2004 irrigation with wadi hassan s wastewater caused the highest gi 3 14 where the lowest value 2 44 was monitored for seeds treated with just s wastewater however there were no significant differences between treatments apart from seeds watered with just s and wadi hassan wastewater f 4 46 df 4145 p 0 007 table 2 some workers investigated the effect of different wastewater types on seed germination of a variety of plants reuse of winery wastewater was reported to delay significantly the germination of different plant species although overall gp of all species was not affected mosse et al 2010 shrestha and niroula 2003 reported that the effluents from municipality sewage and dairy farming inhibited seed germination while shah udyog effluent promoted it effluent with ec less than 2250 μs cm was used successfully for irrigation of sunflowers with no adverse effect on seed germination and plant growth hussain et al 2010 zaki and shaaban 2015 which is to some extent agree with our results earlier studies indicated that the impact of wastewater on seed germination was not consistently and was dependent on the concentration of wastewater doke et al 2011 fendri et al 2013 rajesh et al 2013 2013 singh et al 2013 sinha and paul 2013 akhkha et al 2019 heidari and moradi 2019 kanwal et al 2020 irrigation with different plant effluents at lower concentration has been reported to promote seed germination of a variety of plants presumably due to presence of certain stimulatory toxicants that doesn t affect osmotic entry of water but accelerates the physiological processes of seed germination on the other hand higher concentrations exerted a negative impact on seed germination muthalagi and mala 2007 sinha and paul 2013 malaviya and sharma 2011 2016 huy and iwai 2018 such inhibitory effect of highly concentrated wastewater was attributed to the high amount of various organic and inorganic compounds including high salinity akbari et al 2007 krmz and bell 2012 rahman et al 2008 naseri et al 2012 yousofinia et al 2012 alawsy et al 2018 hadji et al 2020 haq et al 2021 in addition heavy metals chloride ion high phenolic compounds rusan et al 2015 decreased dissolved oxygen chinnusamy et al 2001 and or to absorption of higher dissolved solids have been proven to constrain seed germination singh et al 2007 3 3 wastewater and plant growth the effects of different types of treated wastewater on the growth rate of faba bean were found to be variable table 3 irrigation with reclaimed effluents originated from industrial and just s treatment plants for 30 days did not induce significant changes in the fresh and dry weights in addition to the leaf area compared to the plants treated with fresh water even with all wastewater tested contained greater concentrations of n p k than the control however plants irrigated with wastewater from zarqa river and wadi hassan treatment plants produced meaningfully less biomass f 4 25 df 4 45 p 0 006 for fresh weight f 6 35 df 4 45 p 0 0005 for dry weight and f 4 24 df 4 45 p 0 006 for leaf area than the control fresh weight was reduced by 23 5 and 12 6 for the plants receiving effluents from wadi hassan and zarqa river respectively in comparison with the control the same trend but at greater magnitude was observed for dry weight where it declined by 42 5 for wadi hassan wastewater and 37 5 for zarqa river water other than the plants irrigated with fresh water both treatments also showed up to 25 2 reduction in the leaf area when compared with control many workers have studied the influence of diverse types of treated wastewater on agronomic and physiological aspect of numerous agricultural crops but the consequences were variable results obtained by mkhinini et al 2018 showed that faba bean plants exposed to soils irrigated with treated wastewater produced significantly lesser shoots and root weight comparing to control plants irrigated with fresh water reuse of treated wastewater discharged from different sources in irrigation of a diversity of plants has been reported to have a detrimental impact on various growth parameters i e plant height root length leaf area dry matter and or yield hayet et al 2018 murillo et al 2000 hajihashemi et al 2020 however other studies showed that the source of irrigation wastewater did not significantly impact tomato yield traits gatta et al 2015 and young citrus trees rebou et al 2000 reduction in the plant growth as a result of wastewater application could be accredited to exposure to various contaminants present in treated wastewaters mainly high amounts of salts and heavy metals in the soil as reported by several investigators rusan et al 2007 khalid department of environmental sciences et al 2017 castro et al 2011 such contaminants may exert an adverse effect on the plant growth including inhibiting photosynthesis process changing the enzymatic activity diminishing the carbohydrates level and growth hormones in addition to destroying chloroplast marschner 1995 schaller 2003 hajihashemi et al 2020 in contrast irrigation with other types of treated wastewater has been proven to boost most growth and yield variables of various plants i e fresh and dry biomass leaf area index plant height number of leaves per plant and yield chiefly once used at low concentrations al zoubi et al 2008 moazzam khan et al 2009 tavassoli et al 2010 gupta et al 2015 bedbabis et al 2015 alghobar and suresha 2016 moradi et al 2016 jahan et al 2019 akhkha et al 2019 shan et al 2021 such enhanced plant preference was presumably attributed to the presence of considerable amount of organic matter and essential nutrients n p k ca s cu mn and zn in municipal wastewaters tarrason et al 2008 zavadi 2009 nath et al 2009 mousavi et al 2013 nissim et al 2015 al hadithy et al 2019 haq et al 2021 thus responses of the plant to irrigation with wastewater seem like to be specific to plant species quality of the municipal water supply nature of the waste s degree of wastewater treatment and experimental circumstances therefore proper crop cultivar selection should be considered before wastewater use kumawat et al 2001 plant tissue analysis shows the nutrient status of plants and provides a comprehensive idea about the status of soil nutrient supplies because the complexity of element reactions in soils hinders reliable diagnosis of nutrients availability to plants when based only on soil analyses olfs et al 2005 wastewater had higher concentrations of essential nutrients than fresh water although plants grown with any type of wastewater did not induce a significant escalation in n content compared with that of fresh water except for 9 reduction monitored for the industrial wastewater treatment f 3 64 df 4 45 p 0 029 table 4 however p concentration was significantly increased by up to 41 in industrial and just s wastewater treatments compared to tap water f 18 17 df 4 45 p 0 0001 though other treatments did not vary essentially from control table 4 wastewater originated from the zarqa river and wadi hassan treatment plants significantly elevated k content in plant leaf tissues in comparison with the control but was reduced by 24 for the plants grown in industrial wastewater f 27 38 df 4 45 p 0 0001 table 4 this result is in conflict with the findings of alizadeh et al 2001 tavassoli et al 2010 and haq et al 2021 who reported that reuse of treated wastewater from different origins improved significantly the macro elements contents in corn forage rice and vegetable crops respectively which was related to the present of sufficient nutrients in wastewater tunc and sahin 2015 such inadequate nutrient uptake may be partly attributed to ph and salinity of soil it is known that increasing soil ph led to a reduction in the uptake of n p and k where most plant nutrients are optimally available to plants within 6 5 7 5 ph range cruz et al 2018 bekmirzaev et al 2020 likewise the root growth is restricted by osmotic and ions toxic effects leading to a decrease in nutrient uptake and inhibition of the translocation of mineral nutrients especially k the total n in plant tissues was found to increases rapidly in response to n fertilization when plants are deficient however once n demand for growth is satisfied n concentrations increase slightly or do not increase at all rubio covarrubias et al 2009 3 4 wastewater and plant aphid interaction little attention was paid for the effect of wastewater on the plant insect interaction except for some sporadic literatures dealing with the impact of wastewater on the population growth of insects in this study the responses of faba bean as a result of exposure to wastewater and aphid infestation simultaneously are present in table 5 it is evident that the growth performance of aphid free plants irrigated with fresh water control was in general superior relative to other treatments infested plants grown with industrial and zarqa river wastewater as well as fresh water ranked in the second place exhibiting a significant reduction in fresh weight by up to 13 6 beyond the control f 46 43 df 5 54 p 0 0001 however fresh weight of the infested plants grown with just s and wadi hassan wastewater to aphid infested plants was the least about 35 inferior to the control a similar trend was observed for the dry weight but at different magnitudes table 5 control plants yielded the greatest dry weight relative to other treatments apart from that grown with zarqa river water followed by industrial wastewater f 16 17 df 5 54 p 0 0001 the dry weight was condensed by up to 30 for the infested plants irrigated with just s and zarqa river wastewater along with fresh water there were no significant differences in the leaf area between the control and infested plants that were irrigated by industrial and wadi hassan wastewater but it considerably diminished for the infested plants receiving just s and fresh water by up to 30 relative to the control f 20 77 df 5 54 p 0 0001 table 6 represents the population density of a fabae on the plants irrigated with reclaimed wastewater of different origins results indicated obviously that aphids significantly built up the greatest population on the plants irrigated with zarqa river water followed by that grown with industrial and wadi hassan wastewater f 199 25 df 4 45 p 0 0001 unpredictably the population growth of aphids was minimal on the plants receiving fresh water or just s wastewater constituting merely about half of the population created on zarqa river treatment reproductive potential of individual adult aphids is present in table 6 it is clear that irrigation with treated wastewater has a substantial influence on the average numbers of progeny produced by an individual but to different extent f 111 65 df 4 45 p 0 0001 the greatest fecundity rate was observed for aphids reared on the plants grown with wastewater from zarqa river 62 over the control while aphids kept on the plants irrigated with industrial and wadi hassan wastewater showed a moderate fecundity up to 35 over the control however the sizes of offspring were significantly reduced during the entire longevity by up to 38 5 and 49 8 for adults fed on the plants irrigated treated with wastewater from just s and wadi hassan plants respectively tiroesele et al 2013 reported that there was no obvious influence for effluent water on the reproduction of cowpea aphid aphis craccivora koch hemiptera aphididae despite the high n content in the sewage water indicating the existence of n does not always imply positive effect on aphid growth especially when other elements such as k are available at certain concentration levels though culliney et al 1986 monitored a marked reduction in survival and fecundity of green peach aphids myzus persicae sulzer hemiptera aphididae on collard plants irrigated with syracuse sludge wastewater with high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and cadmium as compared to populations on plants grown with groton sludge such reduction in aphid fitness was thought to be attributable to uptake and translocation of these chemicals from sludge by plants ultimately resulting in direct toxicity jastrow and koeppe 1980 sommers 1980 and or incidence of insect nutrients at suboptimal amount in the plant spiking the green peach aphid on bell peppers capsicum annuum solanales solanaceae with common pharmaceuticals cecs at environmentally relevant concentrations found in reclaimed wastewater displayed no discernible effects on aphid growth and survival or the key bacteria in their microbial community but plants were significantly reduced in the growth pennington et al 2018 in contrast cabbage looper trichoplusia ni hübner lepidoptera noctuidae was negatively affected by antibiotics through a plant matrix pennington et al 2017 the causative factors for the positive or negative effects of wastewater on the fecundity and population growth of aphids are extremely difficult to identify due to the complex mixture of materials and chemicals found in sludge furr et al 1976 mumma et al 1984 changes in plant metabolism may in turn affect phytophagous insects scheurer 1976 lawton and mcneill 1979 it has been reported that n correlated positively with aphid growth by increasing essential amino acids in the plant de valpine and rosenheim 2008 throop et al 2004 gash 2012 but the negative impact of k on the population growth of insect was not compatible with the results of n p and k contents in the leaf tissues found in this study 4 conclusion our results suggest that the undiluted municipal wastewater originated from industrial and just s treatment plants were as effective as fresh water in enhancing the growth of faba bean and could be re used as effective as freshwater however effluents should be subjected to a periodic control for any source of pathogens and potentially hazardous chemicals accumulated in soils and or plants in general application of reclaimed effluents significantly improved the population growth and fecundity of aphids except for just s wastewater in the face of a recognizable increase in aphid abundance on plants irrigated with most tested wastewater there was no further reduction in plant growth compared to infested plants receiving only fresh water but boosted plant performance was observed for the plants grown with industrial and zarqa river wastewater further studies are worthwhile to identify the response of faba beans and aphids to the treated wastewaters under field conditions and the magnitude of the heavy metals in plants especially in the edible grains declaration of

9906,decision support systems dss have long been used in research service provision and extension despite the diversity of technological applications in which past agricultural dss canvass there has been relatively little information on either the functional aspects of dss designed for economic decisions in irrigated cropping or the human and social factors influencing the adoption of knowledge from such dss the objectives of the study were to 1 review the functionality and target end users of economic dss for irrigated cropping systems 2 document the extent to which these dss account for and visualise uncertainty in dss outputs 3 examine tactical or strategic decisions able to be explored in dss with irrigation infrastructure being a key strategic decision and 4 explore the human and social factors influencing adoption of dss heuristics this study showed that development of previous dss has often occurred as a result of a technology push instead of end user pull which has meant that previous dss have been generated in a top down fashion rather than being demand driven by end user needs we found that few dss enable analysis of both tactical and strategic decisions and that few dss account for uncertainty in their outputs we uncover a surprising lack of documented end user feedback on economic dss for irrigated cropping such as end user satisfaction with dss functionality or future intentions to use the technology as well as a lack of dss application outside regions in which they were originally developed declining adoption of dss does not necessarily imply declining adoption of dss heuristics in fact declining dss uptake may indicate that knowledge and heuristics extended by the dss has been successful obviating the need for use of the dss per se future dss could be improved through the use of demand driven participatory approaches more aligned with user needs with more training to build human capacity including understanding uncertainty and ability to contrast tactical and strategic decisions using multiple economic environmental and social metrics graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation software scale socio economic policy adoption 1 introduction irrigated cropping systems underpin status quo food security carruthers et al 1997 schultz et al 2005 and will be increasingly important for ensuring consistent food supply in future irrigated croplands are more than twice as productive as rainfed croplands and while only 16 of global croplands are irrigated irrigated crops comprise around 36 of the global harvest per year however the extent to which irrigation is employed in any agricultural system is a function of manifold biophysical economic environmental and social factors biophysical factors include crop type crop water use efficiency enterprise mix alcock et al 2015 bell et al 2015 harrison et al 2012b 2012d koech and langat 2018 physical factors may include water allocation availability irrigation infrastructure and effects of climate change bell et al 2015 2013 harrison et al 2017 koech and langat 2018 economic factors include capital outlay costs and commodity prices bjornlund et al 2007 environmental factors may include anaerobic effects caused by waterlogging risk of salinity beltrán 1999 lazaridou et al 2019 and social factors may include management aspirations peer and family values succession plans amongst others bjornlund et al 2007 bond 1998 caswell 1991 christie et al 2018 given this complexity decision makers are faced with multiple concurrent factors to consider when deciding when irrigation should be used if at all decision support systems dss have historically evolved to help users navigate and systematically disentangle some of the aforementioned issues appropriately contextualised dss can be used to extricate the effects of irrigation on social economic and environmental indicators through extension service provision or participatory research mccown 2002 early research defines dss as computerised sources of knowledge expertise and experience providing accessible information to decision makers colomb 1987 unlike traditional techniques in operations research and optimisation dss rely on the judgement of the designer from problem formulation to choosing relevant data to selecting approaches to be used in generating solutions rausser and yassour 1978 around four decades later our modern definitions have changed little from those proposed in the 1970s with rinaldi and he 2014b defining dss as interactive software based systems to help decision makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data documents and personal knowledge to identify and solve problems and to optimise decisions olsson and andersson 2006 van meensel et al 2012 the application of and need for agricultural dss in irrigated agriculture has increased substantially since the 1990s for different reasons around the globe in developed countries the use of dss in agriculture by water management authorities has increased to help balance water use between the field and district levels agricultural dss can also be used by decision makers to more effectively manage the allocation of irrigation water to enhance crop or pasture water use efficiency and minimise environmental pollution while improving nutrient use efficiencies christie et al 2020 ho et al 2013 rinaldi and he 2014a at the farm level dss have been promulgated for multiple tactical and strategic decisions outlined further below including contrasting of options for increasing productivity better allocation of resources climate change adaptation and for avoiding food waste chang fung martel et al 2017 ibrahim et al 2018 phelan et al 2015 2018 zhai et al 2020 regional variation in the need for and use of agricultural dss is explored in detail in the body of this review temporal farm management decisions may be tactical weekly or strategic over several years tactical decisions concerning irrigated cropping may include whether or not to apply water or fertiliser repayment of debts or purchasing of operational supplies strategic decisions include enterprise choices and purchasing of machinery or irrigation infrastructure temporal decisions operate on a continuum from operational to strategic with tactical and operational decisions being made in support of an overarching strategic vision an appropriately designed dss should facilitate decision making at either tactical or strategic scales helping transpose decisions from reactive to proactive chang fung martel et al 2017 phelan et al 2018 a key purpose of the present paper was to review the extent to which previous dss operate on tactical or strategic bases because ultimately the combination of both short and long term decisions contribute towards generation of economic wealth there are fewer agricultural dss designed for strategic decision making rinaldi and he 2014c even though strategic decisions may have greater impact on wealth compared with tactical decisions more than two decades ago silva et al 2001a developed a dss to improve strategic planning and management of large irrigation schemes in the alentejo region of portugal the dss allowed contrasting of crop types and systems integrating socio economic and biophysical data at the field level to analyse how a given irrigation scheme may be adopted by farmers more recently khan et al 2009 developed waterworks a dss designed to facilitate tactical and strategic irrigation decisions at the farm level to improve economic and water use efficiencies of farm businesses a key strategic decision is the type of irrigation machinery and infrastructure to be purchased investment in irrigation infrastructure can represent a significant capital outlay that may be irreversible once new irrigation infrastructure is in situ this can result in inflexible production systems that are unable to respond to future water scarcity increasing investment risk by over six fold depending on the severity of drought adamson and loch 2014 despite the potential impact of irrigation infrastructure on economic outcomes few dss appear to permit contrasting of economic factors associated with irrigation infrastructure many dss output produce values that have no variability e g the profitability associated with a management intervention may be shown as a mean value but the range standard deviation or variability associated with the mean is not shown this variability is known as uncertainty outputs from any dss or model carry implicit uncertainty associated with either 1 lack of knowledge or data used to build a dss hardaker et al 2015 2004 pembleton et al 2016 2 uncertainty in model inputs or internal parameters harrison et al 2014 2012c 2012d or 3 uncertainty in model algorithms and equations harrison et al 2019 uncertainty can be visualised through appropriate statistical measures that show ranges or statistical distributions of dss inputs or outputs harrison et al 2017 ho et al 2014 kandulu et al 2012 monjardino et al 2015 despite the variety of methods with which uncertainty can be displayed graphically e g ho et al 2014 harrison et al 2016b the extent to which risk and risk metrics can be usefully interpreted by dss users is not well known there is also evidence to suggest that end users often have little understanding of uncertainty implicit to dss outputs or how uncertainty may affect their management decisions harrison et al 2016a mowrer 2000 the extent to which dss outputs are adopted is rarely measured and anecdotally at least is often considered to be limited bell et al 2015 harrison et al 2012a inman bamber et al 2007 mccown 2001 previous research on irrigation dss has often focused on technology aspects but has not generally assessed how socio economic aspects influence adoption pannell et al 2006 describe the challenges of measuring these adoption related attributes even if resources were available to conduct surveys of end users such assessments tend to rely on indirect measurement through expert opinion in most technical evaluations there has been little consideration of the attributes of agricultural communities and households that support or hinder adoption in contrast to the bulk of work on the characteristics of farm households pannell et al 2006 indicate that innovations are more likely to be adopted when they have a high relative advantage and when they are readily trailable to address this knowledge gap the review discuss how economic social and cultural factors influence application and adoption of irrigation dss and dss knowledge and illustrate pathways in which these factors should be considered in future dss development in this review we focus on economic dss for agriculture that have graphical user interfaces guis that can be used to compare scenarios for tactical and or strategic purposes we examine the drivers of adoption of past agricultural dss and dss outputs knowledge discussing pathways to ensure economic dss are relevant and contain actionable information for farm irrigation management specifically the aims of this paper were to 1 review the functionality and intended end users of previous and extant economic dss for irrigated cropping systems 2 document the extent to which these dss account for and visualise uncertainty in dss outputs 3 examine tactical and strategic decisions that are able to be explored in dss with investment decisions in irrigation infrastructure being a key strategic decision and 4 explore the human and social factors influencing adoption of dss heuristics 2 methods in this review we apply the following criteria to select economic dss for inclusion 1 the dss includes a gui in a form of web based software tool or as an app not mathematical models in isolation or dss without guis which are flexible to operate utilize by the end users 2 the dss includes output variables of either yield water use or both and 3 the dss allows contrasting of resources allocation and management across the whole farm we define end users as people who use dss heuristics to action decisions where a heuristic is the development of a problem solving process that allows a short term approximation to a problem by way of example a dss heuristic could be gained by a farmer who uses trial and error processes to learn how a crop responds to a given seasonal climate outlook once the farmer has gleaned an appropriate mental model rom using the dss she he may thus decide to jettison future use of the dss we define next users as people who use dss and dss heuristics to provide advice to others but do not ultimately action decisions themselves e g a farm advisor agronomist or consultant may use the outputs from a dss to provide information to a farmer see table 1 decision time frames considered in this review include seasonal annual or long term 5 20 years hereafter economic decisions relating to seasonal annual time frames are referred to as tactical e g crop sowing choices and decision making relating to longer term multi year time frames are referred to as strategic e g decisions relating to irrigation infrastructure climate change and transformational adaptation for longer term farm profitability following these guides dss designed for daily or real time irrigation decisions including irrigation scheduling precision irrigation or geographic information systems gis were considered out of scope instead our primary objective was to review economic dss that analyse farm systems on tactical or strategic bases e g dss designed to compute the economically optimal the proportion of farm productivity derived from irrigation the review was conducted and structured as follows 1 literature search based on the search criteria process outlined in fig 1 fourteen economic irrigation dss were selected from the literature table 1 section 2 2 extract information from selected dss each dss was analysed in the context of our aims including intended application and decision analysis tactical and strategic economic decisions including presence or absence of irrigation infrastructure type of end user type of interface biophysical and or environmental metrics e g yield water use and water productivity economic metrics e g ml ha and ability to quantify uncertainty section 3 3 evaluate drivers of adoption of agricultural dss and dss heuristics and identify pathways for increasing the adoption of beneficial knowledge provided by economic dss section 4 4 conclusions summarise the major challenges typical decisions made outline criteria that would make dss more useful for decision makers and identify opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of extension processes that use dss section 5 the description of dss in section 3 is designed to facilitate insights into technology deficits related to dss functionality e g tactical and strategic decision making uncertainty in outputs etc whereas section 4 is designed to address human and social factors related to end user knowledge derived from dss including the attributes of dss that influence adoptability 3 economic dss for irrigated agricultural systems 3 1 overview of dss functionality dss shown in table 1 facilitate tactical and strategic economic decisions considering the influence of climate on economic and risk outcomes labour requirements benchmarking economic performance selection and design of irrigation systems irrigation management and investment assessment target end users include farmers irrigation managers intermediaries i e consultants extensionists advisors and agronomists and policymakers table 1 these dss contained graphical user interfaces facilitating scenario comparison and use without coding christie et al 2020 pembleton et al 2016 tapsuwan et al 2015 watkiss et al 2015 with software varying from web based tools to apps and spreadsheets many dss have been developed and tested as case studies trl level 2 in table 1 but perpetuation of dss into the long term appears to be a problem that most developers and scientists still grapple with e g dss evim and dssipm were developed for research purposes and were not maintained this example has been repeated historically ad nauseum across regions dss have been developed for many different reasons most dss aim to help users identify more profitable irrigation regimes e g ahp dssir domis cotton webapp dss evim some have been developed for comparison of alternative farming systems and or cropping diversity feat irrigation optimiser dssipm or water productivity and use efficiency sirmod irrigation optimiser while fewer have been developed for comparison of the profitability associated with adapting irrigation infrastructure waterworks what if sadreg the majority of dss facilitate comparisons of multiple crop types which adds versatility and presumably utility to a broader range of end users though some focus only on one crop type e g cotton webapp feat most dss have been designed for use by farmers advisors and service providers at the farm scale fewer dss have been designed to facilitate decision making at the regional and catchment scale with exceptions of domis dssir dssipm what if and dss evim perhaps the most stark conclusion from table 1 is that most dss have been developed and applied only locally and are not available publicly in the latter case potential users need to contact developers to gain access to the dss of interest localised development of dss suggests that developers may prefer to construct new decision support tools rather than adapt or share previous dss such lack of transfer between regions may be due to multiple reasons such as inability to access and modify source code protection of commercial intellectual property inadequate functionality of the existing dss improper complexity suitability or even a simple lack of research into existing dss at the outset this is key area in which future dss developers could significantly improve upon the use and adaptation of existing dss would be expected to facilitate collaboration lead to greater support and maintenance of dss improve understanding of diverse agroecological and socio economic systems and ultimately improve impact adoption of dss knowledge in the environments in which they operate more extensive sharing increased public availability and advertising of dss either commercially or free of charge would be also expected to improve awareness and uptake 3 2 tactical decisions tactical dss are designed for shorter term seasonal economic decisions for instance waterworks was developed to provide seasonal irrigation management decisions in waterworks fig 2 simulation and optimisation modules were considered at the farm level in australia khan et al 2009 waterworks is designed to help users evaluate water productivity economic efficiency and environmental performance for pivot drip and surface irrigation systems to increase crop yield and profit for a farm business inputs include crops cropped area soil type source of water surface or groundwater water trading existing and proposed irrigation layouts the main output of the dss is optimised profitability at the whole farm level seasonal water allocation overall crop water use efficiency water trading price crop price and crop yield while waterworks was built using participatory approaches with end users trialling ease of use flexibility and user friendliness khan et al 2009 there appears to be little documentation of user feedback on quality criteria of the dss such as information semantic success system technical success or service quality use and effectiveness success this observation suggests a need for further documentation of user feedback on both satisfaction and further intentions to use this dss the dss sirmod simulates the hydraulics of surface irrigation border furrow and basin at the field level and evaluates the economic implications of alternative field layouts including differences due to topography field size and length walker 1993 1998 sirmod helps users understand economically viable management practices such as seasonal water application and optimisation of surface irrigation wu et al 2017 zheng et al 2009a 2009b the dss allows comparison of alternative seasonal surface irrigation design and management practices to irrigators and other decision makers abbasi et al 2003 hornbuckle et al 1999 raine and walker 1998 hornbuckle et al 2005 indicate that 1 the ease of data entry into the dss 2 type of platform pc vs mobile device 3 designing the dss to better meet end user needs and 4 cost benefit ratio as a result of using sirmod are key observations regarding potential uptake of the dss despite the widespread use of this dss there appears to be little documentation of user uptake learning or feedback on sirmod 3 3 strategic decisions strategic dss facilitate insight into long term economic decisions such as adoption of a whole farm plan for an irrigation system or development of a plan to establish irrigation infrastructure montagu et al 2006 while many approaches have been used in the literature to assist decisions on managing water resources the multi criteria analysis mca or multi criteria decision analysis mcda are popular in comparing irrigation strategies with respect to long term economic value mca and mcda approaches evaluate trade offs between the successes of alternative irrigation systems and their impacts on the process of decision making hajkowicz and collins 2007 karleuša et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 the analytical hierarchy process ahp uses mca to support strategic economic decisions at the farm level the ahp was conceived in response to top down transfer of technology in which experts e g scientists perceived farmer problems and proposed solutions for these problems karami 2006 but without first consulting farmers as the end users as might be predicted such top down approaches often lead to poor adoption outcomes through a participatory process using ahp in the dss expert choice the end user participants in the study of karami 2006 agreed that the decision hierarchy should be 1 comprehensive 2 relevant to extension programs for diffusion of irrigation methods and 3 include both technical and socio economic factors in using expert choice with four distinct groups of irrigation farmers karami 2006 clearly showed how ahp can help end users better understand the characteristics of alternative irrigation systems but also identify the broader socio economic factors contributing to farmer decisions underpinning whether or not to adopt a specific type of irrigation dssipm helps users assess cultivation options for irrigated agricultural systems and to identify constraints impacting crop choice and crop yields silva et al 2001a while outcomes from the work of silva et al 2001b provide insights into the relative value of crop irrigation dssipm was not designed to compare different irrigation systems a similar mca approach was used in the development of sadreg which supports strategic decisions to design and select surface irrigation systems through comparison of alternative attributes yield cost of investment operation and maintenance run off land levelling soil erosion goncalves et al 2007 1998b 1998a goncalves and pereira 2009 sadreg has been previously used to understand the context of water saving in relation to farm economics in northeast syria darouich et al 2012 along with comparing surface irrigation with sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation darouich et al 2017 2014 el gafy and el ganzori 2012 used dss evim to produce economic maps at the regional level in egypt for different crops to support strategic economic decisions on cropping patterns to maximise the value of irrigation water but does not include irrigation infrastructure in contrast domis estimates the cost of irrigation systems i e drip irrigation sprinkler and micro sprinkler for different crops domis evaluates the economic feasibility of these systems considering the location soil groundwater irrigation equipment crop information the regional profile of a given region accounting for water quality rainfall wind speed solar energy source of irrigation and agricultural land use despite its widespread use in india and current availability online patel et al 2018 we find little evidence in the little of user feedback or evaluation on the system service or information quality of this dss while dss are often used to make strategic economic decisions at the farm and regional levels langworthy et al 2018 few catchment scale dss account for irrigation infrastructure economic indicators associated with water infrastructure and policies in the water energy food climate nexus were considered in the what if dss for the zambezi river basin in africa payet burin et al 2019 this dss centres on large scale irrigation management strategic plans including irrigation infrastructure development agriculture production farming zone crop choices irrigation and yield crop and energy markets similar to what if dssir was designed to help users understand environmental economic and social interdependencies of irrigated agriculture at the catchment scale including employment subsidies gross domestic product and environmental pollution bazzani 2005a irrigation systems in dssir comprise fixed and site specific irrigation layout furrows and drip and mobile layouts sprinklers and self moving guns to understand water yield functions and rotations because most catchment level dss have been designed for analyses of irrigation investment at a large scale outcomes do not consider tactical decisions such as crop management and are thus not comparable with other tactical dss these findings underscore the need for consistent output metrics in dss spanning multiple disciplines social economic and environmental and ability to examine both tactical and strategic decisions of the dss analysed only five ahp dsirr what if waterworks e water include uncertainty in output variables this may be because 1 uncertainty in dss outputs is often not intuitive to users 2 variability associated with climatic economic factors implicit parameter uncertainty and error propagation can be difficult to quantify harrison et al 2019 or 3 developers do not consider uncertainty as a high priority dss output we suggest that uncertainty in dss outputs is a feature that should be given more consideration in future work particularly in dss that include climatic or market volatility assuming that an irrigation dss has been designed to be compatible with users sociocultural values and their need for innovation including uncertainty in output variables would allow more informed assessments of the relative advantage of proceeding with dss based decisions 3 4 irrigation infrastructure in general few of the dss reviewed accounted for irrigation infrastructure although waterworks and sadreg are notable exceptions khan et al 2009 use waterworks to compare yields of several crops under alternative irrigation systems table 2 in a case study of the feasibility of drip or pivot irrigation investment table 3 khan et al 2009 show that the capital cost of pivot irrigation ranges between au 2771 and au 3750 ha while variable costs depended on the size of the pivot irrigators and crop type seasonal conditions soil types and groundwater level the case study documented a scenario for maize grown over 40 ha where shifting from surface to pivot irrigation increased yield by 0 5 t ha gross margin by aud 115 ha water use efficiency by 0 22 t ml and reduced water use for irrigation by 0 65 ml ha table 2 in general pivot irrigation led to higher gross margins associated with higher yields and water productivity resulting in improved economic returns per unit irrigation water ml this result was consistent for grapes maize soybeans and wheat suggesting that pivot irrigation systems would be a more profitable investment that surface irrigation in this context a limited number of studies have examined the agronomic and economic effects of irrigation infrastructure darouich et al 2014 used sadreg and mca and found an 11 reduction in cotton yield in surface and drip irrigation systems when comparing deficit irrigation with full irrigation the same authors later compared border check and sprinkler systems and found that wheat yields for border check and sprinkler irrigation systems were 4511 kg ha and 5200 kg ha respectively suggesting that flood based systems had lower water use efficiencies darouich et al 2017 maraseni et al 2012 examined a range of irrigation systems in southern queensland australia and showed that while irrigation efficiency was similar across irrigation systems there was large variability in capital investment labour water savings and nitrogen input across infrastructure systems table 4 the highest capital cost was that associated with changing from sprinkler hand shift to drip sprinkler roll line 5000 ha but this change in infrastructure also increased yield by 18 reduced labour by 40 and saved 2 ml ha in irrigation rollin and scott 2018 compared irrigation infrastructure for rice cotton and maize in southern nsw and northern victoria and showed that marginal rates of return varied due to depending on level of capital investment table 5 for instance changes in irrigation system from the contour system to terrace bankless resulted in higher cropping intensity and reduced water use but received the lowest return 14 on capital invested while these findings are useful future work must go further and compare the biophysical yield water use etc and economic cost profitability etc associated with irrigation infrastructure systems across environments and production systems ie crops able to be grown based on enterprise mix these findings would facilitate improved development of future dss e g water use efficiency parameters associated with different irrigation infrastructure as well as end user understanding of the most appropriate infrastructure accounting for their farming system climate type and future management aspirations table 5 3 5 transparency in presenting uncertainty in dss outputs previous work has shown that end users of dss often have little understanding of uncertainty mowrer 2000 uncertainty in dss can be broadly classified into six categories 1 inherent randomness in initial conditions 2 measurement error 3 systematic error e g due to a bias in sampling 4 natural variation biological systems may vary in time and space 5 model uncertainty and 6 selective judgment uncertainty due to different interpretations of the data uusitalo et al 2015 model uncertainty comprises dss structure and dss internal parameters these factors are not independent because there is a trade off between increasing complexity improved model structure and increasing parameter error harrison et al 2019 passioura 1996 reynolds and acock 1985 probability theory inter or intra year climatic variability may also be used to quantify uncertainty harrison et al 2017 2016b 2012b dss that account for economic scenarios ideally should also account for uncertainty and risks alcock et al 2015 uusitalo et al 2015 as this supports more informed user assessments of relative advantage and perceived superiority of alternative innovations dss considered here table 1 show limited scope in accounting for risk and or uncertainty only five dss of those reviewed here quantify uncertainty uusitalo et al 2015 suggest that evaluating uncertainty depends on the amount and quality of available information scale of application and the purpose of the dss many economic dss are deterministic wherein outputs are derived from a single computation such that no uncertainty is embodied in dss outputs ho et al 2014 watkiss et al 2015 in these cases uncertainty could be shown by running multiple input values e g market prices or costs through a dss to produce a distribution of outputs this process is applied in dssir such that outputs in the dss are presented as both means and associated variability e g the range of irrigation water to be applied and the variability in water supply associated with climatic variability however the development of uncertainty metrics in dss involves considerable technical complexity e g adequate mathematical accounting of error propagation or the development of datasets that reasonably account for social environmental and economic variability implicit to dss datasets these reasons may explain why many contemporary dss do not account for uncertainty as well visualisation of risk in dss outputs if often not intuitive to the layperson and large variability in outputs of some dss may result in a loss of trust in the software by some users similar to other functional aspects of dss quantification of uncertainty must be considered in the design phase and should be iteratively refined throughout the development and adoption phases in line with end user feedback such refinement should be conducted using multi disciplinary participatory approach that involves input from not only next and end users but also software developers scientists and other stakeholders throughout the life of the dss this process would be expected to increase the adoptability of the dss heuristics by ensuring the aspirations and capacities of users and their communities are addressed and that the dss is compatible with users sociocultural values including their need for innovation to move forwards uncertainty metrics in future dss may be developed with participatory approaches and either 1 expert judgment 2 model emulation i e a statistical representation low order simplification of model outputs 3 sensitivity analysis e g via parameter perturbation 4 temporal or spatial variability in model outputs 5 use of multiple models 6 use of multiple initial conditions and or 7 probabilistic approaches which may be conducted by rerunning a model with multiple sets of driving variables e g climates soil types if the addition of uncertainty metrics to a dss interface results in excessive variability that prevents a meaningful decision being made then the addition of uncertainty will have served its purpose such cases would mean that the variability associated with a given value or treatment is so high that it is not significantly different from another treatment without showing uncertainty end users have no way of knowing if the difference between any two treatments is real or significant having the ability to distinguish between treatments is another key reason future dss developers should consider implementing measures of uncertainty in as outputs of dss 3 6 summary of functional aspects of previous and extant dss economic dss have been developed for multiple purposes from comparisons of investment decisions in irrigation infrastructure to analyses of agronomic effects on farm profit or costs to strategies for increasing water use efficiency or water productivity table 1 it is worth noting that the extent to which an intervention causes change very much depends on the initial conditions for example a crop is unlikely to respond to irrigation if the soil moisture profile is already full thus consideration of baseline conditions in any dss is important we found that many economic dss have been developed with site specific foci using case studies for validation and that only one dss sirmod has been actively tested and applied in multiple regions this observation suggests that previous dss have had limited transferability across environments such lack of transferability of dss across regions may be due to many reasons such as inappropriate dss functionality lack of extension training support or lack or research awareness raising by previous dss developers ongoing development and structural or software maintenance issues appear to be a key issue we showed that many past dss are no longer extant or in operation because the continued use of dss outputs in research policy and industry is critical to impact increased profitability and sustainability the following section examines adoption of previous dss knowledge and outlines pathways for increasing adoption of future dss heuristics in the following section we broaden our scope to all dss in agriculture since we examine the multitude of factors influencing the extension adoption and impact of dss in agriculture in general we first cover the problem of implementation then discuss factors influencing adoption and finally end with a discussion on participatory approaches 4 adoption and impact of dss in irrigated agriculture 4 1 the problem of implementation there are many benefits of dss for farmers and extension providers some of these benefits include confirmation or rebuttal of intuitive knowledge improved awareness of direct and external issues impacting a given outcome reduced uncertainty improved ability to contrast multiple scenarios and utilise large datasets and proven science to make more informed decisions and or the use of dss as proxies for conveying and understanding knowledge as part of extension frameworks despite this many studies have shown that current agricultural dss are not well adopted by farmers this is termed the problem of implementation eastwood et al 2012 leeuwis 2013 lindblom et al 2013 mackrell et al 2009 matthews et al 2008 mccown 2002 rossi et al 2014 van meensel et al 2012 evaluating the number of users mode and extent of use and benefits to users has not historically been included in dss research kerr 2004 mccown 2001 rinaldi and he 2014c indeed many publications relating to irrigation dss may infer the future relevance and benefits for end users of the system based on its characteristics but research rarely extends to evaluating adoption once if the dss becomes publicly available an approach to examining adoption of irrigation dss was carried out across 12 irrigation districts in alberta canada wang et al 2015 while 67 of the 199 participating farmers had adopted improved use of irrigation the majority involved physical tools and observation the use of a hand auger to dig up soil and direct assessment of the appearance and feel of soil moisture to guide their decision making applying dss related methods to support irrigation decision making was near to or less than 1 for both adoption and level of intensity i e the percentage of total irrigated area on which it was used wang et al 2015 these findings highlight some of the key attributes of dss compared with some physical on farm practices that influence adoptability the increased complexity and reduced trialability of the dss related methods viz phelan et al 2018 in this instance reducing implementation compared with physical tools and observation a range of agricultural dss have targeted the interface between farm management theory and actual practice mccown 2001 payne et al 2016 provide useful guidelines on the extent of support required for users to adopt different technologies recognising the important role that human and social capital play in the process of adoption technologies that implement a technology push or top down strategies tend to address simple cause and effect problems provide readily experienced and observable benefits are highly compatible with current practices and are relatively easy for farmers to implement independently some agricultural dss in this category are relatively simple tools developed to assist farmers tactical decisions mccown 2002 stone and hochman 2004 a shortfall of these simple tools is that as users learn more about a situation they may desire greater flexibility than the tool allows namely the opportunity to reduce decision uncertainty further and assess relative advantage to a greater extent by exploring different scenarios rose et al 2016 upon reaching the point at which the outputs and heuristics become readily predictable users may discontinue use of such tools even though they continue using the heuristics gained although somewhat intractable future dss research would benefit from documenting adoption of dss heuristics rather than dss per se at the other end of the spectrum payne et al 2016 describe the high level of co learning required to develop and extend technologies that address complex problems and do not generally bring about rapid results strategic irrigation dss designed to provide integrated recommendations for systems management fall within this high complexity category and are often associated with low levels of implementation stevens 2007 describes the ineffective scientific framework and linear knowledge pathways often used to convey information to farmers about irrigation decision making instead of the deeper learning based approach required to support practice change a key reason for limited adoption by farmers is that many dss have been created by scientists and software developers purely from a supply rather than a demand perspective lindblom et al 2013 in such cases development has proceeded as a result of technology push instead of end user pull to help solve a problem or improve a practice significant shortcomings of current agricultural dss are a consequence of a lack of understanding of farmers needs and decision making in practice a lack of compatibility mccown 2001 and mackrell et al 2009 explain dss have traditionally promulgated empirical positivist paradigms with an underlying belief that the role of a dss is to provide information to improve or even replace farmer decision making yet farmer decision making is a tacit and heuristic process and there is a disconnect between the farm management theory that forms the basis of modelled relationships and actual farm management in practice eastwood et al 2012 when agricultural dss are designed to provide recommendations for systems management and intended to act as proxies for a farmers decision making process low adoption has been partly attributed to the resistance of farmers to give up their own decision making processes mccown 2002 farmers decision making processes associated with adoption are influenced by a wide range of social factors vanclay 1992 more innovative dss development approaches take a less technical and analytical paradigm acknowledging the importance of the social and individual views in farmer decision making vanclay 1992 highlighted that along with attributes of the technology itself alignment of the technology with user aspirations i e goals values beliefs personality culture motivation and capacity human social natural physical financial influence the extent of adoption rose et al 2016 report fifteen factors influencing uptake and use of several agricultural dss in the united kingdom following semi structured interviews with farmers and advisors and these included characteristics of the technology end users and compliance landscape such as performance ease of use trust relevance to the user level of marketing it education and farmer age fig 4 similar factors have also been identified and discussed to varying extents in other publications alvarez and nuthall 2006 cox 1996 kerr 2004 tapsuwan et al 2015 van meensel et al 2012 4 2 drivers of adoption 4 2 1 technology the attributes of the technology itself relative advantage compatibility complexity trialability observability rogers 1 are key factors that can be used to evaluate potential adoption pathways for existing irrigation dss and to intentionally address in the development of future dss van meensel et al 2012 summarised the success factors of agricultural dss and the influential characteristics of the technology reflected the importance of compatibility flexibility perceived usefulness credibility and trialability ease of use see also rose et al 2016 dss flexibility is the opportunity for end users to compare different scenarios and adapt the system to farm specific situations and this also allows assessment of the relative advantage of proceeding with dss based decisions relative advantage is also relevant for the initial decisions relating to investing in or using an irrigation dss olivier and singels 2004 listed uncertainty about actual benefits of investing in and using agricultural dss for irrigation scheduling mccown 2002 p 195 explains that farmers cease to care about even credible tools when they cannot see sufficient practical value for action resulting from the output taking into consideration the costs including managerial time and attention it is not uncommon for farmers to cease using a technology if they are able to learn and then apply the associated principles heuristically and this mode of use can be viewed as successful adoption mccown 2002 there are also cases in which agricultural dss shift from being used as goal orientated tools towards learning aids schlindwein et al 2015 the web based domis dss is reported to aid farmer decision making around the design and cost of micro irrigation systems by providing different scenarios to consider and prioritise patel et al 2018 flexibility has been incorporated into the dss design so that different levels of data can be entered depending on user knowledge with the reduced complexity allowing it to be used without the aid of professional knowledge of agricultural engineering and micro irrigation system design while an evaluation of adoption of domis has not been published patel et al 2018 p 2247 state that this dss is considered to be useful to farmers industry researchers and policy makers in agriculture and allied sectors in india a challenge for dss that provide flexibility and credible representation of complex farming systems is ease of use kerr 2004 explains that many dss are not implemented in small owner operated farming systems because they are too complex requiring users to understand unfamiliar language and variables for basic input for which they may not have the associated data and possess existing knowledge and skills for irrigation dss scientific complexity of the system and high requirements of inputs and parameters have limited adoption inman bamber et al 2007 olivier and singels 2004 in a review of dss to manage irrigation in agriculture rinaldi and he 2014c suggest that it is necessary to achieve a middle ground between simplicity in farmer use to encourage adoption and scientific complexity in the dss to maintain rigour to encourage initial and continued implementation dss must also be easily maintained with the capacity to be adapted with new information an important yet challenging consideration for dss funders and stakeholders rossi et al 2014 dss developers and funders must therefore consider alternative pathways to market after the build of the tool dss are generally constructed for a purpose but their longevity must also be planned for to prevent outdated software and dss redundancy the tactical irrigation optimizer and strategic dssipm and dss evim are examples of economic irrigation dss that are not available for use due to ceased development table 1 they are among many dss that have showed promise or been successful for a period only to be discarded when their creators have ceased maintenance of the software licencing and training manuals or technology and science have advanced but the data within the tool have been superseded e g dss tools containing now defunct global climate model data such as the sres emissions scenarios 4 2 2 end users when the attributes of the dss has been tailored to favour adoption the most likely users are the innovator and early adopter farmer segments mccown 2002 tapsuwan et al 2015 innovators are at the forefront of change and enjoy the process of trialling new practices often without facilitated support howden et al 1998 rogers 1995 they focus on continually improving their farm with confident decision making often based on science and data turner et al 2017 found that innovator australian farmers displayed strong economic and business orientations and were more likely than other segments to participate in benchmarking and other recordkeeping activities that align with the measuring and monitoring approach of dss early adopters take a proactive stance to change and are mostly viewed with respect by their industry peers when successfully implementing new practices rogers 1995 however mccown 2002 warns against the assumption that adoption of agricultural dss by innovators and early adopters termed visionaries will lead to adoption by the early majority rogers 1995 the early majority are more pragmatic in their decision making less open to innovation and change and do not relate to the experience of the visionaries interviews with 30 irrigators in georgia usa in relation to adoption of irrigator pro revealed that on farm contact and demonstrations would be needed to build the human and social capital required to support wider uptake rather than relying on diffusion from innovators to other farmer segments morrison 2009 mccown 2002 p 204 suggests that initial users of agricultural dss are visionary farmers and the dss fails to cross the chasm to be used by the pragmatists by not crossing an effort fails to achieve the critical market size that would retain funding and or agency political support this is the significance of the chasm only about 15 of potential customers are comprised of visionaries on the left side of the chasm the left tail of the bell curve studies on farmer characteristics that influence adoption of dss provide insights into the inter related social factors associated with farmers approaches to decision making alvarez and nuthall 2006 rose et al 2016 alvarez and nuthall 2006 investigated adoption in the context of new zealand and uruguay dairy farming and identified a suite of aspirations and human and social capacity farmer goals personality education skills current information processes learning style and business size as influential factors fig 4 highlights the complexity of relationships between some of these factors in the united kingdom context rose et al 2016 and the reality that in different contexts e g cultures farming systems stages of community development landscapes the relative influence of these factors changes the adoption and diffusion outcome prediction tool adopt kuehne et al 2017 can be used to estimate peak adoption rates of any agricultural technology and times to peak adoption james and harrison 2016 used adopt to examine a range of livestock greenhouse gas abatement techniques and predicted adoption rates from 34 to 95 and times to peak adoption of 3 9 14 9 years while farmers can be end users of the dss ahp sirmod waterworks e water and feat the remaining dss reviewed in this paper are targeted at next users including intermediaries such as farmer advisors and policy makers targeting intermediaries i e consultants extensionists advisors and agronomists may therefore help bridge the chasm and increase adoption rates of agricultural dss design and development processes can be tailored accordingly if the goal is to create a dss that will act as an adaptable simulator for an intermediary most likely a consultant in these interactions mccown 2002 van meensel et al 2012 explains that intermediaries i e next users can facilitate dialogue between farmers and agricultural dss and the exchange of ideas about management practices that are relevant to the farmers indeed given the need for advisors to contrast multiple scenarios across perhaps multiple farms it could be expected that farm advisors tent to be more receptive to dss than the majority of farmers a worthwhile avenue for future research would be the impact gained by conducting participatory work with advisors as an intermediary to farmers versus the impact gained by working with farmers themselves here again we return to our earlier sentiment that practice change primarily occurs when end users learn and apply heuristics these heuristics could be gained through direct interaction with a dss or via an intermediary that passes down the heuristics advisory support is particularly important where irrigation dss are developed to investigate future production potential in large irrigation schemes such as dsirr in italy bazzani 2005a what if in the zambezi river basin in africa payet burin et al 2019 e water in the mekrou river basin in west africa udias et al 2018 and cotton webapp in the us southern high plains mauget et al 2013 not only are advisors likely to be the most effective next users of this type of dss the recommended changes to farming systems as a result of use can be extensive such that adoption of recommendations would be limited without additional agronomic advice to build human capital e water is an example of a dss that aids decision making about irrigation and fertiliser management to optimise food crop production improve food security and efficiently use natural resources at a river basin level udias et al 2018 while case study research showed that e water could identify promising site specific management strategies for the mekrou river basin in west africa the future impact of the dss will rely on the capacity of intermediaries to use and understand the software and the extent that farmers across the region are willing and able to adopt the resulting recommendations 4 3 participatory approaches challenging yet essential lindblom et al 2013 state that the single unifying predictor of success or failure of a dss is the extent to which end users are involved in its development this aligns with the reality that the adoption process involves users continually re evaluating whether the attributes of management practices contribute to their aspirations within the constraints of the assets available lindblom et al 2013 therefore a development process that aims to understand end user aspirations capacities and innovation needs and aligns the attributes of the irrigation dss with these would be expected to achieve greater impact jakku and thorburn 2010 and van meensel et al 2012 illustrate effective participatory approaches that developed dss deemed useful by farmers they emphasise the role of co learning by a range of stakeholders involved in the participatory process with farmers considered experts in their domain and scientists recognising the need to prioritise understanding over technicality agricultural innovation is viewed as a complex interactive and iterative process of review act and reflect as opposed to scientists creating a technology and the adoption pathway simply focused on persuading farmers to implement it key factors influencing the success of the participatory approach carried out by van meensel et al 2012 include 1 selection of appropriate stakeholders and a high level of transparency among them 2 constructive collaboration among stakeholders and common goals for the dss and 3 flexibility in the development process respecting the available time and scope but accepting adaptation during the process and not following a priori road map richards et al 2008 describes another example of extensive industry and user consultation in the development of hydro logic to deliver a simple focussed irrigation dss with intermediate rather than complex and therefore accessible software following its initial release in australia in 2003 there was ongoing system development in response to continued research and evaluation of end use and in 2007 a survey of registered users revealed 30 implementation by farmers for irrigation management decisions jakku and thorburn 2010 suggest stakeholders involved in dss development consider four potential outcomes of participatory dss development 1 ongoing use of the technology 2 co creation of management recommendations 3 improved understanding but no practice change and 4 rejection of the technology while outcome 1 is traditionally viewed as successful adoption the evaluation of all outcomes paints a wider picture of the extent of uptake and use of the technology indeed success can be viewed through many lenses jakku and thorburn 2010 evaluated the outcomes of participation in co creating the watersense dss and considered actions consistent with outcomes 2 and 3 to be a success this approach aligns with wilkinson 2011 who describe adoption as a non linear process that may be gradual step wise and or may result in only partial implementation or even dis adoption as described above marianne et al 2012 show that dss can be used to characterise the diversity of uses and user situations to identify the need for flexibility in a dss as well as identification of new concepts through a series of workshops with designers and users marianne et al 2012 co created the cetiom dss and attributed success of their work to the iterative processes in which the prototype tool was tested and refined with end users in line with point 2 above lynch and gregor 2004 highlighted the need to broaden the constructs of both participation and adoption success along with mackrell et al 2009 they noted that structured survey methods are insufficient to capture the resulting range of outcomes and that qualitative interpretative studies must be factored into funding and activity timelines in our experience end users often learn as much through the participatory co learning process as they do in using dss per se suggesting that the dss provide a platform in which different agricultural paradigms can be proposed contrasted and debated in many cases success could even be defined as dis adoption of a dss because the heuristics have been learnt and can be applied mentally by end users without support from the dss although participatory approaches are vital to success the size of the end user population to be surveyed and the number of proposed iterations requires careful consideration at the outset further if a wide range of end users are involved in the design of a dss their views and needs often vary e g harrison et al 2017 selecting the most common viewpoint arising from participatory approaches may address the needs of the largest part of the target population of end users but may not necessarily have the greatest impact harrison et al 2017 2016a further work is required to determine which views arising from participatory processes surveys semi structured interviews and other information gathering processes are the most important and or will maximise future adoption of the dss 5 conclusions the objectives of this review were to 1 review the functionality and intended end users of economic dss for irrigated cropping systems 2 document the extent to which these dss account for uncertainty in dss outputs 3 examine tactical or strategic decisions able to be explored in dss with irrigation infrastructure being a key strategic decision and 4 explore the human and social factors influencing adoption of dss heuristics we showed that many dss have focussed on either tactical or strategic decision making but only the dss waterworks accounted for both tactical and strategic decision making we found that few dss show measures of uncertainty in their outputs e g standard deviation associated with a mean though reasons for this are unclear it is possible that uncertainty is not well understood by end users or is unable to be adequately quantified and intuitively displayed by dss developers we suggest that simple statistics shown in an intuitive and transparent fashion e g standard deviations ranges or percentiles would go a long way towards helping end users understand potential variability associated with dss outputs we also found that only waterworks allowed contrasting between alternative forms of irrigation infrastructure a lack of dss comparing economic implications of alternative irrigation systems and investment may be a reflection of the limited experimental data comparing yields and profitability of alternative forms of irrigation in the field our findings suggest that waterworks is perhaps most developed in terms of the functional aspects of our aims another key conclusion of our work was that very few dss have been applied in multiple regions the vast majority of dss have been applied only in the regions in which they were developed this observation may be underpinned by either 1 a lack of willingness to use or adapt existing dss in new environments 2 a lack of extension or awareness of existing dss 3 the presence of socio economic or cultural barriers preventing adoption of existing dss or 4 combinations of these reasons lack of widespread use of dss across regions is another area deserving of further study importantly the clear distinction should be made between the adoption of dss per se vs the adoption of dss heuristics adoption and perpetual use of dss does not necessarily indicate cumulative adoption of a given heuristic or paradigm promulgated by a dss in fact disuse of dss may indicate that knowledge transfer has been entirely successful wherein the knowledge extended by the dss is no longer required by the end user improving the adoption of future dss heuristics may require addressing socio economic and cultural problems associated with implementation including the limited alignment of dss features with end user aspirations viz historical top down approaches capacities and innovation needs perceived relative advantage of an innovation reversibility trialability and training to build the human and social capacity required to build trust and confidence in the technology to address these issues future design and development of dss should be demand driven and be conducted in an iterative participatory learning process providing manifold ways in which

9906,decision support systems dss have long been used in research service provision and extension despite the diversity of technological applications in which past agricultural dss canvass there has been relatively little information on either the functional aspects of dss designed for economic decisions in irrigated cropping or the human and social factors influencing the adoption of knowledge from such dss the objectives of the study were to 1 review the functionality and target end users of economic dss for irrigated cropping systems 2 document the extent to which these dss account for and visualise uncertainty in dss outputs 3 examine tactical or strategic decisions able to be explored in dss with irrigation infrastructure being a key strategic decision and 4 explore the human and social factors influencing adoption of dss heuristics this study showed that development of previous dss has often occurred as a result of a technology push instead of end user pull which has meant that previous dss have been generated in a top down fashion rather than being demand driven by end user needs we found that few dss enable analysis of both tactical and strategic decisions and that few dss account for uncertainty in their outputs we uncover a surprising lack of documented end user feedback on economic dss for irrigated cropping such as end user satisfaction with dss functionality or future intentions to use the technology as well as a lack of dss application outside regions in which they were originally developed declining adoption of dss does not necessarily imply declining adoption of dss heuristics in fact declining dss uptake may indicate that knowledge and heuristics extended by the dss has been successful obviating the need for use of the dss per se future dss could be improved through the use of demand driven participatory approaches more aligned with user needs with more training to build human capacity including understanding uncertainty and ability to contrast tactical and strategic decisions using multiple economic environmental and social metrics graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation software scale socio economic policy adoption 1 introduction irrigated cropping systems underpin status quo food security carruthers et al 1997 schultz et al 2005 and will be increasingly important for ensuring consistent food supply in future irrigated croplands are more than twice as productive as rainfed croplands and while only 16 of global croplands are irrigated irrigated crops comprise around 36 of the global harvest per year however the extent to which irrigation is employed in any agricultural system is a function of manifold biophysical economic environmental and social factors biophysical factors include crop type crop water use efficiency enterprise mix alcock et al 2015 bell et al 2015 harrison et al 2012b 2012d koech and langat 2018 physical factors may include water allocation availability irrigation infrastructure and effects of climate change bell et al 2015 2013 harrison et al 2017 koech and langat 2018 economic factors include capital outlay costs and commodity prices bjornlund et al 2007 environmental factors may include anaerobic effects caused by waterlogging risk of salinity beltrán 1999 lazaridou et al 2019 and social factors may include management aspirations peer and family values succession plans amongst others bjornlund et al 2007 bond 1998 caswell 1991 christie et al 2018 given this complexity decision makers are faced with multiple concurrent factors to consider when deciding when irrigation should be used if at all decision support systems dss have historically evolved to help users navigate and systematically disentangle some of the aforementioned issues appropriately contextualised dss can be used to extricate the effects of irrigation on social economic and environmental indicators through extension service provision or participatory research mccown 2002 early research defines dss as computerised sources of knowledge expertise and experience providing accessible information to decision makers colomb 1987 unlike traditional techniques in operations research and optimisation dss rely on the judgement of the designer from problem formulation to choosing relevant data to selecting approaches to be used in generating solutions rausser and yassour 1978 around four decades later our modern definitions have changed little from those proposed in the 1970s with rinaldi and he 2014b defining dss as interactive software based systems to help decision makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data documents and personal knowledge to identify and solve problems and to optimise decisions olsson and andersson 2006 van meensel et al 2012 the application of and need for agricultural dss in irrigated agriculture has increased substantially since the 1990s for different reasons around the globe in developed countries the use of dss in agriculture by water management authorities has increased to help balance water use between the field and district levels agricultural dss can also be used by decision makers to more effectively manage the allocation of irrigation water to enhance crop or pasture water use efficiency and minimise environmental pollution while improving nutrient use efficiencies christie et al 2020 ho et al 2013 rinaldi and he 2014a at the farm level dss have been promulgated for multiple tactical and strategic decisions outlined further below including contrasting of options for increasing productivity better allocation of resources climate change adaptation and for avoiding food waste chang fung martel et al 2017 ibrahim et al 2018 phelan et al 2015 2018 zhai et al 2020 regional variation in the need for and use of agricultural dss is explored in detail in the body of this review temporal farm management decisions may be tactical weekly or strategic over several years tactical decisions concerning irrigated cropping may include whether or not to apply water or fertiliser repayment of debts or purchasing of operational supplies strategic decisions include enterprise choices and purchasing of machinery or irrigation infrastructure temporal decisions operate on a continuum from operational to strategic with tactical and operational decisions being made in support of an overarching strategic vision an appropriately designed dss should facilitate decision making at either tactical or strategic scales helping transpose decisions from reactive to proactive chang fung martel et al 2017 phelan et al 2018 a key purpose of the present paper was to review the extent to which previous dss operate on tactical or strategic bases because ultimately the combination of both short and long term decisions contribute towards generation of economic wealth there are fewer agricultural dss designed for strategic decision making rinaldi and he 2014c even though strategic decisions may have greater impact on wealth compared with tactical decisions more than two decades ago silva et al 2001a developed a dss to improve strategic planning and management of large irrigation schemes in the alentejo region of portugal the dss allowed contrasting of crop types and systems integrating socio economic and biophysical data at the field level to analyse how a given irrigation scheme may be adopted by farmers more recently khan et al 2009 developed waterworks a dss designed to facilitate tactical and strategic irrigation decisions at the farm level to improve economic and water use efficiencies of farm businesses a key strategic decision is the type of irrigation machinery and infrastructure to be purchased investment in irrigation infrastructure can represent a significant capital outlay that may be irreversible once new irrigation infrastructure is in situ this can result in inflexible production systems that are unable to respond to future water scarcity increasing investment risk by over six fold depending on the severity of drought adamson and loch 2014 despite the potential impact of irrigation infrastructure on economic outcomes few dss appear to permit contrasting of economic factors associated with irrigation infrastructure many dss output produce values that have no variability e g the profitability associated with a management intervention may be shown as a mean value but the range standard deviation or variability associated with the mean is not shown this variability is known as uncertainty outputs from any dss or model carry implicit uncertainty associated with either 1 lack of knowledge or data used to build a dss hardaker et al 2015 2004 pembleton et al 2016 2 uncertainty in model inputs or internal parameters harrison et al 2014 2012c 2012d or 3 uncertainty in model algorithms and equations harrison et al 2019 uncertainty can be visualised through appropriate statistical measures that show ranges or statistical distributions of dss inputs or outputs harrison et al 2017 ho et al 2014 kandulu et al 2012 monjardino et al 2015 despite the variety of methods with which uncertainty can be displayed graphically e g ho et al 2014 harrison et al 2016b the extent to which risk and risk metrics can be usefully interpreted by dss users is not well known there is also evidence to suggest that end users often have little understanding of uncertainty implicit to dss outputs or how uncertainty may affect their management decisions harrison et al 2016a mowrer 2000 the extent to which dss outputs are adopted is rarely measured and anecdotally at least is often considered to be limited bell et al 2015 harrison et al 2012a inman bamber et al 2007 mccown 2001 previous research on irrigation dss has often focused on technology aspects but has not generally assessed how socio economic aspects influence adoption pannell et al 2006 describe the challenges of measuring these adoption related attributes even if resources were available to conduct surveys of end users such assessments tend to rely on indirect measurement through expert opinion in most technical evaluations there has been little consideration of the attributes of agricultural communities and households that support or hinder adoption in contrast to the bulk of work on the characteristics of farm households pannell et al 2006 indicate that innovations are more likely to be adopted when they have a high relative advantage and when they are readily trailable to address this knowledge gap the review discuss how economic social and cultural factors influence application and adoption of irrigation dss and dss knowledge and illustrate pathways in which these factors should be considered in future dss development in this review we focus on economic dss for agriculture that have graphical user interfaces guis that can be used to compare scenarios for tactical and or strategic purposes we examine the drivers of adoption of past agricultural dss and dss outputs knowledge discussing pathways to ensure economic dss are relevant and contain actionable information for farm irrigation management specifically the aims of this paper were to 1 review the functionality and intended end users of previous and extant economic dss for irrigated cropping systems 2 document the extent to which these dss account for and visualise uncertainty in dss outputs 3 examine tactical and strategic decisions that are able to be explored in dss with investment decisions in irrigation infrastructure being a key strategic decision and 4 explore the human and social factors influencing adoption of dss heuristics 2 methods in this review we apply the following criteria to select economic dss for inclusion 1 the dss includes a gui in a form of web based software tool or as an app not mathematical models in isolation or dss without guis which are flexible to operate utilize by the end users 2 the dss includes output variables of either yield water use or both and 3 the dss allows contrasting of resources allocation and management across the whole farm we define end users as people who use dss heuristics to action decisions where a heuristic is the development of a problem solving process that allows a short term approximation to a problem by way of example a dss heuristic could be gained by a farmer who uses trial and error processes to learn how a crop responds to a given seasonal climate outlook once the farmer has gleaned an appropriate mental model rom using the dss she he may thus decide to jettison future use of the dss we define next users as people who use dss and dss heuristics to provide advice to others but do not ultimately action decisions themselves e g a farm advisor agronomist or consultant may use the outputs from a dss to provide information to a farmer see table 1 decision time frames considered in this review include seasonal annual or long term 5 20 years hereafter economic decisions relating to seasonal annual time frames are referred to as tactical e g crop sowing choices and decision making relating to longer term multi year time frames are referred to as strategic e g decisions relating to irrigation infrastructure climate change and transformational adaptation for longer term farm profitability following these guides dss designed for daily or real time irrigation decisions including irrigation scheduling precision irrigation or geographic information systems gis were considered out of scope instead our primary objective was to review economic dss that analyse farm systems on tactical or strategic bases e g dss designed to compute the economically optimal the proportion of farm productivity derived from irrigation the review was conducted and structured as follows 1 literature search based on the search criteria process outlined in fig 1 fourteen economic irrigation dss were selected from the literature table 1 section 2 2 extract information from selected dss each dss was analysed in the context of our aims including intended application and decision analysis tactical and strategic economic decisions including presence or absence of irrigation infrastructure type of end user type of interface biophysical and or environmental metrics e g yield water use and water productivity economic metrics e g ml ha and ability to quantify uncertainty section 3 3 evaluate drivers of adoption of agricultural dss and dss heuristics and identify pathways for increasing the adoption of beneficial knowledge provided by economic dss section 4 4 conclusions summarise the major challenges typical decisions made outline criteria that would make dss more useful for decision makers and identify opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of extension processes that use dss section 5 the description of dss in section 3 is designed to facilitate insights into technology deficits related to dss functionality e g tactical and strategic decision making uncertainty in outputs etc whereas section 4 is designed to address human and social factors related to end user knowledge derived from dss including the attributes of dss that influence adoptability 3 economic dss for irrigated agricultural systems 3 1 overview of dss functionality dss shown in table 1 facilitate tactical and strategic economic decisions considering the influence of climate on economic and risk outcomes labour requirements benchmarking economic performance selection and design of irrigation systems irrigation management and investment assessment target end users include farmers irrigation managers intermediaries i e consultants extensionists advisors and agronomists and policymakers table 1 these dss contained graphical user interfaces facilitating scenario comparison and use without coding christie et al 2020 pembleton et al 2016 tapsuwan et al 2015 watkiss et al 2015 with software varying from web based tools to apps and spreadsheets many dss have been developed and tested as case studies trl level 2 in table 1 but perpetuation of dss into the long term appears to be a problem that most developers and scientists still grapple with e g dss evim and dssipm were developed for research purposes and were not maintained this example has been repeated historically ad nauseum across regions dss have been developed for many different reasons most dss aim to help users identify more profitable irrigation regimes e g ahp dssir domis cotton webapp dss evim some have been developed for comparison of alternative farming systems and or cropping diversity feat irrigation optimiser dssipm or water productivity and use efficiency sirmod irrigation optimiser while fewer have been developed for comparison of the profitability associated with adapting irrigation infrastructure waterworks what if sadreg the majority of dss facilitate comparisons of multiple crop types which adds versatility and presumably utility to a broader range of end users though some focus only on one crop type e g cotton webapp feat most dss have been designed for use by farmers advisors and service providers at the farm scale fewer dss have been designed to facilitate decision making at the regional and catchment scale with exceptions of domis dssir dssipm what if and dss evim perhaps the most stark conclusion from table 1 is that most dss have been developed and applied only locally and are not available publicly in the latter case potential users need to contact developers to gain access to the dss of interest localised development of dss suggests that developers may prefer to construct new decision support tools rather than adapt or share previous dss such lack of transfer between regions may be due to multiple reasons such as inability to access and modify source code protection of commercial intellectual property inadequate functionality of the existing dss improper complexity suitability or even a simple lack of research into existing dss at the outset this is key area in which future dss developers could significantly improve upon the use and adaptation of existing dss would be expected to facilitate collaboration lead to greater support and maintenance of dss improve understanding of diverse agroecological and socio economic systems and ultimately improve impact adoption of dss knowledge in the environments in which they operate more extensive sharing increased public availability and advertising of dss either commercially or free of charge would be also expected to improve awareness and uptake 3 2 tactical decisions tactical dss are designed for shorter term seasonal economic decisions for instance waterworks was developed to provide seasonal irrigation management decisions in waterworks fig 2 simulation and optimisation modules were considered at the farm level in australia khan et al 2009 waterworks is designed to help users evaluate water productivity economic efficiency and environmental performance for pivot drip and surface irrigation systems to increase crop yield and profit for a farm business inputs include crops cropped area soil type source of water surface or groundwater water trading existing and proposed irrigation layouts the main output of the dss is optimised profitability at the whole farm level seasonal water allocation overall crop water use efficiency water trading price crop price and crop yield while waterworks was built using participatory approaches with end users trialling ease of use flexibility and user friendliness khan et al 2009 there appears to be little documentation of user feedback on quality criteria of the dss such as information semantic success system technical success or service quality use and effectiveness success this observation suggests a need for further documentation of user feedback on both satisfaction and further intentions to use this dss the dss sirmod simulates the hydraulics of surface irrigation border furrow and basin at the field level and evaluates the economic implications of alternative field layouts including differences due to topography field size and length walker 1993 1998 sirmod helps users understand economically viable management practices such as seasonal water application and optimisation of surface irrigation wu et al 2017 zheng et al 2009a 2009b the dss allows comparison of alternative seasonal surface irrigation design and management practices to irrigators and other decision makers abbasi et al 2003 hornbuckle et al 1999 raine and walker 1998 hornbuckle et al 2005 indicate that 1 the ease of data entry into the dss 2 type of platform pc vs mobile device 3 designing the dss to better meet end user needs and 4 cost benefit ratio as a result of using sirmod are key observations regarding potential uptake of the dss despite the widespread use of this dss there appears to be little documentation of user uptake learning or feedback on sirmod 3 3 strategic decisions strategic dss facilitate insight into long term economic decisions such as adoption of a whole farm plan for an irrigation system or development of a plan to establish irrigation infrastructure montagu et al 2006 while many approaches have been used in the literature to assist decisions on managing water resources the multi criteria analysis mca or multi criteria decision analysis mcda are popular in comparing irrigation strategies with respect to long term economic value mca and mcda approaches evaluate trade offs between the successes of alternative irrigation systems and their impacts on the process of decision making hajkowicz and collins 2007 karleuša et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 the analytical hierarchy process ahp uses mca to support strategic economic decisions at the farm level the ahp was conceived in response to top down transfer of technology in which experts e g scientists perceived farmer problems and proposed solutions for these problems karami 2006 but without first consulting farmers as the end users as might be predicted such top down approaches often lead to poor adoption outcomes through a participatory process using ahp in the dss expert choice the end user participants in the study of karami 2006 agreed that the decision hierarchy should be 1 comprehensive 2 relevant to extension programs for diffusion of irrigation methods and 3 include both technical and socio economic factors in using expert choice with four distinct groups of irrigation farmers karami 2006 clearly showed how ahp can help end users better understand the characteristics of alternative irrigation systems but also identify the broader socio economic factors contributing to farmer decisions underpinning whether or not to adopt a specific type of irrigation dssipm helps users assess cultivation options for irrigated agricultural systems and to identify constraints impacting crop choice and crop yields silva et al 2001a while outcomes from the work of silva et al 2001b provide insights into the relative value of crop irrigation dssipm was not designed to compare different irrigation systems a similar mca approach was used in the development of sadreg which supports strategic decisions to design and select surface irrigation systems through comparison of alternative attributes yield cost of investment operation and maintenance run off land levelling soil erosion goncalves et al 2007 1998b 1998a goncalves and pereira 2009 sadreg has been previously used to understand the context of water saving in relation to farm economics in northeast syria darouich et al 2012 along with comparing surface irrigation with sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation darouich et al 2017 2014 el gafy and el ganzori 2012 used dss evim to produce economic maps at the regional level in egypt for different crops to support strategic economic decisions on cropping patterns to maximise the value of irrigation water but does not include irrigation infrastructure in contrast domis estimates the cost of irrigation systems i e drip irrigation sprinkler and micro sprinkler for different crops domis evaluates the economic feasibility of these systems considering the location soil groundwater irrigation equipment crop information the regional profile of a given region accounting for water quality rainfall wind speed solar energy source of irrigation and agricultural land use despite its widespread use in india and current availability online patel et al 2018 we find little evidence in the little of user feedback or evaluation on the system service or information quality of this dss while dss are often used to make strategic economic decisions at the farm and regional levels langworthy et al 2018 few catchment scale dss account for irrigation infrastructure economic indicators associated with water infrastructure and policies in the water energy food climate nexus were considered in the what if dss for the zambezi river basin in africa payet burin et al 2019 this dss centres on large scale irrigation management strategic plans including irrigation infrastructure development agriculture production farming zone crop choices irrigation and yield crop and energy markets similar to what if dssir was designed to help users understand environmental economic and social interdependencies of irrigated agriculture at the catchment scale including employment subsidies gross domestic product and environmental pollution bazzani 2005a irrigation systems in dssir comprise fixed and site specific irrigation layout furrows and drip and mobile layouts sprinklers and self moving guns to understand water yield functions and rotations because most catchment level dss have been designed for analyses of irrigation investment at a large scale outcomes do not consider tactical decisions such as crop management and are thus not comparable with other tactical dss these findings underscore the need for consistent output metrics in dss spanning multiple disciplines social economic and environmental and ability to examine both tactical and strategic decisions of the dss analysed only five ahp dsirr what if waterworks e water include uncertainty in output variables this may be because 1 uncertainty in dss outputs is often not intuitive to users 2 variability associated with climatic economic factors implicit parameter uncertainty and error propagation can be difficult to quantify harrison et al 2019 or 3 developers do not consider uncertainty as a high priority dss output we suggest that uncertainty in dss outputs is a feature that should be given more consideration in future work particularly in dss that include climatic or market volatility assuming that an irrigation dss has been designed to be compatible with users sociocultural values and their need for innovation including uncertainty in output variables would allow more informed assessments of the relative advantage of proceeding with dss based decisions 3 4 irrigation infrastructure in general few of the dss reviewed accounted for irrigation infrastructure although waterworks and sadreg are notable exceptions khan et al 2009 use waterworks to compare yields of several crops under alternative irrigation systems table 2 in a case study of the feasibility of drip or pivot irrigation investment table 3 khan et al 2009 show that the capital cost of pivot irrigation ranges between au 2771 and au 3750 ha while variable costs depended on the size of the pivot irrigators and crop type seasonal conditions soil types and groundwater level the case study documented a scenario for maize grown over 40 ha where shifting from surface to pivot irrigation increased yield by 0 5 t ha gross margin by aud 115 ha water use efficiency by 0 22 t ml and reduced water use for irrigation by 0 65 ml ha table 2 in general pivot irrigation led to higher gross margins associated with higher yields and water productivity resulting in improved economic returns per unit irrigation water ml this result was consistent for grapes maize soybeans and wheat suggesting that pivot irrigation systems would be a more profitable investment that surface irrigation in this context a limited number of studies have examined the agronomic and economic effects of irrigation infrastructure darouich et al 2014 used sadreg and mca and found an 11 reduction in cotton yield in surface and drip irrigation systems when comparing deficit irrigation with full irrigation the same authors later compared border check and sprinkler systems and found that wheat yields for border check and sprinkler irrigation systems were 4511 kg ha and 5200 kg ha respectively suggesting that flood based systems had lower water use efficiencies darouich et al 2017 maraseni et al 2012 examined a range of irrigation systems in southern queensland australia and showed that while irrigation efficiency was similar across irrigation systems there was large variability in capital investment labour water savings and nitrogen input across infrastructure systems table 4 the highest capital cost was that associated with changing from sprinkler hand shift to drip sprinkler roll line 5000 ha but this change in infrastructure also increased yield by 18 reduced labour by 40 and saved 2 ml ha in irrigation rollin and scott 2018 compared irrigation infrastructure for rice cotton and maize in southern nsw and northern victoria and showed that marginal rates of return varied due to depending on level of capital investment table 5 for instance changes in irrigation system from the contour system to terrace bankless resulted in higher cropping intensity and reduced water use but received the lowest return 14 on capital invested while these findings are useful future work must go further and compare the biophysical yield water use etc and economic cost profitability etc associated with irrigation infrastructure systems across environments and production systems ie crops able to be grown based on enterprise mix these findings would facilitate improved development of future dss e g water use efficiency parameters associated with different irrigation infrastructure as well as end user understanding of the most appropriate infrastructure accounting for their farming system climate type and future management aspirations table 5 3 5 transparency in presenting uncertainty in dss outputs previous work has shown that end users of dss often have little understanding of uncertainty mowrer 2000 uncertainty in dss can be broadly classified into six categories 1 inherent randomness in initial conditions 2 measurement error 3 systematic error e g due to a bias in sampling 4 natural variation biological systems may vary in time and space 5 model uncertainty and 6 selective judgment uncertainty due to different interpretations of the data uusitalo et al 2015 model uncertainty comprises dss structure and dss internal parameters these factors are not independent because there is a trade off between increasing complexity improved model structure and increasing parameter error harrison et al 2019 passioura 1996 reynolds and acock 1985 probability theory inter or intra year climatic variability may also be used to quantify uncertainty harrison et al 2017 2016b 2012b dss that account for economic scenarios ideally should also account for uncertainty and risks alcock et al 2015 uusitalo et al 2015 as this supports more informed user assessments of relative advantage and perceived superiority of alternative innovations dss considered here table 1 show limited scope in accounting for risk and or uncertainty only five dss of those reviewed here quantify uncertainty uusitalo et al 2015 suggest that evaluating uncertainty depends on the amount and quality of available information scale of application and the purpose of the dss many economic dss are deterministic wherein outputs are derived from a single computation such that no uncertainty is embodied in dss outputs ho et al 2014 watkiss et al 2015 in these cases uncertainty could be shown by running multiple input values e g market prices or costs through a dss to produce a distribution of outputs this process is applied in dssir such that outputs in the dss are presented as both means and associated variability e g the range of irrigation water to be applied and the variability in water supply associated with climatic variability however the development of uncertainty metrics in dss involves considerable technical complexity e g adequate mathematical accounting of error propagation or the development of datasets that reasonably account for social environmental and economic variability implicit to dss datasets these reasons may explain why many contemporary dss do not account for uncertainty as well visualisation of risk in dss outputs if often not intuitive to the layperson and large variability in outputs of some dss may result in a loss of trust in the software by some users similar to other functional aspects of dss quantification of uncertainty must be considered in the design phase and should be iteratively refined throughout the development and adoption phases in line with end user feedback such refinement should be conducted using multi disciplinary participatory approach that involves input from not only next and end users but also software developers scientists and other stakeholders throughout the life of the dss this process would be expected to increase the adoptability of the dss heuristics by ensuring the aspirations and capacities of users and their communities are addressed and that the dss is compatible with users sociocultural values including their need for innovation to move forwards uncertainty metrics in future dss may be developed with participatory approaches and either 1 expert judgment 2 model emulation i e a statistical representation low order simplification of model outputs 3 sensitivity analysis e g via parameter perturbation 4 temporal or spatial variability in model outputs 5 use of multiple models 6 use of multiple initial conditions and or 7 probabilistic approaches which may be conducted by rerunning a model with multiple sets of driving variables e g climates soil types if the addition of uncertainty metrics to a dss interface results in excessive variability that prevents a meaningful decision being made then the addition of uncertainty will have served its purpose such cases would mean that the variability associated with a given value or treatment is so high that it is not significantly different from another treatment without showing uncertainty end users have no way of knowing if the difference between any two treatments is real or significant having the ability to distinguish between treatments is another key reason future dss developers should consider implementing measures of uncertainty in as outputs of dss 3 6 summary of functional aspects of previous and extant dss economic dss have been developed for multiple purposes from comparisons of investment decisions in irrigation infrastructure to analyses of agronomic effects on farm profit or costs to strategies for increasing water use efficiency or water productivity table 1 it is worth noting that the extent to which an intervention causes change very much depends on the initial conditions for example a crop is unlikely to respond to irrigation if the soil moisture profile is already full thus consideration of baseline conditions in any dss is important we found that many economic dss have been developed with site specific foci using case studies for validation and that only one dss sirmod has been actively tested and applied in multiple regions this observation suggests that previous dss have had limited transferability across environments such lack of transferability of dss across regions may be due to many reasons such as inappropriate dss functionality lack of extension training support or lack or research awareness raising by previous dss developers ongoing development and structural or software maintenance issues appear to be a key issue we showed that many past dss are no longer extant or in operation because the continued use of dss outputs in research policy and industry is critical to impact increased profitability and sustainability the following section examines adoption of previous dss knowledge and outlines pathways for increasing adoption of future dss heuristics in the following section we broaden our scope to all dss in agriculture since we examine the multitude of factors influencing the extension adoption and impact of dss in agriculture in general we first cover the problem of implementation then discuss factors influencing adoption and finally end with a discussion on participatory approaches 4 adoption and impact of dss in irrigated agriculture 4 1 the problem of implementation there are many benefits of dss for farmers and extension providers some of these benefits include confirmation or rebuttal of intuitive knowledge improved awareness of direct and external issues impacting a given outcome reduced uncertainty improved ability to contrast multiple scenarios and utilise large datasets and proven science to make more informed decisions and or the use of dss as proxies for conveying and understanding knowledge as part of extension frameworks despite this many studies have shown that current agricultural dss are not well adopted by farmers this is termed the problem of implementation eastwood et al 2012 leeuwis 2013 lindblom et al 2013 mackrell et al 2009 matthews et al 2008 mccown 2002 rossi et al 2014 van meensel et al 2012 evaluating the number of users mode and extent of use and benefits to users has not historically been included in dss research kerr 2004 mccown 2001 rinaldi and he 2014c indeed many publications relating to irrigation dss may infer the future relevance and benefits for end users of the system based on its characteristics but research rarely extends to evaluating adoption once if the dss becomes publicly available an approach to examining adoption of irrigation dss was carried out across 12 irrigation districts in alberta canada wang et al 2015 while 67 of the 199 participating farmers had adopted improved use of irrigation the majority involved physical tools and observation the use of a hand auger to dig up soil and direct assessment of the appearance and feel of soil moisture to guide their decision making applying dss related methods to support irrigation decision making was near to or less than 1 for both adoption and level of intensity i e the percentage of total irrigated area on which it was used wang et al 2015 these findings highlight some of the key attributes of dss compared with some physical on farm practices that influence adoptability the increased complexity and reduced trialability of the dss related methods viz phelan et al 2018 in this instance reducing implementation compared with physical tools and observation a range of agricultural dss have targeted the interface between farm management theory and actual practice mccown 2001 payne et al 2016 provide useful guidelines on the extent of support required for users to adopt different technologies recognising the important role that human and social capital play in the process of adoption technologies that implement a technology push or top down strategies tend to address simple cause and effect problems provide readily experienced and observable benefits are highly compatible with current practices and are relatively easy for farmers to implement independently some agricultural dss in this category are relatively simple tools developed to assist farmers tactical decisions mccown 2002 stone and hochman 2004 a shortfall of these simple tools is that as users learn more about a situation they may desire greater flexibility than the tool allows namely the opportunity to reduce decision uncertainty further and assess relative advantage to a greater extent by exploring different scenarios rose et al 2016 upon reaching the point at which the outputs and heuristics become readily predictable users may discontinue use of such tools even though they continue using the heuristics gained although somewhat intractable future dss research would benefit from documenting adoption of dss heuristics rather than dss per se at the other end of the spectrum payne et al 2016 describe the high level of co learning required to develop and extend technologies that address complex problems and do not generally bring about rapid results strategic irrigation dss designed to provide integrated recommendations for systems management fall within this high complexity category and are often associated with low levels of implementation stevens 2007 describes the ineffective scientific framework and linear knowledge pathways often used to convey information to farmers about irrigation decision making instead of the deeper learning based approach required to support practice change a key reason for limited adoption by farmers is that many dss have been created by scientists and software developers purely from a supply rather than a demand perspective lindblom et al 2013 in such cases development has proceeded as a result of technology push instead of end user pull to help solve a problem or improve a practice significant shortcomings of current agricultural dss are a consequence of a lack of understanding of farmers needs and decision making in practice a lack of compatibility mccown 2001 and mackrell et al 2009 explain dss have traditionally promulgated empirical positivist paradigms with an underlying belief that the role of a dss is to provide information to improve or even replace farmer decision making yet farmer decision making is a tacit and heuristic process and there is a disconnect between the farm management theory that forms the basis of modelled relationships and actual farm management in practice eastwood et al 2012 when agricultural dss are designed to provide recommendations for systems management and intended to act as proxies for a farmers decision making process low adoption has been partly attributed to the resistance of farmers to give up their own decision making processes mccown 2002 farmers decision making processes associated with adoption are influenced by a wide range of social factors vanclay 1992 more innovative dss development approaches take a less technical and analytical paradigm acknowledging the importance of the social and individual views in farmer decision making vanclay 1992 highlighted that along with attributes of the technology itself alignment of the technology with user aspirations i e goals values beliefs personality culture motivation and capacity human social natural physical financial influence the extent of adoption rose et al 2016 report fifteen factors influencing uptake and use of several agricultural dss in the united kingdom following semi structured interviews with farmers and advisors and these included characteristics of the technology end users and compliance landscape such as performance ease of use trust relevance to the user level of marketing it education and farmer age fig 4 similar factors have also been identified and discussed to varying extents in other publications alvarez and nuthall 2006 cox 1996 kerr 2004 tapsuwan et al 2015 van meensel et al 2012 4 2 drivers of adoption 4 2 1 technology the attributes of the technology itself relative advantage compatibility complexity trialability observability rogers 1 are key factors that can be used to evaluate potential adoption pathways for existing irrigation dss and to intentionally address in the development of future dss van meensel et al 2012 summarised the success factors of agricultural dss and the influential characteristics of the technology reflected the importance of compatibility flexibility perceived usefulness credibility and trialability ease of use see also rose et al 2016 dss flexibility is the opportunity for end users to compare different scenarios and adapt the system to farm specific situations and this also allows assessment of the relative advantage of proceeding with dss based decisions relative advantage is also relevant for the initial decisions relating to investing in or using an irrigation dss olivier and singels 2004 listed uncertainty about actual benefits of investing in and using agricultural dss for irrigation scheduling mccown 2002 p 195 explains that farmers cease to care about even credible tools when they cannot see sufficient practical value for action resulting from the output taking into consideration the costs including managerial time and attention it is not uncommon for farmers to cease using a technology if they are able to learn and then apply the associated principles heuristically and this mode of use can be viewed as successful adoption mccown 2002 there are also cases in which agricultural dss shift from being used as goal orientated tools towards learning aids schlindwein et al 2015 the web based domis dss is reported to aid farmer decision making around the design and cost of micro irrigation systems by providing different scenarios to consider and prioritise patel et al 2018 flexibility has been incorporated into the dss design so that different levels of data can be entered depending on user knowledge with the reduced complexity allowing it to be used without the aid of professional knowledge of agricultural engineering and micro irrigation system design while an evaluation of adoption of domis has not been published patel et al 2018 p 2247 state that this dss is considered to be useful to farmers industry researchers and policy makers in agriculture and allied sectors in india a challenge for dss that provide flexibility and credible representation of complex farming systems is ease of use kerr 2004 explains that many dss are not implemented in small owner operated farming systems because they are too complex requiring users to understand unfamiliar language and variables for basic input for which they may not have the associated data and possess existing knowledge and skills for irrigation dss scientific complexity of the system and high requirements of inputs and parameters have limited adoption inman bamber et al 2007 olivier and singels 2004 in a review of dss to manage irrigation in agriculture rinaldi and he 2014c suggest that it is necessary to achieve a middle ground between simplicity in farmer use to encourage adoption and scientific complexity in the dss to maintain rigour to encourage initial and continued implementation dss must also be easily maintained with the capacity to be adapted with new information an important yet challenging consideration for dss funders and stakeholders rossi et al 2014 dss developers and funders must therefore consider alternative pathways to market after the build of the tool dss are generally constructed for a purpose but their longevity must also be planned for to prevent outdated software and dss redundancy the tactical irrigation optimizer and strategic dssipm and dss evim are examples of economic irrigation dss that are not available for use due to ceased development table 1 they are among many dss that have showed promise or been successful for a period only to be discarded when their creators have ceased maintenance of the software licencing and training manuals or technology and science have advanced but the data within the tool have been superseded e g dss tools containing now defunct global climate model data such as the sres emissions scenarios 4 2 2 end users when the attributes of the dss has been tailored to favour adoption the most likely users are the innovator and early adopter farmer segments mccown 2002 tapsuwan et al 2015 innovators are at the forefront of change and enjoy the process of trialling new practices often without facilitated support howden et al 1998 rogers 1995 they focus on continually improving their farm with confident decision making often based on science and data turner et al 2017 found that innovator australian farmers displayed strong economic and business orientations and were more likely than other segments to participate in benchmarking and other recordkeeping activities that align with the measuring and monitoring approach of dss early adopters take a proactive stance to change and are mostly viewed with respect by their industry peers when successfully implementing new practices rogers 1995 however mccown 2002 warns against the assumption that adoption of agricultural dss by innovators and early adopters termed visionaries will lead to adoption by the early majority rogers 1995 the early majority are more pragmatic in their decision making less open to innovation and change and do not relate to the experience of the visionaries interviews with 30 irrigators in georgia usa in relation to adoption of irrigator pro revealed that on farm contact and demonstrations would be needed to build the human and social capital required to support wider uptake rather than relying on diffusion from innovators to other farmer segments morrison 2009 mccown 2002 p 204 suggests that initial users of agricultural dss are visionary farmers and the dss fails to cross the chasm to be used by the pragmatists by not crossing an effort fails to achieve the critical market size that would retain funding and or agency political support this is the significance of the chasm only about 15 of potential customers are comprised of visionaries on the left side of the chasm the left tail of the bell curve studies on farmer characteristics that influence adoption of dss provide insights into the inter related social factors associated with farmers approaches to decision making alvarez and nuthall 2006 rose et al 2016 alvarez and nuthall 2006 investigated adoption in the context of new zealand and uruguay dairy farming and identified a suite of aspirations and human and social capacity farmer goals personality education skills current information processes learning style and business size as influential factors fig 4 highlights the complexity of relationships between some of these factors in the united kingdom context rose et al 2016 and the reality that in different contexts e g cultures farming systems stages of community development landscapes the relative influence of these factors changes the adoption and diffusion outcome prediction tool adopt kuehne et al 2017 can be used to estimate peak adoption rates of any agricultural technology and times to peak adoption james and harrison 2016 used adopt to examine a range of livestock greenhouse gas abatement techniques and predicted adoption rates from 34 to 95 and times to peak adoption of 3 9 14 9 years while farmers can be end users of the dss ahp sirmod waterworks e water and feat the remaining dss reviewed in this paper are targeted at next users including intermediaries such as farmer advisors and policy makers targeting intermediaries i e consultants extensionists advisors and agronomists may therefore help bridge the chasm and increase adoption rates of agricultural dss design and development processes can be tailored accordingly if the goal is to create a dss that will act as an adaptable simulator for an intermediary most likely a consultant in these interactions mccown 2002 van meensel et al 2012 explains that intermediaries i e next users can facilitate dialogue between farmers and agricultural dss and the exchange of ideas about management practices that are relevant to the farmers indeed given the need for advisors to contrast multiple scenarios across perhaps multiple farms it could be expected that farm advisors tent to be more receptive to dss than the majority of farmers a worthwhile avenue for future research would be the impact gained by conducting participatory work with advisors as an intermediary to farmers versus the impact gained by working with farmers themselves here again we return to our earlier sentiment that practice change primarily occurs when end users learn and apply heuristics these heuristics could be gained through direct interaction with a dss or via an intermediary that passes down the heuristics advisory support is particularly important where irrigation dss are developed to investigate future production potential in large irrigation schemes such as dsirr in italy bazzani 2005a what if in the zambezi river basin in africa payet burin et al 2019 e water in the mekrou river basin in west africa udias et al 2018 and cotton webapp in the us southern high plains mauget et al 2013 not only are advisors likely to be the most effective next users of this type of dss the recommended changes to farming systems as a result of use can be extensive such that adoption of recommendations would be limited without additional agronomic advice to build human capital e water is an example of a dss that aids decision making about irrigation and fertiliser management to optimise food crop production improve food security and efficiently use natural resources at a river basin level udias et al 2018 while case study research showed that e water could identify promising site specific management strategies for the mekrou river basin in west africa the future impact of the dss will rely on the capacity of intermediaries to use and understand the software and the extent that farmers across the region are willing and able to adopt the resulting recommendations 4 3 participatory approaches challenging yet essential lindblom et al 2013 state that the single unifying predictor of success or failure of a dss is the extent to which end users are involved in its development this aligns with the reality that the adoption process involves users continually re evaluating whether the attributes of management practices contribute to their aspirations within the constraints of the assets available lindblom et al 2013 therefore a development process that aims to understand end user aspirations capacities and innovation needs and aligns the attributes of the irrigation dss with these would be expected to achieve greater impact jakku and thorburn 2010 and van meensel et al 2012 illustrate effective participatory approaches that developed dss deemed useful by farmers they emphasise the role of co learning by a range of stakeholders involved in the participatory process with farmers considered experts in their domain and scientists recognising the need to prioritise understanding over technicality agricultural innovation is viewed as a complex interactive and iterative process of review act and reflect as opposed to scientists creating a technology and the adoption pathway simply focused on persuading farmers to implement it key factors influencing the success of the participatory approach carried out by van meensel et al 2012 include 1 selection of appropriate stakeholders and a high level of transparency among them 2 constructive collaboration among stakeholders and common goals for the dss and 3 flexibility in the development process respecting the available time and scope but accepting adaptation during the process and not following a priori road map richards et al 2008 describes another example of extensive industry and user consultation in the development of hydro logic to deliver a simple focussed irrigation dss with intermediate rather than complex and therefore accessible software following its initial release in australia in 2003 there was ongoing system development in response to continued research and evaluation of end use and in 2007 a survey of registered users revealed 30 implementation by farmers for irrigation management decisions jakku and thorburn 2010 suggest stakeholders involved in dss development consider four potential outcomes of participatory dss development 1 ongoing use of the technology 2 co creation of management recommendations 3 improved understanding but no practice change and 4 rejection of the technology while outcome 1 is traditionally viewed as successful adoption the evaluation of all outcomes paints a wider picture of the extent of uptake and use of the technology indeed success can be viewed through many lenses jakku and thorburn 2010 evaluated the outcomes of participation in co creating the watersense dss and considered actions consistent with outcomes 2 and 3 to be a success this approach aligns with wilkinson 2011 who describe adoption as a non linear process that may be gradual step wise and or may result in only partial implementation or even dis adoption as described above marianne et al 2012 show that dss can be used to characterise the diversity of uses and user situations to identify the need for flexibility in a dss as well as identification of new concepts through a series of workshops with designers and users marianne et al 2012 co created the cetiom dss and attributed success of their work to the iterative processes in which the prototype tool was tested and refined with end users in line with point 2 above lynch and gregor 2004 highlighted the need to broaden the constructs of both participation and adoption success along with mackrell et al 2009 they noted that structured survey methods are insufficient to capture the resulting range of outcomes and that qualitative interpretative studies must be factored into funding and activity timelines in our experience end users often learn as much through the participatory co learning process as they do in using dss per se suggesting that the dss provide a platform in which different agricultural paradigms can be proposed contrasted and debated in many cases success could even be defined as dis adoption of a dss because the heuristics have been learnt and can be applied mentally by end users without support from the dss although participatory approaches are vital to success the size of the end user population to be surveyed and the number of proposed iterations requires careful consideration at the outset further if a wide range of end users are involved in the design of a dss their views and needs often vary e g harrison et al 2017 selecting the most common viewpoint arising from participatory approaches may address the needs of the largest part of the target population of end users but may not necessarily have the greatest impact harrison et al 2017 2016a further work is required to determine which views arising from participatory processes surveys semi structured interviews and other information gathering processes are the most important and or will maximise future adoption of the dss 5 conclusions the objectives of this review were to 1 review the functionality and intended end users of economic dss for irrigated cropping systems 2 document the extent to which these dss account for uncertainty in dss outputs 3 examine tactical or strategic decisions able to be explored in dss with irrigation infrastructure being a key strategic decision and 4 explore the human and social factors influencing adoption of dss heuristics we showed that many dss have focussed on either tactical or strategic decision making but only the dss waterworks accounted for both tactical and strategic decision making we found that few dss show measures of uncertainty in their outputs e g standard deviation associated with a mean though reasons for this are unclear it is possible that uncertainty is not well understood by end users or is unable to be adequately quantified and intuitively displayed by dss developers we suggest that simple statistics shown in an intuitive and transparent fashion e g standard deviations ranges or percentiles would go a long way towards helping end users understand potential variability associated with dss outputs we also found that only waterworks allowed contrasting between alternative forms of irrigation infrastructure a lack of dss comparing economic implications of alternative irrigation systems and investment may be a reflection of the limited experimental data comparing yields and profitability of alternative forms of irrigation in the field our findings suggest that waterworks is perhaps most developed in terms of the functional aspects of our aims another key conclusion of our work was that very few dss have been applied in multiple regions the vast majority of dss have been applied only in the regions in which they were developed this observation may be underpinned by either 1 a lack of willingness to use or adapt existing dss in new environments 2 a lack of extension or awareness of existing dss 3 the presence of socio economic or cultural barriers preventing adoption of existing dss or 4 combinations of these reasons lack of widespread use of dss across regions is another area deserving of further study importantly the clear distinction should be made between the adoption of dss per se vs the adoption of dss heuristics adoption and perpetual use of dss does not necessarily indicate cumulative adoption of a given heuristic or paradigm promulgated by a dss in fact disuse of dss may indicate that knowledge transfer has been entirely successful wherein the knowledge extended by the dss is no longer required by the end user improving the adoption of future dss heuristics may require addressing socio economic and cultural problems associated with implementation including the limited alignment of dss features with end user aspirations viz historical top down approaches capacities and innovation needs perceived relative advantage of an innovation reversibility trialability and training to build the human and social capacity required to build trust and confidence in the technology to address these issues future design and development of dss should be demand driven and be conducted in an iterative participatory learning process providing manifold ways in which stakeholders can learn from and choose to implement the knowledge technology or skills gained through such dialogue credit authorship contribution statement mth conceived the study ia lt and mth wrote

9907,water deficit and conventional production mode limited agriculture sustainable development on the loess plateau crop rotation and conservation tillage appears to serve as an effective strategy to

harvesting of wheat and maize in each plot the gravimetric method was used to determine soil moisture content for all treatments and the more details of the operation were described in zhang et al

was uneven distribution approximately 60 of the total rainfall was concentrated in july to september fig 2 for each rotation cycle the precipitation distribution pattern during growing and fallow period were quite different which rest on different cropping systems in growth period average precipitation of ww was 399 mm accounted for 41 of total precipitation in every rotation cycle while it turned to being 558 mm 57 and 689 mm 71 in wm and mm respectively within the fallow period average precipitation of ww was 571 mm much more than 414 and 281 mm in wm and mm 3 2 crop yield and economic profit cropping system significantly affected grain yield and economic profit all the time in 12 years trails tillage method affected grain yield and economic profit after three cycle the mean yield and economic profit were highly variable across the different cropping systems table 2 and table 3 the wm and mm increased grain yield by 61 5 and 124 1 p 0 05 and increased economic profits by 153 6 and 265 7 compared to ww respectively the ww suffered from economic loss due to the extremely lower precipitation in cycle 6 but the wm and mm were always profitable economically for all cycle for tillage methods average yield and economic profit of st were slightly higher compared to ct with the maximum increase of 9 3 under mm and 31 8 under ww nevertheless this increasing tendency appeared only in the last three rotation cycles suggesting rotation cycle also was the important factor affecting yield and economic profit 3 3 evapotranspiration during growth period and water use efficiency average evapotranspiration in growth period et and water use efficiency wue were affected by cropping system and tillage method table 4 et with the order as follows mm st mm ct wm st ww st wm ct ww ct and the tendency of wue was ranked as mm st mm ct wm st wm ct ww st ww ct for cropping systems wue under mm was always the highest for every cycle although the et under wm was lower than ww in cycle 1 wm and mm enhanced et compared with ww in most scenarios for tillage methods et and wue was higher with st compared to that with ct generally by an average of 32 5 mm 1 3 in ww 18 6 mm 6 6 in wm and 8 1 mm 8 1 in mm respectively 3 4 precipitation storage and loss during fallow stage precipitation storage ps and loss pl were significantly affected by cropping system and tillage method fig 3 for cropping systems the ww had higher ps in most cycles compared to wm and mm affected by precipitation amount and fallow time the mm even showed a negative increase in cycle 3 for tillage methods the st showed better ps mean value 153 5 mm through the whole cycle six cycles results showed that mm with st mean value 211 1 mm had a proportionately lowest pl and ww with ct mean value 345 8 mm showed a relatively highest pl but no significantly different between mm and wm except that in cycle 1 and 5 3 5 temporal and spatial dynamics of soil water storage in 0 200 cm layers after each cycle with the passage of time soil water storage of ww and mm showed a decreasing trend in 0 200 cm layers compared to pre experiment fig 4 wm maintained soil water storage at a high level all the time and st could ease the downward trend relative to ct we further explored the soil water condition at different soil layers in fig 5 in 0 100 cm layers the sws under ww and wm were a dynamic in consumption and replenishment but a decreasing tendency was shown in mm while the ww consumed soil water continually in 100 200 cm and cv also confirm the results fig 6 the lower value of its the better temporal stability of soil water storage would be the temporal stability of soil water storage in 0 100 cm layers was ranked as ww st wm st ww ct wm ct mm st mm ct on the contrary the rank in 100 200 cm layers was mm st mm ct wm st wm ct ww st ww ct 3 6 soil water balance soil water balance with cropping systems and tillage methods is illustrated in fig 7 in ww the soil water deficit mainly occurred in 100 200 cm layers total decreased at a rate of 16 5 mm per cycle et accounted for 66 7 of output and pl accounted for 33 3 and that phenomenon was observed in 0 100 cm layers total loss with the rate of 13 6 mm per rotation cycle under mm et and pl accounted for 77 8 and 22 2 of output respectively however the wm can keep a better soil water condition compared to ww and mm in addition st increased soil water balance by reducing precipitation loss compared to ct 3 7 correlation analysis correlation analysis showed that pg and et were positive to yield and wue but pf pl and ps were negative to yield and wue fig 8 furthermore the significant negative relationship was found between et pl and soil water balance moreover there was a positive relationship observed between ps and soil water balance in addition there was no correlation between precipitation and soil water balance 4 discussion 4 1 crop yield and economic profit grain yield and economic profit were highly variable across every cycle in different cropping systems which caused by water stress implying precipitation played a critical role in the maintenance of grain yield nielsen and vigil 2010 moitzi et al 2019 as we all known the maize and wheat water requirements are similar and approximately 430 mm sun et al 2010 the precipitation during spring maize growth period basically can support maize growth combining with soil water while the precipitation during winter wheat growth period cannot meet the needs of wheat growth thus leading to the lower grain yield and economic profit therefore reasonable cropping system matching the growth period to the precipitation characteristics is the effective and sustainable way to increase grain yield in dryland recent evidence suggested that crop rotation was an effective method of increasing grain yield in most cases nielsen and vigil 2018 in our study a yield rises in wm by 2 8 3 9 compared to ww however the yield declines in wm compared to mm was also observed which is inconsistent with the results of berzsenyi et al 2000 sun et al 2018a found that a negative effect of cereal crop rotation on maize might be related to the soil water period at key growth periods in this experiment there is a large difference between wheat and maize yields and the increasing yield of wheat under wm system is not enough to make up for the yield gap between wheat and maize we speculate that the yield difference between wm and mm system might be related to crop characters subsoiling played a considerable part in stabilizing and increasing crop yields from the rainfed production systems of dryland sang et al 2016 in this experiment st significantly increased the wheat and maize yields when compared with ct in three cropping systems these findings were agreed with previous studies showing that subsoiling ameliorates soil physical properties promote soil water storage increasing production ultimately ma et al 2015 meanwhile the positive effect of tillage cropping system to yield and economic profit was consisting with fischer et al 2002 and sun et al 2018a but subsoiling is not widely adopted by farmers in this region due to the expensive machinery cost and no significant change of grain yield in early period the long term experimental results showed that the economic profit from the increase yield by subsoiling is higher than the machinery cost however this is immeasurable that the benefits it brings not only in soil structure and water availability but also in yield sustainability 4 2 precipitation storage loss and water use fallow period providing an opportunity to preserve more precipitation in the soil not only can relieve the water deficit caused by crop growth but also creates a good soil moisture conditions for the follow crop lópez bellido et al 1997 zhang et al 2019a the fallow period duration for mm is longer than ww 14 months vs 6 months in one rotation cycle while the precipitation during fallow is lower than that in ww thus the highest precipitation storage was observed in the ww and the lowest was observed in the mm for the view of whole cycle we believe that it is more meaningful to analyze precipitation loss than storage the lower precipitation loss occurs in mm and wm in every cycle suggesting that there was more precipitation used by crop growth or storage in the soil meanwhile a number of researchers have reported subsoiling plays an active role in precipitation storage and precipitation use efficiency during fallow period temesgen et al 2009 sun et al 2018b our study also showed the same tendency in three cropping systems achieving more efficiency of water is a primary goal for crop management of dryland agriculture peterson et al 1996 in the present study the highest wue and evapotranspiration were observed in mm system due to the high maize yield and precipitation in growth period wang et al 2018b found a higher ecosystem wue for c4 crop maize than for c3 crop wheat owing to the characteristics of species which increase biomass matter with same situation in c4 is faster than c3 plants wang et al 2012 moreover st can also improve et and wue compared to ct in three cropping systems our findings are consistent with previous research in the similar region zhang et al 2019a precipitation cannot meet the demand of wheat growth and the lacking water of wheat growth is acquired from the stored soil water approximately accounting for 60 70 of crop water consumption guan et al 2015 we found that the soil water deplete occurs during wheat growth season similar finding is reported by huang et al 2003b and the same phenomenon is also observed in other cropping systems also suggesting the crucial of precipitation storage in fallow period to recover soil moisture 4 3 soil water sustainability soil water sustainability is a primary factor restricts the development of dryland agriculture ding et al 2016 we analyze soil water status after each rotation cycle from soil water temporal stability spatial variability and soil balance three aspects to access soil water sustainability the temporal stability is defined as the temporal persistence of a spatial pattern or as time invariant association between spatial locations and statistical measures of soil properties such as soil water storage vachaud et al 1985 our study found that the wm with st presents the strong temporal stability suggesting this cropping system can keep balance between soil water consumption during growth period and precipitation storage during fallow period a number of studies illustrate that vegetation characteristics such as leaf area index lai is essential for temporal stability of soil water storage baroni et al 2013 jia and shao 2013 mohanty et al 2000 found that crop growth cycles and tillage method significantly affect the evolution of soil water spatial structure in relatively uniform soil properties and flat topography field the ww has a long crop cover period 9 months but has a high precipitation loss during fallow period although the mm has large lai compare to wheat the et is also higher than ww therefore the two continuous cropping systems have lower soil water storage temporal stability the wm realizes the advantage of two crops complement each other thereby gain then strong temporal stability meanwhile st not only can affect crop growth but also can preserve soil water maintain soil water temporal stability ultimately rosenbaum et al 2012 pointed out that the top soil water storage variation is mainly related to precipitation while the soil water content dynamics in the subsoil due to crop root water uptake in our study the cv in 0 100 cm layer under mm was higher than other cropping systems on the contrary in 100 200 cm layer the cv of ww system is lower than other cropping systems these findings show that wheat consumed more water in the deep soil than maize and st decrease the cv compared to ct suggesting st can keep soil space water balance winter wheat is a deep rooted crop jin et al 2007 while maize roots are mostly distributed in the 0 80 cm soil layer meanwhile root plays a critical role of soil water absorb xue et al 2019 therefore the wm system with st weakens the spatial variability of soil moisture by deep and shallow roots soil water storage declined during crop grown period while supplemented during the fallow but the average soil water balance still showed a slightly decline tendency in ww and mm with both two tillage methods wang et al 2020 also found that whether in dry or normal years the soil water balance values were negative under maize continuous cropping system if things go on like this decline tendency it will not be conducive to the sustainable development of agriculture same as zhang et al 2019b suggestion crop rotation should perform to prevent soil water deficit correlation analysis shows that et pl were positive to soil water balance and ps was negative to soil water balance suggesting that enhance precipitation storage and decrease loss during fallow period by conservation tillage is still the important factor in dryland agriculture in addition crop water use will take into account when designing cropping system to prevent soil water deficit 5 conclusion the highest yield and wue with the lowest rainfall loss during fallow period were observed in mm st but the higher water consumption of this cropping system resulted in soil water deficit and it is not conducive to sustainable development compare to the two continuous cropping systems the wm increased temporal stability decreased spatial variability of soil water storage and maintained soil water balance nonetheless it was better than ww but worse than mm in terms of grain yield and wue additionally subsoiling tillage was the efficient measure in improving precipitation storage and water use efficiency across the above three cropping systems increasing precipitation storage and reducing loss still be the most important goal in rainfed farmland and a suitable cropping system also an efficiency method that make better use of precipitation by adjusting the distribution of precipitation in additional when selecting crop species the crop water use should be taken into consideration to keep soil water balance overall we are willing to recommend replacing ww ct with wm st to prevent soil water deficit and ensure the safety of grain and forage crops we hope that our research will be helpful in selecting appropriate cropping system and tillage method according to precipitation characteristics to achieve sustainable development of yield and moisture in dryland region nevertheless the study only analyzes indicators in rotation cycle as a whole the mechanism of how crop rotation and tillage method affect wheat and maize growth has not been studied additionally soil structure chemical properties and biological characteristics should be studied in

significance the level of 0 05 figures were generated using sigmaplot 12 5 3 results 3 1 characteristics of precipitation an obvious character of precipitation throughout the year in our study area was uneven distribution approximately 60 of the total rainfall was concentrated in july to september fig 2 for each rotation cycle the precipitation distribution pattern during growing and fallow period were quite different which rest on different cropping systems in growth period average precipitation of ww was 399 mm accounted for 41 of total precipitation in every rotation cycle while it turned to being 558 mm 57 and 689 mm 71 in wm and mm respectively within the fallow period average precipitation of ww was 571 mm much more than 414 and 281 mm in wm and mm 3 2 crop yield and economic profit cropping system significantly affected grain yield and economic profit all the time in 12 years trails tillage method affected grain yield and economic profit after three cycle the mean yield and economic profit were highly variable across the different cropping systems table 2 and table 3 the wm and mm increased grain yield by 61 5 and 124 1 p 0 05 and increased economic profits by 153 6 and 265 7 compared to ww respectively the ww suffered from economic loss due to the extremely lower precipitation in cycle 6 but the wm and mm were always profitable economically for all cycle for tillage methods average yield and economic profit of st were slightly higher compared to ct with the maximum increase of 9 3 under mm and 31 8 under ww nevertheless this increasing tendency appeared only in the last three rotation cycles suggesting rotation cycle also was the important factor affecting yield and economic profit 3 3 evapotranspiration during growth period and water use efficiency average evapotranspiration in growth period et and water use efficiency wue were affected by cropping system and tillage method table 4 et with the order as follows mm st mm ct wm st ww st wm ct ww ct and the tendency of wue was ranked as mm st mm ct wm st wm ct ww st ww ct for cropping systems wue under mm was always the highest for every cycle although the et under wm was lower than ww in cycle 1 wm and mm enhanced et compared with ww in most scenarios for tillage methods et and wue was higher with st compared to that with ct generally by an average of 32 5 mm 1 3 in ww 18 6 mm 6 6 in wm and 8 1 mm 8 1 in mm respectively 3 4 precipitation storage and loss during fallow stage precipitation storage ps and loss pl were significantly affected by cropping system and tillage method fig 3 for cropping systems the ww had higher ps in most cycles compared to wm and mm affected by precipitation amount and fallow time the mm even showed a negative increase in cycle 3 for tillage methods the st showed better ps mean value 153 5 mm through the whole cycle six cycles results showed that mm with st mean value 211 1 mm had a proportionately lowest pl and ww with ct mean value 345 8 mm showed a relatively highest pl but no significantly different between mm and wm except that in cycle 1 and 5 3 5 temporal and spatial dynamics of soil water storage in 0 200 cm layers after each cycle with the passage of time soil water storage of ww and mm showed a decreasing trend in 0 200 cm layers compared to pre experiment fig 4 wm maintained soil water storage at a high level all the time and st could ease the downward trend relative to ct we further explored the soil water condition at different soil layers in fig 5 in 0 100 cm layers the sws under ww and wm were a dynamic in consumption and replenishment but a decreasing tendency was shown in mm while the ww consumed soil water continually in 100 200 cm and cv also confirm the results fig 6 the lower value of its the better temporal stability of soil water storage would be the temporal stability of soil water storage in 0 100 cm layers was ranked as ww st wm st ww ct wm ct mm st mm ct on the contrary the rank in 100 200 cm layers was mm st mm ct wm st wm ct ww st ww ct 3 6 soil water balance soil water balance with cropping systems and tillage methods is illustrated in fig 7 in ww the soil water deficit mainly occurred in 100 200 cm layers total decreased at a rate of 16 5 mm per cycle et accounted for 66 7 of output and pl accounted for 33 3 and that phenomenon was observed in 0 100 cm layers total loss with the rate of 13 6 mm per rotation cycle under mm et and pl accounted for 77 8 and 22 2 of output respectively however the wm can keep a better soil water condition compared to ww and mm in addition st increased soil water balance by reducing precipitation loss compared to ct 3 7 correlation analysis correlation analysis showed that pg and et were positive to yield and wue but pf pl and ps were negative to yield and wue fig 8 furthermore the significant negative relationship was found between et pl and soil water balance moreover there was a positive relationship observed between ps and soil water balance in addition there was no correlation between precipitation and soil water balance 4 discussion 4 1 crop yield and economic profit grain yield and economic profit were highly variable across every cycle in different cropping systems which caused by water stress implying precipitation played a critical role in the maintenance of grain yield nielsen and vigil 2010 moitzi et al 2019 as we all known the maize and wheat water requirements are similar and approximately 430 mm sun et al 2010 the precipitation during spring maize growth period basically can support maize growth combining with soil water while the precipitation during winter wheat growth period cannot meet the needs of wheat growth thus leading to the lower grain yield and economic profit therefore reasonable cropping system matching the growth period to the precipitation characteristics is the effective and sustainable way to increase grain yield in dryland recent evidence suggested that crop rotation was an effective method of increasing grain yield in most cases nielsen and vigil 2018 in our study a yield rises in wm by 2 8 3 9 compared to ww however the yield declines in wm compared to mm was also observed which is inconsistent with the results of berzsenyi et al 2000 sun et al 2018a found that a negative effect of cereal crop rotation on maize might be related to the soil water period at key growth periods in this experiment there is a large difference between wheat and maize yields and the increasing yield of wheat under wm system is not enough to make up for the yield gap between wheat and maize we speculate that the yield difference between wm and mm system might be related to crop characters subsoiling played a considerable part in stabilizing and increasing crop yields from the rainfed production systems of dryland sang et al 2016 in this experiment st significantly increased the wheat and maize yields when compared with ct in three cropping systems these findings were agreed with previous studies showing that subsoiling ameliorates soil physical properties promote soil water storage increasing production ultimately ma et al 2015 meanwhile the positive effect of tillage cropping system to yield and economic profit was consisting with fischer et al 2002 and sun et al 2018a but subsoiling is not widely adopted by farmers in this region due to the expensive machinery cost and no significant change of grain yield in early period the long term experimental results showed that the economic profit from the increase yield by subsoiling is higher than the machinery cost however this is immeasurable that the benefits it brings not only in soil structure and water availability but also in yield sustainability 4 2 precipitation storage loss and water use fallow period providing an opportunity to preserve more precipitation in the soil not only can relieve the water deficit caused by crop growth but also creates a good soil moisture conditions for the follow crop lópez bellido et al 1997 zhang et al 2019a the fallow period duration for mm is longer than ww 14 months vs 6 months in one rotation cycle while the precipitation during fallow is lower than that in ww thus the highest precipitation storage was observed in the ww and the lowest was observed in the mm for the view of whole cycle we believe that it is more meaningful to analyze precipitation loss than storage the lower precipitation loss occurs in mm and wm in every cycle suggesting that there was more precipitation used by crop growth or storage in the soil meanwhile a number of researchers have reported subsoiling plays an active role in precipitation storage and precipitation use efficiency during fallow period temesgen et al 2009 sun et al 2018b our study also showed the same tendency in three cropping systems achieving more efficiency of water is a primary goal for crop management of dryland agriculture peterson et al 1996 in the present study the highest wue and evapotranspiration were observed in mm system due to the high maize yield and precipitation in growth period wang et al 2018b found a higher ecosystem wue for c4 crop maize than for c3 crop wheat owing to the characteristics of species which increase biomass matter with same situation in c4 is faster than c3 plants wang et al 2012 moreover st can also improve et and wue compared to ct in three cropping systems our findings are consistent with previous research in the similar region zhang et al 2019a precipitation cannot meet the demand of wheat growth and the lacking water of wheat growth is acquired from the stored soil water approximately accounting for 60 70 of crop water consumption guan et al 2015 we found that the soil water deplete occurs during wheat growth season similar finding is reported by huang et al 2003b and the same phenomenon is also observed in other cropping systems also suggesting the crucial of precipitation storage in fallow period to recover soil moisture 4 3 soil water sustainability soil water sustainability is a primary factor restricts the development of dryland agriculture ding et al 2016 we analyze soil water status after each rotation cycle from soil water temporal stability spatial variability and soil balance three aspects to access soil water sustainability the temporal stability is defined as the temporal persistence of a spatial pattern or as time invariant association between spatial locations and statistical measures of soil properties such as soil water storage vachaud et al 1985 our study found that the wm with st presents the strong temporal stability suggesting this cropping system can keep balance between soil water consumption during growth period and precipitation storage during fallow period a number of studies illustrate that vegetation characteristics such as leaf area index lai is essential for temporal stability of soil water storage baroni et al 2013 jia and shao 2013 mohanty et al 2000 found that crop growth cycles and tillage method significantly affect the evolution of soil water spatial structure in relatively uniform soil properties and flat topography field the ww has a long crop cover period 9 months but has a high precipitation loss during fallow period although the mm has large lai compare to wheat the et is also higher than ww therefore the two continuous cropping systems have lower soil water storage temporal stability the wm realizes the advantage of two crops complement each other thereby gain then strong temporal stability meanwhile st not only can affect crop growth but also can preserve soil water maintain soil water temporal stability ultimately rosenbaum et al 2012 pointed out that the top soil water storage variation is mainly related to precipitation while the soil water content dynamics in the subsoil due to crop root water uptake in our study the cv in 0 100 cm layer under mm was higher than other cropping systems on the contrary in 100 200 cm layer the cv of ww system is lower than other cropping systems these findings show that wheat consumed more water in the deep soil than maize and st decrease the cv compared to ct suggesting st can keep soil space water balance winter wheat is a deep rooted crop jin et al 2007 while maize roots are mostly distributed in the 0 80 cm soil layer meanwhile root plays a critical role of soil water absorb xue et al 2019 therefore the wm system with st weakens the spatial variability of soil moisture by deep and shallow roots soil water storage declined during crop grown period while supplemented during the fallow but the average soil water balance still showed a slightly decline tendency in ww and mm with both two tillage methods wang et al 2020 also found that whether in dry or normal years the soil water balance values were negative under maize continuous cropping system if things go on like this decline tendency it will not be conducive to the sustainable development of agriculture same as zhang et al 2019b suggestion crop rotation should perform to prevent soil water deficit correlation analysis shows that et pl were positive to soil water balance and ps was negative to soil water balance suggesting that enhance precipitation storage and decrease loss during fallow period by conservation tillage is still the important factor in dryland agriculture in addition crop water use will take into account when designing cropping system to prevent soil water deficit 5 conclusion the highest yield and wue with the lowest rainfall loss during fallow period were observed in mm st but the higher water consumption of this cropping system resulted in soil water deficit and it is not conducive to sustainable development compare to the two continuous cropping systems the wm increased temporal stability decreased spatial variability of soil water storage and maintained soil water balance nonetheless it was better than ww but worse than mm in terms of grain yield and wue additionally subsoiling tillage was the efficient measure in improving precipitation storage and water use efficiency across the above three cropping systems increasing precipitation storage and reducing loss still be the most important goal in rainfed farmland and a suitable cropping system also an efficiency method that make better use of precipitation by adjusting the distribution of precipitation in additional when selecting crop species the crop water use should be taken into consideration to keep soil water balance overall we are willing to recommend replacing ww ct with wm st to prevent soil water deficit and ensure the safety of grain and forage crops we hope that our research will be helpful in selecting appropriate cropping system and tillage method according to precipitation characteristics to achieve sustainable development of yield and moisture in dryland region nevertheless the study only analyzes indicators in rotation cycle as a whole the mechanism of how crop rotation and tillage method affect wheat and maize growth has not been studied additionally soil structure chemical properties and biological characteristics should be studied in

different crops limited information is available dealing with the beneficial role of soil application of si on grape tomato under drought stress while no literature exists evaluating the positive role of si applied as a seed priming material on grape tomato under drought stress evaluating the comparative efficacy of these two si application methods seed priming and soil incorporation has never been tried before at least in grape tomato under drought stress this study attempts determining the beneficial role of si applied as seed priming or soil incorporation and recommending optimum dose at each application method under various levels of soil moisture availability we hypothesized that priming seed with si and soil incorporation would help alleviate negative impacts of drought stress on grape tomato therefore the objectives of the present study were to i evaluate the effects of si applied through seed priming and soil incorporation methods on grape tomato under water deﬁcit stress and ii determine the optimum dose of si under these application methods for improving drought tolerance in grape tomato 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and growth condition polyhouse experiments were conducted at the asian institute of technology 14 0791 n 100 6114 e pathum thani thailand during october 2019 to march 2020 seeds of grape tomato variety t309 were grown in the polyhouse where relative humidity ranged between 70 and 75 and temperature varied between 30º and 35ºc seeds were sown in peat moss filled disinfected tray which was kept inside the polyhouse for germination at the two leaf stage the seedlings were transplanted into pots one healthy and vigorous seedling per pot each of which contained 15 kg of soil the soil contained 22 17 61 2 5 and 0 011 sand silt clay organic matter and si content respectively after 7 days of seedling transplanting 112 5 kg n ha 1 50 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 100 kg k2o ha 1 were applied following the recommended fertilizer application for tomato cultivation by the department of agriculture ministry of agriculture and cooperatives royal thai government this fertilizer dose was applied in the form of urea 0 94 g pot 1 triple super phosphate 0 82 g pot 1 and potassium chloride 1 25 g pot 1 as 50 n 100 p2o5 and 100 k2o respectively a second split of the remaining 50 n 0 94 g pot 1 urea was applied as top dressing at 30 days after seedling transplanting all pots received uniform watering up to saturation until 14 days after transplanting for proper establishment of seedlings thereafter an artificial water deficit stress was imposed by withholding irrigation until the attainment of a preferred level of soil moisture 2 2 experimental design and treatment 2 2 1 experiment 1 seed priming of monosilicic acid by soil moisture study the experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design with factorial combination of five si doses and three soil moisture regimes replicated three times a commercial fertilizer in the form of monosilicic acid msa si oh 4 or h4sio4 marketed by the thai green agro co ltd was used as a source of si which contained 20 si there were five msa doses 0 0 063 0 125 0 25 and 0 5 mm prepared by adding 0 30 60 120 and 240 mg msa l 1 water and three soil moisture regimes that included a well watered condition of 100 fc moderate soil moisture level of 75 fc and a severe moisture deficit condition of 50 fc fig 1 the soil moisture regimes were selected based on datta et al 2009 ullah et al 2018 sirisuntornlak et al 2019 alam et al 2020 and chakma et al 2021 seeds of grape tomato were treated with five doses of msa solution seed and solution volume ratio was 1 5 w v at 28 2 c and kept for 24 h farooq et al 2006 after priming seeds with the respective msa doses the treated seeds were washed with distilled water followed by surface drying of seeds with blotting paper air drying under shade and storing for seven days before sowing both primed and non primed seeds were then sown in small plastic trays containing sterilized peat moss substrate for germination one 20 day old two leaf stage healthy and vigorous seedling was transplanted into each pot and each pot with one seedling was considered as one treatment combination soil moisture level was determined by the gravimetric method following datta et al 2009 the soil contained 42 moisture content at 100 fc other two soil moisture levels were established based on 100 fc where 75 and 50 fc corresponded to 31 5 and 21 soil moisture content respectively soil moisture content in each pot was monitored daily using a portable soil moisture meter sm150 soil moisture sensor sm150 delta t devices ltd cambridge uk throughout the crop growth period soil moisture level in each pot was adjusted to the desired level 100 75 and 50 fc by watering pots when soil moisture level dropped below the desired level 2 2 2 experiment 2 soil incorporation of silicic acid by soil moisture study a factorial experiment consisting of five msa doses 0 75 150 300 and 600 kg ha 1 applied as soil incorporation and the same soil moisture regimes used in experiment 1 was laid out in a completely randomized design replicated three times fig 1 the respective msa dose was applied into each pot one day before transplanting at 0 2 81 5 63 11 25 and 22 5 g pot 1 other arrangements for experiment 2 were similar as practiced in experiment 1 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 growth fruit yield parameters and irrigation water productivity data on plant height cm and leaf area cm2 plant 1 were recorded before harvesting the crop plant height was measured from the soil surface to the highest tip of leaf one day before harvest using a measuring tape whereas leaf area of individual plant was determined from leaf length and maximum width of a leaf as described by blanco and folegatti 2003 other growth parameters such as shoot dry matter and root dry matter g plant 1 were measured after fruit harvest by oven drying fresh shoot and root biomass samples at 72 c until constant weight fruit yield g plant 1 and number of fruit per plant were recorded at harvest irrigation water productivity kg m 3 was calculated by dividing fruit yield kg by total irrigation water input m3 ullah et al 2018 maneepitak et al 2019 2 3 2 fruit quality parameters fruit length cm was measured at harvest data on fruit ph were recorded using a ph meter model fivego f2 mettler toledo gmbh im langacher 44 8606 greifensee switzerland while total soluble solids tss content was measured from the juice of tomato fruit using a

distilled water and keeping it for 24 h in dark and dw is the dry weight after drying the turgid leaf samples in an oven for 48 h at 70 c electrolyte leakage was calculated using the conductivity method lafuente et al 1991 camejo et al 2005 tomato leaves of similar age group were cut equally into six discs and unwanted materials were removed by washing three times with deionized water the discs were kept vertically for 20 h after immersing into test tube containing 20 ml deionized water the electrical conductivity ec1 of the solution was then measured using a conductivity meter model eutech con 150 thermo scientific eutech instruments singapore electrical conductivity of the solution of killed tissues ec2 was measured after boiling the sample for 15 min and cooling it at room

two way analysis of variance anova using statistix 8 analytical software 2105 miller landing rd tallahassee fl 32312 usa software program the significance of the treatment effects was determined using the least significant difference test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 seed priming of monosilicic acid by soil moisture study the two way interaction between msa dose and soil moisture regime was not significant for most of the evaluated parameters except for fruit yield fruit number plant 1 and irrigation water productivity table 1 plant height was similar among msa doses and 0 25 mm msa dose resulted in the maximum plant height table 2 a drastic reduction in plant height was evident with decreasing soil moisture regime and 100 fc had 63 and 8 taller plants than 50 and 75 fc respectively leaf area was the maximum 19491 cm2 plant 1 at 0 25 mm msa dose which was 17 and 13 more than leaf area at 0 and 0 063 mm msa doses respectively table 2 leaf area was reduced by 88 and 36 at 50 and 75 fc respectively compared with leaf area at 100 fc shoot dry matter progressively increased with increasing msa dose and 0 5 mm msa dose had 12 more shoot dry matter than the control table 2 shoot dry matter decreased with decreasing soil moisture regime and it was reduced by 81 and 15 at 50 and 75 fc respectively compared with shoot dry matter at 100 fc priming seeds with 0 25 mm msa resulted in significantly higher root dry matter than all other doses with a maximum increase of 22 than the control table 2 among three soil moisture regimes 75 fc had 120 and 14 more root dry matter than 50 and 100 fc respectively the interactive effect between msa dose and soil moisture regime was highly significant p 0 01 for fruit yield table 1 there was no effect of msa dose on fruit yield at severe moisture deficit of 50 fc and the same was also mostly true at 75 fc table 3 maximum fruit yield was obtained when seeds were primed with 0 25 mm msa dose at 100 fc which was 41 20 12 and 31 higher than msa doses of 0 0 063 0 125 and 0 5 mm respectively at the same soil moisture regime at 75 fc 0 25 mm msa dose had 21 higher fruit yield than the control the main effect of msa dose and soil moisture regime as well as their interaction significantly affected fruit number plant 1 table 1 plants grown under severe moisture deficit of 50 fc produced the minimum number of fruits regardless of msa doses table 3 the same was also true for plants grown under 75 fc while priming seeds with 0 25 mm msa dose had the maximum fruit number plant 1 at 100 fc fruit number plant 1 was increased by 43 20 and 50 when seeds were primed with 0 25 mm msa dose at 100 fc compared with 0 0 063 and 0 5 mm msa doses respectively at the same soil moisture regime a highly significant p 0 01 individual and interactive effect of msa dose and soil moisture regime was observed on irrigation water productivity table 1 seed priming of msa had no effect on irrigation water productivity at 50 fc while msa dose of 0 125 mm had 30 higher irrigation water productivity than 0 and 0 5 mm msa dose at 75 fc table 3 at 100 fc 0 25 mm msa dose resulted in 41 26 14 and 33 higher irrigation water productivity than 0 0 063 0 125 and 0 5 mm msa doses respectively plants grown from seeds primed with 0 125 and 0 25 mm msa dose had longer fruits which was 12 longer than the control table 4 fruit length of plants exposed to 50 and 75 fc was reduced by 28 and 9 respectively compared with plants grown under 100 fc the individual and interactive effects between msa dose and soil moisture regime were not significant on fruit ph while tss gradually increased with decreasing soil moisture regime in which 50 fc resulted in 24 and 13 higher tss than tss at 100 and 75 fc respectively table 4 color index and electrolyte leakage was the maximum at 50 fc table 4 color index was reduced by 10 at 100 and 75 fc compared with 50 fc the corresponding decrease in electrolyte leakage was 17 and 10 respectively the lowest soil moisture level of 50 fc had the maximum spad value 62 6 which was reduced with increasing soil moisture content however it was not affected by msa dose table 4 priming seeds with 0 25 mm msa resulted in the highest lrwc which was statistically at par with lrwc at 0 5 mm msa but 7 higher than lrwc at the control table 4 a progressive decrease of 3 and 11 in lrwc was observed when soil moisture was reduced from 100 to 75 and 50 fc respectively 3 2 experiment 2 soil application of monosilicic acid by soil moisture study leaf area shoot dry matter fruit yield fruit number plant 1 and irrigation water productivity were significantly affected by the two way interaction between soil applied msa dose and soil moisture regime table 1 plants fertilized with 300 and 600 kg msa ha 1 were taller than the rest of the plants grown at 0 75 and 150 kg msa ha 1 table 5 decreasing soil moisture regime had a severe impact on plant height and plants at 50 fc were 45 shorter than plants at 100 fc the interaction between msa dose and soil moisture regime revealed no impact of msa dose on leaf area at 50 fc table 5 leaf area was significantly higher in plants by 78 81 and 83 fertilized with 150 kg msa ha 1 at 75 fc than leaf area at 0 75 and 600 kg msa ha 1 respectively at the same soil moisture regime under well watered condition of 100 fc plants fertilized with 300 kg msa ha 1 had the maximum leaf area which was statistically at par with leaf area at 75 and 150 kg msa ha 1 but 43 and 24 higher than leaf area at 0 and 600 kg msa ha 1 soil application of msa had no effect on shoot dry matter at 50 fc table 5 a progressive increase in shoot dry matter was observed with increasing msa dose at 75 fc it was maximized at 300 kg msa ha 1 33 4 g plant 1 and was 24 higher than the control application of msa at 300 kg ha 1 had maximum shoot dry matter at 100 fc which was statistically at par with all other msa doses at the same soil moisture regime plants fertilized with 300 kg msa ha 1 had the maximum root dry matter which was statistically similar with other msa doses but 33 and 20 higher than root dry matter at 0 and 600 kg msa ha 1 respectively table 5 root dry matter was reduced by 67 and 17 at 50 and 75 fc respectively compared with root dry matter at 100 fc the two way interaction between msa dose and soil moisture regime revealed that fruit yield was negatively affected by soil moisture deficit and application of msa had no effect even at the highest dose of 600 kg ha 1 at 50 fc table 6 under moderate soil moisture level of 75 fc msa applied at 300 kg ha 1 had maximum fruit yield which was 64 higher than 0 kg msa ha 1 at the same soil moisture regime fruit yield progressively increased with increasing msa dose and maximized at 300 kg msa ha 1 at 100 fc which was 38 and 19 higher than fruit yield at 0 and 600 kg msa ha 1 respectively at the same soil moisture regime plants grown at severe soil moisture deficit of 50 fc produced a smaller number of fruit plant 1 where msa application had no effect table 6 application of msa at 300 kg ha 1 resulted in the maximum number of fruit plant 1 at 75 and 100 fc which was reduced by 56 and 39 at 0 kg msa ha 1 at the respective soil moisture regimes irrigation water productivity remained similar at 50 fc across msa doses while it was the maximum at 300 kg msa ha 1 at 75 and 100 fc table 6 irrigation water productivity at 75 and 100 fc was 69 and 38 higher respectively at 300 kg msa ha 1 compared with the control plants grown under well watered condition of 100 fc produced 11 and 41 longer fruits than plants at 75 and 50 fc respectively table 7 the individual and interactive effects between msa dose and soil moisture regime were not significant on fruit ph while tss gradually increased with decreasing soil moisture regime in which 50 fc resulted in 21 and 7 higher tss than 100 and 75 fc respectively table 7 soil moisture regimes of 50 and 75 fc had statistically similar color index 59 2 and 57 3 respectively which was significantly higher than color index at 100 fc 53 1 table 7 the main effect of soil moisture regime had a significant effect on spad value where 50 fc had significantly higher spad value 56 3 than spad value at 100 fc 53 4 table 7 leaf relative water content was decreased by 9 and 18 when soil moisture level was reduced from 100 to 75 and 50 fc respectively table 7 an increase in electrolyte leakage with decreasing soil moisture level was evident and 50 fc had 14 and 9 more electrolyte leakage than electrolyte leakage at 100 and 75 fc respectively table 7 4 discussion drought is one of the most severe abiotic stresses which adversely affects normal physiological morphological and biochemical processes of plants and drastically reduces crop yields on a global scale ullah et al 2017 2018 sirisuntornlak et al 2019 in this study overall growth fruit yield and quality of grape tomato were seriously affected by soil moisture deficit the present findings are similar to pervez et al 2009 mingchi et al 2010 and rezaei et al 2012 who also noted a considerable drought stress induced decrease in plant height leaf area shoot dry matter and root length drought stress induced growth reduction in the form of reduced plant height leaf area shoot dry matter and root dry matter has been attributed to an overall inhibition of cell division and cell elongation processes of higher plants farooq et al 2009 drought stress negatively affects cell growth due to a reduction in turgor pressure drought stress interrupts water flow from the xylem to the surrounding elongating cells resulting in an inhibition of cell elongation process farooq et al 2009 moreover the decrease in plant biomass production under drought stress also results from a reduction in photosynthetic activity and translocation rate of assimilates due to low leaf water potential decreased stomatal opening and an inhibition of chloroplast activity sokoto and muhammad 2014 drought stress induced reduction in total fruit yield could be due to i less number of trusses and pre harvest fruit drop resulting from limited carbohydrate availability owing to a reduced photosynthetic rate lopez et al 2012 halo et al 2020 and ii less number of flower plant 1 resulting from floral abortion which contributes to a smaller number of fruit plant 1 pulupol et al 1996 zegbe et al 2006 a significant decrease in irrigation water productivity was observed at lower soil moisture regimes which is mainly due to a drastic reduction in fruit yield rather than a decrease in water input however certain quality parameters of tomato fruit improve under water deficit stress numerous studies have revealed that an enhancement of fruit quality is invariably paralleled with the undesirable yield depression under drought stress especially small fruit size kirda et al 2004 kuscu et al 2014 chen et al 2014 wu et al 2021 in the present study some of the quality parameters such as tss and color index improved under moisture deficit conditions of 75 and 50 fc similarly chen et al 2014 and nangare et al 2016 also observed a significant improvement in most of the quality parameters fruit ph tss and color index of tomato in response to water deficit stress wu et al 2021 reported higher contents of soluble solids vitamin c and soluble sugar of greenhouse grown tomato fruits under reduced water supply 50 and 75 actual evapotranspiration compared with the highest water supply 100 actual evapotranspiration nuruddin et al 2003 evaluated the response of greenhouse grown tomato to drought stress imposed at different growth stages and observed lower tss and color index in plants grown under nonstressed condition or grown under stress applied only at flowering stage compared with plants grown under drought stress throughout the entire growth period water deficit stress causes a reduction in the transport of water within plant however the distribution of photo assimilates remains unaffected zegbe et al 2006 the water level within fruits is reduced due to a drought stress mediated reduction in the transport of water within plant which causes a reduction in fruit size and low dilution this in turn promotes accumulation of assimilates within fruits resulting in an improvement in quality parameters zegbe domınguez et al 2003 kuscu et al 2014 an improvement in tss due to water deficit stress has been attributed to higher conversion of starch to sugars zegbe domınguez et al 2003 the harmful effects of water deficit stress on crop growth and yield are dependent on the degree of water deficit and the crop growth stage chen et al 2014 observed that both yield and fruit quality of tomato were susceptible to water deficit at flowering fruit development and fruit ripening stages however these parameters were not sensitive to water deficit stress at vegetative stage unlike to the study of chen et al 2014 water deficit stress was artificially imposed during all growth stages in the present study and better fruit quality in terms of higher tss and color index at lower soil moisture level was observed the reason behind obtaining better fruit quality despite an exposure of grape tomato to water deficit stress during all growth stages is not clear which warrants further investigation this might be due to the fact that the water accumulation in the fruit under nonstressed condition causes the dilution of fruit ingredients du et al 2017 wu et al 2021 spad value is an indication of the level of chlorophyll in the leaf which is largely dependent on the degree of water supply tomato plants under drought stress produced leaves that were shorter in size and darker in green color compared with the plants grown under nonstressed condition rolando et al 2015 observed an increase in leaf greenness chlorophyll concentration measured by a spad meter of potato solanum tuberosum l under water stress and concluded that the increasing level of chlorophyll is an expression of more conservative strategies for plant under drought in addition sirisuntornlak et al 2019 observed a higher spad value in maize zea mays l plants grown under 75 fc compared with plants grown under 100 fc higher spad value observed at lower soil moisture regimes could be due to a greater concentration of chlorophyll photosynthetic pigment in the leaves having a small area alternatively chlorophyll pigment in the leaf tissues of drought stressed plants are concentrated in relation to a decline in leaf water content which ultimately leads to a high value of leaf greenness or dark green color songsri et al 2009 puangbut et al 2017 the ability of a plant to withstand drought stress is strongly linked to its capacity to restrict water loss from leaf epidermis after stomatal aperture reaches to the minimum muchow and sinclair 1989 a decrease in lrwc with decreasing soil moisture regimes observed during the present study clearly indicates the sensitivity of grape tomato to water deficit stress and its inability to restrict water loss leaf relative water content is a key indicator of water status in plants and a decrease in lrwc is one of the most important characteristics of drought stress this reduction in lrwc might be due to an increase in membrane permeability leaf relative conductivity and a reduction in water supply bai et al 2006 an increase in electrolyte leakage was observed under lower soil moisture regimes of 75 and 50 fc possibly because of cell membrane injury induced by water deficit stress bajji et al 2002 the integrity and stability of cell membranes are impaired under conditions of water deficit stress negatively affecting the rate of ion movement in and out of cells an increase in electrolyte leakage and respiration rate is a common response of plants exposed to a variety of abiotic stresses including drought due to stress induced oxidative damages abdelaal et al 2020 application of different exogenous protectants to alleviate the harmful effects of drought on crops has been a major consideration for agricultural researchers over time among these exogenous protectants application of various trace elements such as si is a commonly used approach for alleviating drought stress induced deleterious effects in plants ullah et al 2018 sirisuntornlak et al 2019 alam et al 2020 the ameliorative effects of si supplementation in enhancing plant tolerance against various biological and environmental stresses are well documented exogenous si application alleviates the antagonistic impacts of drought stress in tomato by i improving hydraulic conductivity resulting in an increase in root water uptake and enhancing cell wall integrity cao et al 2017 ii enhancing light energy distribution in chloroplasts and optimization of photosynthesis cao et al 2020 iii improving photosynthetic parameters decreasing the levels of ros in leaf chloroplast and maintaining the structure of chloroplast membrane cao et al 2015 and iv enhancing antioxidant defense capacity cao et al 2017 which culminate in improving growth and yield of plant ullah et al 2016 although the interactive effect between msa and soil moisture regime was mostly nonsignificant an overall trend of growth and yield improvement was evident with msa application the present results revealed a better response of grape tomato when seeds were primed with 0 25 mm msa dose in experiment 1 or when msa was soil incorporated at 300 kg ha 1 60 kg ha 1 soluble si in experiment 2 shi et al 2014 observed an improved seed germination decreased phenol contents in radicles and alleviation of oxidative stress in tomato in response to exogenous si application 0 5 mm sodium silicate solution gowda et al 2015 soil applied a special si fertilizer osv 5 containing 8 si at 750 kg ha 1 60 kg ha 1 soluble si along with the recommended npk fertilizer dose and observed longer tomato plants with more branches and fruit yield plant 1 than no supplementary si application a si induced improvement in dry matter of plant shoot and root was observed indicating the beneficial role of si in augmenting plant growth better growth of root systems is critical under water deficit stress enabling plants in maintaining plant water relations ullah et al 2016 observed a respective increase of about 35 and 45 in shoot and root dry matter of tomato plants grown with 50 ppm of si addition most of these benefits in response to exogenous application of si have been generally credited to increased root hydraulic conductance and cell wall stability higher root dry matter and improved root hydraulic conductance as a result of si application might confer grape tomato plants with better drought tolerance capacity other possible si mediated stress mitigating mechanisms involve a decrease in transpirational water loss and an enhancement in root water uptake and metabolism shi et al 2014 deposition of si on leaf surface and consequently a reduction in transpiration rate has been believed as a possible drought stress response gao et al 2006 however this is not always the case as no decrease in transpiration rate has been also observed as a result of si application in sorghum hattori et al 2005 and wheat gong et al 2005 therefore the mechanism of drought tolerance as a result of si application might be more linked with better water uptake the beneficial role of si in increasing yields under drought stress is well documented in various crops such as maize sirisuntornlak et al 2019 rice ullah et al 2018 wheat ahmed et al 2016 potato pilon et al 2014 and cantaloupe alam et al 2020 in the present study there was no effect of msa application on fruit yield and fruit number plant 1 at 50 fc this indicates that grape tomato plants cannot produce marketable yield at this lower soil moisture level even with supplementation of msa at the maximum dose of 0 5 mm as seed priming or 600 kg ha 1 as soil incorporation nonetheless msa supplementation was effective at moderate soil moisture regime of 75 fc where its application at 0 25 mm as a seed priming material or 300 kg ha 1 as soil incorporation resulted in higher fruit yield and fruit number plant 1 than most of the other msa doses at the same soil moisture regime this better yield response driven by msa application could be attributed to enhanced water uptake improved plant water relations and reduced transpiration rate at this soil moisture level 75 fc the same trend was also evident at 100 fc most probably due to better plant water relations and translocation of assimilates silicon mediated improvement in fruit yield at 75 and 100 fc is a cumulative result of better vegetative growth and yield contributing attributes irrigation water productivity remained similar and significantly lower at 50 fc across msa doses than all other treatment combinations which was due to lower fruit yield though total water input was also lower than other soil moisture regimes on the other hand msa seed priming at 0 25 mm or soil application at 300 kg ha 1 substantially increased irrigation water productivity at 75 fc which could be safely credited to higher fruit yield along with more water savings at 100 fc seed priming with msa at 0 25 mm or soil application at 300 kg msa ha 1 maximized irrigation water productivity as there was significantly higher fruit yields in these treatment combinations similarly marodin et al 2014 reported that exogenous application of si sio2 at 401 kg ha 1 maximized yield of tomato plants grown under unstressed condition which corresponds to our results at 100 fc in the present study there was no interaction effect between msa dose and soil moisture regime on fruit quality parameters regardless of application methods however the individual effect of msa dose was only significant on fruit length in seed priming study where msa application improved the length of fruit do nascimento et al 2020 also observed no significant improvement in quality characteristics pulp thickness pulp firmness and tss of melon fruits grown with a maximum of 800 kg ha 1 of diatomaceous earth source of si applied to sandy soil it has been reported that si does not translocate to fruits therefore it does not play any major role in changing fruit quality parameters especially tss confirming the lack of phytotoxicity of this element ouellette et al 2017 5 conclusions among abiotic stresses drought stress is the most general and formidable obstacle which restrains farmers from achieving optimal crop production and substantially reduces yields of all crops including grape tomato severe soil moisture deficit of 50 fc reduced growth fruit yield and irrigation water productivity of grape tomato in both studies exogenous application of msa was not effective at 50 fc regardless of application methods or doses at moderate 75 fc to well watered condition 100 fc msa application at 0 25 mm as a seed priming material or 300 kg ha 1 60 kg ha 1 soluble si applied as soil incorporation maximized fruit yield and irrigation water productivity of grape tomato on the other hand quality of grape tomato was improved at lower soil moisture level of 50 fc in both studies while msa application largely had no effect on fruit quality these results highlight the potential of exogenous si application in grape tomato grown under moderate to sufficient well watered soil moisture availability with opportunities to increase revenues and improve water productivity further studies in other soil types with different grape tomato cultivars under field conditions are needed to recommended inclusion of si in the fertilizer management

productivity of grape tomato solanum lycopersicon l var cerasiform under drought stress in the first experiment si in the form of monosilicic acid msa h4sio4 was applied as a seed priming material in

and 600 kg ha 1 under the same soil moisture regimes used in the first experiment the results revealed that fruit yield and irrigation water productivity were severely affected by soil moisture deficit at 50 fc while fruit quality was better at this soil moisture level fruit yield was reduced by 95 at 0 mm msa priming dose at 50 fc compared with fruit yield at 0 25 mm msa priming dose at 100 fc in the first experiment in the second experiment soil incorporation of msa at 300 kg ha 1 in combination with 100 fc maximized fruit yield which was reduced by 96 at 0 kg ha 1 msa dose in combination with 50 fc exogenous application of msa at 0 25 mm as a seed priming material and 300 kg ha 1 as soil incorporation 60 kg ha 1 soluble si also resulted in better fruit yield and irrigation water productivity at 75 fc priming seeds of grape tomato with msa at 0 25 mm or soil incorporating with 300 kg ha 1 could be recommended to enhance fruit yield of grape tomato grown under soil

different crops limited information is available dealing with the beneficial role of soil application of si on grape tomato under drought stress while no literature exists evaluating the positive role of si applied as a seed priming material on grape tomato under drought stress evaluating the comparative efficacy of these two si application methods seed priming and soil incorporation has never been tried before at least in grape tomato under drought stress this study attempts determining the beneficial role of si applied as seed priming or soil incorporation and recommending optimum dose at each application method under various levels of soil moisture availability we hypothesized that priming seed with si and soil incorporation would help alleviate negative impacts of drought stress on grape tomato therefore the objectives of the present study were to i evaluate the effects of si applied through seed priming and soil incorporation methods on grape tomato under water deﬁcit stress and ii determine the optimum dose of si under these application methods for improving drought tolerance in grape tomato 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and growth condition polyhouse experiments were conducted at the asian institute of technology 14 0791 n 100 6114 e pathum thani thailand during october 2019 to march 2020 seeds of grape tomato variety t309 were grown in the polyhouse where relative humidity ranged between 70 and 75 and temperature varied between 30º and 35ºc seeds were sown in peat moss filled disinfected tray which was kept inside the polyhouse for germination at the two leaf stage the seedlings were transplanted into pots one healthy and vigorous seedling per pot each of which contained 15 kg of soil the soil contained 22 17 61 2 5 and 0 011 sand silt clay organic matter and si content respectively after 7 days of seedling transplanting 112 5 kg n ha 1 50 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 100 kg k2o ha 1 were applied following the recommended fertilizer application for tomato cultivation by the department of agriculture ministry of agriculture and cooperatives royal thai government this fertilizer dose was applied in the form of urea 0 94 g pot 1 triple super phosphate 0 82 g pot 1 and potassium chloride 1 25 g pot 1 as 50 n 100 p2o5 and 100 k2o respectively a second split of the remaining 50 n 0 94 g pot 1 urea was applied as top dressing at 30 days after seedling transplanting all pots received uniform watering up to saturation until 14 days after transplanting for proper establishment of seedlings thereafter an artificial water deficit stress was imposed by withholding irrigation until the attainment of a preferred level of soil moisture 2 2 experimental design and treatment 2 2 1 experiment 1 seed priming of monosilicic acid by soil moisture study the experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design with factorial combination of five si doses and three soil moisture regimes replicated three times a commercial fertilizer in the form of monosilicic acid msa si oh 4 or h4sio4 marketed by the thai green agro co ltd was used as a source of si which contained 20 si there were five msa doses 0 0 063 0 125 0 25

moisture deficit condition of 50 fc fig 1 the soil moisture regimes were selected based on datta et al 2009 ullah et al 2018 sirisuntornlak et al 2019 alam et al 2020 and chakma et al 2021 seeds of grape tomato were treated with five doses of msa solution seed and solution volume ratio was 1 5 w v at 28 2 c and kept for 24 h farooq et al 2006 after priming seeds with the respective msa doses the treated seeds were washed with distilled water followed by surface drying of seeds with blotting paper air drying under shade and storing for seven days before sowing both primed and non primed seeds were then sown in small plastic trays containing sterilized peat moss substrate for germination one 20 day old two leaf stage healthy and vigorous seedling was transplanted into each pot and each pot with one seedling was considered as one treatment combination soil moisture level was determined by the gravimetric method following datta et al 2009 the soil contained 42 moisture content at 100 fc other two soil moisture levels were established based on 100 fc where 75 and 50 fc corresponded to 31 5 and 21 soil moisture content respectively soil moisture content in each pot was monitored daily using a portable soil moisture meter sm150 soil moisture sensor sm150 delta t devices ltd cambridge uk throughout the crop growth period soil moisture level in each pot was adjusted to the desired level 100 75 and 50 fc by watering pots when soil moisture level dropped below the desired level 2 2 2 experiment 2 soil incorporation of silicic acid by soil moisture study a factorial experiment consisting of five msa doses 0 75 150 300 and 600 kg ha 1 applied as soil incorporation and the same soil moisture regimes used in experiment 1 was laid out in a completely randomized design

and maximum width of a leaf as described by blanco and folegatti 2003 other growth parameters such as shoot dry matter and root dry matter g plant 1 were measured after fruit harvest by oven drying fresh shoot and root biomass samples at 72 c until constant weight fruit yield g plant 1 and number of fruit per plant were recorded at harvest irrigation water productivity kg m 3 was calculated by dividing fruit yield kg by total irrigation water input m3 ullah et al 2018 maneepitak et al 2019 2 3 2 fruit quality parameters fruit length cm was measured at harvest data on fruit ph were recorded

than msa doses of 0 0 063 0 125 and 0 5 mm respectively at the same soil moisture regime at 75 fc 0 25 mm msa dose had 21 higher fruit yield than the control the main effect of msa dose and soil moisture regime as well as their interaction significantly affected fruit number plant 1 table 1 plants grown under severe moisture deficit of 50 fc produced the minimum number of fruits regardless of msa doses table 3 the same was also true for plants grown under 75 fc while priming seeds with 0 25 mm msa dose had the maximum fruit number plant 1 at 100 fc fruit number plant 1 was increased by 43 20 and 50 when seeds were primed with 0 25 mm msa dose at 100 fc compared with 0 0 063 and 0 5 mm msa doses respectively at the same soil moisture regime a highly significant p 0 01 individual and interactive effect of msa dose and soil moisture regime was observed on irrigation water productivity table 1 seed priming of msa had no effect on irrigation water productivity at 50 fc while msa dose

fruit ph while tss gradually increased with decreasing soil moisture regime in which 50 fc resulted in 24 and 13 higher tss than tss at 100 and 75 fc respectively table 4 color index and electrolyte leakage was the maximum at 50 fc table 4 color index was reduced by 10 at 100 and 75 fc compared with 50 fc the corresponding decrease in electrolyte leakage was 17 and 10 respectively the lowest soil

in the highest lrwc which was statistically at par with lrwc at 0 5 mm msa but 7 higher than lrwc at the control table 4 a progressive decrease of 3 and 11 in lrwc was observed when soil moisture was reduced from 100 to 75 and 50 fc respectively 3 2 experiment 2 soil application of monosilicic acid by soil moisture study leaf area shoot dry matter fruit yield fruit number plant 1 and irrigation water productivity were significantly affected by the two way interaction between soil applied msa dose and soil moisture regime table 1 plants fertilized with 300 and 600 kg msa ha 1 were taller than the rest of the plants grown at 0 75 and 150 kg msa ha 1 table 5 decreasing soil moisture regime had a severe impact on plant height and plants at 50 fc were 45 shorter than plants at 100 fc the interaction between msa dose and soil moisture regime revealed no impact of msa dose on leaf area at 50 fc table 5 leaf area was significantly higher in plants by 78 81 and 83 fertilized with 150 kg msa ha 1 at 75 fc than leaf area at 0 75 and 600 kg msa ha 1 respectively at the same soil moisture regime under well watered condition of 100 fc plants fertilized with 300 kg msa ha 1 had the maximum leaf area which was statistically at par with leaf area at 75 and 150 kg msa ha 1 but 43 and 24 higher than leaf area at 0 and 600 kg msa ha 1 soil application of msa had no effect on shoot dry matter at 50 fc table 5 a progressive increase in shoot dry matter was observed with increasing msa dose at 75 fc it was maximized at 300 kg msa ha 1 33 4 g plant 1 and was 24 higher than the control application of msa at 300 kg ha 1 had maximum shoot dry matter at 100 fc which was statistically at par with all other msa doses at the same soil moisture regime plants fertilized with 300 kg msa ha 1 had the maximum root dry matter which was statistically similar with other msa doses but 33 and 20 higher than root dry matter at 0 and 600 kg msa ha 1 respectively table 5 root dry matter was reduced by 67 and 17 at 50 and 75 fc respectively compared with root dry matter at 100 fc the two way interaction between msa dose and soil moisture regime revealed that fruit yield was negatively affected by soil moisture deficit and application of msa had no effect even at the highest dose of 600 kg ha 1 at 50 fc table 6 under moderate soil moisture level of 75 fc msa applied at 300 kg ha 1 had maximum fruit yield which was 64 higher than 0 kg msa ha 1 at the same soil moisture regime fruit yield progressively increased with increasing msa dose and maximized at 300 kg msa ha 1 at 100 fc which was 38 and 19 higher than fruit yield at 0 and 600 kg msa ha 1 respectively at the same soil moisture regime plants grown at severe soil moisture deficit of 50 fc produced a smaller number of fruit plant 1 where msa application had no effect table 6 application of msa at 300 kg ha 1 resulted in the maximum number of fruit plant 1 at 75 and 100 fc which was reduced by 56 and 39 at 0 kg msa ha 1 at the respective soil moisture regimes irrigation water productivity remained similar at 50 fc across msa doses while it was the maximum at 300 kg msa ha 1 at 75 and 100 fc table 6 irrigation water productivity at 75 and 100 fc was 69 and 38 higher respectively at 300 kg msa ha 1 compared with the control plants grown under well watered condition of 100 fc produced 11 and 41 longer fruits than plants at 75 and 50 fc respectively table 7 the individual and interactive effects between msa dose and soil moisture regime were not significant on fruit ph while tss gradually increased with decreasing soil moisture regime in which 50 fc resulted in 21 and 7 higher tss than 100 and 75 fc respectively table 7 soil moisture regimes of 50 and 75 fc had statistically similar color index 59 2 and 57 3 respectively which was significantly higher than color index at 100 fc 53 1 table 7 the main effect of soil moisture regime had a significant effect on spad value where 50 fc had significantly higher spad value 56 3 than spad value at 100 fc 53 4 table 7 leaf relative water content was decreased by 9 and 18 when soil moisture level was reduced from 100 to 75 and 50 fc respectively table 7 an increase in electrolyte leakage with decreasing soil moisture level was evident and 50 fc had 14 and 9 more electrolyte leakage than electrolyte leakage at 100 and 75 fc respectively table 7 4 discussion drought is one of the most severe abiotic stresses which adversely affects normal physiological morphological and biochemical processes of plants and drastically reduces crop yields on a global scale ullah et al 2017 2018 sirisuntornlak et al 2019 in this study overall growth fruit yield and quality of grape tomato were seriously affected by soil moisture deficit the present findings are similar to pervez et al 2009 mingchi et al 2010 and rezaei et al 2012 who also noted a considerable drought stress induced decrease in plant height leaf area shoot dry matter and root length drought stress induced growth reduction in the form of reduced plant height leaf area shoot dry matter and root dry matter has been attributed to an overall inhibition of cell division and cell elongation processes of higher plants farooq et al 2009 drought stress negatively affects cell growth due to a reduction in turgor pressure drought stress interrupts water flow from the xylem to the surrounding elongating cells resulting in an inhibition of cell elongation process farooq et al 2009 moreover the decrease in plant biomass production under drought stress also results from a reduction in photosynthetic activity and translocation rate of assimilates due to low leaf water potential decreased stomatal opening and an inhibition of chloroplast activity sokoto and muhammad 2014 drought stress induced reduction in total fruit yield could be due to i less number of trusses and pre harvest fruit drop resulting from limited carbohydrate availability owing to a reduced photosynthetic rate lopez et al 2012 halo et al 2020 and ii less number of flower plant 1 resulting from floral abortion which contributes to a smaller number of fruit plant 1 pulupol et al 1996 zegbe et al 2006 a significant decrease in irrigation water productivity was observed at lower soil moisture regimes which is mainly due to a drastic reduction in fruit yield rather than a decrease in water input however certain quality parameters of tomato fruit improve under water deficit stress numerous studies have revealed that an enhancement of fruit quality is invariably paralleled with the undesirable yield depression under drought stress especially small fruit size kirda et al 2004 kuscu et al 2014 chen et al 2014 wu et al 2021 in the present study some of the quality parameters such as tss and color index improved under moisture deficit conditions of 75 and 50 fc similarly chen et al 2014 and nangare et al 2016 also observed a significant improvement in most of the quality parameters fruit ph tss and color index of tomato in response to water deficit stress wu et al 2021 reported higher contents of soluble solids vitamin c and soluble sugar of greenhouse grown tomato fruits under reduced water supply 50 and 75 actual evapotranspiration compared with the highest water supply 100 actual evapotranspiration nuruddin et al 2003 evaluated the response of greenhouse grown tomato to drought stress imposed at different growth stages and observed lower tss and color index in plants grown under nonstressed condition or grown under stress applied only at flowering stage compared with plants grown under drought stress throughout the entire growth period water deficit stress causes a reduction in the transport of water within plant however the distribution of photo assimilates remains unaffected zegbe et al 2006 the water level within fruits is reduced due to a drought stress mediated reduction in the transport of water within plant which causes a reduction in fruit size and low dilution this in turn promotes accumulation of assimilates within fruits resulting in an improvement in quality parameters zegbe domınguez et al 2003 kuscu et al 2014 an improvement in tss due to water deficit stress has been attributed to higher conversion of starch to sugars zegbe domınguez et al 2003 the harmful effects of water deficit stress on crop growth and yield are dependent on the degree of water deficit and the crop growth stage chen et al 2014 observed that both yield and fruit quality of tomato were susceptible to water deficit at flowering fruit development and fruit ripening stages however these parameters were not sensitive to water deficit stress at vegetative stage unlike to the study of chen et al 2014 water deficit stress was artificially imposed during all growth stages in the present study and better fruit quality in terms of higher tss and color index at lower soil moisture level was observed the reason behind obtaining better fruit quality despite an exposure of grape tomato to water deficit stress during all growth stages is not clear which warrants further investigation this might be due to the fact that the water accumulation in the fruit under nonstressed condition causes the dilution of fruit ingredients du et al 2017 wu et al 2021 spad value is an indication of the level of chlorophyll in the leaf which is largely dependent on the degree of water supply tomato plants under drought stress produced leaves that were shorter in size and darker in green color compared with the plants grown under nonstressed condition rolando et al 2015 observed an increase in leaf greenness chlorophyll concentration measured by a spad meter of potato solanum tuberosum l under water stress and concluded that the increasing level of chlorophyll is an expression of more conservative strategies for plant under drought in addition sirisuntornlak et al 2019 observed a higher spad value in maize zea mays l plants grown under 75 fc compared with plants grown under 100 fc higher spad value observed at lower soil moisture regimes could be due to a greater concentration of chlorophyll photosynthetic pigment in the leaves having a small area alternatively chlorophyll pigment in the leaf tissues of drought stressed plants are concentrated in relation to a decline in leaf water content which ultimately leads to a high value of leaf greenness or dark green color songsri et al 2009 puangbut et al 2017 the ability of a plant to withstand drought stress is strongly linked to its capacity to restrict water loss from leaf epidermis after stomatal aperture reaches to the minimum muchow and sinclair 1989 a decrease in lrwc with decreasing soil moisture regimes observed during the present study clearly indicates the sensitivity of grape tomato to water deficit stress and its inability to restrict water loss leaf relative water content is a key indicator of water status in plants and a decrease in lrwc is one of the most important characteristics of drought stress this reduction in lrwc might be due to an increase in membrane permeability leaf relative conductivity and a reduction in water supply bai et al 2006 an increase in electrolyte leakage was observed under lower soil moisture regimes of 75 and 50 fc possibly because of cell membrane injury induced by water deficit stress bajji et al 2002 the integrity and stability of cell membranes are impaired under conditions of water deficit stress negatively affecting the rate of ion movement in and out of cells an increase in electrolyte leakage and respiration rate is a common response of plants exposed to a variety of abiotic stresses including drought due to stress induced oxidative damages abdelaal et al 2020 application of different exogenous protectants to alleviate the harmful effects of drought on crops has been a major consideration for agricultural researchers over time among these exogenous protectants application of various trace elements such as si is a commonly used approach for alleviating drought stress induced deleterious effects in plants ullah et al 2018 sirisuntornlak et al 2019 alam et al 2020 the ameliorative effects of si supplementation in enhancing plant tolerance against various biological and environmental stresses are well documented exogenous si application alleviates the antagonistic impacts of drought stress in tomato by i improving hydraulic conductivity resulting in an increase in root water uptake and enhancing cell wall integrity cao et al 2017 ii enhancing light energy distribution in chloroplasts and optimization of photosynthesis cao et al 2020 iii improving photosynthetic parameters decreasing the levels of ros in leaf chloroplast and maintaining the structure of chloroplast membrane cao et al 2015 and iv enhancing antioxidant defense capacity cao et al 2017 which culminate in improving growth and yield of plant ullah et al 2016 although the interactive effect between msa and soil moisture regime was mostly nonsignificant an overall trend of growth and yield improvement was evident with msa application the present results revealed a better response of grape tomato when seeds were primed with 0 25 mm msa dose in experiment 1 or when msa was soil incorporated at 300 kg ha 1 60 kg ha 1 soluble si in experiment 2 shi et al 2014 observed an improved seed germination decreased phenol contents in radicles and alleviation of oxidative stress in tomato in response to exogenous si application 0 5 mm sodium silicate solution gowda et al 2015 soil applied a special si fertilizer osv 5 containing 8 si at 750 kg ha 1 60 kg ha 1 soluble si along with the recommended npk fertilizer dose and observed longer tomato plants with more branches and fruit yield plant 1 than no supplementary si application a si induced improvement in dry matter of plant shoot and root was observed indicating the beneficial role of si in augmenting plant growth better growth of root systems is critical under water deficit stress enabling plants in maintaining plant water relations ullah et al 2016 observed a respective increase of about 35 and 45 in shoot and root dry matter of tomato plants grown with 50 ppm of si addition most of these benefits in response to exogenous application of si have been generally credited to increased root hydraulic conductance and cell wall stability higher root dry matter and improved root hydraulic conductance as a result of si application might confer grape tomato plants with better drought tolerance capacity other possible si mediated stress mitigating mechanisms involve a decrease in transpirational water loss and an enhancement in root water uptake and metabolism shi et al 2014 deposition of si on leaf surface and consequently a reduction in transpiration rate has been believed as a possible drought stress response gao et al 2006 however this is not always the case as no decrease in transpiration rate has been also observed as a result of si application in sorghum hattori et al 2005 and wheat gong et al 2005 therefore the mechanism of drought tolerance as a result of si application might be more linked with better water uptake the beneficial role of si in increasing yields under drought stress is well documented in various crops such as maize sirisuntornlak et al 2019 rice ullah et al 2018 wheat ahmed et al 2016 potato pilon et al 2014 and cantaloupe alam et al 2020 in the present study there was no effect of msa application on fruit yield and fruit number plant 1 at 50 fc this indicates that grape tomato plants cannot produce marketable yield at this lower soil moisture level even with supplementation of msa at the maximum dose of 0 5 mm as seed priming or 600 kg ha 1 as soil incorporation nonetheless msa supplementation was effective at moderate soil moisture regime of 75 fc where its application at 0 25 mm as a seed priming material or 300 kg ha 1 as soil incorporation resulted in higher fruit yield and fruit number plant 1 than most of the other msa doses at the same soil moisture regime this better yield response driven by msa application could be attributed to enhanced water uptake improved plant water relations and reduced transpiration rate at this soil moisture level 75 fc the same trend was also evident at 100 fc most probably due to better plant water relations and translocation of assimilates silicon mediated improvement in fruit yield at 75 and 100 fc is a cumulative result of better vegetative growth and yield contributing attributes irrigation water productivity remained similar and significantly lower at 50 fc across msa doses than all other treatment combinations which was due to lower fruit yield though total water input was also lower than other soil moisture regimes on the other hand msa seed priming at 0 25 mm or soil application at 300 kg ha 1 substantially increased irrigation water productivity at 75 fc which could be safely credited to higher fruit yield along with more water savings at 100 fc seed priming with msa at 0 25 mm or soil application at 300 kg msa ha 1 maximized irrigation water productivity as there was significantly higher fruit yields in these treatment combinations similarly marodin et al 2014 reported that exogenous application of si sio2 at 401 kg ha 1 maximized yield of tomato plants grown under unstressed condition which corresponds to our results at 100 fc in the present study there was no interaction effect between msa dose and soil moisture regime on fruit quality parameters regardless of application methods however the individual effect of msa dose was only significant on fruit length in seed priming study where msa application improved the length of fruit do nascimento et al 2020 also observed no significant improvement in quality characteristics pulp thickness pulp firmness and tss of melon fruits grown with a maximum of 800 kg ha 1 of diatomaceous earth source of si applied to sandy soil it has been reported that si does not translocate to fruits therefore it does not play any major role in changing fruit quality parameters especially tss confirming the lack of phytotoxicity of this element ouellette et al 2017 5 conclusions among abiotic stresses drought stress is the most general and formidable obstacle which restrains farmers from achieving optimal crop production and substantially reduces yields of all crops including grape tomato severe soil moisture deficit of 50 fc reduced growth fruit yield and irrigation water productivity of grape tomato in both studies exogenous application of msa was not effective at 50 fc regardless of application methods or doses at moderate 75 fc to well watered condition 100 fc msa application at 0 25 mm as a seed priming material or 300 kg ha 1 60 kg ha 1 soluble si applied as soil incorporation maximized fruit yield and irrigation water productivity of grape tomato on the other hand quality of grape tomato was improved at lower soil moisture level of 50 fc in both studies while msa application largely had no effect on fruit quality these results highlight the potential of exogenous si application in grape tomato grown under moderate to sufficient well watered soil moisture availability with opportunities to increase revenues and improve water productivity further studies in other soil types with different grape tomato cultivars under field conditions are needed to recommended inclusion of si in the fertilizer management

accumulation of medicinal components are significantly affected by soil moisture appropriate soil moisture can promote root growth and increase yield but is not conducive to the synthesis of medicinal ingredients moreover water deficit can induce defensive and adaptive responses enhance secondary metabolism in the plant and increase the contents of medicinal ingredients gao and liang 2004 in plants such as astragalus membranaceus liang et al 2016 dendrobium moniliforme wu et al 2016 and salvia miltiorrhiza bunge liu et al 2011 however there is little research on water management especially water deficit in p notoginseng a pot experiment showed that a soil moisture content equal to 56 4 59 θ f where θ f is the field capacity was the most beneficial to the growth of p notoginseng and could effectively improve its yield and saponin content xia et al 2016 field experiments showed that different soil moisture contents were required in different growth stages to improve the yield and saponin content of p notoginseng the best irrigation water limit ranges are reportedly 60 65 θ f 45 50 θ f 85 90 θ f and 80 85 θ f in the seedling stage flowering stage fruiting stage and root weight gain stage respectively the fresh yield of p notoginseng was 5295 kg ha 1 and the water use efficiency was 3 03 kg m 3 yu et al 2006 fertilizer plays a positive role in increasing crop yield to improve production the application rate of chemical fertilizers in china reached 53 29 million tons in 2015 and the application rates of nitrogen fertilizer and agricultural compound fertilizer were 23 1 and 22 07 million tons respectively national statistical bureau of the people s republic of china 2015 he et al 2020 however excessive application of chemical fertilizers causes soil consolidation soil acidification nitrate pollution soil nutrient imbalance and deterioration and a high incidence of pests and diseases jin and xing 2018 xie et al 2019 the chinese government has discovered the seriousness of the problem and put forward a strategic concept for the replacement of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer the chinese ministry of agriculture and rural affairs proposed the action plan of zero growth in fertilizer and pesticide use by 2020 to reduce chemical fertilizer application he et al 2020 china s total chemical fertilizer application was 46 48 million tons in 2017 he et al 2020 the application of organic fertilizer promotes the growth and reproduction of soil microorganisms in farmland and improves soil fertility zhao et al 2020a 2020b tao et al 2014 and the contents of soil microbial biomass carbon smbc and nitrogen smbn ren et al 2018 in recent years the growth yield and saponin content of p notoginseng have been studied extensively in the context of chemical fertilizer the results showed that total pns content was 10 8 11 5 for three year old p notoginseng roots when 337 5 450 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilizer was applied wei et al 2008 furthermore when nitrogen fertilizer urea phosphorus fertilizer p 2 o 5 and potassium fertilizer k 2 o were applied at 71 60 149 37 kg ha 1 46 54 110 62 kg ha 1 and 236 35 444 72 kg ha 1 respectively the dry yield of roots was 861 54 1139 45 kg ha 1 for three year old p notoginseng yu et al 2015 however when these fertilizers were applied at 247 5 kg ha 1 450 kg ha 1 and 990 kg ha 1 respectively the dry yield of roots was 3881 37 kg ha 1 and the total pns content was 12 92 song et al 2019 in addition there are a few studies on the application of organic fertilizer in the cultivation process of p notoginseng liu et al 2012 found that with the application of 1 5 t ha 1 biological fertilizer per year the yield per plant of fresh roots from three year old p notoginseng was 31 17 g and the plants effectively avoided infection irrigation and fertilizer management can promote crop growth enhance the yield increase the accumulation of nutrients and reduce agricultural non point source pollution wang et al 2019 hao et al 2019 however how to effectively combine deficient irrigation and organic fertilizer to maintain yield improve saponin content increase water and fertilizer use efficiency and reduce the disease incidence rate of p notoginseng under shade cultivation needs further investigation in southwest regions of china therefore this study aimed at performing the green production of p notoginseng and 1 explored the effects of water deficit and organic fertilizer coupling on the yield saponin content water and fertilizer use efficiency and disease incidence rate of p notoginseng and 2 established two comprehensive benefit evaluation models of medicinal saponin content using the topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution and pca

ginsenoside r b1 and ginsenoside r d according to the pca and topsis model evaluation results and the data comparative analysis of each index the dmfm treatment is the best water deficit and organic fertilizer combination 4 discussion the purpose of water deficit irrigation and organic fertilizer treatment is to control the growth of aboveground and underground parts of crops by regulating soil moisture content and nutrients the water content of flowers and roots can be used to characterize the vitality of each part of the plant wei et al 2018 the results showed that water deficit had a significant effect on the flower and root of p notoginseng table 2 and table 3 flower water content w f and root water content w r increased with the increase in irrigation amount under severe deficit irrigation 35 20 θ f ds the dry root yield y r was the lowest but the fiber root weight density ρ f was the highest which indicates that the per unit volume of fiber roots was the largest this could be because the roots extend to grow in all directions to enlarge the contact area between the root and the soil and to obtain more soil moisture for plants when the water level is insufficient martorell et al 2012 in this study the water contents of flowers w f and roots w r of p notoginseng were the highest under light deficit irrigation 65 50 θ f dl but the saponin content pns and growth were inhibited which meant yield was not the highest table 2 and table 3 the dry flower yield y f dry root yield y r rhizome main root length l 4 5 branch root length l 6 and main root diameter d 2 of p notoginseng were the best under medium water deficit irrigation 50 35 θ f dm table 3 because moderate water deficit irrigation is beneficial for the accumulation of plant polysaccharides and promoted the growth of medicinal plants wu et al 2016 however xia s research xia et al 2016 showed that the most conducive soil moisture content to the growth of p notoginseng was 56 4 59 θ f because there are many differences in field and pot experiments the plants grew in pots were seriously influenced by the boundary effect and soil water transport conditions furthermore the contact surface with atmosphere in pot is lower than field resulting in a higher range of suitable soil moisture content ginsenosides r g1 and r b1 had the greatest contents of saponin in p notoginseng and the total amounts of ginsenoside r g1 r b1 and p notoginseng saponin r 1 were not less than 5 0 which is the saponins standard for p notoginseng jia et al 2014 the results showed that different water deficits had significant effects on ginsenoside r g1 ginsenoside r b1 ginsenoside r d and total pns contents table 4 with the increase in irrigation amount total pns content increased first and then decreased however under the dl light water deficit irrigation root pns content was significantly lower than that under the ds treatment severe water deficit irrigation which is consistent with the studies of zhu et al 2008 andchung et al 2010 on bupleurum chinense and rehmannia glutinosa the effects of different organic fertilizers on the contents of ginsenoside r b1 and total pns were significant table 4 with the increase in irrigation amount the content of total pns first increased and then decreased and the highest level was observed under the fm treatment organic fertilizer plays a significant role in increasing the number of soil microorganisms and soil porosity and in driving the composition and structure of the microbial community tao et al 2014 suitable water fertilizer coupling conditions increase soil permeability enhance soil microbial activity and create a favorable micro environment in the root zone and canopy for the growth of p notoginseng there is a positive correlation between the root yield and pns content and planting years cui et al 2002 under the experimental conditions the dry and fresh root yields and pns of p notoginseng in the dmfm within 2 years and 10 months were 3039 19 and 8865 78 kg ha 1 and 10 85 respectively which were 3 and 144 70 higher than the average annual fresh root yield and pns 8571 73 kg ha 1 and 4 34 respectively of large scale cultivation in 2015 in wenshan city yunnan province cui et al 2017 yu et al 2015 however the average diseases incidence were 3 92 and 5 82 for 2 year old and 3 year old p notoginseng respectively especially at the dlfh treatments increased to 7 62 and 11 03 respectively fig 3 which were higher than that in previous studies cui et al 2002 there may be the reason that microbial community structure and quantity in the root zone of medicinal plants will be imbalanced guan et al 2006 and cause a high disease incidence of p notoginseng root rot xia et al 2016 and black spot yang et al 2018 with high temperature and soil moisture content in august flowering period furthermore plant diseases were negatively correlated with the frequency of pesticide application without considering the resistance of the diseases li et al 2021 excess pesticides are used to control diseases for increasing yield and growers income because there are few standards guidance regarding pesticide usage in chinese traditional herbs cultivation zhao et al 2020a 2020b however p notoginseng absorbs heavy metal elements and pesticide residues while absorbing soil water and nutrients the detection of banned pesticides or traces above the regulatory residue limits has led to loss of market share and income for both the growers and sales people in yunnan china xiao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020a 2020b therefore it is urgent to transform and upgrade the green production of p notoginseng with the aim of improving saponin content and increasing income in this study in order to decrease the accumulation of heavy metal elements and pesticide residues pesticides were sprayed once a year to achieve green production pfp decreased with the increase in fertilizer application but increased first and then decreased with the increase in irrigation amount wue decreased with the increase in irrigation amount but increased first and then decreased with the increase in fertilizer application which was consistent with zhang s research zhang et al 2017 the pfp and wue were 41 02 kg t 1 and 0 25 kg m 3 for 2 year old and 67 54 kg t 1 and 0 43 kg m 3 for 3 year old p notoginseng under the dmfm treatment respectively fig 3 there are certain thresholds for the demand of water and fertilizer in plant growth within these thresholds coupling moderate deficit irrigation and fertilizer can effectively increase crop yield oppositely excessive irrigation and fertilizer application will reduce crop yield waste water and fertilizer and decrease the water and fertilizer use efficiency xing et al 2015 therefore optimized water deficit and organic fertilizer treatments can improve the wue and pep reduce the survival rate of fungi actinomycetes and anaerobic bacteria and avoid changing the microenvironment of the p notoginseng root zone thus controlling the diseases and pests guan et al 2006 liu et al 2012 the goal of water and fertilizer regulation is to improve saponin content and production a comprehensive evaluation by pca and the topsis model of p notoginseng revealed that the dmfm treatment was the best 5 conclusions moderate water deficit and organic fertilizer application significantly increased the dry yield of p notoginseng flowers and roots and pns and the irrigation amount had a stronger effect than the fertilizer amount and the water fertilizer interaction under the dmfm treatment the flower dry yield dry root yield fresh root yield and pns were 57 99 kg ha 1 3039 19 kg ha 1 8865 29 kg ha 1 and 10 85 respectively moreover moderate water deficit and organic fertilizer application

which were higher than those resulting from other treatments additionally the pns resulting from dmfm exhibited the highest comprehensive score and comprehensive index based on principal component analysis and the topsis model this combination could create a higher yield of flowers and roots provide a scientific management for planting and improve the economic benefits for planters and the local government keywords water deficit panax notoginseng yield saponin content water use efficiency principal component analysis topsis model 1 introduction panax notoginseng burk f h chen sanqi a perennial herb species of panax genus under the araliaceae family is a traditional chinese medicine that is mainly cultivated in mountainous areas at altitudes of 1200 2000 m at approximately 23 5 n and 104 e in yunnan and guangxi provinces china cui et al 2002 li et al 2013 panax notoginseng saponins pns are the main bioactive components and include ginsenosides r g1 r b1 r d and r e and notoginsenoside r 1 li et al 2013 li shizhen a famous chinese physician in the ming dynasty recorded that it was used for enriching blood and treating traumatic bleeding lower gastrointestinal bleeding and infection meditated corneal ulcers yang et al 2018 in addition p notoginseng has been extensively used in medical research for applications such as cardiovascular disease hypertension hyperglycemia atherosclerosis and cancers he et al 2012 yang et al 2018 in 2018 the yunnan provincial government officially proclaimed that the p notoginseng based industry was the core of its biomedical industry and was predicted to achieve a production value of 100 billion yuan by 2020 xu et al 2019 it takes three to seven years from planting to harvesting and the plant prefers a shady and humid environment and has rigorous sunshine soil moisture and nutrient requirements xia et al 2016 august to september is the best time for picking p notoginseng flowers because the increase in plant height stem diameter and leaf growth stops additionally the growth and saponin content of roots reach the maximum in december and january cui et al 2002 zhao et al 2020a 2020b the content of saponin in p notoginseng is affected by various factors such as the incidence of root rot drying methods soil water content and fertilization ratio in addition it can absorb heavy metals and pesticide residues in the soil while absorbing nutrients guo et al 2014 to produce a higher yield per unit area large amounts of water fertilizer approximately 500 kg ha 1 and pesticides over 3 times year 1 are applied in planting p notoginseng at the same time with the excessive application of chemical fertilizer soil hardening acidification poor airflow and the disease incidence are increasing jin and xing 2018 xie et al 2019 additionally the more pesticides that are sprayed the more heavy metals accumulate in p notoginseng chen et al 2014 zhao et al 2020a 2020b as a result production decreases because of an increasing disease incidence rate the price drops sharply and the plant is difficult to sell because of pesticide residue and the income of planters is seriously affected li et al 2021 therefore it is urgent to realize the green production of p notoginseng for which water and nutrients are the key factors water deficit stress is a water saving technology related to plant physiology that was developed on the basis of crop limited optimal water allocation theory growth compensation effects and growth redundancy theory reynolds et al 1994 zhang et al 2018 the growth of root and the accumulation of medicinal components are significantly affected by soil moisture appropriate soil moisture can promote root growth and increase yield but is not conducive to the synthesis of medicinal ingredients moreover water deficit can induce defensive and adaptive responses enhance secondary metabolism in the plant and increase the contents of medicinal ingredients gao and liang 2004 in plants such as astragalus membranaceus liang et al 2016 dendrobium moniliforme wu et al 2016 and salvia miltiorrhiza bunge liu et al 2011 however there is little research on water management especially water deficit in p notoginseng a pot experiment showed that a soil moisture content equal to 56 4 59 θ f where θ f is the field capacity was the most beneficial to the growth of p notoginseng and could effectively improve its yield and saponin content xia et al 2016 field experiments showed that different soil moisture contents were required in different growth stages to improve the yield and saponin content of p notoginseng the best irrigation water limit ranges are reportedly 60 65 θ f 45 50 θ f 85 90 θ f and 80 85 θ f in the seedling stage flowering stage fruiting stage and root weight gain stage respectively the fresh yield of p notoginseng was 5295 kg ha 1 and the water use efficiency was 3 03 kg m 3 yu et al 2006 fertilizer plays a positive role in increasing crop yield to improve production the application rate of chemical fertilizers in china reached 53 29 million tons in 2015 and the application rates of nitrogen fertilizer and agricultural compound fertilizer were 23 1 and 22 07 million tons respectively national statistical bureau of the people s republic of china 2015 he et al 2020 however excessive application of chemical fertilizers causes soil consolidation soil acidification nitrate pollution soil nutrient imbalance and deterioration and a high incidence of pests and diseases jin and xing 2018 xie et al 2019 the chinese government has discovered the seriousness of the problem and put forward a strategic concept for the replacement of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer the chinese ministry of agriculture and rural affairs proposed the action plan of zero growth in fertilizer and pesticide use by 2020 to reduce chemical fertilizer application he et al 2020 china s total chemical fertilizer application was 46 48 million tons in 2017 he et al 2020 the application of organic fertilizer promotes the growth and reproduction of soil microorganisms in farmland and improves soil fertility zhao et al 2020a 2020b tao et al 2014 and the contents of soil microbial biomass carbon smbc and nitrogen smbn ren et al 2018 in recent years the growth yield and saponin content of p notoginseng have been studied extensively in the context of chemical fertilizer the results showed that total pns content was 10 8 11 5 for three year old p notoginseng roots when 337 5 450 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilizer was applied wei et al 2008 furthermore when nitrogen fertilizer urea phosphorus fertilizer p 2 o 5 and potassium fertilizer k 2 o were applied at 71 60 149 37 kg ha 1 46 54 110 62 kg ha 1 and 236 35 444 72 kg ha 1 respectively the dry yield of roots was 861 54 1139 45 kg ha 1 for three year old p notoginseng yu et al 2015 however when these fertilizers were applied at 247 5 kg ha 1 450 kg ha 1 and 990 kg ha 1 respectively the dry yield of roots was 3881 37 kg ha 1 and the total pns content was 12 92 song et al 2019 in addition there are a few studies on the application of organic fertilizer in the cultivation process of p notoginseng liu et al 2012 found that with the application of 1 5 t ha 1 biological fertilizer per year the yield per plant of fresh roots from three year old p notoginseng was 31 17 g and the plants effectively avoided infection irrigation and fertilizer management can promote crop growth enhance the yield increase the accumulation of nutrients and reduce agricultural non point source pollution wang et al 2019 hao et al 2019 however how to effectively combine deficient irrigation and organic fertilizer to maintain yield improve saponin content increase water and fertilizer use efficiency and reduce the disease incidence rate of p notoginseng under shade cultivation needs further investigation in southwest regions of china therefore this study aimed at performing the green production of p notoginseng and 1 explored the effects of water deficit and organic fertilizer coupling on the yield saponin content water and fertilizer use efficiency and disease incidence rate of p notoginseng and 2 established two comprehensive benefit evaluation models of medicinal saponin content using the topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution and pca principal component analysis methods to identify a better water deficit and organic fertilizer management mode and provide a theoretical basis and technical guidance for planting p notoginseng 2

combination and ck was the worst table 6 the results showed that dmfm could yield the best comprehensive benefit and balance the contents of p notoginseng saponin r 1 ginsenoside r g1 ginsenoside r e ginsenoside r b1 and ginsenoside r d according to the pca and topsis model evaluation results and the data comparative analysis of each index the dmfm treatment is the best water deficit and organic fertilizer combination 4 discussion the purpose of water deficit irrigation and organic fertilizer treatment is to control the growth of aboveground and underground parts of crops by regulating soil moisture content and nutrients the water content of flowers and roots can be used to characterize the vitality of each part of the plant wei et al 2018 the results showed that water deficit had a significant effect on the flower and root of p notoginseng table 2 and table 3 flower water content w f and root water content w r increased with the increase in irrigation amount under severe deficit irrigation 35 20 θ f ds the dry root yield y r was the lowest but the fiber root weight density ρ f was the highest which indicates that the per unit volume of fiber roots was the largest this could be because the roots extend to grow in all directions to enlarge the contact area between the root and the soil and to obtain more soil moisture for plants when the water level is insufficient martorell et al 2012 in this study the water contents of flowers w f and roots w r of p notoginseng were the highest under light deficit irrigation 65 50 θ f dl but the saponin content pns and growth were inhibited which meant yield was not the highest table 2 and table 3 the dry flower yield y f dry root yield y r rhizome main root length l 4 5 branch root length l 6 and main root diameter d 2 of p notoginseng were the best under medium water deficit irrigation 50 35 θ f dm table 3 because moderate water deficit irrigation is beneficial for the accumulation of plant polysaccharides and promoted the growth of medicinal plants wu et al 2016 however xia s research xia et al 2016 showed that the most conducive soil moisture content to the growth of p notoginseng was 56 4 59 θ f because there are many differences in field and pot experiments the plants grew in pots were seriously influenced by the boundary effect and soil water transport conditions furthermore the contact surface with atmosphere in pot is lower than field resulting in a higher range of suitable soil moisture content ginsenosides r g1 and r b1 had the greatest contents of saponin in p notoginseng and the total amounts of ginsenoside r g1 r b1 and p notoginseng saponin r 1 were not less than 5 0 which is the saponins standard for p notoginseng jia et al 2014 the results showed that different water deficits had significant effects on ginsenoside r g1 ginsenoside r b1 ginsenoside r d and total pns contents table 4 with the increase in irrigation amount total pns content increased first and then decreased however under the dl light water deficit irrigation root pns content was significantly lower than that under the ds treatment severe water deficit irrigation which is consistent with the studies of zhu et al 2008 andchung et al 2010 on bupleurum chinense and rehmannia glutinosa the effects of different organic fertilizers on the contents of ginsenoside r b1 and total pns were significant table 4 with the increase in irrigation amount the content of total pns first increased and then decreased and the highest level was observed under the fm treatment organic fertilizer plays a significant role in increasing the number of soil microorganisms and soil porosity and in driving the composition and structure of the microbial community tao et al 2014 suitable water fertilizer coupling conditions increase soil permeability enhance soil microbial activity and create a favorable micro environment in the root zone and canopy for the growth of p notoginseng there is a positive correlation between the root yield and pns content and planting years cui et al 2002 under the experimental conditions the dry and fresh root yields and pns of p notoginseng in the dmfm within 2 years and 10 months were 3039 19 and 8865 78 kg ha 1 and 10 85 respectively which were 3 and 144 70 higher than the average annual fresh root yield and pns 8571 73 kg ha 1 and 4 34 respectively of large scale cultivation in 2015 in wenshan city yunnan province cui et al 2017 yu et al 2015 however the average diseases incidence were 3 92 and 5 82 for 2 year old and 3 year old p notoginseng respectively especially at the dlfh treatments increased to 7 62 and 11 03 respectively fig 3 which were higher than that in previous studies cui et al 2002 there may be the reason that microbial community structure and quantity in the root zone of medicinal plants will be imbalanced guan et al 2006 and cause a high disease incidence of p notoginseng root rot xia et al 2016 and black spot yang et al 2018 with high temperature and soil moisture content in august flowering period furthermore plant diseases were negatively correlated with the frequency of pesticide application without considering the resistance of the diseases li et al 2021 excess pesticides are used to control diseases for increasing yield and growers income because there are few standards guidance regarding pesticide usage in chinese traditional herbs cultivation zhao et al 2020a 2020b however p notoginseng absorbs heavy metal elements and pesticide residues while absorbing soil water and nutrients the detection of banned pesticides or traces above the regulatory residue limits has led to loss of market share and income for both the growers and sales people in yunnan china xiao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020a 2020b therefore it is urgent to transform and upgrade the green production of p notoginseng with the aim of improving saponin content and increasing income in this study in order to decrease the accumulation of heavy metal elements and pesticide residues pesticides were sprayed once a year to achieve green production pfp decreased with the increase in fertilizer application but increased first and then decreased with the increase in irrigation amount wue decreased with the increase in irrigation amount but increased first and then decreased with the increase in fertilizer application which was consistent with zhang s research zhang et al 2017 the pfp and wue were 41 02 kg t 1 and 0 25 kg m 3 for 2 year old and 67 54 kg t 1 and 0 43 kg m 3 for 3 year old p notoginseng under the dmfm treatment respectively fig 3 there are certain thresholds for the demand of water and fertilizer in plant growth within these thresholds coupling moderate deficit irrigation and fertilizer can effectively increase crop yield oppositely excessive irrigation and fertilizer application will reduce crop yield waste water and fertilizer and decrease the water and fertilizer use efficiency xing et al 2015 therefore optimized water deficit and organic fertilizer treatments can improve the wue and pep reduce the survival rate of fungi actinomycetes and anaerobic bacteria and avoid changing the microenvironment of the p notoginseng root zone thus controlling the diseases and pests guan et al 2006 liu et al 2012 the goal of water and fertilizer regulation is to improve saponin content and production a comprehensive evaluation by pca and the topsis model of p notoginseng revealed that the dmfm treatment was the best 5 conclusions moderate water deficit and organic fertilizer application significantly increased the dry yield of p notoginseng flowers and roots and pns and the irrigation amount had a stronger effect than the fertilizer amount and the water fertilizer interaction under the dmfm treatment the flower dry yield dry root yield fresh root yield and pns were 57 99 kg ha 1 3039 19 kg ha 1 8865 29 kg ha 1 and 10 85 respectively moreover moderate water deficit and organic fertilizer application significantly increased the pfp and wue compared with the dlfh treatment the dmfm treatment reduced water use by 42 39 and fertilizer use by 23 81 while pfp and wue increased by 91 83 and 149 72
