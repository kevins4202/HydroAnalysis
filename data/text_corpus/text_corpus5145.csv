25725,with the increasing complexity of hydrological systems hydrological modeling by modelers from different research areas has been regarded as an effective way to solve complex hydrological issues as the first step of hydrological modeling conceptual modeling plays an important role in supporting modeling idea communication among interdisciplinary modelers currently conceptual modeling methods usually show the modeling ideas by using the block based diagrams however further research need to be explored to express the spatial and temporal distribution of these modeling elements and their dynamic interaction relationships thus promoting the communication of modeling ideas and reaching a common understanding of the modeling system among modelers visual conceptual scenario is the production of hydrological conceptual modeling and can be used to express modelers cognition of modeling system this article proposes a construction method of visual conceptual scenario the conceptual component that represents the modeling elements the rules that constrain the scenario construction and a dynamic interaction method that supports the visualization of dynamic hydrological process are designed finally a study case of identifying the impact of energy base water project on the groundwater is designed to illustrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed construction method of visual conceptual scenario keywords hydrological conceptual modeling conceptual scenario conceptual component dynamic scenario expression opengms 1 introduction hydrological modeling plays an important role in explaining complex hydrological phenomena and exploring the relationships among hydrological processes and it can support water resource management and decision making demeritt and wainwright 2005 granell et al 2010 granell et al 2013 to solve hydrological problems researchers from all over the world have conducted a series of hydrological modeling studies and produced numerous hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat douglas mankin et al 2010 koo et al 2020a b the storm water management model swmm gironás et al 2010 the variable infiltration capacity vic macroscale hydrologic model liang et al 1994 and the soil and water integrated model swim krysanova et al 2000 however when considering a complex hydrological system there is a growing understanding that a single model from a specific research area cannot sufficiently represent all the details of the modeling system argent 2004 voinov and cerco 2010 coupling multidomain models and conducting hydrological integrated modeling to solve complex hydrological problems have become a trending topic granell et al 2013 belete et al 2017 the long term practice of hydrological integrated modeling has shown that the mutual understanding among modelers may be the first step in hydrological modeling refsgaard and henriksen 2004 for example in order to explore the impacts of groundwater exploitation on watershed ecological environment a groundwater quantity model a groundwater water quality model a vegetation growth model and a surface runoff module from a basin hydrological model may be involved in the modeling system however each type of these models has numerous individual computational models e g there are many basin hydrological models such as swat topmodel hbv etc each individual model was built on specific modeling principles and each has its own application scope in this way how to choose the right individual models or modules to conduct integrated modeling has become an important modeling task for hydrological problem solving moreover modelers with a background in hydrology may not understand the modeling principles of vegetation growth models which makes it difficult to communicate modeling ideas therefore it is necessary to make clear the modeling elements and their interaction relationships before conducting hydrological integrated modeling so that modelers with different backgrounds can reach a common cognition of the modeling system and then guide the construction of hydrological computational model in this article the process by which modelers with different backgrounds express and communicate their understanding of the modeling system is called hydrological conceptual modeling the open geographic modeling and simulation opengms http geomodeling njnu edu cn provides a modeling resource sharing environment such as model data and computational resources which aims to support collaborative modeling and complex environmental problem solving wen et al 2006 chen et al 2011 yue et al 2015 chen et al 2016 yue et al 2016 wen et al 2017 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 chen et al 2020 2021 wang et al 2020 the opengms divides the integrated modeling process into three steps conceptual modeling logical modeling and computational modeling chen et al 2020 in this article the hydrological conceptual modeling is conducted within the context of integrated modeling in the opengms framework which focuses on the expression of the modelers cognition of the modeling systems recently a series of related studies on hydrological conceptual modeling has been carried out the european community ec funded project harmonising quality assurance harmoniqua attempts to offer computer based guidance for supporting the full modeling process which covers all water management domains different types of users different types of modeling purposes and different levels of modeling complexity scholten et al 2004 kassahun et al 2005 refsgaard et al 2005 højberg et al 2007 scholten and refsgaard 2010 black et al 2014 rushton 2004 points out that a conceptual model can illustrate the mechanisms of the hydrological system being modeled and can allow other modelers to assess current thinking and to provide further insights jakeman et al 2006 summarize ten iterative steps in the development and evaluation of environmental models which incorporate the idea that conceptualization can help in thinking and finding underlying information about the system the capabilities of hydrological conceptual modeling can be summarized as follows 1 at the beginning stage of hydrological modeling hydrological conceptual modeling can be regarded as a process in which the modeling problems are analyzed the modeling objectives are specified and the dynamic mechanisms of the hydrological system is clarified rushton 2004 jakeman et al 2006 yazici and akkaya 2000 for example in studying the influence of vegetation on hydrological processes in an area according to specific application scenarios modelers may first consider the following issues among others a how many processes are involved from the beginning of precipitation to the formation of runoff b how vegetation types influence these processes c what the relationships among these processes are and d how vegetation affects the spatial and temporal distributions of rainfall runoff and evapotranspiration such points need to be clarified during the conceptual modeling phase which can help modelers to better understand the modeling problem although the understanding of modeling problems may be simple and incomplete at the beginning of conceptual modeling it provides the possibility for further communication with other researchers 2 in the hydrological modeling process hydrological conceptual modeling can support the transfer of modeling ideas among modelers to achieve a common understanding of the modeling problems generally when faced with comprehensive and interdisciplinary hydrological modeling problems modelers often have different viewpoints due to their different research backgrounds for example modelers with experience studying surface hydrological processes may be accustomed to applying infiltration excess runoff saturation excess runoff and partial infiltration excess runoff to describe the mechanisms responsible for runoff generation however modelers with groundwater research backgrounds usually emphasize the contribution of the underground seepage system to surface runoff generation rubin 2003 in this respect conceptual modeling can provide the capacity to express different ideas and can help different modelers understand each other 3 hydrological conceptual models embody the principles of hydrological models which can facilitate the sharing and application of hydrological models in the later stage of hydrological modeling clark et al 2015 with the increasing complexity of hydrological models the hydrological modules involved and the relationships among these modules become more complex argent 2004 belete et al 2017 yue et al 2019 it is difficult for users especially interdisciplinary researchers to understand these comprehensive hydrological models which limits the application of the models a conceptual model is the product of conceptual modeling which is very helpful for users who aim to understand a hydrological model quickly at the conceptual level by comparing conceptual models users can quickly choose appropriate models for their applications from a large number of candidate models rather than reading the explanatory documents for each model in turn in short hydrological conceptual modeling runs through the whole process of hydrological modeling and plays an important role in promoting the transmission and exchange of modeling ideas with the development of hydrological conceptual modeling research three main types of hydrological conceptual modeling methods have been developed 1 conceptual sketching sketching is a powerful way to explore modeling ideas rushton 2004 jakeman et al 2006 modelers usually drew a conceptual sketch directly on paper to express and communicate their modeling ideas this approach is very effective within a specific research team due to its simplicity and convenience however the conceptual modeling results are difficult to share with others and to reuse because of the informal and individual conceptual modeling approach wand and weber 2002 this makes it difficult for modelers with different backgrounds to communicate with each other 2 graph based conceptual modeling to formalize modeling ideas the influence diagram block diagram or bond graph is introduced by modelers to express the modeling elements e g geographic entities and hydrological processes and their relationships which can aid thinking and modeling gawthrop and smith 1996 muetzelfeldt and massheder 2003 jakeman et al 2006 leonard et al 2017 lukyanenko et al 2017 examples include gbms sm chari and sen 1998 gme generic modeling environment davis 2003 and geovista studio gahegan et al 2002 these methods usually use block primitives and lines to express specific elements and their relationships although this approach has advantages in expressing logical reasoning it has limitations in expressing the details of the modeling thought process such as the spatial and temporal relationships among different modeling elements for example canopy interception and surface infiltration are different steps in surface hydrological processes and they occur at different times and places however in a graph based modeling approach the lines between block primitives cannot express such spatial and temporal relationships among different modeling elements 3 icon based conceptual modeling this approach builds a visual conceptual modeling scenario from the perspective of the modelers ideas about the hydrological system chen et al 2011 in this approach different modeling elements are represented by different icons and these icons are organized by the layout rules to build a constrained and cognitive conceptual scenario such a scenario provides a flexible way for the modelers to communicate modeling ideas intuitively however due to the limitation of two dimensional 2d and static icons it is difficult to express the three dimensional 3d time space relationships of the modeling elements e g nested relationships moreover the hydrological processes are dynamic which is difficult to express in such a static and 2d scenario in conclusion although these conceptual modeling approaches provide effective tools to express modeling elements and their relationships they have limitations in expressing the spatial and temporal distribution of modeling elements and related dynamic hydrological processes recently serious games virtual environment and geographic scenario are increasingly used as tools to help stakeholders participate in the research of environmental issues chen et al 2013 lin et al 2013a b lin and chen 2015 craven et al 2017 chen and lin 2018 khoury et al 2018 smith and lohani 2018 lü et al 2018 2019 den haan et al 2020 li et al 2021a b yang et al 2021 inspired by these studies visual conceptual scenario is proposed to express modelers cognition of modeling system the visual conceptual scenario is the production of hydrological conceptual modeling which provides a visual way for cross domain modelers to express their modeling ideas at conceptual level thus facilitating the communication among these modelers the conceptual scenario consists of numbers of conceptual components which represent geographic entities e g rivers vegetation and soil involved in modeling system and related hydrological processes e g surface runoff precipitation and evaporation the cognitive differences among different modelers can be addressed by designing different conceptual components namely modelers can express their knowledge of the geographic entities or hydrological processes by designing corresponding conceptual components to construct the visual conceptual scenario these conceptual components need to be organized according specific rules therefore a series of rules e g context rules layout rules and semantic rules that reflect modelers cognition of modeling system are designed to constrain the construction of the scenario meanwhile the spatial and temporal distribution of conceptual components can be constrained by these rules for example the layout rules can dictate that cloud must be above the ground and the semantic rules can specify that rain comes before surface runoff since the dynamics of hydrological processes can be expressed by the interaction among conceptual components a method that represents such interaction relationships at conceptual level is proposed in this way the temporal and spatial distribution of modeling elements is constrained by specific rules and the dynamic hydrological process of the modeling system is driven by dynamic interaction method proposed in this article during the hydrological conceptual modeling modelers can exchange modeling ideas through the visual and dynamic conceptual scenario rather than through abstract block primitives the remainder of this article is structured as follows the construction framework of visual conceptual scenario is introduced in section 2 section 3 introduces the methodology of the construction of conceptual scenario in section 4 a case study involving two conceptual scenarios is developed finally conclusions and directions for future work are presented in section 5 2 the construction framework of the visual conceptual scenario fig 1 shows the construction framework of the visual conceptual scenario when considering a hydrological system modelers may work together to communicate their perceptions of how to model the system the following aspects among others will be considered in understanding a hydrological system the geographic entities involved in the system the space time distribution pattern of these entities how many hydrological processes take place in the system and the relationships among these processes in this article the geographic entity is employed as the cognitive object and the whole hydrological system is regarded as a collection of geographic entities and their relationships as shown in the left side of fig 1 the relationships among geographic entities can be treated as the behavior interaction or hydrological process interaction of these geographic entities for example the precipitation process can be treated as the behavior of the cloud geographic entity and it allows cloud entity to interact with underlying surface geographic entity therefore to understand the hydrological system modelers need to first understand the geographic entities involved in the hydrological system to represent the geographic entity and related hydrological processes the concept of conceptual component is proposed in this article as shown in the middle part of fig 1 a conceptual component is designed by modelers to express their ideas about a geographic entity and it consists of two parts the visual element and the behavior script the visual element is the abstract representation of the geographic entity in a visual way it can express the appearance of the geographic entity and the visual effects of related hydrological processes for example to represent vegetation the visual element can express the geometrical shapes the color and the visual effects of the transpiration process for the transpiration of vegetation it can be considered that vegetation has the transpiration behavior the behavior script defines the control logics that trigger the behaviors of the current conceptual component which can be used to drive the dynamic expression of the related hydrological process for example the cloud conceptual component defines the precipitation behavior i e the visual effects of precipitation and this behavior is triggered when the cloud cools suddenly which is defined in the behavior script based on this design idea of high cohesion and low coupling each conceptual component can express its appearance and behaviors and they can be flexibly coupled together to construct a conceptual scenario and interact with each other the process of constructing a conceptual scenario is the process of expressing the modeling ideas of modelers an effective conceptual scenario is one that follows the specific constraining rules that reflect modelers ideas about the modeling problems as shown in the right side of fig 1 the conceptual components are designed to be the fundamental units of the conceptual scenario and they need to match the specific constraining rules according to the modeling requirements for example pollutants generally flow from upstream to downstream the constraining rules need to restrain such directional relationships of the pollutant flow there are three main types of rules that will be considered context rules layout rules and semantic rules generally the context rules reflect the specific modeling requirements that are based on the analysis of the modeling problem the layout rules specify the spatial information e g position scale and rotation of the components and the semantic rules clarify the semantic properties e g physical biological and chemical properties of the conceptual components these constraining rules reflect the modelers understanding of the conceptual components that are involved in the conceptual scenario which also help the interdisciplinary modelers understand unfamiliar things for example a modeler who studies groundwater can design a series of rules to illustrate the layered structure of the soil and how the water enters and leaves such a layered structure in order to convey his her modeling ideas to other modelers moreover the constraining rules ensure the unambiguous expression of the conceptual scenario provide a normalized method of constructing a conceptual scenario and enable good communication among modelers due to the dynamic nature of the hydrological system a dynamic interaction method is proposed to express the dynamic hydrological processes and their interaction relationships compared to the static expression of hydrological processes used in current conceptual modeling methods the dynamic interaction method can drive the hydrological process to evolve more dynamically 3 the construction of the visual conceptual scenario 3 1 the design of the conceptual components a conceptual component is the comprehensive representation of a geographic entity and is the basic building block of a conceptual scenario the basic idea of designing the conceptual component is to use the visualization and scripting techniques provided by the unity engine unity 2021 to express the attribute and behavior characteristics of the geographic entity fig 2 shows the detailed design method of a conceptual component to identify a geographic entity the following aspects will be considered among others what it is its semantic features e g point source discharge where it is its spatial features e g position scale and rotation its geometric features e g the boundary of a basin its attribute features e g the flow volume of a river and the hydrological processes it is associated with e g the transpiration process of vegetation these aspects can be summarized as status characteristics and behavior characteristics as shown in fig 2 to formally describe these two types of characteristics the visual element and behavior script are designed to form a conceptual component the visual element is responsible for visualizing the geographic entity including the appearance of the geographic entity and the visual effects of its related hydrological process and describing the attribute characteristics associated with appearance such as the geometric shapes and the spatial position of the geographic entity the behavior script records the attribute characteristics associated with the behavior of the entity such as the semantic attributes e g the moisture of the soil and the evaporation velocity of the water and defines the control logic of triggering the visual effects that represent the corresponding hydrological process the unity engine is a real time 3d interactive content creation platform that provides a powerful graphics rendering engine and script systems which can be used to develop high quality graphics applications video games etc in this article the conceptual component is implemented based on unity there are three core components of the unity engine the rendering engine the physical engine and the script system the rendering engine is mainly responsible for graphics rendering and provides the ability to render 2d and 3d scenarios the physical engine is mainly response for simulating the real physical effects such as the collision detection of moving objects it is often used to calculate the motion behavior data of the conceptual component to produce physically consistent motion effects the script system provides the ability to interact flexibly with visual elements currently the c c 2021 and lua lua 2021 are the two most popular scripting languages that unity offers c is an object oriented programming language developed by microsoft which is very popular in the developer community lua is a lightweight and compact scripting language that is widely used to develop game logic due to its flexibility and ease of use lua is employed to develop the behavior script of the conceptual component in this article the advanced visualization technology provided by the unity engine is employed to design the visual element as shown in fig 2 the mesh that represents the shape of a geographic entity is usually constructed in 3d modeling software such as blender blender 2021 3d studio max 3d studio max 2021 and cinema 4d cinema 4d 2021 as shown in fig 3 part a in the upper left panel shows the tree mesh which provides the basic shape of a tree to visualize the mesh more vividly the light and texture which can be called material are employed to decorate the mesh the light is employed to simulate the visual effect of light hitting the surface of the mesh the texture is used to make the mesh look like the geographic entity it represents in the real world as shown in fig 3 part b in the upper left panel shows the tree with the material attached which makes the tree look like a tree in the real world a particle system is usually used to simulate fuzzy phenomena using massive small particles e g small squares or small circles in computer graphics such as fire explosions rain and snow in this article it can be used to represent dynamic hydrological processes such as precipitation and transpiration as shown in fig 3 part c in the upper left panel shows the tree with the transpiration process occurring the shading language shaderlab designed by unity is an editable program fragment that can configure the texture calculate the special effects e g the bloom effect and self luminous effect produce animation effects etc shaderlab is designed to execute the rendering instructions on the graphics processing unit gpu which determines the quality of the visual effects all these visualization technologies are provided by the rendering engine of unity which can be used to create not only 2d visual elements but also 3d visual elements as shown in the bottom panel of fig 3 a visual element is implemented by the game object in unity a game object can attach a series of functional components to implement the visualization requirements mentioned above for example the transform component represents the spatial information of the game object e g position rotation and scale the mesh render component determines how to render the game object and the material component can improve the visual effects of the game object the script component can access the information in other components and determine how to represent the visual effects for example the particle system can be used to represent precipitation e g particles moving from the sky to the ground and transpiration e g particles moving from the ground to the sky the script component can access the particle system attached to the game object to control the directions of the particles and express the corresponding hydrological process unity provides a powerful script system in which c c 2021 is employed as the native programming language due to its popularity in the development community as a typical application of the script system the script component is implemented in c the behavior script determines when the behavior is triggered as shown in the upper right panel in fig 3 when the temperature reaches 30 the transpiration process of the tree will be triggered and the corresponding visual effects represented by the particle system will be driven immediately generally the conceptual component is designed by modelers with a specific research background which means that the behaviors of the conceptual component have to be fully customizable in this regard lua is better than the native programming language c at defining the triggering logic of the behaviors as shown in the bottom panel in fig 3 the xlua plugin is employed to introduce lua into unity and it can support the communication between lua and c luabehavior defines the necessary information of the behavior script such as the related attribute data and lifecycle functions the execution order of these lifecycle functions is as follows awake start update and destroy the triggering logic of the behaviors is usually defined in the update function any customized behavior script inherited from luabehavior can exchange data with the script component attached in the game object this is why the behavior script can trigger the visual effects defined in the visual element in brief the visual element represents the visual effects of the geographic entity and the behavior script defines the logic that triggers these visual effects in this way modelers can express their understanding of a geographic entity by designing the corresponding conceptual component and customizing its behaviors this design method of high cohesion and low coupling provides convenience and flexibility for coupling these conceptual components to construct a conceptual scenario 3 2 the construction of the conceptual scenario 3 2 1 the classification and expression of the constraining rules the constraining rules are used to guide and restrict the construction of the conceptual scenario which determines whether the conceptual scenario conforms to the modelers ideas about the modeling problems as mentioned in section 2 there are three main kinds of constraining rules i e context rules layout rules and semantic rules as shown in fig 4 the context rules are usually a formal description of the modeling targets application requirements application fields etc and they reflect the modelers analysis results for the modeling problems the context rules may only work in the current conceptual scenario due to their strong specificity for example in the study of the hydrological system in a large scale watershed the small reservoirs may be neglected so the reservoir conceptual component cannot be selected to construct the current conceptual scenario however the reservoir cannot be neglected in the study of the hydrological process in a small scale watershed generally the context rules would be designed by the participating modelers to build the fundamental framework from a holistic perspective to guide the subsequent modeling work the layout rules reflect the spatial and temporal distributions of the conceptual components for example vegetation grows in soil rather than a river and the sun must appear in the sky rather than the ground normally the relative directions and distances and the spatial topology relationships among the conceptual components would be considered in designing the layout rules for example a hydropower station is usually built in the upper and middle reaches of a river and lies astride the river the direction and spatial topology information would be employed to express such relationships between the hydropower station and the river the semantic rules usually reflect the biological physical chemical and social properties of the conceptual component for example a river will freeze if the environmental temperature is less than zero degrees celsius and the terrain of china is characteristically high in the west but low in the east these rules express the semantic information of the conceptual components which makes the conceptual scenario more understandable in this article the lua script is employed to define these rules formally and flexibly as shown at the bottom of fig 4 the lua script defines the rule that a tree must grow in the terrain rather than in the sea the start function defines the participating conceptual components e g the tree and the terrain and the check function defines the judgment logic which refers to whether the tree and terrain match this constraining rule in this way the constraining rules can be defined in the lua script independently and they can be flexibly introduced and removed in a conceptual scenario according to the modeling requirements generally there are two kinds of rules involved in the construction of a conceptual scenario for common rules e g basic geographical regularities and common sense the rule scripts are saved in the rule library which can be shared among different conceptual scenarios however for custom rules the modelers would work together to define the rule scripts for the specific modeling requirements and these scripts may only work in the current conceptual scenario 3 2 2 applying the constraining rules fig 5 shows the process of applying the constraining rules to construct a conceptual scenario first the related conceptual components are selected according to the conceptual modeling requirements then these conceptual components are arranged in the conceptual scenario according to the modeling ideas of the participating modelers such as by placing the conceptual components in the appropriate positions in the conceptual scenario and selecting the appropriate conceptual components to construct the conceptual scenario according to the semantic information in the meantime the constraining rules are selected to check whether the arrangement of these conceptual components is effective and reasonable if the constraining rules apply only to the current conceptual scenario the modelers need to customize the rule scripts otherwise they select common rule scripts from the rule library subsequently these rule scripts will be executed to determine the effectiveness of these arrangements of the conceptual components for those arrangements that do not pass the rule test modelers need to rearrange these conceptual components until they match all of the constraining rules finally to drive the dynamic visualization of the conceptual scenario the interactive relationships among the conceptual components are configured which is described in section 3 3 3 3 the dynamic expression of the conceptual scenario 3 3 1 the dynamic interaction method among conceptual components generally a hydrological process is a dynamic process that can evolve over time the dynamic visualization of the conceptual scenario can help modelers understand hydrological processes more intuitively especially for modelers with other research backgrounds as mentioned in section 3 1 the status characteristics semantic geometric attribute spatial etc are employed to describe the conceptual components which can define the status information of the conceptual components at a certain point in time therefore the dynamic expression of the hydrological process can be regarded as a task in which the status characteristics of the related conceptual components change over time fig 6 shows the dynamic interaction method which can be used to describe the interactive relationships among the different statuses of multiple conceptual components conceptual component 1 i e c 1 has three statues i e s 1 s 2 and s 3 and each status can be described by its status characteristics semantic i e se 1 spatial i e sp 1 geometric i e g 1 attribute i e a 1 etc the interactive processes relating these status characteristics can drive the evolution of the hydrological process similarly the different conceptual components can interact with each other in this way fig 7 shows an example of a dynamic interaction method the underlying surface conceptual component contains three statuses the surface runoff status the infiltration status and the groundwater runoff status in this example for convenience only the soil moisture attribute is employed to describe these statuses specifically the three statuses of the underlying surface conceptual component can be linked by the soil moisture the cloud conceptual component has a precipitation status and the rainfall attribute is employed to describe the amount of precipitation as shown in the left panel of fig 7 to drive the conceptual scenario first the cloud conceptual component needs to trigger the precipitation process i e it switches to the precipitation status then as the rainfall increases the soil moisture of the underlying surface increases surface runoff occurs when the rainfall intensity exceeds the soil infiltration intensity i e the surface runoff process is triggered generally some of the rainfall forms surface runoff and some of it seeps into the soil i e the infiltration process is triggered finally when the soil moisture exceeds the field water capacity the excess water seeps down to form underground runoff i e the underground runoff process is triggered in this way the hydrological processes involved can be triggered via the interaction of different statuses of multiple conceptual components 3 3 2 the interactive script for implementing the dynamic interaction method the dynamic interaction method describes the interactive relationships among different conceptual components to implement the dynamic interaction method the interactive script is developed in which different conceptual components are connected by the interaction of their status characteristics fig 8 implements the example in fig 7 which shows how the interactive script drives the dynamic expression of the conceptual scenario as shown in fig 8 the cloud and underlying surface conceptual components have been registered in the conceptual scenario as mentioned above both the cloud and the underlying surface conceptual components consist of the visual elements and related behavior script the cloud conceptual component defines a precipitation process in the behavior script of the cloud conceptual component the rainfall variable is defined to record the amount of precipitation in the underlying surface conceptual component there are three hydrological processes that have been defined surface runoff infiltration and groundwater runoff the soilmoisture variable is defined in the behavior script which can be used to determine when to trigger these processes to drive the scenario in the start function of the interactive script the precipitation process is triggered first then in the update function the cloud conceptual component and underlying surface conceptual component are connected by passing the value of rainfall to soilmoisture finally the visual effects of the hydrological processes are triggered when the value of the soilmoisture variable meets the corresponding conditions in the behavior script in this way different conceptual components can interact with each other and the conceptual scenario can be driven dynamically 4 study case groundwater is an important source of energy production in arid regions so it is necessary to study the impact of enhanced human pressure on groundwater awawdeh et al 2020 in this section the conceptual modeling is conducted under the background of identifying the impact of energy base water project on the groundwater in the subei lake basin ordos northwestern china hou et al 2008 liu et al 2016 two conceptual scenarios that reflect the key hydrological processes in the subei lake basin are designed to test the practicability and feasibility of constructing visual conceptual scenario for conducting hydrological conceptual modeling section 4 1 constructs a 3d scenario that describes the impact of groundwater exploitation on the surface a 2d scenario is constructed to illustrate the groundwater movement in section 4 2 4 1 the 3d scenario for describing the impact of the groundwater exploitation on the surface the exploitation of groundwater will have a series of effects on the local ecological environment for example extensive groundwater extraction can dry up lakes wither trees and dry up farmland the conceptual scenario constructed in this section attempts to conduct conceptual modeling for the impact of the groundwater exploitation on the surface for simplicity there are several typical geographic entities and their relationships that are involved in the conceptual modeling process as shown in fig 9 the cloud can produce precipitation and the precipitation process can connect to the terrain because the terrain takes moisture from the precipitation process as the rainfall increases some of the rainfall forms surface runoff and some of it seeps into the soil consequently the surface runoff process can connect to the lake and the infiltration process can connect to the groundwater the lake can replenish the groundwater sources by the water supply process the tree absorbs groundwater to sustain its life to develop energy production several waterworks have been built in the subei lake basin the waterworks system pumps up water from the production well and then the water is used for crop irrigation and energy production of the ordos energy base in fig 9 these geographic entities and their relationships are expressed by the block diagram based method in this section a 3d conceptual scenario is constructed to improve such a conceptual modeling method first the conceptual components are designed to represent the corresponding geographic entities in the modeling system taking the lake conceptual component as an example in the left panel of fig 10 the visual elements e g the shape and the color of the lake of the lake conceptual components are designed in the blender and they can be controlled by the c script to implement several visual effects in the unity engine thus the specific behavior of the lake can be represented for example the evaporation process is implemented by a c script that toggles a particle system to be shown or hidden as shown in the upper left corner of fig 10 similarly other behaviors of the lake are implemented such as water supply and fall rise of water level the visual element defines the appearance and related visual effects of the lake while the behavior script is designed to determine when to trigger these visual effects the right panel of fig 10 shows the judgment logics for triggering the corresponding behaviors in this way all the conceptual components involved in fig 9 can be designed as shown in fig 11 to construct the 3d conceptual scenario the conceptual components must be arranged by a series of constraint rules as shown in fig 12 a here three examples are considered 1 because the subei lake basin belongs to an arid area there is little rainfall this can be constrained by the context rule 2 generally the tree is planted in the terrain rather than in the lake this can be constrained by the layout rule 3 the lake water level is normally higher than the groundwater level this can be constrained by the semantic rule finally the interactive script is developed to express the dynamic evolution process of the 3d conceptual scenario here three examples exemplify the process as shown in fig 12 b 1 the waterworks system extracts the water from underground 2 the lake seeps into the ground 3 the tree dies due to lack of water at this point the 3d conceptual scenario has been built and the dynamic visualization of the scenario is shown in fig 13 4 2 the 2d scenario for expressing the groundwater movement in this section the groundwater movement with the consideration of groundwater exploitation is expressed in a 2d conceptual scenario fig 14 shows the interactive relationships among the involved geographic entities the groundwater is mainly used for energy production and vegetation absorption in addition the lake is one of the sources of groundwater supply because of the differences in underground topography and geological conditions coupled with the extraction of groundwater the groundwater begins to move which occurs via downward leakage upward leakage and lateral flow similar to the steps in section 4 1 the conceptual components that are involved in fig 14 are designed then the corresponding constraint rules are developed and the interactive relationships among these components are configured fig 15 shows the constructed 2d conceptual scenario 5 conclusions and future work this article proposes to construct visual conceptual scenario to facilitate the exchange of modeling ideas among modelers during hydrological conceptual modeling the primary originality of this study is its development of a construction scheme that implements the construction of conceptual scenario which can support modelers with different backgrounds in working together first modelers can express their conception of geographic entities by designing the conceptual components with which the appearance and behaviors of geographic entities are expressed then modelers can develop rules to constrain the construction of the conceptual scenario which reflects an understanding of the spatial and temporal relationships among geographic entities finally the visual scenario is driven to express the dynamic interaction among modeling elements and visually demonstrate the dynamic hydrological process compared to block diagram based methods the visual conceptual scenario can not only express the spatial and temporal distribution of modeling elements but also express the dynamic evolution of hydrological processes which helps interdisciplinary modelers understand the modeling system more clearly thus promoting the communication among modelers the conceptual component is the basic unit of conceptual scenario construction as well as the expression of modeling ideas modelers from different domains can design their own conceptual components to express their modeling ideas these components can be coupled together to form a conceptual scenario that reflects the modelers common understanding of the modeling system this design pattern greatly facilitates cross domain modelers to express and share their modeling ideas modelers from different domains and even around the world can collaborate on conceptual modeling by designing their own conceptual components and these conceptual components can also be shared in the cyberspace in short the conceptual scenario construction method proposed in this paper provides the possibility for collaborative hydrological conceptual modeling in cyberspace in the future to ensure that the proposed visual conceptual scenario better serves hydrological conceptual modeling the following issues are worth exploring in future studies 1 convenient and effective tools are necessary for modelers in designing the conceptual components currently the conceptual components are designed manually in the unity editor although the unity editor provides extensible libraries for developers to customize their tools this requires developers to be familiar with the framework of the unity editor itself which increases the difficulty of designing the conceptual components in this respect a series of application oriented high level tools need to be developed to improve the efficiency of designing the conceptual components 2 common resource libraries need to be built for sharing and reusing conceptual resources i e the resources that are used to design the conceptual components generally there is much work to do in designing a conceptual component such as preparing visual resources e g images 3d models and art resources designing the visual effects e g the animation and particle system and developing the behavior scripts it is a time consuming process for developers to prepare these resources especially visual resources however once common resource libraries e g for visual resources special effects and behavior scripts are built developers can search and reuse the existing conceptual resources 3 a recommendation mechanism for the constraining rules needs to be explored to improve the efficiency of the construction of conceptual scenarios in this article the constraining rules are customized manually or selected by the modelers which is inefficient in the construction of complex conceptual scenarios moreover although modelers from different areas can work together to design the constraining rules for a specific conceptual scenario this cannot guarantee that the designed rules will take all the constraining cases into account in this scenario therefore an automatic or semiautomatic recommendation mechanism for the constraining rules could provide a series of alternative rules that could apply to the current conceptual scenario through such a mechanism modelers could select or customize specific rules based on the alternative rules which would reduce the difficulty of constructing the

25725,with the increasing complexity of hydrological systems hydrological modeling by modelers from different research areas has been regarded as an effective way to solve complex hydrological issues as the first step of hydrological modeling conceptual modeling plays an important role in supporting modeling idea communication among interdisciplinary modelers currently conceptual modeling methods usually show the modeling ideas by using the block based diagrams however further research need to be explored to express the spatial and temporal distribution of these modeling elements and their dynamic interaction relationships thus promoting the communication of modeling ideas and reaching a common understanding of the modeling system among modelers visual conceptual scenario is the production of hydrological conceptual modeling and can be used to express modelers cognition of modeling system this article proposes a construction method of visual conceptual scenario the conceptual component that represents the modeling elements the rules that constrain the scenario construction and a dynamic interaction method that supports the visualization of dynamic hydrological process are designed finally a study case of identifying the impact of energy base water project on the groundwater is designed to illustrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed construction method of visual conceptual scenario keywords hydrological conceptual modeling conceptual scenario conceptual component dynamic scenario expression opengms 1 introduction hydrological modeling plays an important role in explaining complex hydrological phenomena and exploring the relationships among hydrological processes and it can support water resource management and decision making demeritt and wainwright 2005 granell et al 2010 granell et al 2013 to solve hydrological problems researchers from all over the world have conducted a series of hydrological modeling studies and produced numerous hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat douglas mankin et al 2010 koo et al 2020a b the storm water management model swmm gironás et al 2010 the variable infiltration capacity vic macroscale hydrologic model liang et al 1994 and the soil and water integrated model swim krysanova et al 2000 however when considering a complex hydrological system there is a growing understanding that a single model from a specific research area cannot sufficiently represent all the details of the modeling system argent 2004 voinov and cerco 2010 coupling multidomain models and conducting hydrological integrated modeling to solve complex hydrological problems have become a trending topic granell et al 2013 belete et al 2017 the long term practice of hydrological integrated modeling has shown that the mutual understanding among modelers may be the first step in hydrological modeling refsgaard and henriksen 2004 for example in order to explore the impacts of groundwater exploitation on watershed ecological environment a groundwater quantity model a groundwater water quality model a vegetation growth model and a surface runoff module from a basin hydrological model may be involved in the modeling system however each type of these models has numerous individual computational models e g there are many basin hydrological models such as swat topmodel hbv etc each individual model was built on specific modeling principles and each has its own application scope in this way how to choose the right individual models or modules to conduct integrated modeling has become an important modeling task for hydrological problem solving moreover modelers with a background in hydrology may not understand the modeling principles of vegetation growth models which makes it difficult to communicate modeling ideas therefore it is necessary to make clear the modeling elements and their interaction relationships before conducting hydrological integrated modeling so that modelers with different backgrounds can reach a common cognition of the modeling system and then guide the construction of hydrological computational model in this article the process by which modelers with different backgrounds express and communicate their understanding of the modeling system is called hydrological conceptual modeling the open geographic modeling and simulation opengms http geomodeling njnu edu cn provides a modeling resource sharing environment such as model data and computational resources which aims to support collaborative modeling and complex environmental problem solving wen et al 2006 chen et al 2011 yue et al 2015 chen et al 2016 yue et al 2016 wen et al 2017 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 chen et al 2020 2021 wang et al 2020 the opengms divides the integrated modeling process into three steps conceptual modeling logical modeling and computational modeling chen et al 2020 in this article the hydrological conceptual modeling is conducted within the context of integrated modeling in the opengms framework which focuses on the expression of the modelers cognition of the modeling systems recently a series of related studies on hydrological conceptual modeling has been carried out the european community ec funded project harmonising quality assurance harmoniqua attempts to offer computer based guidance for supporting the full modeling process which covers all water management domains different types of users different types of modeling purposes and different levels of modeling complexity scholten et al 2004 kassahun et al 2005 refsgaard et al 2005 højberg et al 2007 scholten and refsgaard 2010 black et al 2014 rushton 2004 points out that a conceptual model can illustrate the mechanisms of the hydrological system being modeled and can allow other modelers to assess current thinking and to provide further insights jakeman et al 2006 summarize ten iterative steps in the development and evaluation of environmental models which incorporate the idea that conceptualization can help in thinking and finding underlying information about the system the capabilities of hydrological conceptual modeling can be summarized as follows 1 at the beginning stage of hydrological modeling hydrological conceptual modeling can be regarded as a process in which the modeling problems are analyzed the modeling objectives are specified and the dynamic mechanisms of the hydrological system is clarified rushton 2004 jakeman et al 2006 yazici and akkaya 2000 for example in studying the influence of vegetation on hydrological processes in an area according to specific application scenarios modelers may first consider the following issues among others a how many processes are involved from the beginning of precipitation to the formation of runoff b how vegetation types influence these processes c what the relationships among these processes are and d how vegetation affects the spatial and temporal distributions of rainfall runoff and evapotranspiration such points need to be clarified during the conceptual modeling phase which can help modelers to better understand the modeling problem although the understanding of modeling problems may be simple and incomplete at the beginning of conceptual modeling it provides the possibility for further communication with other researchers 2 in the hydrological modeling process hydrological conceptual modeling can support the transfer of modeling ideas among modelers to achieve a common understanding of the modeling problems generally when faced with comprehensive and interdisciplinary hydrological modeling problems modelers often have different viewpoints due to their different research backgrounds for example modelers with experience studying surface hydrological processes may be accustomed to applying infiltration excess runoff saturation excess runoff and partial infiltration excess runoff to describe the mechanisms responsible for runoff generation however modelers with groundwater research backgrounds usually emphasize the contribution of the underground seepage system to surface runoff generation rubin 2003 in this respect conceptual modeling can provide the capacity to express different ideas and can help different modelers understand each other 3 hydrological conceptual models embody the principles of hydrological models which can facilitate the sharing and application of hydrological models in the later stage of hydrological modeling clark et al 2015 with the increasing complexity of hydrological models the hydrological modules involved and the relationships among these modules become more complex argent 2004 belete et al 2017 yue et al 2019 it is difficult for users especially interdisciplinary researchers to understand these comprehensive hydrological models which limits the application of the models a conceptual model is the product of conceptual modeling which is very helpful for users who aim to understand a hydrological model quickly at the conceptual level by comparing conceptual models users can quickly choose appropriate models for their applications from a large number of candidate models rather than reading the explanatory documents for each model in turn in short hydrological conceptual modeling runs through the whole process of hydrological modeling and plays an important role in promoting the transmission and exchange of modeling ideas with the development of hydrological conceptual modeling research three main types of hydrological conceptual modeling methods have been developed 1 conceptual sketching sketching is a powerful way to explore modeling ideas rushton 2004 jakeman et al 2006 modelers usually drew a conceptual sketch directly on paper to express and communicate their modeling ideas this approach is very effective within a specific research team due to its simplicity and convenience however the conceptual modeling results are difficult to share with others and to reuse because of the informal and individual conceptual modeling approach wand and weber 2002 this makes it difficult for modelers with different backgrounds to communicate with each other 2 graph based conceptual modeling to formalize modeling ideas the influence diagram block diagram or bond graph is introduced by modelers to express the modeling elements e g geographic entities and hydrological processes and their relationships which can aid thinking and modeling gawthrop and smith 1996 muetzelfeldt and massheder 2003 jakeman et al 2006 leonard et al 2017 lukyanenko et al 2017 examples include gbms sm chari and sen 1998 gme generic modeling environment davis 2003 and geovista studio gahegan et al 2002 these methods usually use block primitives and lines to express specific elements and their relationships although this approach has advantages in expressing logical reasoning it has limitations in expressing the details of the modeling thought process such as the spatial and temporal relationships among different modeling elements for example canopy interception and surface infiltration are different steps in surface hydrological processes and they occur at different times and places however in a graph based modeling approach the lines between block primitives cannot express such spatial and temporal relationships among different modeling elements 3 icon based conceptual modeling this approach builds a visual conceptual modeling scenario from the perspective of the modelers ideas about the hydrological system chen et al 2011 in this approach different modeling elements are represented by different icons and these icons are organized by the layout rules to build a constrained and cognitive conceptual scenario such a scenario provides a flexible way for the modelers to communicate modeling ideas intuitively however due to the limitation of two dimensional 2d and static icons it is difficult to express the three dimensional 3d time space relationships of the modeling elements e g nested relationships moreover the hydrological processes are dynamic which is difficult to express in such a static and 2d scenario in conclusion although these conceptual modeling approaches provide effective tools to express modeling elements and their relationships they have limitations in expressing the spatial and temporal distribution of modeling elements and related dynamic hydrological processes recently serious games virtual environment and geographic scenario are increasingly used as tools to help stakeholders participate in the research of environmental issues chen et al 2013 lin et al 2013a b lin and chen 2015 craven et al 2017 chen and lin 2018 khoury et al 2018 smith and lohani 2018 lü et al 2018 2019 den haan et al 2020 li et al 2021a b yang et al 2021 inspired by these studies visual conceptual scenario is proposed to express modelers cognition of modeling system the visual conceptual scenario is the production of hydrological conceptual modeling which provides a visual way for cross domain modelers to express their modeling ideas at conceptual level thus facilitating the communication among these modelers the conceptual scenario consists of numbers of conceptual components which represent geographic entities e g rivers vegetation and soil involved in modeling system and related hydrological processes e g surface runoff precipitation and evaporation the cognitive differences among different modelers can be addressed by designing different conceptual components namely modelers can express their knowledge of the geographic entities or hydrological processes by designing corresponding conceptual components to construct the visual conceptual scenario these conceptual components need to be organized according specific rules therefore a series of rules e g context rules layout rules and semantic rules that reflect modelers cognition of modeling system are designed to constrain the construction of the scenario meanwhile the spatial and temporal distribution of conceptual components can be constrained by these rules for example the layout rules can dictate that cloud must be above the ground and the semantic rules can specify that rain comes before surface runoff since the dynamics of hydrological processes can be expressed by the interaction among conceptual components a method that represents such interaction relationships at conceptual level is proposed in this way the temporal and spatial distribution of modeling elements is constrained by specific rules and the dynamic hydrological process of the modeling system is driven by dynamic interaction method proposed in this article during the hydrological conceptual modeling modelers can exchange modeling ideas through the visual and dynamic conceptual scenario rather than through abstract block primitives the remainder of this article is structured as follows the construction framework of visual conceptual scenario is introduced in section 2 section 3 introduces the methodology of the construction of conceptual scenario in section 4 a case study involving two conceptual scenarios is developed finally conclusions and directions for future work are presented in section 5 2 the construction framework of the visual conceptual scenario fig 1 shows the construction framework of the visual conceptual scenario when considering a hydrological system modelers may work together to communicate their perceptions of how to model the system the following aspects among others will be considered in understanding a hydrological system the geographic entities involved in the system the space time distribution pattern of these entities how many hydrological processes take place in the system and the relationships among these processes in this article the geographic entity is employed as the cognitive object and the whole hydrological system is regarded as a collection of geographic entities and their relationships as shown in the left side of fig 1 the relationships among geographic entities can be treated as the behavior interaction or hydrological process interaction of these geographic entities for example the precipitation process can be treated as the behavior of the cloud geographic entity and it allows cloud entity to interact with underlying surface geographic entity therefore to understand the hydrological system modelers need to first understand the geographic entities involved in the hydrological system to represent the geographic entity and related hydrological processes the concept of conceptual component is proposed in this article as shown in the middle part of fig 1 a conceptual component is designed by modelers to express their ideas about a geographic entity and it consists of two parts the visual element and the behavior script the visual element is the abstract representation of the geographic entity in a visual way it can express the appearance of the geographic entity and the visual effects of related hydrological processes for example to represent vegetation the visual element can express the geometrical shapes the color and the visual effects of the transpiration process for the transpiration of vegetation it can be considered that vegetation has the transpiration behavior the behavior script defines the control logics that trigger the behaviors of the current conceptual component which can be used to drive the dynamic expression of the related hydrological process for example the cloud conceptual component defines the precipitation behavior i e the visual effects of precipitation and this behavior is triggered when the cloud cools suddenly which is defined in the behavior script based on this design idea of high cohesion and low coupling each conceptual component can express its appearance and behaviors and they can be flexibly coupled together to construct a conceptual scenario and interact with each other the process of constructing a conceptual scenario is the process of expressing the modeling ideas of modelers an effective conceptual scenario is one that follows the specific constraining rules that reflect modelers ideas about the modeling problems as shown in the right side of fig 1 the conceptual components are designed to be the fundamental units of the conceptual scenario and they need to match the specific constraining rules according to the modeling requirements for example pollutants generally flow from upstream to downstream the constraining rules need to restrain such directional relationships of the pollutant flow there are three main types of rules that will be considered context rules layout rules and semantic rules generally the context rules reflect the specific modeling requirements that are based on the analysis of the modeling problem the layout rules specify the spatial information e g position scale and rotation of the components and the semantic rules clarify the semantic properties e g physical biological and chemical properties of the conceptual components these constraining rules reflect the modelers understanding of the conceptual components that are involved in the conceptual scenario which also help the interdisciplinary modelers understand unfamiliar things for example a modeler who studies groundwater can design a series of rules to illustrate the layered structure of the soil and how the water enters and leaves such a layered structure in order to convey his her modeling ideas to other modelers moreover the constraining rules ensure the unambiguous expression of the conceptual scenario provide a normalized method of constructing a conceptual scenario and enable good communication among modelers due to the dynamic nature of the hydrological system a dynamic interaction method is proposed to express the dynamic hydrological processes and their interaction relationships compared to the static expression of hydrological processes used in current conceptual modeling methods the dynamic interaction method can drive the hydrological process to evolve more dynamically 3 the construction of the visual conceptual scenario 3 1 the design of the conceptual components a conceptual component is the comprehensive representation of a geographic entity and is the basic building block of a conceptual scenario the basic idea of designing the conceptual component is to use the visualization and scripting techniques provided by the unity engine unity 2021 to express the attribute and behavior characteristics of the geographic entity fig 2 shows the detailed design method of a conceptual component to identify a geographic entity the following aspects will be considered among others what it is its semantic features e g point source discharge where it is its spatial features e g position scale and rotation its geometric features e g the boundary of a basin its attribute features e g the flow volume of a river and the hydrological processes it is associated with e g the transpiration process of vegetation these aspects can be summarized as status characteristics and behavior characteristics as shown in fig 2 to formally describe these two types of characteristics the visual element and behavior script are designed to form a conceptual component the visual element is responsible for visualizing the geographic entity including the appearance of the geographic entity and the visual effects of its related hydrological process and describing the attribute characteristics associated with appearance such as the geometric shapes and the spatial position of the geographic entity the behavior script records the attribute characteristics associated with the behavior of the entity such as the semantic attributes e g the moisture of the soil and the evaporation velocity of the water and defines the control logic of triggering the visual effects that represent the corresponding hydrological process the unity engine is a real time 3d interactive content creation platform that provides a powerful graphics rendering engine and script systems which can be used to develop high quality graphics applications video games etc in this article the conceptual component is implemented based on unity there are three core components of the unity engine the rendering engine the physical engine and the script system the rendering engine is mainly responsible for graphics rendering and provides the ability to render 2d and 3d scenarios the physical engine is mainly response for simulating the real physical effects such as the collision detection of moving objects it is often used to calculate the motion behavior data of the conceptual component to produce physically consistent motion effects the script system provides the ability to interact flexibly with visual elements currently the c c 2021 and lua lua 2021 are the two most popular scripting languages that unity offers c is an object oriented programming language developed by microsoft which is very popular in the developer community lua is a lightweight and compact scripting language that is widely used to develop game logic due to its flexibility and ease of use lua is employed to develop the behavior script of the conceptual component in this article the advanced visualization technology provided by the unity engine is employed to design the visual element as shown in fig 2 the mesh that represents the shape of a geographic entity is usually constructed in 3d modeling software such as blender blender 2021 3d studio max 3d studio max 2021 and cinema 4d cinema 4d 2021 as shown in fig 3 part a in the upper left panel shows the tree mesh which provides the basic shape of a tree to visualize the mesh more vividly the light and texture which can be called material are employed to decorate the mesh the light is employed to simulate the visual effect of light hitting the surface of the mesh the texture is used to make the mesh look like the geographic entity it represents in the real world as shown in fig 3 part b in the upper left panel shows the tree with the material attached which makes the tree look like a tree in the real world a particle system is usually used to simulate fuzzy phenomena using massive small particles e g small squares or small circles in computer graphics such as fire explosions rain and snow in this article it can be used to represent dynamic hydrological processes such as precipitation and transpiration as shown in fig 3 part c in the upper left panel shows the tree with the transpiration process occurring the shading language shaderlab designed by unity is an editable program fragment that can configure the texture calculate the special effects e g the bloom effect and self luminous effect produce animation effects etc shaderlab is designed to execute the rendering instructions on the graphics processing unit gpu which determines the quality of the visual effects all these visualization technologies are provided by the rendering engine of unity which can be used to create not only 2d visual elements but also 3d visual elements as shown in the bottom panel of fig 3 a visual element is implemented by the game object in unity a game object can attach a series of functional components to implement the visualization requirements mentioned above for example the transform component represents the spatial information of the game object e g position rotation and scale the mesh render component determines how to render the game object and the material component can improve the visual effects of the game object the script component can access the information in other components and determine how to represent the visual effects for example the particle system can be used to represent precipitation e g particles moving from the sky to the ground and transpiration e g particles moving from the ground to the sky the script component can access the particle system attached to the game object to control the directions of the particles and express the corresponding hydrological process unity provides a powerful script system in which c c 2021 is employed as the native programming language due to its popularity in the development community as a typical application of the script system the script component is implemented in c the behavior script determines when the behavior is triggered as shown in the upper right panel in fig 3 when the temperature reaches 30 the transpiration process of the tree will be triggered and the corresponding visual effects represented by the particle system will be driven immediately generally the conceptual component is designed by modelers with a specific research background which means that the behaviors of the conceptual component have to be fully customizable in this regard lua is better than the native programming language c at defining the triggering logic of the behaviors as shown in the bottom panel in fig 3 the xlua plugin is employed to introduce lua into unity and it can support the communication between lua and c luabehavior defines the necessary information of the behavior script such as the related attribute data and lifecycle functions the execution order of these lifecycle functions is as follows awake start update and destroy the triggering logic of the behaviors is usually defined in the update function any customized behavior script inherited from luabehavior can exchange data with the script component attached in the game object this is why the behavior script can trigger the visual effects defined in the visual element in brief the visual element represents the visual effects of the geographic entity and the behavior script defines the logic that triggers these visual effects in this way modelers can express their understanding of a geographic entity by designing the corresponding conceptual component and customizing its behaviors this design method of high cohesion and low coupling provides convenience and flexibility for coupling these conceptual components to construct a conceptual scenario 3 2 the construction of the conceptual scenario 3 2 1 the classification and expression of the constraining rules the constraining rules are used to guide and restrict the construction of the conceptual scenario which determines whether the conceptual scenario conforms to the modelers ideas about the modeling problems as mentioned in section 2 there are three main kinds of constraining rules i e context rules layout rules and semantic rules as shown in fig 4 the context rules are usually a formal description of the modeling targets application requirements application fields etc and they reflect the modelers analysis results for the modeling problems the context rules may only work in the current conceptual scenario due to their strong specificity for example in the study of the hydrological system in a large scale watershed the small reservoirs may be neglected so the reservoir conceptual component cannot be selected to construct the current conceptual scenario however the reservoir cannot be neglected in the study of the hydrological process in a small scale watershed generally the context rules would be designed by the participating modelers to build the fundamental framework from a holistic perspective to guide the subsequent modeling work the layout rules reflect the spatial and temporal distributions of the conceptual components for example vegetation grows in soil rather than a river and the sun must appear in the sky rather than the ground normally the relative directions and distances and the spatial topology relationships among the conceptual components would be considered in designing the layout rules for example a hydropower station is usually built in the upper and middle reaches of a river and lies astride the river the direction and spatial topology information would be employed to express such relationships between the hydropower station and the river the semantic rules usually reflect the biological physical chemical and social properties of the conceptual component for example a river will freeze if the environmental temperature is less than zero degrees celsius and the terrain of china is characteristically high in the west but low in the east these rules express the semantic information of the conceptual components which makes the conceptual scenario more understandable in this article the lua script is employed to define these rules formally and flexibly as shown at the bottom of fig 4 the lua script defines the rule that a tree must grow in the terrain rather than in the sea the start function defines the participating conceptual components e g the tree and the terrain and the check function defines the judgment logic which refers to whether the tree and terrain match this constraining rule in this way the constraining rules can be defined in the lua script independently and they can be flexibly introduced and removed in a conceptual scenario according to the modeling requirements generally there are two kinds of rules involved in the construction of a conceptual scenario for common rules e g basic geographical regularities and common sense the rule scripts are saved in the rule library which can be shared among different conceptual scenarios however for custom rules the modelers would work together to define the rule scripts for the specific modeling requirements and these scripts may only work in the current conceptual scenario 3 2 2 applying the constraining rules fig 5 shows the process of applying the constraining rules to construct a conceptual scenario first the related conceptual components are selected according to the conceptual modeling requirements then these conceptual components are arranged in the conceptual scenario according to the modeling ideas of the participating modelers such as by placing the conceptual components in the appropriate positions in the conceptual scenario and selecting the appropriate conceptual components to construct the conceptual scenario according to the semantic information in the meantime the constraining rules are selected to check whether the arrangement of these conceptual components is effective and reasonable if the constraining rules apply only to the current conceptual scenario the modelers need to customize the rule scripts otherwise they select common rule scripts from the rule library subsequently these rule scripts will be executed to determine the effectiveness of these arrangements of the conceptual components for those arrangements that do not pass the rule test modelers need to rearrange these conceptual components until they match all of the constraining rules finally to drive the dynamic visualization of the conceptual scenario the interactive relationships among the conceptual components are configured which is described in section 3 3 3 3 the dynamic expression of the conceptual scenario 3 3 1 the dynamic interaction method among conceptual components generally a hydrological process is a dynamic process that can evolve over time the dynamic visualization of the conceptual scenario can help modelers understand hydrological processes more intuitively especially for modelers with other research backgrounds as mentioned in section 3 1 the status characteristics semantic geometric attribute spatial etc are employed to describe the conceptual components which can define the status information of the conceptual components at a certain point in time therefore the dynamic expression of the hydrological process can be regarded as a task in which the status characteristics of the related conceptual components change over time fig 6 shows the dynamic interaction method which can be used to describe the interactive relationships among the different statuses of multiple conceptual components conceptual component 1 i e c 1 has three statues i e s 1 s 2 and s 3 and each status can be described by its status characteristics semantic i e se 1 spatial i e sp 1 geometric i e g 1 attribute i e a 1 etc the interactive processes relating these status characteristics can drive the evolution of the hydrological process similarly the different conceptual components can interact with each other in this way fig 7 shows an example of a dynamic interaction method the underlying surface conceptual component contains three statuses the surface runoff status the infiltration status and the groundwater runoff status in this example for convenience only the soil moisture attribute is employed to describe these statuses specifically the three statuses of the underlying surface conceptual component can be linked by the soil moisture the cloud conceptual component has a precipitation status and the rainfall attribute is employed to describe the amount of precipitation as shown in the left panel of fig 7 to drive the conceptual scenario first the cloud conceptual component needs to trigger the precipitation process i e it switches to the precipitation status then as the rainfall increases the soil moisture of the underlying surface increases surface runoff occurs when the rainfall intensity exceeds the soil infiltration intensity i e the surface runoff process is triggered generally some of the rainfall forms surface runoff and some of it seeps into the soil i e the infiltration process is triggered finally when the soil moisture exceeds the field water capacity the excess water seeps down to form underground runoff i e the underground runoff process is triggered in this way the hydrological processes involved can be triggered via the interaction of different statuses of multiple conceptual components 3 3 2 the interactive script for implementing the dynamic interaction method the dynamic interaction method describes the interactive relationships among different conceptual components to implement the dynamic interaction method the interactive script is developed in which different conceptual components are connected by the interaction of their status characteristics fig 8 implements the example in fig 7 which shows how the interactive script drives the dynamic expression of the conceptual scenario as shown in fig 8 the cloud and underlying surface conceptual components have been registered in the conceptual scenario as mentioned above both the cloud and the underlying surface conceptual components consist of the visual elements and related behavior script the cloud conceptual component defines a precipitation process in the behavior script of the cloud conceptual component the rainfall variable is defined to record the amount of precipitation in the underlying surface conceptual component there are three hydrological processes that have been defined surface runoff infiltration and groundwater runoff the soilmoisture variable is defined in the behavior script which can be used to determine when to trigger these processes to drive the scenario in the start function of the interactive script the precipitation process is triggered first then in the update function the cloud conceptual component and underlying surface conceptual component are connected by passing the value of rainfall to soilmoisture finally the visual effects of the hydrological processes are triggered when the value of the soilmoisture variable meets the corresponding conditions in the behavior script in this way different conceptual components can interact with each other and the conceptual scenario can be driven dynamically 4 study case groundwater is an important source of energy production in arid regions so it is necessary to study the impact of enhanced human pressure on groundwater awawdeh et al 2020 in this section the conceptual modeling is conducted under the background of identifying the impact of energy base water project on the groundwater in the subei lake basin ordos northwestern china hou et al 2008 liu et al 2016 two conceptual scenarios that reflect the key hydrological processes in the subei lake basin are designed to test the practicability and feasibility of constructing visual conceptual scenario for conducting hydrological conceptual modeling section 4 1 constructs a 3d scenario that describes the impact of groundwater exploitation on the surface a 2d scenario is constructed to illustrate the groundwater movement in section 4 2 4 1 the 3d scenario for describing the impact of the groundwater exploitation on the surface the exploitation of groundwater will have a series of effects on the local ecological environment for example extensive groundwater extraction can dry up lakes wither trees and dry up farmland the conceptual scenario constructed in this section attempts to conduct conceptual modeling for the impact of the groundwater exploitation on the surface for simplicity there are several typical geographic entities and their relationships that are involved in the conceptual modeling process as shown in fig 9 the cloud can produce precipitation and the precipitation process can connect to the terrain because the terrain takes moisture from the precipitation process as the rainfall increases some of the rainfall forms surface runoff and some of it seeps into the soil consequently the surface runoff process can connect to the lake and the infiltration process can connect to the groundwater the lake can replenish the groundwater sources by the water supply process the tree absorbs groundwater to sustain its life to develop energy production several waterworks have been built in the subei lake basin the waterworks system pumps up water from the production well and then the water is used for crop irrigation and energy production of the ordos energy base in fig 9 these geographic entities and their relationships are expressed by the block diagram based method in this section a 3d conceptual scenario is constructed to improve such a conceptual modeling method first the conceptual components are designed to represent the corresponding geographic entities in the modeling system taking the lake conceptual component as an example in the left panel of fig 10 the visual elements e g the shape and the color of the lake of the lake conceptual components are designed in the blender and they can be controlled by the c script to implement several visual effects in the unity engine thus the specific behavior of the lake can be represented for example the evaporation process is implemented by a c script that toggles a particle system to be shown or hidden as shown in the upper left corner of fig 10 similarly other behaviors of the lake are implemented such as water supply and fall rise of water level the visual element defines the appearance and related visual effects of the lake while the behavior script is designed to determine when to trigger these visual effects the right panel of fig 10 shows the judgment logics for triggering the corresponding behaviors in this way all the conceptual components involved in fig 9 can be designed as shown in fig 11 to construct the 3d conceptual scenario the conceptual components must be arranged by a series of constraint rules as shown in fig 12 a here three examples are considered 1 because the subei lake basin belongs to an arid area there is little rainfall this can be constrained by the context rule 2 generally the tree is planted in the terrain rather than in the lake this can be constrained by the layout rule 3 the lake water level is normally higher than the groundwater level this can be constrained by the semantic rule finally the interactive script is developed to express the dynamic evolution process of the 3d conceptual scenario here three examples exemplify the process as shown in fig 12 b 1 the waterworks system extracts the water from underground 2 the lake seeps into the ground 3 the tree dies due to lack of water at this point the 3d conceptual scenario has been built and the dynamic visualization of the scenario is shown in fig 13 4 2 the 2d scenario for expressing the groundwater movement in this section the groundwater movement with the consideration of groundwater exploitation is expressed in a 2d conceptual scenario fig 14 shows the interactive relationships among the involved geographic entities the groundwater is mainly used for energy production and vegetation absorption in addition the lake is one of the sources of groundwater supply because of the differences in underground topography and geological conditions coupled with the extraction of groundwater the groundwater begins to move which occurs via downward leakage upward leakage and lateral flow similar to the steps in section 4 1 the conceptual components that are involved in fig 14 are designed then the corresponding constraint rules are developed and the interactive relationships among these components are configured fig 15 shows the constructed 2d conceptual scenario 5 conclusions and future work this article proposes to construct visual conceptual scenario to facilitate the exchange of modeling ideas among modelers during hydrological conceptual modeling the primary originality of this study is its development of a construction scheme that implements the construction of conceptual scenario which can support modelers with different backgrounds in working together first modelers can express their conception of geographic entities by designing the conceptual components with which the appearance and behaviors of geographic entities are expressed then modelers can develop rules to constrain the construction of the conceptual scenario which reflects an understanding of the spatial and temporal relationships among geographic entities finally the visual scenario is driven to express the dynamic interaction among modeling elements and visually demonstrate the dynamic hydrological process compared to block diagram based methods the visual conceptual scenario can not only express the spatial and temporal distribution of modeling elements but also express the dynamic evolution of hydrological processes which helps interdisciplinary modelers understand the modeling system more clearly thus promoting the communication among modelers the conceptual component is the basic unit of conceptual scenario construction as well as the expression of modeling ideas modelers from different domains can design their own conceptual components to express their modeling ideas these components can be coupled together to form a conceptual scenario that reflects the modelers common understanding of the modeling system this design pattern greatly facilitates cross domain modelers to express and share their modeling ideas modelers from different domains and even around the world can collaborate on conceptual modeling by designing their own conceptual components and these conceptual components can also be shared in the cyberspace in short the conceptual scenario construction method proposed in this paper provides the possibility for collaborative hydrological conceptual modeling in cyberspace in the future to ensure that the proposed visual conceptual scenario better serves hydrological conceptual modeling the following issues are worth exploring in future studies 1 convenient and effective tools are necessary for modelers in designing the conceptual components currently the conceptual components are designed manually in the unity editor although the unity editor provides extensible libraries for developers to customize their tools this requires developers to be familiar with the framework of the unity editor itself which increases the difficulty of designing the conceptual components in this respect a series of application oriented high level tools need to be developed to improve the efficiency of designing the conceptual components 2 common resource libraries need to be built for sharing and reusing conceptual resources i e the resources that are used to design the conceptual components generally there is much work to do in designing a conceptual component such as preparing visual resources e g images 3d models and art resources designing the visual effects e g the animation and particle system and developing the behavior scripts it is a time consuming process for developers to prepare these resources especially visual resources however once common resource libraries e g for visual resources special effects and behavior scripts are built developers can search and reuse the existing conceptual resources 3 a recommendation mechanism for the constraining rules needs to be explored to improve the efficiency of the construction of conceptual scenarios in this article the constraining rules are customized manually or selected by the modelers which is inefficient in the construction of complex conceptual scenarios moreover although modelers from different areas can work together to design the constraining rules for a specific conceptual scenario this cannot guarantee that the designed rules will take all the constraining cases into account in this scenario therefore an automatic or semiautomatic recommendation mechanism for the constraining rules could provide a series of alternative rules that could apply to the current conceptual scenario through such a mechanism modelers could select or customize specific rules based on the alternative rules which would reduce the difficulty of constructing the

25726,we applied data based recurrence cfd rcfd to model pollutant dispersion in near field flow configurations in case of complex topologies the global domain version of rcfd fails to account for local recurrent flow features we therefore developed a novel island based version of rcfd which partitions the computational domain to isolate islands of high recurrence prominence and subsequently defines a distinct recurrence path for each of these islands we applied island based rcfd to pollutant dispersion for two side by side cubical buildings with three different gap widths in between them and a real urban environment we showed that numerical predictions of pollutant dispersion by island based rcfd were in excellent agreement with full cfd simulations thus outperforming the global domain version of rcfd in both applications island based rcfd simulations ran three orders of magnitude faster than corresponding full cfd simulations in the second application this speed up enabled real time simulations on a computational grid of 10 million cells graphical abstract image 1 keywords recurrence cfd rcfd pollutant dispersion island based rcfd real time cfd 1 introduction globally over 50 of the population lives in urban areas today and the world s urban population will increase to 7 5 billion before 2050 giles corti et al 2016 in recent years air pollution in urban environments has increased significantly posing a serious societal problem environmental protection agency 2020 zhong et al 2016 air quality in compact urban environments is directly linked to human health block and calderón garcidueñas 2009 shorshani et al 2015 because of daily exposure to hazardous pollutants by outdoor activities and the penetration of outdoor pollutants into the indoor environment by building ventilation and infiltration the urban outdoor air pollution originates mainly from emissions from traffic households and industry and comprises hazardous materials e g toxic gaseous substances and fine particulates bartzis et al 2008 shorshani et al 2015 understanding pollutant dispersion mechanisms and identifying pollution concentration patterns is essential for the design of pollution mitigation strategies for the investigation of pollutant dispersion in urban environments different approaches like field measurements cui et al 2017 niu and tung 2007 wind tunnel tests gromke et al 2016 gromke and ruck 2012 and numerical simulations blocken 2014 blocken and gualtieri 2012 tominaga and stathopoulos 2013 have been employed especially numerical simulations have been widely used because of their relatively low cost and for their ability to provide three dimensional information in the whole computational domain as opposed to point measurements in field measurements and wind tunnel tests among numerical simulations and analytical calculations gaussian dispersion models are often utilized because of their simplicity and time efficiency moonen and allegrini 2015 rajaona et al 2015 senocak et al 2008 however these simple models fail to capture near field dispersion mechanisms and three dimensional concentration patterns within complex urban topologies in such cases computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations have been proposed to accurately simulate the interaction between the complex wind field and the pollutant blocken et al 2013 chu et al 2005 gousseau et al 2012 on top of the complex mean flow pollutant dispersion is governed by the turbulence characteristics i e the characteristics of the large scale and small scale vortices of the flow in the context of cfd simulation of urban flows especially these small scale flow features cannot be resolved but their effect on the mean flow has to be modelled by an appropriate turbulence model generally turbulence models can be roughly organized into reyonds averaged navier stokes rans models and large eddy simulation les models rans models are based on time averaging of turbulent fluctuations independent of their spatial scale and require less computational resources than les consequently they have been utilized in many urban environmental studies e g ai and mak 2014 blocken et al 2012 du et al 2018 ricci et al 2019 les models in turn resolve large scale turbulent fluctuations while only the spatially small scales are modelled by a sub grid model pope 2000 recently les models have been used in studies of near field pollutant dispersion in built up environments blocken 2018 moonen et al 2011 indicating a higher predictive capability of les over rans models the large drawback of les turbulence models is the associated computational cost which is much higher than that of rans models tominaga and stathopoulos 2013 reported that the computational time of les was 10 25 times higher than that of a comparable rans simulation therefore increasing the computational efficiency of les without significant loss in accuracy can be seen as a major requirement and challenge towards a wider spread application of les in near field pollutant dispersion modeling for the case of pseudo periodic flows which can be described by recurring flow features the recurrence cfd rcfd approach was developed to mitigate the high computational costs of les recurrence cfd was first developed in the realm of chemical engineering lichtenegger and pirker 2016 pirker and lichtenegger 2018 and has been successfully applied in several fields including bubble columns abbasi et al 2020 fluidized beds dabbagh et al 2020 and free surface flows pirker et al 2020 conceptually rcfd is a data assisted method employing a two stage strategy of data storage and data utilization in the first stage conventional cfd simulations are utilized to generate a characteristic database representing the flow field under consideration and in the second stage this database is exploited to picture the propagation of passive scalars like an air pollutant following this simple strategy the computational times of scalar dispersion processes have been significantly reduced resulting in a speed up of three to four orders of magnitude by rcfd in comparison to full cfd simulations dabbagh et al 2020 du et al 2020 pirker and lichtenegger 2018 pirker et al 2020 in our previous work we successfully applied rcfd to accurately predict pollutant dispersion around an isolated cubical building benchmark case du et al 2020 in that study we could reduce the computational time of corresponding les based cfd simulations by three orders of magnitude without impairing neither the resolution nor the accuracy of results however the step from this benchmark case towards complex flows in urban topologies is not straightforward at its core the rcfd method relies on a prominent recurrent nature of the flow such that within the database which is provided a priori by conventional cfd simulations one always finds pairings of similar flow patterns at two instances of time while this was possible for the simple benchmark case it might be impossible for more complex topologies in his study on local and global recurrence lichtenegger 2018 showed that the global dimensionality of a flow scales exponentially with the domain size in order to meet this dimensionality we would have to build up huge databases spanning a very long observation period before we can find a pair of globally similar flow patterns at first glance this restriction might render the application of rcfd to complex flows in large domains impossible in this study we try to overcome this existing limitation of rcfd by a domain decomposition approach such that we organize the global domain into smaller recurrence islands which for themselves are appropriate for an application of rcfd for this purpose we first have to identify sub domains of prominent recurrent flow features such as wakes of buildings which are embedded in a background flow of low prominence in our case prominent recurrent flow features manifest in a large magnitude of local vorticity fluctuations see section 2 2 once identified the databases for those recurrence islands are built up which are then exploited for the simulation of local dispersion on a deeper code level these local recurrence islands required a thorough revision and adaption of the existing cell to cell shift operator in rcfd which represents convective fluxes in order to test this island based rcfd approach we first illustrate its functionality for the case of two side by side cubic buildings with a gap of varying width between them the configuration of cubical building and the incident wind profile are adopted from the experimental setup of li and meroney 1983 while in case of a small gap separating the wakes into independent recurrence islands does not make sense because of the dominant wake interactions it does become a viable option for larger gap widths in this purely numerical study we will study pollutant dispersion from a ground level line source in the wake of the two buildings by comparing the predictions of full les based cfd existing global domain rcfd and our novel island based rcfd in a second part of this study we apply island based rcfd to the complex urban topology of the wissensturm neighborhood in the city of linz austria also in this case a ground level line source emission is considered which represents vehicular exhaust along a street and we critically compare the predictions of full les based cfd and island based rcfd this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the methodologies of full les based cfd the existing rcfd and the novel island based rcfd are presented afterwards predictions of pollutant dispersion are presented and analyzed for the side by side cubical buildings in section 3 and for the real urban environment in section 4 respectively finally summary and conclusions are given in section 5 2 method 2 1 conventional les based cfd simulations in the framework of this study conventional les based cfd simulations are run for two purposes on the one hand short term full cfd simulations are used to feed the database for subsequent rcfd simulations while on the other hand long term full cfd simulation serve as numerical validation base for our novel rcfd method since the les based cfd simulation methodology has been presented in our previous publication du et al 2020 we omit any details in the present paper in the following we only briefly rephrase the main concept for the sake of completeness the governing filtered navier stokes equations for incompressible isothermal fluid flow of a newtonian fluid read 1 u i x i 0 and 2 u i t u i u j x j υ 2 u i x j x j 1 ρ p x i τ i j x j where u i is the cartesian velocity component p represents the pressure the overbars indicate spatial filtering and υ is the molecular viscosity the subgrid scale stress tensor τ i j describes the effect of unresolved turbulent eddies and can be modelled as pope 2000 3 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j with τ k k being the isotropic part of subgrid scale stress s i j representing the rate of strain tensor for the resolved scale and μ t denotes the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity in the smagorinsky lilly subgrid scale model lilly 1966 smagorinsky 1963 μ t is modelled by fluent 2018 4 μ t ρ l s 2 s with s 2 s i j s i j and l s the mixing length which in turn is calculated by 5 l s m i n k d c s v 1 3 where k 0 40 is the von kármán constant d is the closest wall distance v is the volume of the computational cell and c s 0 1 is the smagorinsky constant on top of the flow equations the transport equation for the passive scalar φ e g a pollutant concentration reads 6 φ t φ u i x i x i d e f f φ x i s with d e f f as the effective diffusivity and s representing a source term e g a pollution source 2 2 existing recurrence cfd simulations as with the conventional les based simulations the existing recurrence cfd rcfd approach has been presented in detail in our previous publication du et al 2020 in the present paper we therefore restrict ourselves to restating the main concept of rcfd however in presenting the main ingredients of rcfd we will emphasise the description of the recurrent nature of the flow more specifically the recurrence prominence since this will pave the way for the novel island based version of rcfd as stated in the introduction rcfd is a data assisted approach employing a two phase strategy first a characteristic database of the given pseudo periodic flow is generated using conventional les based cfd simulations in this phase the fluid flow is traced by massless particles and in regular intervals start and end positions of those lagrangian tracer paths are stored as characteristic cell to cell communication paths into a database which in the end consists of n frames of cell to cell communication patterns in a second phase this database is utilized by a markov alike recurrence process which stitches together sequences from the database more specifically this results into a cell to cell communication network which can evolve beyond the time span of the characteristic database based on this recurrent communication network any passive scalars can be transported according to the pre set cell to cell communication paths in our previous work du et al 2020 we additionally revised the face swap operator which accounts for the physical diffusion of air pollutants in order to describe the degree of similarity between two frames in the database describing two flow fields at two instances of time t and t we employ a recurrence norm 7 n r e c t t d 3 r ϕ r t ϕ r t 2 m a x t t d 3 r ϕ r t ϕ r t 2 with r as spatial coordinate and the integral represents integration over the whole domain in order to capture the recurrent nature of a given flow most efficiently the field quantity ϕ should be chosen based on the physical core phenomenon under consideration in our case we opted for the fluctuating component of the flow vorticity ϕ ω ω ω with ω u and indicating time averaging once the pairwise recurrence norms have been calculated we can span a recurrence matrix which indicates the degree of similarity between frame pairings within the database see illustration in fig 1 obviously this recurrence matrix has a zero diagonal since the recurrence norm between identical frames is zero in the off diagonal region however the value of the recurrence norm first increases i e the level of similarity between frames decreases before it eventually starts to fluctuate around a rather constant value the recurrence plateau if the off diagonal values of the recurrence norm do not run into a plateau the observation period for the database τ r e c was too small or the flow cannot be considered as pseudo periodic if we just plot the recurrence norm along the first line of the recurrence matrix we obtain a recurrence vector which clearly illustrates this off diagonal behaviour of the recurrence norm fig 1 right starting from zero the recurrence norm first increases before it fluctuates around the recurrence plateau finally the magnitude of these fluctuations represents the prominence of recurrence essentially this recurrence prominence determines how well we can distinguish between similar and non similar frame pairings within the database while in our previous study on the isolated cube benchmark case du et al 2020 we experienced significant recurrence prominence of this local flow configuration we obtain a very low recurrence prominence for the case of large domains of complex topologies shown later in this study 2 3 novel island based recurrence cfd simulations at its core our novel island based recurrence cfd methodology introduces a spatial domain composition depending on the local prominence of recurrent flow features in the following sub section we will introduce this island identification methodology while further implications of this domain decomposition are addressed in subsection 2 3 2 2 3 1 identification of recurrence islands for the identification of recurrence islands we use the same field quantity as we have proposed for the recurrence norm eq 7 hence we try to identify local regions islands of high fluctuations of vorticity ω the main steps of this identification procedure are sketched in fig 2 and can be summarized as follows first the time averaged field of vorticity fluctuations ω is spatially smoothened in order to avoid excessively small islands second we look for remaining local maxima and starting from those maxima we expand individual islands towards their neighbouring cells until another island is reached typically this procedure results in quite a lot of small and maybe neighbouring recurrence islands therefore closely located small islands are combined into larger ones in a third step in order to achieve a reasonable number of individual recurrence islands 2 3 2 island based rcfd approach once recurrence islands are identified we can build a recurrence matrix for each of those sub domains consequently we will find different recurrence paths which result in individual time varying communication networks of cell to cell shift patterns for each island in fig 3 the main consequence for the existing recurrence cfd is emphasized instead of one global domain communication network we have n networks which are controled by different recurrence paths during the convection step we have to loop through individual sets of cell to cell shifts for each recurrence island notably all other steps of the recurrence cfd algorithm remain unaffected by this domain decomposition 2 4 numerical implementation the novel island based rcfd runs on the same computational grid as the conventional cfd simulation furthermore all functionalities of the island based rcfd approach have been implemented in the framework of ansys fluent v19 2 by user defined functions such that there is no need to switch the software between full cfd and rcfd simulations however the fluid solver functionalities of fluent will only be used for feeding the database the rcfd solver only uses fluent s grid access routines i e cell to face pointers parallel communication by mpi macros and post processing functions 3 application 1 two side by side cubical buildings in order to prove the functionality of our novel island based rcfd approach we consider the example of two side by side cubical buildings with a gap in between in the next three sub sections we start with a description of the case set up as well as the numerical settings for both conventional les based cfd simulations and rcfd simulations respectively finally subsection 3 4 is dedicated to a thorough analysis of the predictions of the existing global domain rcfd and our novel island based rcfd in comparison to reference results of long term full conventional cfd simulations 3 1 case setup we adopt the case setup from the wind tunnel experiments of li and meroney 1983 who studied pollutant dispersion from a vent on the roof of a cubical building in our previous work du et al 2020 we validated conventional les based cfd simulations for this specific setup and performed sensitivity tests of spatial and temporal discretization in this study we essentially used the same cube geometry boundary conditions and temporal discretization and similar spatial discretization as in the previous work but we doubled the cubic building to arrange for the side by side configuration of two buildings with a gap in total we consider three side by side configurations by changing the gap width between the two cubical buildings from one to five times of building height as detailed in fig 4 these three configurations are called gap 1 gap 3 and gap 5 respectively to represent the vehicular exhausts in the street a ground level line source downstream of the two side by side buildings is defined the line source is placed 0 025 m downstream of the buildings and stretches along both buildings such that the line length is equal to two time the building length plus the gap width see fig 5 vehicular exhausts are simulated by means of a passive tracer gas with same density as air and the emission rate is set to 3 0 10 5 kg s 3 2 simulation settings for conventional cfd the size of the computational domain was chosen in alignment with best practice guidelines bpgs schatzmann et al 2010 tominaga et al 2008 resulting in dimensions of 21h length 12h g width 6h height based on the building height h fig 5a the grid topology and numerical settings are directly adopted from our previous work du et al 2020 at the building surfaces the distance of first cell center point to the wall is set to 0 00125 m yielding y values of about one the computational grid for the three gap widths consists of 1 4 1 7 and 2 1 million hexahedral cells fig 5b the vertical inlet wind profile as well as the profiles for turbulent energy and turbulent dissipation rate are deduced from the experiment of li and meroney 1983 the simplec algorithm is applied for pressure velocity coupling and second order schemes are used for temporal and spatial derivatives further details are given in our previous publication du et al 2020 after an initial spin up process a pseudo periodic flow is established after roughly two flow through times with the latter being defined as τ f l u h 0 32 s with l 1 05 m the length of computational domain and u h as 3 3 m s the characteristic wind profile velocity at building height after these two flow through times the data sampling for the rcfd database starts while at the same time a long term 40 x τ f les based cfd simulation of pollutant dispersion is started as a reference for later rcfd predictions 3 3 simulation settings for rcfd assuming that the characteristic minimum time scale of the governing flow dynamics does not change by adding a second cubic building we define the same sampling interval for the recurrence database δ t r e c 0 01 s as in our previous study du et al 2020 based on this recurrence sampling interval the conventional les based cfd simulation will write cell to cell communication patterns together with field data on vorticity fluctuations every 10th time step thanks to storage efficiency improvements in the code not detailed in this paper we are able to store n 200 data frames thus after a total simulation time of τ r e c 2 s the conventional les based cfd simulation has established the recurrence database in case of island based rcfd we now proceed with the process of island identification in fig 6 the result of this island identification procedure can be seen in the first small gap configuration gap 1 case only one island is identified covering both buildings this island is embedded into a global background sea of low recurrence prominence while within this recurrence island i e in the interacting wakes of those two buildings dominant fluctuations of vorticity occur the fluctuations of vorticity are relatively low elsewhere i e in the background sea which represents the rest of the domain in case of the other two larger gap configurations this island topology changes such that two individual per building islands are established in these cases the high fluctuation regions i e in the wakes of the two buildings are separated by an in between region of low fluctuations which is part of the background sea obviously this island formation depends on a threshold value of vorticity fluctuations magnitude which decides the formation and spatial extension of these recurrence islands in order to avoid case specific settings we opted for a relative threshold of 15 percent of the global maximal value once the domain decomposition has been established we can separate the global database into a set of per island databases and perform recurrence analysis on each of them in fig 7 the recurrence matrices of the background sea are plotted together with the recurrence matrix of the individual islands note that two recurrence islands have been identified for the gap 3 and the gap 5 cases however in fig 7 only one island s recurrence matrix is depicted since the recurrence matrixes for these two islands are very similar obviously the recurrence plateau i e the mean off diagonal level of the pairwise recurrence norms for the island based recurrence matrix is lower than that for the background sea illustrating the off diagonal behaviour of the pairwise recurrence norms along the baseline recurrence vector we further see that within the islands we can expect a significantly higher recurrence prominence than elsewhere based on this per island recurrence behaviour different recurrence paths will be created in each individual recurrence island in other words we will stitch together sequences of cell to cell communication patterns differently for each recurrence island 3 4 results of cfd and rcfd simulations in analyzing the predictive capability of rcfd we restrict ourselves to an evaluation of mean concentration fields for this purpose a non dimensional concentration coefficient k c is defined as 8 k c c u h h q l with c being the dimensional simulated concentration u h depicting the approach wind speed at building height h q the total pollutant emission rate and l the length of the line source in presenting our results we follow a top down approach starting with a three dimensional iso surface representation of the concentration plume towards a contour plot in a horizontal plan to finally concentration profiles along vertical lines with associated error norms in fig 8 iso surfaces of kc are depicted illustrating the three dimensional shape of the pollution plumes in all cases we can observe an accumulation of concentration in the wakes of the buildings while the pollutants are blown downstream along the gap in between the buildings both versions of rcfd predict nearly the same global plume shape as the reference les based cfd simulation with only minor differences in the downstream length of the pollution streaks at this global level of evaluation the most obvious difference can be detected in the smoothness of the iso surfaces while conventional les based cfd simulations result in very smooth mean concentration fields both versions of rcfd introduce artificial noise into these fields which subsequently results in an increased roughness of those iso surfaces this artificial noise can be linked to the representation of the continuous fluxes of pollutants by discrete cell to cell shifts in a next level of evaluation we consider a contour plot of mean concentration in a horizontal plane at mid building height z h 0 5 see fig 9 while both versions of rcfd successfully reproduce the main features of the reference solution we can detect specific prediction errors in case of the global domain based rcfd in the gap 3 case the middle downstream streak is significantly over predicted while in case of the gap 5 case the two middle streaks are both underpredicted and strongly asymmetric in this evaluation the island based version of rcfd achieves a better agreement with the reference solution finally we consider profiles of mean concentration at three vertical lines in the wake of one of the buildings see fig 10 while the island based rcfd agrees very well with the full les based cfd simulation the global domain based rcfd existing rcfd exhibits significant differences these can be linked to locally unfavorable stitching of sequences from the global database stitching locally non similar frames representing non similar flow features inevitably results in local dispersion errors e g when locally the flow suddenly just points into another direction the island based rcfd on the other hand provides a locally reasonable stitching of sequences at least within the islands of most prominent recurrent fluctuations which in the end results in a very good predictive quality of the results in addition to the graphical representation appendix a provides error norms for a quantitative evaluation of the predictive quality of island based rcfd which confirm the superior predictive capability of island based rcfd simulations as opposed to the existing rcfd at this point we can conclude that while both versions of rcfd are able to picture the global behaviour of the pollutant plumes reasonably well island based rcfd predictions result in a better quantitative agreement with the corresponding les based cfd reference simulation at the same time we experienced a very large speed up in terms of computational time see fig 11 while the full les based cfd simulations took between 300 and 400 h of wall clock time on a 32 core computer rcfd both version require the same computational resources took only 48 61 h of total simulation time including the time needed for building the databases this speed up is even more pronounced if we consider only the simulation of pollutant propagation itself once the database has been established in that case rcfd simulations take just a couple of minutes in between 11 and 14 min in comparison to more than 300 h of corresponding full cfd simulations resulting in a speed up of more than three orders of magnitude i e around 1500 times faster since the database for a given configuration has to be built up only once this latter speed up would represent the effective total speed up for all subsequent simulations of alternative pollution events 4 application 2 a real urban environment in the following section we intend to prove the feasibility of island based rcfd simulations for the prediction of pollutant dispersion in a real urban environment in assessing the predictive capabilities and the performance of the rcfd methodology we focus on a thorough comparison with full les based cfd simulations we do not oppose our numerical predictions to measurement data we rather restrict ourselves to a comparison between two numerical methodologies classical les based cfd and island based rcfd 4 1 case description a small part of the town linz in austria the home town of co author s p has been chosen as computational domain features a dominant wissensturm building hosting a public library together with some four to five storey buildings in its immediate surroundings see fig 12 a b we opted for this topology because of a planned traffic tunnel which will have its tunnel portal located just south of this part of the town vehicles aiming for this tunnel might line up just in front of the wissensturm thus causing a dominant line source of traffic induced pollutants in that case pollutant dispersion will be of crucial importance for the residents living in the wake of the wissensturm 4 2 simulation settings for conventional cfd we defined the computational domain following the same bpg as for the two side by side cubical building case in section 3 2 it has dimensions 20 h w l length 12 h w w width 6 h w height in this case w 200 m and l 500 m are the width and length of the building group i e the chosen part of linz and h w 63 m is the height of the wissensturm building based on this computational domain we constructed a high resolution computational grid with 10 million hexahedral cells by surface grid extrusion van hooff and blocken 2010 with a minimum cell size of 1 m see fig 13 a in order to define appropriate boundary conditions we employed a wind profile for a real urban flow in europe from a study of hertwig et al 2017 more specifically we set the vertical profiles of the incoming wind speed and turbulence intensity by interpolating the data from that study for the reference cfd simulations we applied the same les i e standard smagorinsky lilly modeling as described in section 3 for the reference cfd simulation we used time step widths of δ t 0 01 s with corresponding cell based courant numbers n c o 0 5 and we controlled numerical convergence by keeping the scale residuals of all solution variables below 10 5 4 3 simulation settings for rcfd we determined the characteristic time step for the recurrent flow features by evaluating the average cell flow through time i e the timespan a mass less trace would need to cross a computational cell in interesting sub regions within the computational domain in our case we opted for a recurrence time step of δ t r e c 1 s which resembles the minimum of the probed cell flow through times consequently we stored cell to cell communication patterns together with field data on vorticity fluctuations every 100th time step of the les based reference simulation in order to establish a database of 200 high resolution data frames we needed 20 000 time steps of conventional cfd once the database had been established we proceeded with the identification of recurrence islands following the procedure illustrated in section 2 3 in this case this identification procedure yielded two prominent recurrence islands which are illustrated in fig 13b in contrast to the previous side by side building case these islands are not separated by a background sea of low recurrence prominence instead these islands are surrounded by a low prominence background sea nevertheless an evaluation of the respective recurrence matrixes and recurrence vectors reveals that also in this case the recurrence prominence within the islands is significantly enhanced see fig 14 while the recurrence vector of the remaining background sea shows nearly no off diagonal features both recurrence islands exhibit prominent off diagonal minima indicating similar frame pairings given the low recurrence prominence of the background sea we abstain from a global domain based rcfd simulation and in the following solely apply the island based version of rcfd 4 4 results of cfd and rcfd simulations in the case of a real urban environment with the associated large computational grids assessing average concentration fields requires very long simulation times for the reference les based cfd simulation based on our available computational resources we estimated the necessary simulation time in the order of several months in order to avoid such excess simulation costs we therefore decided to focus on the time evolving instantaneous concentration patterns during an unsteady pollution event more specifically we considered a line source of pollutants which is activated at some instance of time and subsequently simulate the propagation of that pollutant within an initially unpolluted environment in turbulent flows any unsteady propagation depends on the specific flow realization at the very instance of time the concentration patterns of two les based cfd simulations will differ depending on the specific starting time of the pollution source in order to obtain a representative unsteady propagation one would have to apply ensemble averaging i e averaging the results of many unsteady pollution events which once again would lead to excessive computational times in our study we therefore compared only one unsteady reference cfd simulation to several realizations of island based rcfd simulations which in turn do not consume significant computational resources in comparing the results we have to keep in mind that even the best possible outcome cannot be expected to be a perfect agreement like in section 3 since we compare individual realizations of an unsteady propagation event in turbulent flow in presenting the comparative results we employ the same top down approach as in section 3 4 starting with three dimensional iso surfaces of the concentration plumes followed by contour plots of concentration at pedestrian level and concentration profiles along vertical lines with associated error norms in fig 15 iso surfaces of the instantaneous concentration fields at three and six minutes after the start of the pollution source are depicted illustrating the three dimensional extension of the instantaneous pollution plumes the island based rcfd successfully reproduces the general features of plume shape as the reference les based cfd simulation on the west of the wissensturm the street canyon is quickly filled with pollutants while in relation to that the atrium in the wake of the building remains nearly free of pollutants on the east side of the wissensturm the downstream spreading of pollutants is hindered by several lower buildings beyond these main features some clear differences are observed as expected there are not only differences between rcfd predictions and the reference cfd simulation but also between the two realizations of rcfd in general the reference simulation seems to be more dispersive than both rcfd simulations i e the pollution plume of the reference simulation extends further to the right and to the left we attribute this to flow features which are part of the long term cfd simulation but which are not represented in the limited database of the rcfd simulations next contour plots of concentration fields at pedestrian level z 2 m are given in fig 16 instead of plotting instantaneous values of concentration we here present a time averaged concentration field with time averaging applied from the start until 6 min after the activation of the pollution source this comparison shows a generally good agreement between the reference cfd simulations and the two realizations of rcfd especially in the wake of the wissensturm however just up stream of the wissensturm the reference cfd simulation predicts a more pronounced local accumulation of pollutants than both rcfd simulations this discrepancy might be linked to the fact that the line source has been placed into an upstream recirculation zone which is prone to discretization errors by mass less tracers which we need to evaluate cell to cell connectivity in fig 17 concentration profiles are given along five vertical lines also in this case we applied 6 min of time averaging in order to obtain time marching mean values of concentration while we still see a generally good agreement between the reference cfd simulation and the two realizations of rcfd we can observe significant differences especially at the line l1 and l5 those profiles are most affected by the local accumulation of pollutants upstream of the wissensturm which is under predicted by both rcfd simulations a quantitative evaluation of these profiles based on available error norms is given in appendix a for the case of a real urban environment we experienced an even larger computational speed up than in the case of the side by side buildings while the les based reference simulation took 320 h of wall clock time on a 32 core computer in order to cover 6 min of pollution dispersion each rcfd simulation required only 3 7 min on the same hardware yielding a relative speed up of more than five thousand i e rcfd simulations run 5 189 times faster than conventional les based cfd simulations notably this speed up leads to faster than real time simulation of pollutant dispersion at high resolution i e on a computation grid of 10 million cells 5 conclusion in this study we performed recurrence cfd rcfd simulations of near field pollutant dispersion in two topologies in order to overcome the insufficient recurrence prominence of the global flow field we developed a new methodology to decompose the computational domain into distinct islands of high recurrence prominence subsequently we tested the novel island based rcfd by two application examples namely i a two side by side cubical buildings configuration and ii a real urban environment the main findings for the two side by side building case are as follows i predictions of island based rcfd agree well with corresponding results of a full les based reference cfd simulation in terms of three dimensional iso surfaces of the concentration plume contour plots in a horizontal plane and concentration profiles along vertical lines ii compared to existing global domain rcfd simulations the novel island based rcfd simulations have an improved predictive capability yielding excellent agreement with the les based reference cfd simulation iii island based rcfd simulations are about a thousand times faster than corresponding les based cfd simulations the main findings for the real urban environment case are as follows iv island based rcfd simulations of pollutant dispersion on a large computational grid of 10 million cells are feasible and deliver reasonable results v qualitatively predictions of island based rcfd agree fairly well with corresponding results by a les based reference cfd simulation in terms of three dimensional iso surface of the instantaneous concentration plume contour plots in a horizontal plane and concentration profiles along vertical lines vi existing quantitative discrepancies between island based rcfd predictions and the reference les based cfd simulation can be linked to an obvious under prediction of local pollution accumulation in the upstream recirculation bubble in front of the wissensturm vii island based rcfd simulations are about five thousand times faster than corresponding les based cfd simulations yielding faster than real time simulations of pollutant dispersion at high resolution overall this study demonstrates that near field pollutant dispersion within complex urban environment can be efficiently modelled by island based

island based rcfd and the reference simulation all the values of fac2 are above 0 89 especially for the gap 5 case above 0 95 suggesting the results by island based rcfd agrees well with full les in general similarly all absolute fb values are very small and all nmse values are well below 0 4 which means that both the systematic and random errors are very low based on these error norms we can conclude that island based rcfd simulations can produce very similar pollutant results as full les for the case of real urban environment the error norms applied for the three vertical lines in fig 17 are summarized in table 2 while most of these error norms still meet the above stated recommendations from literature hanna et al 2004 tominaga and stathopoulos 2018 we have to accept significantly

25726,we applied data based recurrence cfd rcfd to model pollutant dispersion in near field flow configurations in case of complex topologies the global domain version of rcfd fails to account for local recurrent flow features we therefore developed a novel island based version of rcfd which partitions the computational domain to isolate islands of high recurrence prominence and subsequently defines a distinct recurrence path for each of these islands we applied island based rcfd to pollutant dispersion for two side by side cubical buildings with three different gap widths in between them and a real urban environment we showed that numerical predictions of pollutant dispersion by island based rcfd were in excellent agreement with full cfd simulations thus outperforming the global domain version of rcfd in both applications island based rcfd simulations ran three orders of magnitude faster than corresponding full cfd simulations in the second application this speed up enabled real time simulations on a computational grid of 10 million cells graphical abstract image 1 keywords recurrence cfd rcfd pollutant dispersion island based rcfd real time cfd 1 introduction globally over 50 of the population lives in urban areas today and the world s urban population will increase to 7 5 billion before 2050 giles corti et al 2016 in recent years air pollution in urban environments has increased significantly posing a serious societal problem environmental protection agency 2020 zhong et al 2016 air quality in compact urban environments is directly linked to human health block and calderón garcidueñas 2009 shorshani et al 2015 because of daily exposure to hazardous pollutants by outdoor activities and the penetration of outdoor pollutants into the indoor environment by building ventilation and infiltration the urban outdoor air pollution originates mainly from emissions from traffic households and industry and comprises hazardous materials e g toxic gaseous substances and fine particulates bartzis et al 2008 shorshani et al 2015 understanding pollutant dispersion mechanisms and identifying pollution concentration patterns is essential for the design of pollution mitigation strategies for the investigation of pollutant dispersion in urban environments different approaches like field measurements cui et al 2017 niu and tung 2007 wind tunnel tests gromke et al 2016 gromke and ruck 2012 and numerical simulations blocken 2014 blocken and gualtieri 2012 tominaga and stathopoulos 2013 have been employed especially numerical simulations have been widely used because of their relatively low cost and for their ability to provide three dimensional information in the whole computational domain as opposed to point measurements in field measurements and wind tunnel tests among numerical simulations and analytical calculations gaussian dispersion models are often utilized because of their simplicity and time efficiency moonen and allegrini 2015 rajaona et al 2015 senocak et al 2008 however these simple models fail to capture near field dispersion mechanisms and three dimensional concentration patterns within complex urban topologies in such cases computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations have been proposed to accurately simulate the interaction between the complex wind field and the pollutant blocken et al 2013 chu et al 2005 gousseau et al 2012 on top of the complex mean flow pollutant dispersion is governed by the turbulence characteristics i e the characteristics of the large scale and small scale vortices of the flow in the context of cfd simulation of urban flows especially these small scale flow features cannot be resolved but their effect on the mean flow has to be modelled by an appropriate turbulence model generally turbulence models can be roughly organized into reyonds averaged navier stokes rans models and large eddy simulation les models rans models are based on time averaging of turbulent fluctuations independent of their spatial scale and require less computational resources than les consequently they have been utilized in many urban environmental studies e g ai and mak 2014 blocken et al 2012 du et al 2018 ricci et al 2019 les models in turn resolve large scale turbulent fluctuations while only the spatially small scales are modelled by a sub grid model pope 2000 recently les models have been used in studies of near field pollutant dispersion in built up environments blocken 2018 moonen et al 2011 indicating a higher predictive capability of les over rans models the large drawback of les turbulence models is the associated computational cost which is much higher than that of rans models tominaga and stathopoulos 2013 reported that the computational time of les was 10 25 times higher than that of a comparable rans simulation therefore increasing the computational efficiency of les without significant loss in accuracy can be seen as a major requirement and challenge towards a wider spread application of les in near field pollutant dispersion modeling for the case of pseudo periodic flows which can be described by recurring flow features the recurrence cfd rcfd approach was developed to mitigate the high computational costs of les recurrence cfd was first developed in the realm of chemical engineering lichtenegger and pirker 2016 pirker and lichtenegger 2018 and has been successfully applied in several fields including bubble columns abbasi et al 2020 fluidized beds dabbagh et al 2020 and free surface flows pirker et al 2020 conceptually rcfd is a data assisted method employing a two stage strategy of data storage and data utilization in the first stage conventional cfd simulations are utilized to generate a characteristic database representing the flow field under consideration and in the second stage this database is exploited to picture the propagation of passive scalars like an air pollutant following this simple strategy the computational times of scalar dispersion processes have been significantly reduced resulting in a speed up of three to four orders of magnitude by rcfd in comparison to full cfd simulations dabbagh et al 2020 du et al 2020 pirker and lichtenegger 2018 pirker et al 2020 in our previous work we successfully applied rcfd to accurately predict pollutant dispersion around an isolated cubical building benchmark case du et al 2020 in that study we could reduce the computational time of corresponding les based cfd simulations by three orders of magnitude without impairing neither the resolution nor the accuracy of results however the step from this benchmark case towards complex flows in urban topologies is not straightforward at its core the rcfd method relies on a prominent recurrent nature of the flow such that within the database which is provided a priori by conventional cfd simulations one always finds pairings of similar flow patterns at two instances of time while this was possible for the simple benchmark case it might be impossible for more complex topologies in his study on local and global recurrence lichtenegger 2018 showed that the global dimensionality of a flow scales exponentially with the domain size in order to meet this dimensionality we would have to build up huge databases spanning a very long observation period before we can find a pair of globally similar flow patterns at first glance this restriction might render the application of rcfd to complex flows in large domains impossible in this study we try to overcome this existing limitation of rcfd by a domain decomposition approach such that we organize the global domain into smaller recurrence islands which for themselves are appropriate for an application of rcfd for this purpose we first have to identify sub domains of prominent recurrent flow features such as wakes of buildings which are embedded in a background flow of low prominence in our case prominent recurrent flow features manifest in a large magnitude of local vorticity fluctuations see section 2 2 once identified the databases for those recurrence islands are built up which are then exploited for the simulation of local dispersion on a deeper code level these local recurrence islands required a thorough revision and adaption of the existing cell to cell shift operator in rcfd which represents convective fluxes in order to test this island based rcfd approach we first illustrate its functionality for the case of two side by side cubic buildings with a gap of varying width between them the configuration of cubical building and the incident wind profile are adopted from the experimental setup of li and meroney 1983 while in case of a small gap separating the wakes into independent recurrence islands does not make sense because of the dominant wake interactions it does become a viable option for larger gap widths in this purely numerical study we will study pollutant dispersion from a ground level line source in the wake of the two buildings by comparing the predictions of full les based cfd existing global domain rcfd and our novel island based rcfd in a second part of this study we apply island based rcfd to the complex urban topology of the wissensturm neighborhood in the city of linz austria also in this case a ground level line source emission is considered which represents vehicular exhaust along a street and we critically compare the predictions of full les based cfd and island based rcfd this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the methodologies of full les based cfd the existing rcfd and the novel island based rcfd are presented afterwards predictions of pollutant dispersion are presented and analyzed for the side by side cubical buildings in section 3 and for the real urban environment in section 4 respectively finally summary and conclusions are given in section 5 2 method 2 1 conventional les based cfd simulations in the framework of this study conventional les based cfd simulations are run for two purposes on the one hand short term full cfd simulations are used to feed the database for subsequent rcfd simulations while on the other hand long term full cfd simulation serve as numerical validation base for our novel rcfd method since the les based cfd simulation methodology has been presented in our previous publication du et al 2020 we omit any details in the present paper in the following we only briefly rephrase the main concept for the sake of completeness the governing filtered navier stokes equations for incompressible isothermal fluid flow of a newtonian fluid read 1 u i x i 0 and 2 u i t u i u j x j υ 2 u i x j x j 1 ρ p x i τ i j x j where u i is the cartesian velocity component p represents the pressure the overbars indicate spatial filtering and υ is the molecular viscosity the subgrid scale stress tensor τ i j describes the effect of unresolved turbulent eddies and can be modelled as pope 2000 3 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j with τ k k being the isotropic part of subgrid scale stress s i j representing the rate of strain tensor for the resolved scale and μ t denotes the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity in the smagorinsky lilly subgrid scale model lilly 1966 smagorinsky 1963 μ t is modelled by fluent 2018 4 μ t ρ l s 2 s with s 2 s i j s i j and l s the mixing length which in turn is calculated by 5 l s m i n k d c s v 1 3 where k 0 40 is the von kármán constant d is the closest wall distance v is the volume of the computational cell and c s 0 1 is the smagorinsky constant on top of the flow equations the transport equation for the passive scalar φ e g a pollutant concentration reads 6 φ t φ u i x i x i d e f f φ x i s with d e f f as the effective diffusivity and s representing a source term e g a pollution source 2 2 existing recurrence cfd simulations as with the conventional les based simulations the existing recurrence cfd rcfd approach has been presented in detail in our previous publication du et al 2020 in the present paper we therefore restrict ourselves to restating the main concept of rcfd however in presenting the main ingredients of rcfd we will emphasise the description of the recurrent nature of the flow more specifically the recurrence prominence since this will pave the way for the novel island based version of rcfd as stated in the introduction rcfd is a data assisted approach employing a two phase strategy first a characteristic database of the given pseudo periodic flow is generated using conventional les based cfd simulations in this phase the fluid flow is traced by massless particles and in regular intervals start and end positions of those lagrangian tracer paths are stored as characteristic cell to cell communication paths into a database which in the end consists of n frames of cell to cell communication patterns in a second phase this database is utilized by a markov alike recurrence process which stitches together sequences from the database more specifically this results into a cell to cell communication network which can evolve beyond the time span of the characteristic database based on this recurrent communication network any passive scalars can be transported according to the pre set cell to cell communication paths in our previous work du et al 2020 we additionally revised the face swap operator which accounts for the physical diffusion of air pollutants in order to describe the degree of similarity between two frames in the database describing two flow fields at two instances of time t and t we employ a recurrence norm 7 n r e c t t d 3 r ϕ r t ϕ r t 2 m a x t t d 3 r ϕ r t ϕ r t 2 with r as spatial coordinate and the integral represents integration over the whole domain in order to capture the recurrent nature of a given flow most efficiently the field quantity ϕ should be chosen based on the physical core phenomenon under consideration in our case we opted for the fluctuating component of the flow vorticity ϕ ω ω ω with ω u and indicating time averaging once the pairwise recurrence norms have been calculated we can span a recurrence matrix which indicates the degree of similarity between frame pairings within the database see illustration in fig 1 obviously this recurrence matrix has a zero diagonal since the recurrence norm between identical frames is zero in the off diagonal region however the value of the recurrence norm first increases i e the level of similarity between frames decreases before it eventually starts to fluctuate around a rather constant value the recurrence plateau if the off diagonal values of the recurrence norm do not run into a plateau the observation period for the database τ r e c was too small or the flow cannot be considered as pseudo periodic if we just plot the recurrence norm along the first line of the recurrence matrix we obtain a recurrence vector which clearly illustrates this off diagonal behaviour of the recurrence norm fig 1 right starting from zero the recurrence norm first increases before it fluctuates around the recurrence plateau finally the magnitude of these fluctuations represents the prominence of recurrence essentially this recurrence prominence determines how well we can distinguish between similar and non similar frame pairings within the database while in our previous study on the isolated cube benchmark case du et al 2020 we experienced significant recurrence prominence of this local flow configuration we obtain a very low recurrence prominence for the case of large domains of complex topologies shown later in this study 2 3 novel island based recurrence cfd simulations at its core our novel island based recurrence cfd methodology introduces a spatial domain composition depending on the local prominence of recurrent flow features in the following sub section we will introduce this island identification methodology while further implications of this domain decomposition are addressed in subsection 2 3 2 2 3 1 identification of recurrence islands for the identification of recurrence islands we use the same field quantity as we have proposed for the recurrence norm eq 7 hence we try to identify local regions islands of high fluctuations of vorticity ω the main steps of this identification procedure are sketched in fig 2 and can be summarized as follows first the time averaged field of vorticity fluctuations ω is spatially smoothened in order to avoid excessively small islands second we look for remaining local maxima and starting from those maxima we expand individual islands towards their neighbouring cells until another island is reached typically this procedure results in quite a lot of small and maybe neighbouring recurrence islands therefore closely located small islands are combined into larger ones in a third step in order to achieve a reasonable number of individual recurrence islands 2 3 2 island based rcfd approach once recurrence islands are identified we can build a recurrence matrix for each of those sub domains consequently we will find different recurrence paths which result in individual time varying communication networks of cell to cell shift patterns for each island in fig 3 the main consequence for the existing recurrence cfd is emphasized instead of one global domain communication network we have n networks which are controled by different recurrence paths during the convection step we have to loop through individual sets of cell to cell shifts for each recurrence island notably all other steps of the recurrence cfd algorithm remain unaffected by this domain decomposition 2 4 numerical implementation the novel island based rcfd runs on the same computational grid as the conventional cfd simulation furthermore all functionalities of the island based rcfd approach have been implemented in the framework of ansys fluent v19 2 by user defined functions such that there is no need to switch the software between full cfd and rcfd simulations however the fluid solver functionalities of fluent will only be used for feeding the database the rcfd solver only uses fluent s grid access routines i e cell to face pointers parallel communication by mpi macros and post processing functions 3 application 1 two side by side cubical buildings in order to prove the functionality of our novel island based rcfd approach we consider the example of two side by side cubical buildings with a gap in between in the next three sub sections we start with a description of the case set up as well as the numerical settings for both conventional les based cfd simulations and rcfd simulations respectively finally subsection 3 4 is dedicated to a thorough analysis of the predictions of the existing global domain rcfd and our novel island based rcfd in comparison to reference results of long term full conventional cfd simulations 3 1 case setup we adopt the case setup from the wind tunnel experiments of li and meroney 1983 who studied pollutant dispersion from a vent on the roof of a cubical building in our previous work du et al 2020 we validated conventional les based cfd simulations for this specific setup and performed sensitivity tests of spatial and temporal discretization in this study we essentially used the same cube geometry boundary conditions and temporal discretization and similar spatial discretization as in the previous work but we doubled the cubic building to arrange for the side by side configuration of two buildings with a gap in total we consider three side by side configurations by changing the gap width between the two cubical buildings from one to five times of building height as detailed in fig 4 these three configurations are called gap 1 gap 3 and gap 5 respectively to represent the vehicular exhausts in the street a ground level line source downstream of the two side by side buildings is defined the line source is placed 0 025 m downstream of the buildings and stretches along both buildings such that the line length is equal to two time the building length plus the gap width see fig 5 vehicular exhausts are simulated by means of a passive tracer gas with same density as air and the emission rate is set to 3 0 10 5 kg s 3 2 simulation settings for conventional cfd the size of the computational domain was chosen in alignment with best practice guidelines bpgs schatzmann et al 2010 tominaga et al 2008 resulting in dimensions of 21h length 12h g width 6h height based on the building height h fig 5a the grid topology and numerical settings are directly adopted from our previous work du et al 2020 at the building surfaces the distance of first cell center point to the wall is set to 0 00125 m yielding y values of about one the computational grid for the three gap widths consists of 1 4 1 7 and 2 1 million hexahedral cells fig 5b the vertical inlet wind profile as well as the profiles for turbulent energy and turbulent dissipation rate are deduced from the experiment of li and meroney 1983 the simplec algorithm is applied for pressure velocity coupling and second order schemes are used for temporal and spatial derivatives further details are given in our previous publication du et al 2020 after an initial spin up process a pseudo periodic flow is established after roughly two flow through times with the latter being defined as τ f l u h 0 32 s with l 1 05 m the length of computational domain and u h as 3 3 m s the characteristic wind profile velocity at building height after these two flow through times the data sampling for the rcfd database starts while at the same time a long term 40 x τ f les based cfd simulation of pollutant dispersion is started as a reference for later rcfd predictions 3 3 simulation settings for rcfd assuming that the characteristic minimum time scale of the governing flow dynamics does not change by adding a second cubic building we define the same sampling interval for the recurrence database δ t r e c 0 01 s as in our previous study du et al 2020 based on this recurrence sampling interval the conventional les based cfd simulation will write cell to cell communication patterns together with field data on vorticity fluctuations every 10th time step thanks to storage efficiency improvements in the code not detailed in this paper we are able to store n 200 data frames thus after a total simulation time of τ r e c 2 s the conventional les based cfd simulation has established the recurrence database in case of island based rcfd we now proceed with the process of island identification in fig 6 the result of this island identification procedure can be seen in the first small gap configuration gap 1 case only one island is identified covering both buildings this island is embedded into a global background sea of low recurrence prominence while within this recurrence island i e in the interacting wakes of those two buildings dominant fluctuations of vorticity occur the fluctuations of vorticity are relatively low elsewhere i e in the background sea which represents the rest of the domain in case of the other two larger gap configurations this island topology changes such that two individual per building islands are established in these cases the high fluctuation regions i e in the wakes of the two buildings are separated by an in between region of low fluctuations which is part of the background sea obviously this island formation depends on a threshold value of vorticity fluctuations magnitude which decides the formation and spatial extension of these recurrence islands in order to avoid case specific settings we opted for a relative threshold of 15 percent of the global maximal value once the domain decomposition has been established we can separate the global database into a set of per island databases and perform recurrence analysis on each of them in fig 7 the recurrence matrices of the background sea are plotted together with the recurrence matrix of the individual islands note that two recurrence islands have been identified for the gap 3 and the gap 5 cases however in fig 7 only one island s recurrence matrix is depicted since the recurrence matrixes for these two islands are very similar obviously the recurrence plateau i e the mean off diagonal level of the pairwise recurrence norms for the island based recurrence matrix is lower than that for the background sea illustrating the off diagonal behaviour of the pairwise recurrence norms along the baseline recurrence vector we further see that within the islands we can expect a significantly higher recurrence prominence than elsewhere based on this per island recurrence behaviour different recurrence paths will be created in each individual recurrence island in other words we will stitch together sequences of cell to cell communication patterns differently for each recurrence island 3 4 results of cfd and rcfd simulations in analyzing the predictive capability of rcfd we restrict ourselves to an evaluation of mean concentration fields for this purpose a non dimensional concentration coefficient k c is defined as 8 k c c u h h q l with c being the dimensional simulated concentration u h depicting the approach wind speed at building height h q the total pollutant emission rate and l the length of the line source in presenting our results we follow a top down approach starting with a three dimensional iso surface representation of the concentration plume towards a contour plot in a horizontal plan to finally concentration profiles along vertical lines with associated error norms in fig 8 iso surfaces of kc are depicted illustrating the three dimensional shape of the pollution plumes in all cases we can observe an accumulation of concentration in the wakes of the buildings while the pollutants are blown downstream along the gap in between the buildings both versions of rcfd predict nearly the same global plume shape as the reference les based cfd simulation with only minor differences in the downstream length of the pollution streaks at this global level of evaluation the most obvious difference can be detected in the smoothness of the iso surfaces while conventional les based cfd simulations result in very smooth mean concentration fields both versions of rcfd introduce artificial noise into these fields which subsequently results in an increased roughness of those iso surfaces this artificial noise can be linked to the representation of the continuous fluxes of pollutants by discrete cell to cell shifts in a next level of evaluation we consider a contour plot of mean concentration in a horizontal plane at mid building height z h 0 5 see fig 9 while both versions of rcfd successfully reproduce the main features of the reference solution we can detect specific prediction errors in case of the global domain based rcfd in the gap 3 case the middle downstream streak is significantly over predicted while in case of the gap 5 case the two middle streaks are both underpredicted and strongly asymmetric in this evaluation the island based version of rcfd achieves a better agreement with the reference solution finally we consider profiles of mean concentration at three vertical lines in the wake of one of the buildings see fig 10 while the island based rcfd agrees very well with the full les based cfd simulation the global domain based rcfd existing rcfd exhibits significant differences these can be linked to locally unfavorable stitching of sequences from the global database stitching locally non similar frames representing non similar flow features inevitably results in local dispersion errors e g when locally the flow suddenly just points into another direction the island based rcfd on the other hand provides a locally reasonable stitching of sequences at least within the islands of most prominent recurrent fluctuations which in the end results in a very good predictive quality of the results in addition to the graphical representation appendix a provides error norms for a quantitative evaluation of the predictive quality of island based rcfd which confirm the superior predictive capability of island based rcfd simulations as opposed to the existing rcfd at this point we can conclude that while both versions of rcfd are able to picture the global behaviour of the pollutant plumes reasonably well island based rcfd predictions result in a better quantitative agreement with the corresponding les based cfd reference simulation at the same time we experienced a very large speed up in terms of computational time see fig 11 while the full les based cfd simulations took between 300 and 400 h of wall clock time on a 32 core computer rcfd both version require the same computational resources took only 48 61 h of total simulation time including the time needed for building the databases this speed up is even more pronounced if we consider only the simulation of pollutant propagation itself once the database has been established in that case rcfd simulations take just a couple of minutes in between 11 and 14 min in comparison to more than 300 h of corresponding full cfd simulations resulting in a speed up of more than three orders of magnitude i e around 1500 times faster since the database for a given configuration has to be built up only once this latter speed up would represent the effective total speed up for all subsequent simulations of alternative pollution events 4 application 2 a real urban environment in the following section we intend to prove the feasibility of island based rcfd simulations for the prediction of pollutant dispersion in a real urban environment in assessing the predictive capabilities and the performance of the rcfd methodology we focus on a thorough comparison with full les based cfd simulations we do not oppose our numerical predictions to measurement data we rather restrict ourselves to a comparison between two numerical methodologies classical les based cfd and island based rcfd 4 1 case description a small part of the town linz in austria the home town of co author s p has been chosen as computational domain features a dominant wissensturm building hosting a public library together with some four to five storey buildings in its immediate surroundings see fig 12 a b we opted for this topology because of a planned traffic tunnel which will have its tunnel portal located just south of this part of the town vehicles aiming for this tunnel might line up just in front of the wissensturm thus causing a dominant line source of traffic induced pollutants in that case pollutant dispersion will be of crucial importance for the residents living in the wake of the wissensturm 4 2 simulation settings for conventional cfd we defined the computational domain following the same bpg as for the two side by side cubical building case in section 3 2 it has dimensions 20 h w l length 12 h w w width 6 h w height in this case w 200 m and l 500 m are the width and length of the building group i e the chosen part of linz and h w 63 m is the height of the wissensturm building based on this computational domain we constructed a high resolution computational grid with 10 million hexahedral cells by surface grid extrusion van hooff and blocken 2010 with a minimum cell size of 1 m see fig 13 a in order to define appropriate boundary conditions we employed a wind profile for a real urban flow in europe from a study of hertwig et al 2017 more specifically we set the vertical profiles of the incoming wind speed and turbulence intensity by interpolating the data from that study for the reference cfd simulations we applied the same les i e standard smagorinsky lilly modeling as described in section 3 for the reference cfd simulation we used time step widths of δ t 0 01 s with corresponding cell based courant numbers n c o 0 5 and we controlled numerical convergence by keeping the scale residuals of all solution variables below 10 5 4 3 simulation settings for rcfd we determined the characteristic time step for the recurrent flow features by evaluating the average cell flow through time i e the timespan a mass less trace would need to cross a computational cell in interesting sub regions within the computational domain in our case we opted for a recurrence time step of δ t r e c 1 s which resembles the minimum of the probed cell flow through times consequently we stored cell to cell communication patterns together with field data on vorticity fluctuations every 100th time step of the les based reference simulation in order to establish a database of 200 high resolution data frames we needed 20 000 time steps of conventional cfd once the database had been established we proceeded with the identification of recurrence islands following the procedure illustrated in section 2 3 in this case this identification procedure yielded two prominent recurrence islands which are illustrated in fig 13b in contrast to the previous side by side building case these islands are not separated by a background sea of low recurrence prominence instead these islands are surrounded by a low prominence background sea nevertheless an evaluation of the respective recurrence matrixes and recurrence vectors reveals that also in this case the recurrence prominence within the islands is significantly enhanced see fig 14 while the recurrence vector of the remaining background sea shows nearly no off diagonal features both recurrence islands exhibit prominent off diagonal minima indicating similar frame pairings given the low recurrence prominence of the background sea we abstain from a global domain based rcfd simulation and in the following solely apply the island based version of rcfd 4 4 results of cfd and rcfd simulations in the case of a real urban environment with the associated large computational grids assessing average concentration fields requires very long simulation times for the reference les based cfd simulation based on our available computational resources we estimated the necessary simulation time in the order of several months in order to avoid such excess simulation costs we therefore decided to focus on the time evolving instantaneous concentration patterns during an unsteady pollution event more specifically we considered a line source of pollutants which is activated at some instance of time and subsequently simulate the propagation of that pollutant within an initially unpolluted environment in turbulent flows any unsteady propagation depends on the specific flow realization at the very instance of time the concentration patterns of two les based cfd simulations will differ depending on the specific starting time of the pollution source in order to obtain a representative unsteady propagation one would have to apply ensemble averaging i e averaging the results of many unsteady pollution events which once again would lead to excessive computational times in our study we therefore compared only one unsteady reference cfd simulation to several realizations of island based rcfd simulations which in turn do not consume significant computational resources in comparing the results we have to keep in mind that even the best possible outcome cannot be expected to be a perfect agreement like in section 3 since we compare individual realizations of an unsteady propagation event in turbulent flow in presenting the comparative results we employ the same top down approach as in section 3 4 starting with three dimensional iso surfaces of the concentration plumes followed by contour plots of concentration at pedestrian level and concentration profiles along vertical lines with associated error norms in fig 15 iso surfaces of the instantaneous concentration fields at three and six minutes after the start of the pollution source are depicted illustrating the three dimensional extension of the instantaneous pollution plumes the island based rcfd successfully reproduces the general features of plume shape as the reference les based cfd simulation on the west of the wissensturm the street canyon is quickly filled with pollutants while in relation to that the atrium in the wake of the building remains nearly free of pollutants on the east side of the wissensturm the downstream spreading of pollutants is hindered by several lower buildings beyond these main features some clear differences are observed as expected there are not only differences between rcfd predictions and the reference cfd simulation but also between the two realizations of rcfd in general the reference simulation seems to be more dispersive than both rcfd simulations i e the pollution plume of the reference simulation extends further to the right and to the left we attribute this to flow features which are part of the long term cfd simulation but which are not represented in the limited database of the rcfd simulations next contour plots of concentration fields at pedestrian level z 2 m are given in fig 16 instead of plotting instantaneous values of concentration we here present a time averaged concentration field with time averaging applied from the start until 6 min after the activation of the pollution source this comparison shows a generally good agreement between the reference cfd simulations and the two realizations of rcfd especially in the wake of the wissensturm however just up stream of the wissensturm the reference cfd simulation predicts a more pronounced local accumulation of pollutants than both rcfd simulations this discrepancy might be linked to the fact that the line source has been placed into an upstream recirculation zone which is prone to discretization errors by mass less tracers which we need to evaluate cell to cell connectivity in fig 17 concentration profiles are given along five vertical lines also in this case we applied 6 min of time averaging in order to obtain time marching mean values of concentration while we still see a generally good agreement between the reference cfd simulation and the two realizations of rcfd we can observe significant differences especially at the line l1 and l5 those profiles are most affected by the local accumulation of pollutants upstream of the wissensturm which is under predicted by both rcfd simulations a quantitative evaluation of these profiles based on available error norms is given in appendix a for the case of a real urban environment we experienced an even larger computational speed up than in the case of the side by side buildings while the les based reference simulation took 320 h of wall clock time on a 32 core computer in order to cover 6 min of pollution dispersion each rcfd simulation required only 3 7 min on the same hardware yielding a relative speed up of more than five thousand i e rcfd simulations run 5 189 times faster than conventional les based cfd simulations notably this speed up leads to faster than real time simulation of pollutant dispersion at high resolution i e on a computation grid of 10 million cells 5 conclusion in this study we performed recurrence cfd rcfd simulations of near field pollutant dispersion in two topologies in order to overcome the insufficient recurrence prominence of the global flow field we developed a new methodology to decompose the computational domain into distinct islands of high recurrence prominence subsequently we tested the novel island based rcfd by two application examples namely i a two side by side cubical buildings configuration and ii a real urban environment the main findings for the two side by side building case are as follows i predictions of island based rcfd agree well with corresponding results of a full les based reference cfd simulation in terms of three dimensional iso surfaces of the concentration plume contour plots in a horizontal plane and concentration profiles along vertical lines ii compared to existing global domain rcfd simulations the novel island based rcfd simulations have an improved predictive capability yielding excellent agreement with the les based reference cfd simulation iii island based rcfd simulations are about a thousand times faster than corresponding les based cfd simulations the main findings for the real urban environment case are as follows iv island based rcfd simulations of pollutant dispersion on a large computational grid of 10 million cells are feasible and deliver reasonable results v qualitatively predictions of island based rcfd agree fairly well with corresponding results by a les based reference cfd simulation in terms of three dimensional iso surface of the instantaneous concentration plume contour plots in a horizontal plane and concentration profiles along vertical lines vi existing quantitative discrepancies between island based rcfd predictions and the reference les based cfd simulation can be linked to an obvious under prediction of local pollution accumulation in the upstream recirculation bubble in front of the wissensturm vii island based rcfd simulations are about five thousand times faster than corresponding les based cfd simulations yielding faster than real time simulations of pollutant dispersion at high resolution overall this study demonstrates that near field pollutant dispersion within complex urban environment can be efficiently modelled by island based

island based rcfd and the reference simulation all the values of fac2 are above 0 89 especially for the gap 5 case above 0 95 suggesting the results by island based rcfd agrees well with full les in general similarly all absolute fb values are very small and all nmse values are well below 0 4 which means that both the systematic and random errors are very low based on these error norms we can conclude that island based rcfd simulations can produce very similar pollutant results as full les for the case of real urban environment the error norms applied for the three vertical lines in fig 17 are summarized in table 2 while most of these error norms still meet the above stated recommendations from literature hanna et al 2004 tominaga and stathopoulos 2018 we have to accept significantly

25727,wildfire occurrence is expected to increase in future climate and land use land cover lulc change scenarios especially in vulnerable areas as the european mediterranean basin in this study future probability of wildfire occurrence was estimated for a 20 year time period 2041 2060 centered on 2050 by applying a statistically based regression model using lulc derived contact areas with the forest cover interfaces as proxy for the human related factor and a combination of live fuel moisture content and seasonal climate related variables as predictors future wildfire occurrence was mapped under rcp 8 5 high emissions scenario in four spanish regions with heterogeneous socioeconomic lulc and natural fire related characteristics at 1 km2 target spatial resolution results showed increased wildfire probability in 19 73 of 1 km2 cells observing regional differences in the variable effects this approach could be applied to other spatial scales offering tools for planning and management actions and to obtain different possible future scenarios keywords land use land cover interfaces climate change initiative land cover lfmc coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 business as usual scenario wildland urban interface 1 introduction nowadays wildfires are one of the significant threats to forested areas worldwide and the european mediterranean basin is one of the more susceptible areas to fire episodes reporting more than 85 of the total burned area in europe san miguel ayanz et al 2012 wildfires however are complex phenomena involving multiple factors mediate e g fuel availability moisture conditions natural and human ignitions meteorological climate drivers gudmundsson et al 2014 and management decisions hély et al 2001 which also operate at different spatial and temporal scales bedia et al 2015 reported changes in the mediterranean region regarding the use of land and climate spinoni et al 2020 are affecting the fire cycle pausas and fernández muñoz 2012 increasing the frequency and severity of wildland fires moreno et al 2013 and threatening ecosystem stability the provision of services habitat and biodiversity conservation landscape value and aesthetics as well as property and human lives these changes are expected to become more intense in the coming century syphard et al 2019 increasing their effects on fires and the consequential impacts on human communities worldwide spain is representative of these changes within mediterranean europe stellmes et al 2013 as lengthened and longer fire weather seasons have become more frequent jolly et al 2015 understanding the past relationships among land use land cover lulc changes climate and wildfire occurrence will allow for the prediction of future impacts and the evaluation of vulnerabilities which will serve as input for management and policy actions gallardo et al 2015 resulting relationships will depend on the type and force of driving factors and their importance in different regions the european mediterranean basin has experienced profound lulc changes derived from human activities geri et al 2010 in the last century lulc changes in rural areas of southern european countries were first linked to the intense abandonment of the countryside 1950s 1960s then there was a shift to a new agricultural and mechanized system 1980s followed by urban expansion in forested areas and increased recreational activities and the consequential intensification of the pressure on natural zones 2000s vilar et al 2016a such abandonment led to exceptional fuel accumulation due to natural reforestation processes geri et al 2010 and urban pressure due to the increase in contact areas between forest and urban constructions the so called wildland urban interface or wui all of which triggered an increase in wildfire risk besides lulc also creates an impact through the ignition of fires with more than 80 of fires in this area being linked to human activities and the result of negligence accidents or acts of arson ganteaume et al 2013 e g the use of fire to control herbaceous vegetation for cattle grazing or to clean brushwood in crops lightning causes 5 in average of the known fires in this basin given the wide range of the human activities effects several studies include the contact areas between forest and other covers the so called interfaces such as wui vilar et al 2016a chas amil et al 2013 modugno et al 2016 lampin maillet et al 2011 agricultural forest interface gallardo et al 2015 martínez et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2016 and grassland forest interface rodrigues 2014 vilar et al 2019 among others as human drivers of wildfire occurrence assuming that socioeconomic changes are likely to continue further changes in lulc are also expected projecting the amount of lulc change and the location thereof will allow for future lulc derived interfaces to be obtained and for the human factor of the wildfire occurrence be represented gallardo et al 2015 on the other hand the climate role in wildfires is mainly linked to the control of vegetation characteristics and status westerling et al 2011 pre fire season weather conditions have been proved to have a strong influence on the ignition and propagation of large fires because of their effect on fuel load and flammability urbieta et al 2015 moreover the fuel moisture content fmc defined as the mass of water contained within vegetation per dry mass is a critical variable affecting fire interactions with fuel yebra et al 2013 and might affect both fuel ignition and fire spread rate viegas et al 1992 rossa et al 2017 as fmc increases the flammability of fuels tends to decrease as more energy is needed to evaporate water before burning organic tissues argañaraz et al 2018 fmc is usually separated into live lfmc and dead fuels dfmc chuvieco et al 2004 most operational fire danger rating systems include the estimation of dfmc those lying on the forest floor leaves branches and debris camia et al 2003 still the estimation of lfmc is included less often less significant relations between fire spread or intensity were found in experimental data field analysis for a shrub or conifer forest fernandes and cruz 2012 among other reasons this is because lfmc is the result of complex interactions between previous and concurrent weather and the varied biological mechanisms that influence water content and dry matter accumulation jolly et al 2014 turner 1981 climate change trends in southern europe are expected to lead to increased temperature a greater number of heatwaves and dryer days cramer et al 2008 and a decreased summer precipitation kovats et al 2014 modelling studies predict that this will lead to an increase in fire activity sousa et al 2015 the number of large fires vázquez de la cueva et al 2012 and the burnt area amatulli et al 2013 turco et al 2018 dupuy et al 2020 recently reviewed 23 studies that projected fire danger indices or fire activity number of fires size and burnt area and at modelled climate fire relationships in the european context at local regional or continental scale results showed a relative increase 2 4 per decade in mean seasonal fire danger under pessimistic climate change scenarios in the mediterranean regions burnt areas are projected to increase everywhere in southern europe at a rate of 15 25 per decade dupuy et al 2020 several simulation scenario studies have combined factors on humans topography vegetation and fmc along with climate change conditions as drivers of future wildfires in fire prone areas worldwide examples of variables included in the modelling processes include housing density westerling et al 2011 distance to populated places liu et al 2012 land use effects syphard et al 2018 distance to roads syphard et al 2019 road density liu et al 2012 wui and other land cover interfaces gallardo et al 2015 aspect and slope westerling et al 2011 vegetation type syphard et al 2018 and fine fuel moisture content liu et al 2012 however in the european context dupuy et al 2020 claimed that one of the sources of uncertainty in future estimations was the lack of information on the influence of human factors on climate fire relationships moreover they affirmed that the influence of fmc should be taken into account and constitutes a possible source of bias for future predictions the main aim of this work was to develop an integrated modelling framework at 1 km2 target resolution to better understand the importance of climate lfmc and human factors on future spatial and temporal characteristics of wildfire occurrence in different southern european regions to that end the variable effect and distribution of current and future projected probability of wildfires were analyzed in four areas of spain these regions were selected as representative of lulc changes and climate conditions in southern europe and have different socioeconomic biophysical and wildfire characteristics the specific objectives were first to calibrate statistical based regression models for wildfire occurrence combining climate lfmc topography and lulc interfaces secondly the regression models were applied to the projected lulc and climate variables obtaining the future wildfire probability the three main research questions addressed are 1 would wildfire probability increase or decrease in relation to lulc and climate changes and how 2 which variables would be more influential in the different regions and 3 could this modelling framework be applied to other scales and areas for planning and management actions 2 study sites this paper covers four spanish regions ourense zamora madrid and valencia fig 1 table 1 these regions are representative of the landscape types derived from the different socioeconomic processes affecting southern europe in the last decades and the relation thereof to historical fire events and trends as explained in the introduction more specifically two of the sites are rural oriented ourense and zamora in the northwest of spain and the other two are representative of urban development madrid and valencia located in central spain and on the eastern mediterranean coast respectively the rural oriented sites have low population densities table 1 with regressive demographic dynamics due to low birth rates and an ageing population balsa barreiro and hermosilla 2013 spanish statistic institute ine 2019 except in the major cities moreno et al 2014 in ourense the population is mostly dispersed chas amil et al 2015 and the economy is based on the primary sector gonzalez and pukkala 2007 on the contrary urban sites have higher population densities and their economy is based on the tertiary sector ine 2019 in the late 1990s significant urban growth happened in urbanized areas such as madrid in parallel to decreased agricultural and forest areas plata rocha et al 2011 also there was an intense urbanization process in the spanish mediterranean coast i e the valencian region disturbing its natural configuration syphard et al 2018 barbero sierra et al 2013 the expansion of urban construction continued from 2000 until the outbreak of the global economic crisis in 2008 in rural regions such as ourense afforestation processes due to the abandonment of agricultural activities have continued for the last four decades fuentes santos et al 2013 in zamora the abandonment of these activities was accompanied by a decrease in the livestock density until the mid 1990s moreno et al 2014 land cover is the landscape resulting from these changes in ourense fig 1a forest covers prevail 67 of the total area while in zamora fig 1b agriculture is the predominant land cover 64 of the total area in madrid fig 1c and valencia fig 1d a more balanced spatial distribution of forest and agricultural areas is observed with urban areas being abundant 16 and 6 respectively other land cover types relevant to fire occurrence such as pastures and shrublands occupy a substantial percentage of the total territory of madrid 14 pasture lands and valencia 15 shrublands in comparison to other regions climatic conditions are quite diverse in the selected regions which have a dissimilar influence on fire incidence and the effects on the territory ourense has oceanic conditions but warm summers zamora and madrid are representative of mediterranean continental climate while valencia has a mediterranean climate spanish meteorology agency or aemet 2019 table 1 about wildfire characteristics differences between the selected regions are notable in terms of the number of fire events and burnt area as well as fire causes ourense had both the highest number of fires and the largest burned area in the last decade 2006 2015 with more than 70 being due to arson andrade otero et al 2019 and ministry of agriculture fisheries and food www mapa gob es in ourense site fires are then explained by other factors that are not climate related such as accidents neglect and acts of arson aimed at transforming the territory andrade otero et al 2019 3 methods the methodological steps followed to obtain the future wildfire occurrence in the study sites for the 20 year time period 2041 2060 centered on 2050 include four main phases 1 modelling the baseline wildfire occurrence 2 simulating lulc change scenarios 3 building climate projections and 4 modelling future wildfire occurrence fig 2 this integrated modelling framework was proposed at 1 km2 target resolution as appropriate for regional scale in spain due to the average size of its regions and the management system organization as in previous works chuvieco et al 2010 gallardo et al 2015 vilar et al 2016b specific data used for modelling has been generated at this resolution and spatially processed the period of 1998 2015 was used for the baseline wildfire modelling and lulc change simulations these years represent the specific socioeconomic and land cover changes associated with wildfire occurrence that took place in spain in the last decades for modelling the baseline wildfire occurrence phase 1 a 10 year period 2001 2010 was chosen as it was considered sufficient to gather the fire occurrence and recent climate and lfmc conditions variability the 1998 and 2008 land cover maps were used to calibrate lulc change scenarios while the 2015 map to perform its assessment phase 2 lastly lulc 2050 projections and 20 year 2041 2060 climate change projections were obtained phase 3 and wildfire probability was then obtained for that period phase 4 3 1 baseline wildfire occurrence modelling 3 1 1 explanatory variables explanatory variables used to model the baseline wildfire occurrence were related to lulc interfaces lfmc climate and topography aspect table 2 3 1 1 1 lulc maps and derived interfaces the esa climate change initiative land cover cci lc map https www esa landcover cci org was used to both derive lulc interfaces and to simulate lulc change scenarios cci lc was chosen because of its global availability fine spatial resolution 300 m period covered yearly maps since 1998 present and its adequacy for estimating wildfire occurrence at local and european scales vilar et al 2019 this product includes 22 land cover classes using united nations land cover classification system un lccs di gregorio et al 2016 taking into consideration the thematic meaning of the land cover in relation to wildfire occurrence analysis the original cci lc legend was aggregated into eight classes urban agriculture grassland shrubland forest sparse vegetation and bare areas wetland and water bodies to obtain a more manageable number of classes fig 1 three lulc interfaces were obtained and used as proxies for the role of human activity in wildfire occurrence 1 forest agricultural interface fai includes the interfaces between forest grassland shrubland and agricultural 2 forest grassland interface fgi consists of the interfaces between forest shrubland and agricultural and 3 wildland urban interface wui consists of the interfaces between forest grassland shrubland and urban specifically fai represented those areas where a fire is used to carry out agricultural activities such as harvest elimination or brushwood clearing on the borders of the croplands that might spread to nearby forest areas gallardo et al 2015 fgi denoted areas where cattle grazing and other activities such as pasture burning to regenerate the herbaceous vegetation layer might ignite a fire and affect adjacent forest areas finally wui represented the urban development that has happened close to the natural areas and thus the human pressure on the forest areas via activities that might also ignite a fire e g brush cleaning close to the houses gardening works recreational activities as barbeques etc the interfaces were defined as 1 pixel 300 300m to both sides of the contact between the uses defined for each interface type then those pixels were overlaid to the 1 1 km target resolution grid the area occupied by the interface pixels by grid unit was divided by 1 km2 then density values by cell of each interface type were obtained this more general interface delineation and its calculation method allowed its obtainment in the future lulc projection maps 3 1 1 2 live fuel moisture content lfmc lfmc was obtained using a physically based inversion model based on modis reflectance data 500 m nadir bdrf adjusted reflectance product mcd43a4 collection 6 yebra et al 2018 three land cover classes were taken into consideration due to their differences in structural characteristics and biochemical composition and accordingly three lookup tables were simulated using different radiative transfer models rtms grasslands jurdao et al 2013a yebra et al 2008 shrublands jurdao et al 2013a yebra and chuvieco 2009 and forest jurdao et al 2013b simulated spectra were compared by a merit function with the observed spectra from modis images see yebra et al 2018 for further details due to the strong seasonality of wildfire occurrence in spain andrade otero et al 2019 months were grouped into spring march to may and summer june to september seasons monthly average lfmc for spring and summer was then extracted and calculated for each year of the analyzed period 2001 2010 to take into consideration the inter annual variation within the period spring and summer lfmc yearly values were then overlaid to the 1 km2 grid cell resolution 3 1 1 3 climate data spring accumulated precipitation and spring and summer maximum temperature were the climate related seasonal variables for modelling these three variables were computed as the monthly average for each year of the 2001 2010 study period to take the inter annual variation within the period into consideration for zamora and madrid a 1 km2 high resolution gridded dataset mg uc was built following the two step regression kriging hengl et al 2007 interpolation method described in bedia et al 2013 this method uses several orographic variables including elevation distance to the coastline and topographic blocking effects as predictors to reach the target resolution this process was based on a quality controlled weather stations network 2858 and 1158 stations of daily precipitation and temperatures respectively for castilla y león zamora and 384 and 144 stations of daily precipitation and temperatures respectively for madrid belonging to the spanish meteorology agency aemet in ourense and valencia due to the lower weather station density the recently developed safran système d analyze fournissant des renseignements atmosphériques à la neige meteorological analysis system durand et al 1993 1999 available for spain quintana seguí 2015 was used this dataset is based on a high density network of meteorological stations operated from the aemet and covers 35 years 1979 1980 2013 2014 at 5 km2 grid cell resolution safran data was overlaid to the 1 km2 grid cell resolution chosen for our analysis 3 1 2 response variable wildfire occurrence modelling relies on the existence of accurate geo referenced information on fire ignition points this information is not frequently available consequently the location of fire occurrence based on fire perimeters is used as an alternative in this study the most accurate fire data available for each region were used for zamora madrid and valencia fire ignition points x y coordinates collected by the regional fire services were available however the methodology used to identify and geolocate the fires is not consistent and can vary both spatially and temporally from ground or airborne gps time series available and the number of observations also differ 2007 2010 1093 observations 2005 2010 1449 observations and 2001 2010 3713 observations for zamora madrid and valencia respectively a pre processing of the different datasets was made to filter errors i e fire ignitions located in water bodies and to homogenize the information as well as to analyze the variability of the data for modelling purposes fire ignitions observations were considered presence or absence and overlaid to the 1 km2 reference grid cell for those datasets where the fire cause was available only human caused fires and an equivalent proportion of fires with unknown causes were included for the analysis fire ignition points were not available from the regional service in ourense consequently the response variable was generated by combining two satellite

the 2001 2010 baseline period was estimated using generalized linear models glms glms are extensions of linear regression models that support response variables with non normal distributions such as binomials guisan et al 2002 binary glms are commonly applied to explain the probability of fire occurrence martínez et al 2009 rodrigues 2014 vilar et al 2016b fire ignitions were used as the response variable indicating the presence or absence of a fire climate related and lfmc variables were used as predictors the generalized linear model function available in the glm package stats version 3 6 0 for r rcoreteam 2019 with family binomial and logit link corresponding to logistic regression configuration was used collinearity diagnostics such as spearman correlations and variance inflation factor vif were conducted to check whether the explanatory variables were correlated to alleviate the multicollinearity problem and reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the glm a factor analysis tinsley and brown 2000 was fitted using the factor function available in the r base package version 3 6 0 five components and a non rotated matrix were chosen modelling wildfire occurrence faces an additional issue related to the response variable wildfires are rare events and therefore the number of cells with fire absence greatly outnumbered cells with fire presence following preisler et al 2004 a random sample of the absence fire cells was selected as model input to solve this problem and retain enough covariate information on the non ignitions for modelling this approach introduces a deterministic offset term of log πxyt that does not bias the analysis vilar et al 2010 πxyt denotes the response specific sampling rate when nxyt 1 πxyt is also 1 and when nxyt 0 πxyt π in this study a sample of 10 of the zero fire cells was selected the resulting dataset was randomly divided into two groups 75 for model calibration and 25 for validation the lowest akaike s information criterion aic value was used to select the best model predictions were finally obtained for the whole dataset thus getting the probability of wildfire occurrence for each cell from the analysis we obtained the value of exp β the odds ratio which is the predicted change in odds for a unit increase in the corresponding independent variable garson 2012 explanatory variables with an odds ratio equal to or greater than 1 meant odds increased and values less than 1 represented a decrease 3 2 future wildfire occurrence modelling 3 2 1 lulc scenarios 3 2 1 1 input data cci lc maps from 1998 2008 and 2015 were used for the simulation of land cover change scenario a business as usual bau or trend scenario was applied to obtain a lulc map for 2050 using a set of variables representing accessibility suitability and restrictions behind lulc changes table 3 accessibility one of the most critical factors leading changes in lulc verburg et al 2004 was represented by the distance to roads and travel costs the model assumed that people preferred to live close to transport networks like roads to minimize their travel time to and from work gallardo et al 2015 about suitability several variables might give rise to lulc changes for example elevation influences vegetation distribution and slope which affects harvesting practices nguyen et al 2015 also lithology controls soil types given that the kind of soil is considered an essential factor for land abandonment as are the climate conditions lasanta et al 2017 potential vegetation maps provided information on incentives for the location of natural vegetation covers additionally information about natural protected areas and specific legislation for urban planning can restrict or promote the establishment of certain lulc types gallardo et al 2015 legal type restrictions are binding and should be followed by the territory s planners and stakeholders moreover burned areas are also under specific legal regulations which prevent changes in forest use for 30 years after a fire mountain area act 43 2003 3 2 1 2 lulc 2050 scenario simulation a future 2050 lulc bau scenario was run by using the land change modeler lcm eastman and toledano 2018 lcm is a constrained lulc model integrated into terrset https clarklabs org terrset land change modeler in lcm the evaluation of the potential of change is empirically obtained through three possible methods neural networks logistic regression and a machine learning algorithm the change allocation is performed through a multi objective allocation procedure and the quantity of change is estimated using a markov matrix garcía álvarez et al 2019 cci lc maps from 1998 to 2008 were used to analyze past land cover changes for model calibration this sequence was taken as a baseline and then simulated to 2015 and compared to the real map for 2015 for validation purposes the bau shows what would happen if the historical trends of 1998 2008 2015 were to continue until 2050 multi layer perceptron mlp neural network was used to relate lulc and drivers of change table 3 for the simulation the pixels of each lulc class were randomly divided between training 50 and testing samples 50 testing samples allowed for the results to be validated models were run several times to reach accuracy rates greater than 50 for each transition a cramer s v test cramér 1946 was applied to the set of drivers of change to analyze multicollinearity issues among variables the expected quantity of change and competitive land allocation based on the 1998 2008 maps sequence for a future date 2015 in this study was estimated using a markov matrix this calibration process compared the number of pixels and the spatial location of each lulc class in both maps after discrepancy was checked the model was run up to 2050 obtaining lulc simulated maps for the four sites 3 2 2 climate change scenarios the average projected precipitation and temperature for each year of the 20 year time period 2041 2060 were obtained from the regional climate change projections for spain developed in the second phase of the national plan for climate change adaptation escenarios pnacc 2017 http escenarios adaptecca es in particular we have considered the simulation corresponding to the regional climate model knmi racmo22e v1 driven by the global climate model ichec ec earth r1i1p1 from the european branch of the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex https cordex org giorgi et al 2009 jacob et al 2014 in particular the eur 11 cordex domain was used finally the business as usual rcp 8 5 experiment was used in order to maintain the coherence between the different components note that this regional model has shown good performance over the iberian peninsula kotlarsky et al 2019 herrera et al 2020 to obtain the future climatology at 1 km2 spatial resolution grid required for the fire occurrence model the climate change signal 12 km defined as the difference between the future 2041 2060 and historical 1981 2010 periods delta method was added to the observed climatology 1 km räisänen 2007 zahn and von storch 2010 bedia et al 2013 delta future historical projection climatology delta note that this is the simplest bias calibration method as it assumes an additive constant bias b of the model which is removed when those deltas are considered delta future historical future b historical b the interannual variability of the climatic variables was evaluated through t test equal means and f test equal variances comparing each year from 2041 to 2060 with 2050 centered year of the period where lulc projections were calculated in order to ensure the coherence at least up to some point between the different layers included in the model along the whole period 3 2 3 lfmc prediction due to the absence of future lfmc projections a comparison between present and future climate conditions was carried out lfmc interacts with rainfall air temperature or soil moisture qi et al 2012 dennison and moritz 2009 so the purpose of this comparison was to identify the year within the study period 2001 2010 most similar to year 2050 center of the 20 year period from 2041 to 2060 in terms of climatic conditions and to use its lfmc as the values for 2050 to this end the euclidean distance between the present and future spatial patterns of spring precipitation and spring and summer maximum temperatures was obtained for each year of the 2001 2010 study period considering the four regions together the distance was obtained considering each variable independently and their joint standardized version 3 2 4 statistical model for future wildfire occurrence future wildfire occurrence was obtained by applying the historical glm model for each study site using input data lulc maps climate data and lfmc projected up to the 20 year time period 2041 2060 centered on 2050 the factor analysis representing the climate and lfmc variables were translated into the coefficients thereof to be applied to this new dataset using the following relationship 2 f i u i 1 x 1 u i 2 x i 2 u i k x k where f i is the i th factor scores u i j are the components of the eigenvectors then the model can be expressed as 3 b 1 u 1 1 x 1 u 1 2 x 1 2 u 1 k x k b k u k 1 x 1 u k 2 x k 2 u k k x k thus the future model is as follows 4 x j i 1 k b i u i j projected probability values were obtained for each year from 2041 to 2060 moreover the mean and the standard deviation of these probability values of the 20 years of the period were calculated to explore the projected values and its uncertainty maps of 20 year 2041 2060 wildfire occurrence probability were finally obtained for each study site at 1 km2 target resolution 4 results 4 1 baseline wildfire occurrence 4 1 1 explanatory and response variables fig 4 shows the lulc interfaces derived from cci lc 2005 the extent and spatial distribution differed among sites fai dominated in all regions fgi presence was also notable in ourense fig 4a cells covered by wui were also crucial in all study sites except zamora fig 4b seasonal climate related variables within the baseline modelling for the 2001 2010 period included for the factor analysis showed differences among the years of the study period illustrating then the expected variability there were also differences among the regions corresponding to differences in the base climate conditions used figures a1 a2 and a3 for zamora and madrid data at 1 km2 grid resolution were calculated through downscaling processes explained in section 3 1 1 in contrast for ourense and valencia safran database was downscaled from 5 km2 to 1 km2 grid resolution spring and summer lfmc also showed differences over the 2001 2010 period among the regions and within them in the space figure a4 fig 5 shows the wildfire occurrence maps for the study sites as presence absence of the ignition of a fire response variable 4 1 2 modelled wildfire occurrence the first three factors explained more than 80 of the variance in all sites table 4 the first factor was positively and strongly related with spring and summer maximum temperature in all sites except for valencia where the effect was also positive but with lesser influence spring lfmc presented stronger effect followed by summer lfmc the second factor was determined by lfmc spring lfmc in zamora and madrid summer lfmc in ourense but with a weaker effect in the valencian site where spring maximum temperature had a more significant impact finally the third factor was determined either by spring precipitation ourense and valencia or summer lfmc zamora and madrid lulc interfaces aspect and the obtained climate lfmc factors were included as variables to model baseline wildfire occurrence table 5 the significant selected variables varied by each site aspect was not significant in any of the studied sites zfgi was only significant in ourense the other two lulc standardized interfaces zfai and zwui were significant for all sites except for ourense where zfgi was of importance the exponentiated coefficient values exp β indicated the effect on the increase of a wildfire occurrence for example the exp β 1 475 shown in zfgi for ourense indicated that for a one unit increase in zfgi in ourense and where the other variables remained constant the probability of a wildfire multiplied by 1 47 an increase in the odds of a wildfire occurring of about 47 in all sites lulc interfaces had exp β values that were greater than 1 meaning an increase in the odds zfgi was the most influential variable in ourense and zwui and zfai were second most important in madrid valencia and zamora the significance and effects of the combined lfmc and climate related variables factor variables differed depending on the site for madrid and valencia the factor mainly determined by the maximum temperature in spring or summer increased the probability of wildfire occurrence where the other variables remained constant on the contrary a decrease in the odds of a wildfire occurrence exp β 1 was due to the factor mainly determined by the spring precipitation in ourense and valencia and by lfmc mostly spring in zamora however maximum temperature determined the factor in two sites ourense and zamora decreasing the probability of a wildfire in contrast the factor determined by lfmc increased the odds of a wildfire madrid and valencia there were differences in the spatial distribution of the predicted probabilities within each of the sites fig 6 however probability distribution values were similar except for madrid fig 6c where medium values covered most of the site 4 2 future wildfire occurrence 4 2 1 lulc scenarios and derived interfaces 2050 lulc bau scenarios were assessed during the calibration processes by comparing the 2015 predicted map with the actual 2015 map for all study sites the total agreement was 96 looking at the results by class agricultural and forest classes presented the greatest accuracy 90 while errors of commission and omission differed for each site in general lulc classes were adequately predicted except for the urban class which presented both errors of omission 27 and 12 for zamora and madrid respectively and commission 46 17 and 23 in zamora madrid and valencia respectively agriculture in ourense site had an error of commission of 13 bau scenarios showed if the trends in lulc changes continued as observed between 1998 and 2008 the more settled urban sites madrid and valencia experienced urban development nearby the large cities peri urban areas road networks and along the coast in the case of valencia great road accessibility due to high road density in these areas played a role in projected urban development urban grew 27 and 73 in madrid and valencia respectively land abandonment was reflected in these sites in the decreased percentage of agriculture 50 and 14 decreases respectively where were mainly replaced by urban both in madrid and in valencia shrubland decreased and in valencia shrubland were converted into forest encroachment process forest class increased to 60 but the greatest increase was notably in the grassland 100 in both sites too on the other hand in the more rural oriented sites zamora and ourense the lulc tendency showed two different situations in zamora land abandonment was reflected in the decreased agriculture class 22 and increased shrubland and grassland 20 and 73 respectively agriculture was replaced by forest lands however in ourense the tendency showed an increase in an agriculture class which continued in the projected lulc 2050 map being 58 larger in this site there will be less forest and mostly shrubland classes forestlands will be replaced by agriculture and there will be an increase in the urban areas nearby the existing ones the maps of changes between real 2015 and simulated 2050 maps are available in the supplementary material figure a5 lulc 2050 simulated maps controlled the changes in the extension and location of the 2050 lulc interfaces foreseen growth in grassland class in three sites madrid zamora and valencia notably increased fgi table 6 in madrid the projected growth in settlement class also increased wui 17 but not in the case of valencia where wui decreased by 56 even if projected forest lands increased in valencia shrubland declined and this class belonged to forest class when calculating lulc interfaces see section 3 1 1 a lesser amount of shrubland influenced the reduced contact between urban areas and forest in this site the reduction in projected agriculture class affected the decrease of fai in all sites even in ourense but to a lesser extent 4 2 2 climate change scenarios and projected lfmc climate variables precipitation and maximum temperature were projected to the 20 year time period 2041 2060 to the 1 km2 target then spring precipitation spring and summer maximum temperature were extracted the interannual variability of the climatic variables showed significant differences among years but retained the spatial pattern and gradients which were important due to their interaction with the rest of the variables interfaces aspect and lfmc spring precipitation decreased in 2041 2060 while maximum temperatures increased at all sites fig 7 the projected resolution differed given the different source of climate based variables used 1 km2 in the case of zamora and madrid and 5 km2 for ourense and valencia concerning lfmc the year 2005 was identified as the year more similar to projected year 2050 center of the 20 year period from 2041 to 2060 climate conditions in all sites and thus the lfmc for this year epoch was considered input for the future wildfire prediction model fig 8 seasonal differences can be noted within each site in ourense summer values were higher than spring values due to the influence of higher lfmc in the months of june and july in the summer average and lower in march and april in the spring average see figure a4 an agricultural patch located in the south of ourense presented a diverse behavior by season depending on the year of the 2001 2010 time series but dominating lower lfmc values in spring than in summer also some forested areas located in the north of ourense presented lower lfmc values in spring than in summer 4 2 3 projected wildfire occurrence projected wildfire occurrences for each year from 2041 to 2060 showed a similar pattern to the one estimated for the year 2050 which indicated the large contribution of the non climate variables to the proposed model the mean and the standard deviation of the 20 years period reflected a similar projected pattern and regarding the level of uncertainty given by the standard deviation cells with high projected wildfire 0 9 1 probability values retained at least intermediate values 0 7 in addition cells with intermediate projected wildfire were around the mean probability values see figure a6 projected wildfire occurrence would increase in 19 73 of the 1 km2 grid cells depending on the analyzed site and decrease in 26 80 table 7 in one site zamora cells with an increase in projected wildfire occurrence were greater than the baseline model in the other sites the percentage of cells that saw a decrease in projected wildfire occurrence outnumbered those that saw an increase in zamora fig 9 b and madrid fig 9c projected wildfire probability increases in two standard deviations were notable in the areas where the projected wildfire probability was expected to increase while in ourense and valencia the increases were mostly within one standard deviation in general in zamora and in madrid the probability of a wildfire occurring increased in 2041 2060 for areas where the baseline wildfire probability was higher fig 6 however in ourense and valencia this probability increased in areas where the wildfire probability baseline was intermediate or low moreover in ourense projected wildfire probability decreases in some areas where the baseline probability foreseen intermediate values 5 discussion this paper concludes that both lulc and climate changes will have an effect and drive future wildfire probability of occurrence drivers of change and resulting probability will vary across and within the analyzed sites projected wildfire probability will increase by target 1 km2 grid cells mostly in zamora site where the percentage of cells with an increase will be larger than the percentage of cells with a decrease also in this site and in madrid higher projected values occurred where it was expected a higher increase on one hand the strength and characteristics of the relationships among lulc interfaces aspect climate and lfmc established in the baseline predictive models will determine future projected probability on the other hand the relative importance of drivers was different depending on the site but at the same time showed several key common points for instance wildfire occurrence probability increased because of lulc interfaces effect however their specific influence depended on the site wui presented a larger effect in the urban developed sites madrid and valencia while fai in the rural oriented sites zamora and ourense as well as fgi in ourense this result is consistent with other studies done in spain obtaining similar effects in distinguishing drivers that lead to wildfire occurrence in rural fai influence and urban wui influence areas martínez et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2016 consequently our results entail considerations for management actions e g ignition prevention efforts may be most effective if actions are concentrated on these specific lulc interfaces nonetheless wui was not significant in ourense as found in previous research chas amil et al 2013 cci lc lulc 300 m of spatial resolution was used as the lulc data source this data source was considered appropriate for modelling wildfire at the site al level vilar et al 2019 however in orense the urban development structure is small and scattered balsa barreiro and hermosilla 2013 according to roy chowdhury et al 2018 for urban development studies cci lc does not detect the location of fringe areas as essential components of the urban settlement category because wui is defined as the contact area between urban and forest covers further work would be needed to categorize the urban category in these particular situations factor effects on predicted probability were diverse by site as expected for areas located in the mediterranean basin koutsias et al 2013 verdú et al 2012 the maximum temperature increased the predicted probability in two sites madrid and valencia moreover spring precipitation in ourense and madrid and lfmc in zamora decreased the probability of a wildfire consistent with previous research in mediterranean fire prone areas less rainfall in spring has been analyzed as a contributor to increased wildfire occurrence in valencia and morocco chergui et al 2018 also antecedent rainfall has been shown to have a relation with the threshold where lfmc declines and thus fires start in california dennison and moritz 2009 therefore more rain will delay the timing of this critical threshold and thus might be decreasing subsequent wildfires however the relationship between temperature and wildfire occurrence for the two rural sites ourense and zamora contradicted expectations maximum temperature decreased wildfire occurrence nevertheless the baseline model showed that the temperature effect was compensated by spring precipitation or lfmc and factors determined by these variables decreased wildfire probability the resulting probability maps varied within the analyzed sites due to differences in relationships among drivers and response variable in the case of the madrid mid probability values were more abundant within its area and greater wildfire probability values were not spatial concentrated in the same cells as in previous papers vilar et al 2016b however vilar et al 2016a only included human related factors as explanatory variables studies of historical fire prediction in mediterranean areas using climate and land cover or human related variables have shown differences in the strength that climate variables have in the control of estimated wildfire occurrence duane et al 2015 padilla and vega garcía 2011 verdú et al 2012 future projected wildfire will depend on the obtained baseline current conditions and also on nature and the degree of change in climate and lulc among other concerns lulc change scenario projection depends on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the data used for the simulation martínez vega et al 2017 cci lc available for every year since 1992 was chosen as the lulc data source as it was considered a standard source of information because of the global availability thereof allowing studies to be replicated in other sites nonetheless other studies in crop monitoring pérez hoyos et al 2017 revealed this source led to the overestimation of the agriculture class finding improvements in newer versions of the product 2015 this issue could have consequences in the amount of derived fai that is calculated and estimated the time points chosen for the analysis 1998 and 2008 happened after the more important land abandonment process that mainly occurred in the 1950s 1960s geri et al 2010 still this change continued in the selected period and was reflected in the resulting general decline in agriculture except for the ourense site complementary explanatory variables could have improved the modelling of some of the lulc changes such as future information on the road network for the projected centered year 2050 acceptable overall accuracies were obtained in the validation of the bau scenarios but there were misclassification results mostly for the urban class this can be explained by the fact that this category represented a small percentage of the total area of the sites but a high percentage of change mostly in the most developed urban sites gallardo et al 2015 also even the good accuracy results found for the agriculture category in ourense presented an error of commission of 13 this in turn increased this class contrary to the expected general trend of land abandonment projected lulc was used as the data source for lulc interfaces calculation so a detailed analysis of the accuracy in the location of the new lulc was desired this could be improved by calculating quantity and allocation disagreements which include exchange and shift components pontius jr and santacruz 2014 in addition to lulc projected changes future climate scenarios calculated provided data at 1 km2 target resolution the method applied to obtain the future climatology at 1 km delta difference of bedia et al 2013 assumes a constant bias which is removed when the deltas are considered this process has been satisfactorily applied in madrid and zamora sites where historical climate data was able to be calculated at 1 km2 nonetheless good results were also obtained by using safran data at 5 km2 resolution this method could be replicated for other sites if observed historical data are available as a reference according to moriondo et al 2006 the use of regional circulation models rcms allows reproducing fine scale features of different climates making rcms more reliable for climate change impact analysis and fire risk studies in general future wildfire probability will increase at least in two sites zamora and madrid in areas where the expected baseline probability was high consistent with projections made with the inclusion of the human factor in fire prone areas gallardo et al 2015 liu et al 2012 syphard et al 2018 bryant and westerling 2014 westerling et al 2011 however two other sites ourense and valencia showed fewer cells where the wildfire probability would increase also projected wildfire probability decreased in cells where the expected baseline probability was intermediate or low this was due to the less future fgi ourense fai and wui valencia thus reducing the probability of a wildfire and also due to the effects contrary as expected of the reduction in the spring precipitation or an increase in the spring maximum temperature that will reduce the probability of a wildfire other papers also found that climate change was not always dominant in explaining future wildfire changes syphard et al 2019 the modelling framework applied in this paper for regional wildfire future predictions allowed for the establishment of a statistically based wildfire occurrence baseline which showed human climate lfmc driving relationships and strengths said baseline detected regional differences between studied zones in the estimated and the spatial distribution probability of wildfires the dataset used referred to 1 km2 target resolution based on detailed gridded spatial data such as cci lc 300 m climate 1 5 km lfmc 500 m and aspect 200 m in future works these methods can be extended and replicated in other study sites as they have been separately widely applied and proven to provide accurate wildfire estimations in other areas also lulc cci lc and remote sensing data used to derive lfmc are available elsewhere nonetheless some limitations can be found for a wider application well observed climate data are needed to proceed to the downscaling process at 1 km2 also combined climate and lfmc factors are not always easy to interpret and can cover the specific effect of each variable moreover projected lfmc was approximated by analyzing climate current and future conditions as no future field or remote sensing data were available for estimating lfmc further work is needed to find a way to forecast lfmc furthermore even though the non climatic variables largely contributed to the future wildfire occurrence those were projected to a single year centered on the 20 year climate projections which can limit the proposed modelling framework lulc projections can be calculated for more than one target year if considering different past periods of change this could contribute to enrich the projected wildfire occurrence within the 20 year climatic projected period and future work will consider a multi year lulc projections framework 6 conclusions future wildfire projections will result from the complex interactions among diverse factors related to human activities lulc interfaces climate and fuel moisture content lfmc expected changes will produce an increase in wildfire occurrence in three out of four analyzed spanish sites indicating the existing variation in fire climate and land use effects by site lulc change projected scenarios properly simulated the conversion to natural vegetation and urban development resulting in lulc interfaces that will have specific effects on projected wildfire by site when taking management and planning actions considering climate change conditions and the lfmc future worst case scenario will also be important as well as lulc change consequences and therefore the human factor the modelling framework applied here can be replicated in other fire prone sites such as the lulc global cci lc product and remote sensing data used to derive lfmc are available elsewhere still having detailed observed climate data is necessary this paper showed the results for a specific climate change regional model and one emission scenario which must be extended considering an ensemble of climate change projections including several regional climate models and future scenarios as given by the representative concentration pathways rcps to properly quantify the uncertainty related to future projections also lulc change predictions might be improved by applying different lulc scenario pathways conservation economic crisis and considering multi year projections future wildfire predictions in fire prone and humanized areas at detailed spatial resolution and considering regional characteristics are useful

25727,wildfire occurrence is expected to increase in future climate and land use land cover lulc change scenarios especially in vulnerable areas as the european mediterranean basin in this study future probability of wildfire occurrence was estimated for a 20 year time period 2041 2060 centered on 2050 by applying a statistically based regression model using lulc derived contact areas with the forest cover interfaces as proxy for the human related factor and a combination of live fuel moisture content and seasonal climate related variables as predictors future wildfire occurrence was mapped under rcp 8 5 high emissions scenario in four spanish regions with heterogeneous socioeconomic lulc and natural fire related characteristics at 1 km2 target spatial resolution results showed increased wildfire probability in 19 73 of 1 km2 cells observing regional differences in the variable effects this approach could be applied to other spatial scales offering tools for planning and management actions and to obtain different possible future scenarios keywords land use land cover interfaces climate change initiative land cover lfmc coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 business as usual scenario wildland urban interface 1 introduction nowadays wildfires are one of the significant threats to forested areas worldwide and the european mediterranean basin is one of the more susceptible areas to fire episodes reporting more than 85 of the total burned area in europe san miguel ayanz et al 2012 wildfires however are complex phenomena involving multiple factors mediate e g fuel availability moisture conditions natural and human ignitions meteorological climate drivers gudmundsson et al 2014 and management decisions hély et al 2001 which also operate at different spatial and temporal scales bedia et al 2015 reported changes in the mediterranean region regarding the use of land and climate spinoni et al 2020 are affecting the fire cycle pausas and fernández

and aesthetics as well as property and human lives these changes are expected to become more intense in the coming century syphard et al 2019 increasing their effects on fires and the consequential impacts on human communities worldwide spain is representative of these changes within mediterranean europe stellmes et al 2013 as lengthened and longer fire weather seasons have become more frequent jolly et al 2015 understanding the past relationships among land use land cover lulc changes climate and wildfire occurrence will allow for the prediction of future impacts and the evaluation of vulnerabilities which will serve as input for management and policy actions gallardo et al 2015 resulting relationships will depend on the type and force of driving factors and their importance in different regions the european mediterranean basin has experienced profound lulc changes derived from human activities geri et al 2010 in the last century lulc changes in rural areas of southern european countries were first linked to the intense abandonment of the countryside 1950s 1960s then there was a shift to a new agricultural and mechanized system 1980s followed by urban expansion in forested areas and increased recreational activities and the consequential intensification of the pressure on natural zones 2000s vilar et al 2016a such abandonment led to exceptional fuel accumulation due to natural reforestation processes geri et al 2010 and urban pressure due to the increase in contact areas between forest and urban constructions the so called wildland urban interface or wui all of which triggered an increase in wildfire risk besides lulc also creates an impact through the ignition of fires with more than 80 of fires in this area being linked to human activities and the result of negligence accidents or acts of arson ganteaume et al 2013 e g the use of fire to control herbaceous vegetation for cattle grazing or to clean brushwood in crops lightning causes 5 in average of the known fires in this basin given the wide range of the human activities effects several studies include the contact areas between forest and other covers the so called interfaces such as wui vilar et al 2016a chas amil et al 2013 modugno et al 2016 lampin maillet et al 2011 agricultural forest interface gallardo et al 2015 martínez et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2016 and grassland forest interface rodrigues 2014 vilar et al 2019 among others as human drivers of wildfire occurrence assuming that socioeconomic changes are likely to continue further changes in lulc are also expected projecting the amount of lulc change and the location thereof will allow for future lulc derived interfaces to be obtained and for the human factor of the wildfire occurrence be represented gallardo et al 2015 on the other hand the climate role in wildfires is mainly linked to the control of vegetation characteristics and status westerling et al 2011 pre fire season weather conditions have been proved to have a strong influence on the ignition and propagation of large fires because of their effect on fuel load and flammability urbieta et al 2015 moreover the fuel moisture content fmc defined as the mass of water contained within vegetation per dry mass is a critical variable affecting fire interactions with fuel yebra et al 2013 and might affect both fuel ignition and fire spread rate viegas et al 1992 rossa et al 2017 as fmc increases the flammability of fuels tends to decrease as more energy is needed to evaporate water before burning organic tissues argañaraz et al 2018 fmc is usually separated into live lfmc and dead fuels dfmc chuvieco et al 2004 most operational fire danger rating systems include the estimation of dfmc those lying on the forest floor leaves branches and debris camia et al 2003 still the estimation of lfmc is included less often less significant relations between fire spread or intensity were found in experimental data field analysis for a shrub or conifer forest fernandes and cruz 2012 among other reasons this is because lfmc is the result of complex interactions between previous and concurrent weather and the varied biological mechanisms that influence water content and dry matter accumulation jolly et al 2014 turner 1981 climate change trends in southern europe are expected to lead to increased temperature a greater number of heatwaves and dryer days cramer et al 2008 and a decreased summer precipitation kovats et al 2014 modelling studies predict that this will lead to an increase in fire activity sousa et al 2015 the number of large fires vázquez de la cueva et al 2012 and the burnt area amatulli et al 2013 turco et al 2018 dupuy et al 2020 recently reviewed 23 studies that projected fire danger indices or fire activity number of fires size and burnt area and at modelled climate fire relationships in the european context at local regional or continental scale results showed a relative increase 2 4 per decade in mean seasonal fire danger under pessimistic climate change scenarios in the mediterranean regions burnt areas are projected to increase everywhere in southern europe at a rate of 15 25 per decade dupuy et al 2020 several simulation scenario studies have combined factors on humans topography vegetation and fmc along with climate change conditions as drivers of future wildfires in fire prone areas worldwide examples of variables included in the modelling processes include housing density westerling et al 2011 distance to populated places liu et al 2012 land use effects syphard et al 2018 distance to roads syphard et al 2019 road density liu et al 2012 wui and other land cover interfaces gallardo et al 2015 aspect and slope westerling et al 2011 vegetation type syphard et al 2018 and fine fuel moisture content liu et al 2012 however in the european context dupuy et al 2020 claimed that one of the sources of uncertainty in future estimations was the lack of information on the influence of human factors on climate fire relationships moreover they affirmed that the influence of fmc should be taken into account and constitutes a possible source of bias for future predictions the main aim of this work was to develop an integrated modelling framework at 1 km2 target resolution to better understand the importance of climate lfmc and human factors on future spatial and temporal characteristics of wildfire occurrence in different southern european regions to that end the variable effect and distribution of current and future projected probability of wildfires were analyzed in four areas of spain these regions were selected as representative of lulc changes and climate conditions in southern europe and have different socioeconomic biophysical and wildfire characteristics the specific objectives were first to calibrate statistical based regression models for wildfire occurrence combining climate lfmc topography and lulc interfaces secondly the regression models were applied to the projected lulc and climate variables obtaining the future wildfire probability the three main research questions addressed are 1 would wildfire probability increase or decrease in relation to lulc and climate changes and how 2 which variables would be more influential in the different regions and 3 could this modelling framework be applied to other scales and areas for planning and management actions 2 study sites this paper covers four spanish regions ourense zamora madrid and valencia fig 1 table 1 these regions are representative of the landscape types derived from the different socioeconomic processes affecting southern europe in the last decades and the relation thereof to historical fire events and trends as explained in the introduction more specifically two of the sites are rural oriented ourense and zamora in the northwest of spain and the other two are representative of urban development madrid and valencia located in central spain and on the eastern mediterranean coast respectively the rural oriented sites have low population densities table 1 with regressive demographic dynamics due to low birth rates and an ageing population balsa barreiro and hermosilla 2013 spanish statistic institute ine 2019 except in the major cities moreno et al 2014 in ourense the population is mostly dispersed chas amil et al 2015 and the economy is based on the primary sector gonzalez and pukkala 2007 on the contrary urban sites have higher population densities and their economy is based on the tertiary sector ine 2019 in the late 1990s significant urban growth happened in urbanized areas such as madrid in parallel to decreased agricultural and forest areas plata rocha et al 2011 also there was an intense urbanization process in the spanish mediterranean coast i e the valencian region disturbing its natural configuration syphard et al 2018 barbero sierra et al 2013 the expansion of urban construction continued from 2000 until the outbreak of the global economic crisis in 2008 in rural regions such as ourense afforestation processes due to the abandonment of agricultural activities have continued for the last four decades fuentes santos et al 2013 in zamora the abandonment of these activities was accompanied by a decrease in the livestock density until the mid 1990s moreno et al 2014 land cover is the landscape resulting from these changes in ourense fig 1a forest covers prevail 67 of the total area while in zamora fig 1b agriculture is the predominant land cover 64 of the total area in madrid fig 1c and valencia fig 1d a more balanced spatial distribution of forest and agricultural areas is observed with urban areas being abundant 16 and 6 respectively other land cover types relevant to fire occurrence such as pastures and shrublands occupy a substantial percentage of the total territory of madrid 14 pasture lands and valencia 15 shrublands in comparison to other regions climatic conditions are quite diverse in the selected regions which have a dissimilar influence on fire incidence and the effects on the territory ourense has oceanic conditions but warm summers zamora and madrid are representative of mediterranean continental climate while valencia has a mediterranean climate spanish meteorology agency or aemet 2019 table 1 about wildfire characteristics differences between the selected regions are notable in terms of the number of fire events and burnt area as well as fire causes ourense had both the highest number of fires and the largest burned area in the last decade 2006 2015 with more than 70 being due to arson andrade otero et al 2019 and ministry of agriculture fisheries and food www mapa gob es in ourense site fires are then explained by other factors that are not climate related such as accidents neglect and acts of arson aimed at transforming the territory andrade otero et al 2019 3 methods the methodological steps followed to obtain the future wildfire occurrence in the study sites for the 20 year time period 2041 2060 centered on 2050 include four main phases 1 modelling the baseline wildfire occurrence 2 simulating lulc change scenarios 3 building climate projections and 4 modelling future wildfire occurrence fig 2 this integrated modelling framework was proposed at 1 km2 target resolution as appropriate for regional scale in spain due to the average size of its regions and the management system organization as in previous works chuvieco et al 2010 gallardo et al 2015 vilar et al 2016b specific data used for modelling has been generated at this resolution and spatially processed the period of 1998 2015 was used for the baseline wildfire modelling and lulc change simulations these years represent the specific socioeconomic and land cover changes associated with wildfire occurrence that took place in spain in the last decades for modelling the baseline wildfire occurrence phase 1 a 10 year period 2001 2010 was chosen as it was considered sufficient to gather the fire occurrence and recent climate and lfmc conditions variability the 1998 and 2008 land cover maps were used to calibrate lulc change scenarios while the 2015 map to perform its assessment phase 2 lastly lulc 2050 projections and 20 year 2041 2060 climate change projections were obtained phase 3 and wildfire probability was then obtained for that period phase 4 3 1 baseline wildfire occurrence modelling 3 1 1 explanatory variables explanatory variables used to model the baseline wildfire occurrence were related to lulc interfaces lfmc climate and topography aspect table 2 3 1 1 1 lulc maps and derived interfaces the esa climate change initiative land cover cci lc map https www esa landcover cci org was used to both derive lulc interfaces and to simulate lulc change scenarios cci lc was chosen because of its global availability fine spatial resolution 300 m period covered yearly maps since 1998 present and its adequacy for estimating wildfire occurrence at local and european scales vilar et al 2019 this product includes 22 land cover classes using united nations land cover classification system un lccs di gregorio et al 2016 taking into consideration the thematic meaning of the land cover in relation to wildfire occurrence analysis the original cci lc legend was aggregated into eight classes urban agriculture grassland shrubland forest sparse vegetation and bare areas wetland and water bodies to obtain a more manageable number of classes fig 1 three lulc interfaces were obtained and used as proxies for the role of human activity in wildfire occurrence 1 forest agricultural interface fai includes the interfaces between forest grassland shrubland and agricultural 2 forest grassland interface fgi consists of the interfaces between forest shrubland and agricultural and 3 wildland urban interface wui consists of the interfaces between forest grassland shrubland and urban specifically fai represented those areas where a fire is used to carry out agricultural activities such as harvest elimination or brushwood clearing on the borders of the croplands that might spread to nearby forest areas gallardo et al 2015 fgi denoted areas where cattle grazing and other activities such as pasture burning to regenerate the herbaceous vegetation layer might ignite a fire and affect adjacent forest areas finally wui represented the urban development that has happened close to the natural areas and thus the human pressure on the forest areas via activities that might also ignite a fire e g brush cleaning close to the houses gardening works recreational activities as barbeques etc the interfaces were defined as 1 pixel 300 300m to both sides of the contact between the uses defined for each interface type then those pixels were overlaid to the 1 1 km target resolution grid the area occupied by the interface pixels by grid unit was divided by 1 km2 then density values by cell of each interface type were obtained this more general interface delineation and its calculation method allowed its obtainment in the future lulc projection maps 3 1 1 2 live fuel moisture content lfmc lfmc was obtained using a physically based inversion model based on modis reflectance data 500 m nadir bdrf adjusted reflectance product mcd43a4 collection 6 yebra et al 2018 three land cover classes were taken into consideration due to their differences in structural characteristics and biochemical composition and accordingly three lookup tables were simulated using different radiative transfer models rtms grasslands jurdao et al 2013a yebra et al 2008 shrublands jurdao et al 2013a yebra and chuvieco 2009 and forest jurdao et al 2013b simulated spectra were compared by a merit function with the observed spectra from modis images see yebra et al 2018 for further details due to the strong seasonality of wildfire occurrence in spain andrade otero et al 2019 months were grouped into spring march to may and summer june to september seasons monthly average lfmc for spring and summer was then extracted and calculated for each year of the analyzed period 2001 2010 to take into consideration the inter annual variation within the period spring and summer lfmc yearly values were then overlaid to the 1 km2 grid cell resolution 3 1 1 3 climate data spring accumulated precipitation and spring and summer maximum temperature were the climate related seasonal variables for modelling these three variables were computed as the monthly average for each year of the 2001 2010 study period to take the inter annual variation within the period into consideration for zamora and madrid a 1 km2 high resolution gridded dataset mg uc was built following the two step regression kriging hengl et al 2007 interpolation method described in bedia et al 2013 this method uses several orographic variables including elevation distance to the coastline and topographic blocking effects as predictors to reach the target resolution this process was based on a quality controlled weather stations network 2858 and 1158 stations of daily precipitation and temperatures respectively for castilla y león zamora and 384 and 144 stations of daily precipitation and temperatures respectively for madrid belonging to the spanish meteorology agency aemet in ourense and valencia due to the lower weather station density the recently developed safran système d analyze fournissant des renseignements atmosphériques à la neige meteorological analysis system durand et al 1993 1999 available for spain quintana seguí 2015 was used this dataset is based on a high density network of meteorological stations operated from the aemet and covers 35 years 1979 1980 2013 2014 at 5 km2 grid cell resolution safran data was overlaid to the 1 km2 grid cell resolution chosen for our analysis 3 1 2 response variable wildfire occurrence modelling relies on the existence of accurate geo referenced information on fire ignition points this information is not frequently available consequently the location of fire occurrence based on fire perimeters is used as an alternative in this study the most accurate fire data available for each region were used for zamora madrid and valencia fire ignition points x y coordinates collected by the regional fire services were available however the methodology used to identify and geolocate the fires is not consistent and can vary both spatially and temporally from ground or airborne gps time series available and the number of observations also differ 2007 2010 1093 observations 2005 2010 1449 observations and 2001 2010 3713 observations for zamora madrid and valencia respectively a pre processing of the different datasets was made to filter errors i e fire ignitions located in water bodies and to homogenize the information as well as to analyze the variability of the data for modelling purposes fire ignitions observations were considered presence or absence and overlaid to the 1 km2 reference grid cell for those datasets where the fire cause was available only human caused fires and an equivalent proportion of fires with unknown causes were included for the analysis fire ignition points were not available from the regional service in ourense consequently the response variable was generated by combining two satellite products 1 modis terra and aqua burned area ba mcd64a1 product which is a global and monthly gridded 500 m resolution product giglio and justice 2015 and 2 daily modis hotspots hs from mcd14dl and the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viiirs 375 m vnp14imgtdl nrt giglio et al 2003 ba was downloaded from lp daac nasa land products and services https lpdaac usgs gov dataset discovery modis modis products table mcd64a1 v006 and hs from active fire data https firms modaps eosdis nasa gov for 2001 2010 by combining this data three situations were possible 1 ba with no hs 2 hs with no ba and 3 concurrent ba and hs fig 3 in 1 the presence ignition of a fire was assigned to the 1 km2 occupied by a larger area of the ba in 2 a 400 m spatial distance analysis grouped hs and then the one with the earliest date was selected as the ignition of that fire and in 3 it was considered another ignition by choosing the earlier hs date and time 3 1 3 statistical analysis wildfire occurrence for the 2001 2010 baseline period was estimated using generalized linear models glms glms are extensions of linear regression models that support response variables with non normal distributions such as binomials guisan et al 2002 binary glms are commonly applied to explain the probability of fire occurrence martínez et al 2009 rodrigues 2014 vilar et al 2016b fire ignitions were used as the response variable indicating the presence or absence of a fire climate related and lfmc variables were used as predictors the generalized linear model function available in the glm package stats version 3 6 0 for r rcoreteam 2019 with family binomial and logit link corresponding to logistic regression configuration was used collinearity diagnostics such as spearman correlations and variance inflation factor vif were conducted to check whether the explanatory variables were correlated to alleviate the multicollinearity problem and reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the glm a factor analysis tinsley and brown 2000 was fitted using the factor function available in the r base package version 3 6 0 five components and a non rotated matrix were chosen modelling wildfire occurrence faces an additional issue related to the response variable wildfires are rare events and therefore the number of cells with fire absence greatly outnumbered cells with fire presence following preisler et al 2004 a random sample of the absence fire cells was selected as model input to solve this problem and retain enough covariate information on the non ignitions for modelling this approach introduces a deterministic offset term of log πxyt that does not bias the analysis vilar et al 2010 πxyt denotes the response specific sampling rate when nxyt 1 πxyt is also 1 and when nxyt 0 πxyt π in this study a sample of 10 of the zero fire cells was selected the resulting dataset was randomly divided into two groups 75 for model calibration and 25 for validation the lowest akaike s information criterion aic value was used to select the best model predictions were finally obtained for the whole dataset thus getting the probability of wildfire occurrence for each cell from the analysis we obtained the value of exp β the odds ratio which is the predicted change in odds for a unit increase in the corresponding independent variable garson 2012 explanatory variables with an odds ratio equal to or greater than 1 meant odds increased and values less than 1 represented a decrease 3 2 future wildfire occurrence modelling 3 2 1 lulc scenarios 3 2 1 1 input data cci lc maps from 1998 2008 and 2015 were used for the simulation of land cover change scenario a business as usual bau or trend scenario was applied to obtain a lulc map for 2050 using a set of variables representing accessibility suitability and restrictions behind lulc changes table 3 accessibility one of the most critical factors leading changes in lulc verburg et al 2004 was represented by the distance to roads and travel costs the model assumed that people preferred to live close to transport networks like roads to minimize their travel time to and from work gallardo et al 2015 about suitability several variables might give rise to lulc changes for example elevation influences vegetation distribution and slope which affects harvesting practices nguyen et al 2015 also lithology controls soil types given that the kind of soil is considered an essential factor for land abandonment as are the climate conditions lasanta et al 2017 potential vegetation maps provided information on incentives for the location of natural vegetation covers additionally information about natural protected areas and specific legislation for urban planning can restrict or promote the establishment of certain lulc types gallardo et al 2015 legal type restrictions are binding and should be followed by the territory s planners and stakeholders moreover burned areas are also under specific legal regulations which prevent changes in forest use for 30 years after a fire mountain area act 43 2003 3 2 1 2 lulc 2050 scenario simulation a future 2050 lulc bau scenario was run by using the land change modeler lcm eastman and toledano 2018 lcm is a constrained lulc model integrated into terrset https clarklabs org terrset land change modeler in lcm the evaluation of the potential of change is empirically obtained through three possible methods neural networks logistic regression and a machine learning algorithm the change allocation is performed through a multi objective allocation procedure and the quantity of change is estimated using a markov matrix garcía álvarez et al 2019 cci lc maps from 1998 to 2008 were used to analyze past land cover changes for model calibration this sequence was taken as a baseline and then simulated to 2015 and compared to the real map for 2015 for validation purposes the bau shows what would happen if the historical trends of 1998 2008 2015 were to continue until 2050 multi layer perceptron mlp neural network was used to relate lulc and drivers of change table 3 for the simulation the pixels of each lulc class were randomly divided between training 50 and testing samples 50 testing samples allowed for the results to be validated models were run several times to reach accuracy rates greater than 50 for each transition a cramer s v test cramér 1946 was applied to the set of drivers of change to analyze multicollinearity issues among variables the expected quantity of change and competitive land allocation based on the 1998 2008 maps sequence for a future date 2015 in this study was estimated using a markov matrix this calibration process compared the number of pixels and the spatial location of each lulc class in both maps after discrepancy was checked the model was run up to 2050 obtaining lulc simulated maps for the four sites 3 2 2 climate change scenarios the average projected precipitation and temperature for each year of the 20 year time period 2041 2060 were obtained from the regional climate change projections for spain developed in the second phase of the national plan for climate change adaptation escenarios pnacc 2017 http escenarios adaptecca es in particular we have considered the simulation corresponding to the regional climate model knmi racmo22e v1 driven by the global climate model ichec ec earth r1i1p1 from the european branch of the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex https cordex org giorgi et al 2009 jacob et al 2014 in particular the eur 11 cordex domain was used finally the business as usual rcp 8 5 experiment was used in order to maintain the coherence between the different components note that this regional model has shown good performance over the iberian peninsula kotlarsky et al 2019 herrera et al 2020 to obtain the future climatology at 1 km2 spatial resolution grid required for the fire occurrence model the climate change signal 12 km defined as the difference between the future 2041 2060 and historical 1981 2010 periods delta method was added to the observed climatology 1 km räisänen 2007 zahn and von storch 2010 bedia et al 2013 delta future historical projection climatology delta note that this is the simplest bias calibration method as it assumes an additive constant bias b of the model which is removed when those deltas are considered delta future historical future b historical b the interannual variability of the climatic variables was evaluated through t test equal means and f test equal variances comparing each year from 2041 to 2060 with 2050 centered year of the period where lulc projections were calculated in order to ensure the coherence at least up to some point between the different layers included in the model along the whole period 3 2 3 lfmc prediction due to the absence of future lfmc projections a comparison between present and future climate conditions was carried out lfmc interacts with rainfall air temperature or soil moisture qi et al 2012 dennison and moritz 2009 so the purpose of this comparison was to identify the year within the study period 2001 2010 most similar to year 2050 center of the 20 year period from 2041 to 2060 in terms of climatic conditions and to use its lfmc as the values for 2050 to this end the euclidean distance between the present and future spatial patterns of spring precipitation and spring and summer maximum temperatures was obtained for each year of the 2001 2010 study period considering the four regions together the distance was obtained considering each variable independently and their joint standardized version 3 2 4 statistical model for future wildfire occurrence future wildfire occurrence was obtained by applying the historical glm model for each study site using input data lulc maps climate data and lfmc projected up to the 20 year time period 2041 2060 centered on 2050 the factor analysis representing the climate and lfmc variables were translated into the coefficients thereof to be applied to this new dataset using the following relationship 2 f i u i 1 x 1 u i 2 x i 2 u i k x k where f i is the i th factor scores u i j are the components of the eigenvectors then the model can be expressed as 3 b 1 u 1 1 x 1 u 1 2 x 1 2 u 1 k x k b k u k 1 x 1 u k 2 x k 2 u k k x k thus the future model is as follows 4 x j i 1 k b i u i j projected probability values were obtained for each year from 2041 to 2060 moreover the mean and the standard deviation of these probability values of the 20 years of the period were calculated to explore the projected values and its uncertainty maps of 20 year 2041 2060 wildfire occurrence probability were finally obtained for each study site at 1 km2 target resolution 4 results 4 1 baseline wildfire occurrence 4 1 1 explanatory and response variables fig 4 shows the lulc interfaces derived from cci lc 2005 the extent and spatial distribution differed among sites fai dominated in all regions fgi presence was also notable in ourense fig 4a cells covered by wui were also crucial in all study sites except zamora fig 4b seasonal climate related variables within the baseline modelling for the 2001 2010 period included for the factor analysis showed differences among the years of the study period illustrating then the expected variability there were also differences among the regions corresponding to differences in the base climate conditions used figures a1 a2 and a3 for zamora and madrid data at 1 km2 grid resolution were calculated through downscaling processes explained in section 3 1 1 in contrast for ourense and valencia safran database was downscaled from 5 km2 to 1 km2 grid resolution spring and summer lfmc also showed differences over the 2001 2010 period among the regions and within them in the space figure a4 fig 5 shows the wildfire occurrence maps for the study sites as presence absence of the ignition of a fire response variable 4 1 2 modelled wildfire occurrence the first three factors explained more than 80 of the variance in all sites table 4 the first factor was positively and strongly related with spring and summer maximum temperature in all sites except for valencia where the effect was also positive but with lesser influence spring lfmc presented stronger effect followed by summer lfmc the second factor was determined by lfmc spring lfmc in zamora and madrid summer lfmc in ourense but with a weaker effect in the valencian site where spring maximum temperature had a more significant impact finally the third factor was determined either by spring precipitation ourense and valencia or summer lfmc zamora and madrid lulc interfaces aspect and the obtained climate lfmc factors were included as variables to model baseline wildfire occurrence table 5 the significant selected variables varied by each site aspect was not significant in any of the studied sites zfgi was only significant in ourense the other two lulc standardized interfaces zfai and zwui were significant for all sites except for ourense where zfgi was of importance the exponentiated coefficient values exp β indicated the effect on the increase of a wildfire occurrence for example the exp β 1 475 shown in zfgi for ourense indicated that for a one unit increase in zfgi in ourense and where the other variables remained constant the probability of a wildfire multiplied by 1 47 an increase in the odds of a wildfire occurring of about 47 in all sites lulc interfaces had exp β values that were greater than 1 meaning an increase in the odds zfgi was the most influential variable in ourense and zwui and zfai were second most important in madrid valencia and zamora the significance and effects of the combined lfmc and climate related variables factor variables differed depending on the site for madrid and valencia the factor mainly determined by the maximum temperature in spring or summer increased the probability of wildfire occurrence where the other variables remained constant on the contrary a decrease in the odds of a wildfire occurrence exp β 1 was due to the factor mainly determined by the spring precipitation in ourense and valencia and by lfmc mostly spring in zamora however maximum temperature determined the factor in two sites ourense and zamora decreasing the probability of a wildfire in contrast the factor determined by lfmc increased the odds of a wildfire madrid and valencia there were differences in the spatial distribution of the predicted probabilities within each of the sites fig 6 however probability distribution values were similar except for madrid fig 6c where medium values covered most of the site 4 2 future wildfire occurrence 4 2 1 lulc scenarios and derived interfaces 2050 lulc bau scenarios were assessed during the calibration processes by comparing the 2015 predicted map with the actual 2015 map for all study sites the total agreement was 96 looking at the results by class agricultural and forest classes presented the greatest accuracy 90 while errors of commission and omission differed for each site in general lulc classes were adequately predicted except for the urban class which presented both errors of omission 27 and 12 for zamora and madrid respectively and commission 46 17 and 23 in zamora madrid and valencia respectively agriculture in ourense site had an error of commission of 13 bau scenarios showed if the trends in lulc changes continued as observed between 1998 and 2008 the more settled urban sites madrid and valencia experienced urban development nearby the large cities peri urban areas road networks and along the coast in the case of valencia great road accessibility due to high road density in these areas played a role in projected urban development urban grew 27 and 73 in madrid and valencia respectively land abandonment was reflected in these sites in the decreased percentage of agriculture 50 and 14 decreases respectively where were mainly replaced by urban both in madrid and in valencia shrubland decreased and in valencia shrubland were converted into forest encroachment process forest class increased to 60 but the greatest increase was notably in the grassland 100 in both sites too on the other hand in the more rural oriented sites zamora and ourense the lulc tendency showed two different situations in zamora land abandonment was reflected in the decreased agriculture class 22 and increased shrubland and grassland 20 and 73 respectively agriculture was replaced by forest lands however in ourense the tendency showed an increase in an agriculture class which continued in the projected lulc 2050 map being 58 larger in this site there will be less forest and mostly shrubland classes forestlands will be replaced by agriculture and there will be an increase in the urban areas nearby the existing ones the maps of changes between real 2015 and simulated 2050 maps are available in the supplementary material figure a5 lulc 2050 simulated maps controlled the changes in the extension and location of the 2050 lulc interfaces foreseen growth in grassland class in three sites madrid zamora and valencia notably increased fgi table 6 in madrid the projected growth in settlement class also increased wui 17 but not in the case of valencia where wui decreased by 56 even if projected forest lands increased in valencia shrubland declined and this class belonged to forest class when calculating lulc interfaces see section 3 1 1 a lesser amount of shrubland influenced the reduced contact between urban areas and forest in this site the reduction in projected agriculture class affected the decrease of fai in all sites even in ourense but to a lesser extent 4 2 2 climate change scenarios and projected lfmc climate variables precipitation and maximum temperature were projected to the 20 year time period 2041 2060 to the 1 km2 target then spring precipitation spring and summer maximum temperature were extracted the interannual variability of the climatic variables showed significant differences among years but retained the spatial pattern and gradients which were important due to their interaction with the rest of the variables interfaces aspect and lfmc spring precipitation decreased in 2041 2060 while maximum temperatures increased at all sites fig 7 the projected resolution differed given the different source of climate based variables used 1 km2 in the case of zamora and madrid and 5 km2 for ourense and valencia concerning lfmc the year 2005 was identified as the year more similar to projected year 2050 center of the 20 year period from 2041 to 2060 climate conditions in all sites and thus the lfmc for this year epoch was considered input for the future wildfire prediction model fig 8 seasonal differences can be noted within each site in ourense summer values were higher than spring values due to the influence of higher lfmc in the months of june and july in the summer average and lower in march and april in the spring average see figure a4 an agricultural patch located in the south of ourense presented a diverse behavior by season depending on the year of the 2001 2010 time series but dominating lower lfmc values in spring than in summer also some forested areas located in the north of ourense presented lower lfmc values in spring than in summer 4 2 3 projected wildfire occurrence projected wildfire occurrences for each year from 2041 to 2060 showed a similar pattern to the one estimated for the year 2050 which indicated the large contribution of the non climate variables to the proposed model the mean and the standard deviation of the 20 years period reflected a similar projected pattern and regarding the level of uncertainty given by the standard deviation cells with high projected wildfire 0 9 1 probability values retained at least intermediate values 0 7 in addition cells with intermediate projected wildfire were around the mean probability values see figure a6 projected wildfire occurrence would increase in 19 73 of the 1 km2 grid cells depending on the analyzed site and decrease in 26 80 table 7 in one site zamora cells with an increase in projected wildfire occurrence were greater than the baseline model in the other sites the percentage of cells that saw a decrease in projected wildfire occurrence outnumbered those that saw an increase in zamora fig 9 b and madrid fig 9c projected wildfire probability increases in two standard deviations were notable in the areas where the projected wildfire probability was expected to increase while in ourense and valencia the increases were mostly within one standard deviation in general in zamora and in madrid the probability of a wildfire occurring increased in 2041 2060 for areas where the baseline wildfire probability was higher fig 6 however in ourense and valencia this probability increased in areas where the wildfire probability baseline was intermediate or low moreover in ourense projected wildfire probability decreases in some areas where the baseline probability foreseen intermediate values 5 discussion this paper concludes that both lulc and climate changes will have an effect and drive future wildfire probability of occurrence drivers of change and resulting probability will vary across and within the analyzed sites projected wildfire probability will increase by target 1 km2 grid cells mostly in zamora site where the percentage of cells with an increase will be larger than the percentage of cells with a decrease also in this site and in madrid higher projected values occurred where it was expected a higher increase on one hand the strength and characteristics of the relationships among lulc interfaces aspect climate and lfmc established in the baseline predictive models will determine future projected probability on the other hand the relative importance of drivers was different depending on the site but at the same time showed several key common points for instance wildfire occurrence probability increased because of lulc interfaces effect however their specific influence depended on the site wui presented a larger effect in the urban developed sites madrid and valencia while fai in the rural oriented sites zamora and ourense as well as fgi in ourense this result is consistent with other studies done in spain obtaining similar effects in distinguishing drivers that lead to wildfire occurrence in rural fai influence and urban wui influence areas martínez et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2016 consequently our results entail considerations for management actions e g ignition prevention efforts may be most effective if actions are concentrated on these specific lulc interfaces nonetheless wui was not significant in ourense as found in previous research chas amil et al 2013 cci lc lulc 300 m of spatial resolution was used as the lulc data source this data source was considered appropriate for modelling wildfire at the site al level vilar et al 2019 however in orense the urban development structure is small and scattered balsa barreiro and hermosilla 2013 according to roy chowdhury et al 2018 for urban development studies cci lc does not detect the location of fringe areas as essential components of the urban settlement category because wui is defined as the contact area between urban and forest covers further work would be needed to categorize the urban category in these particular situations factor effects on predicted probability were diverse by site as expected for areas located in the mediterranean basin koutsias et al 2013 verdú et al 2012 the maximum temperature increased the predicted probability in two sites madrid and valencia moreover spring precipitation in ourense and madrid and lfmc in zamora decreased the probability of a wildfire consistent with previous research in mediterranean fire prone areas less rainfall in spring has been analyzed as a contributor to increased wildfire occurrence in valencia and morocco chergui et al 2018 also antecedent rainfall has been shown to have a relation with the threshold where lfmc declines and thus fires start in california dennison and moritz 2009 therefore more rain will delay the timing of this critical threshold and thus might be decreasing subsequent wildfires however the relationship between temperature and wildfire occurrence for the two rural sites ourense and zamora contradicted expectations maximum temperature decreased wildfire occurrence nevertheless the baseline model showed that the temperature effect was compensated by spring precipitation or lfmc and factors determined by these variables decreased wildfire probability the resulting probability maps varied within the analyzed sites due to differences in relationships among drivers and response variable in the case of the madrid mid probability values were more abundant within its area and greater wildfire probability values were not spatial concentrated in the same cells as in previous papers vilar et al 2016b however vilar et al 2016a only included human related factors as explanatory variables studies of historical fire prediction in mediterranean areas using climate and land cover or human related variables have shown differences in the strength that climate variables have in the control of estimated wildfire occurrence duane et al 2015 padilla and vega garcía 2011 verdú et al 2012 future projected wildfire will depend on the obtained baseline current conditions and also on nature and the degree of change in climate and lulc among other concerns lulc change scenario projection depends on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the data used for the simulation martínez vega et al 2017 cci lc available for every year since 1992 was chosen as the lulc data source as it was considered a standard source of information because of the global availability thereof allowing studies to be replicated in other sites nonetheless other studies in crop monitoring pérez hoyos et al 2017 revealed this source led to the overestimation of the agriculture class finding improvements in newer versions of the product 2015 this issue could have consequences in the amount of derived fai that is calculated and estimated the time points chosen for the analysis 1998 and 2008 happened after the more important land abandonment process that mainly occurred in the 1950s 1960s geri et al 2010 still this change continued in the selected period and was reflected in the resulting general decline in agriculture except for the ourense site complementary explanatory variables could have improved the modelling of some of the lulc changes such as future information on the road network for the projected centered year 2050 acceptable overall accuracies were obtained in the validation of the bau scenarios but there were misclassification results mostly for the urban class this can be explained by the fact that this category represented a small percentage of the total area of the sites but a high percentage of change mostly in the most developed urban sites gallardo et al 2015 also even the good accuracy results found for the agriculture category in ourense presented an error of commission of 13 this in turn increased this class contrary to the expected general trend of land abandonment projected lulc was used as the data source for lulc interfaces calculation so a detailed analysis of the accuracy in the location of the new lulc was desired this could be improved by calculating quantity and allocation disagreements which include exchange and shift components pontius jr and santacruz 2014 in addition to lulc projected changes future climate scenarios calculated provided data at 1 km2 target resolution the method applied to obtain the future climatology at 1 km delta difference of bedia et al 2013 assumes a constant bias which is removed when the deltas are considered this process has been satisfactorily applied in madrid and zamora sites where historical climate data was able to be calculated at 1 km2 nonetheless good results were also obtained by using safran data at 5 km2 resolution this method could be replicated for other sites if observed historical data are available as a reference according to moriondo et al 2006 the use of regional circulation models rcms allows reproducing fine scale features of different climates making rcms more reliable for climate change impact analysis and fire risk studies in general future wildfire probability will increase at least in two sites zamora and madrid in areas where the expected baseline probability was high consistent with projections made with the inclusion of the human factor in fire prone areas gallardo et al 2015 liu et al 2012 syphard et al 2018 bryant and westerling 2014 westerling et al 2011 however two other sites ourense and valencia showed fewer cells where the wildfire probability would increase also projected wildfire probability decreased in cells where the expected baseline probability was intermediate or low this was due to the less future fgi ourense fai and wui valencia thus reducing the probability of a wildfire and also due to the effects contrary as expected of the reduction in the spring precipitation or an increase in the spring maximum temperature that will reduce the probability of a wildfire other papers also found that climate change was not always dominant in explaining future wildfire changes syphard et al 2019 the modelling framework applied in this paper for regional wildfire future predictions allowed for the establishment of a statistically based wildfire occurrence baseline which showed human climate lfmc driving relationships and strengths said baseline detected regional differences between studied zones in the estimated and the spatial distribution probability of wildfires the dataset used referred to 1 km2 target resolution based on detailed gridded spatial data such as cci lc 300 m climate 1 5 km lfmc 500 m and aspect 200 m in future works these methods can be extended and replicated in other study sites as they have been separately widely applied and proven to provide accurate wildfire estimations in other areas also lulc cci lc and remote sensing data used to derive lfmc are available elsewhere nonetheless some limitations can be found for a wider application well observed climate data are needed to proceed to the downscaling process at 1 km2 also combined climate and lfmc factors are not always easy to interpret and can cover the specific effect of each variable moreover projected lfmc was approximated by analyzing climate current and future conditions as no future field or remote sensing data were available for estimating lfmc further work is needed to find a way to forecast lfmc furthermore even though the non climatic variables largely contributed to the future wildfire occurrence those were projected to a single year centered on the 20 year climate projections which can limit the proposed modelling framework lulc projections can be calculated for more than one target year if considering different past periods of change this could contribute to enrich the projected wildfire occurrence within the 20 year climatic projected period and future work will consider a multi year lulc projections framework 6 conclusions future wildfire projections will result from the complex interactions among diverse factors related to human activities lulc interfaces climate and fuel moisture content lfmc expected changes will produce an increase in wildfire occurrence in three out of four analyzed spanish sites indicating the existing variation in fire climate and land use effects by site lulc change projected scenarios properly simulated the conversion to natural vegetation and urban development resulting in lulc interfaces that will have specific effects on projected wildfire by site when taking management and planning actions considering climate change conditions and the lfmc future worst case scenario will also be important as well as lulc change consequences and therefore the human factor the modelling framework applied here can be replicated in other fire prone sites such as the lulc global cci lc product and remote sensing data used to derive lfmc are available elsewhere still having detailed observed climate data is necessary this paper showed the results for a specific climate change regional model and one emission scenario which must be extended considering an ensemble of climate change projections including several regional climate models and future scenarios as given by the representative concentration pathways rcps to properly quantify the uncertainty related to future projections also lulc change predictions might be improved by applying different lulc scenario pathways conservation economic crisis and considering multi year projections future wildfire predictions in fire prone and humanized areas at detailed spatial resolution and considering regional characteristics are useful for establishing mitigation measures for the future and can be useful to managers as a tool for planning actions to prevent wildfires declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

25728,air quality is a strong health driver its accurate assessment and forecast are important in densely populated megacities to take preventive steps we describe the first indian operational air quality framework safar system of air quality and weather forecasting and research meant for decision makers and a research tool with a capability of three days advance forecast in four indian megacities of distinct environment and topography the framework includes six different components from observations and modelling to outreach to evaluate the performance of the forecast we focus on particulate pollutants which largely define air quality of indian metropolis the model prediction skill is tested for the pilot year 2019 20 which is found to be reasonable the normalized gross error of pm2 5 for delhi is found to be highest 35 whereas for other cities it is 13 20 the model output statistics mos application enhanced operational forecast ability of numerical model which resulted in improving the accuracy for specific seasons winter graphical abstract image 1 keywords particulate matters air quality safar meteorology forecasting model megacities environment topography and health 1 introduction during past few decades human activities have changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere considerably at a local regional and global level causing several problems of global concern air pollution global warming climate change are a few of them the problem of air pollution has become serious in indian metropolitan cities after the economic liberalization india has become one of the world s fastest growing economies the economic and social development in india has been reflected in the rapidly growing industrialization urbanization increased transportation etc which on the other hand also contributed in increasing the emissions of air pollutants high levels of particulate matter concentrations impact human health balakrishnan et al 2019 and affect the radiative balance through direct and indirect effects seinfeld and pandis 2006 exposure to pm2 5 for prolonged periods can lead to serious health effects such as decreased lung function chronic bronchitis and premature mortality us epa 2005 2019 ground level ultra fine particulate matter pm2 5 particles having aerodynamic diameter 2 5 μm is the major concern in indian urban complexes and hence national ambient air quality standards naaqs have been set up for such pollutants in india like by many other countries throughout the world the level of pm2 5 routinely exceeds the 24 h standard of 60 μgm 3 established by the indian government moefcc 2015 pollution is largely added to the atmosphere by surface emissions from various sources including anthropogenic and natural emissions in addition to the emissions meteorological processes on various spatial and temporal scales strongly affect air quality the air quality may be affected by distance transport long to short range and local weather meteorological factors that may affect pm include temperature wind speed wind direction relative humidity rh high pressure system mixing height ventilation coefficient and atmospheric stability extreme weather events such as heatwaves droughts and air stagnation are particularly important when air pollutants accumulate over a relatively long time period during the event summer monsoon is an important feature for india and modulates the air quality through various weather processes climate change may directly affect air quality by modulating emission inventories and dispersion patterns understanding the impact of weather on air quality in a changing climate is extremely important as a prerequisite to any prediction system environmental monitoring and early warning system are the basics of long term development of environmental protection work to improve the quality of people s health and life the development of a robust accurate and simple air quality monitoring and early warning system is highly desirable such a system is also essential to effectively fulfil the requirement of a decision support system which includes various components from observations and predictive capabilities to disseminating strategy at a city level air quality event information in advance can assist the general public in coping with health and environmental problems and take more efficient counter measures schell et al 2001 air quality problem and forecasting capability is developed by quite a few developed countries but such systems are sparse in the developing world when india hosted the 19th commonwealth games in 2010 a need was felt to provide the air quality and weather information to around 8000 athletes from 71 commonwealth nations in indian capital megacity delhi as the air pollution is known to impact the performance of athletes shephard 1984 several controlled studies with athletes have shown that exercise while breathing elevated levels of air pollution which may have a direct impact on athletic performance rundell 2012 in order to address the pressing need and to provide better tools for decision makers the indian air quality forecasting framework known as safar system of air quality and weather forecasting and research has been developed for indian megacities safar is the indian government s first official operational air quality forecasting framework successfully conceived designed and developed by indian institute of tropical meteorology pune a constituent of indian ministry of earth sciences the safar project is also adopted as a pilot study of gurme world meteorological organization beig et al 2015 the safar is an early warning framework designed with an objective to predict air quality 3 days in advance along with weather parameters and translate data into information for the benefit to the society after the successful demonstration of safar project in delhi its usefulness to the common public and society became evident thereafter indian government decided to further expand it in three more major cities of india namely pune mumbai and ahmedabad in addition to understanding the scientific processes governing the day to day variability of air quality and weather parameters safar connects scientific outcome with society to increase preparedness amongst common citizens and help decision makers to reduce health risk associated with air pollution hazards since each of the four megacities represent a distinct micro environment and climatology it provided a challenge to forecasting models and an opportunity to understand different processes controlling the air quality in different environments the operational online chemistry transport model ctms with forecasting applications to multiple indian cities of different micro climate was non existent in india until safar was conceived this is mainly due to many difficulties major among them is the deficiency in the gridded emission inventory in absence of micro level activity data sahu et al 2011 in addition to this difficulties also arise in simulating meteorological fields over an area of complex geography with significant variabilities in weather parameters among different cities the objective of the current paper is to discuss the strategic framework of safar development which includes different components consisting of monitoring network emissions modelling forecasting and its validation and communication the ctms which are deterministic models can forecast air pollution concentrations but the accuracy of the forecast is highly affected by the quality of the emission data and the scale used the incomplete knowledge on the sources transport processes and atmospheric chemicals vara vela et al 2016 which have also been addressed in this paper to evaluate the forecasting performance of the safar model we have applied various statistical metrics the model output statistics mos is a type of statistical post processing a class of techniques used to improve numerical models ability to forecast glahn and lowry 1972 carter et al 1989 many forecasting systems around the globe apply the mos application to improve the operational forecasting perez et al 2015 developed the mos algorithm to enhance the air quality forecast in spain impact of data stratification on the efficiency of the mos methodology to a high resolution deterministic air quality forecast in poland is reported by struzewska et al 2016 a comprehensive discussion on improving the atmospheric chemistry forecast using mos application is provided by ma et al 2018 and references therein the safar framework also includes the mos application to test and improve the skill of air quality forecast the translating of the scientific data to information and its effective dissemination is a key to any air quality management system which is also addressed within safar framework 2 climatology of study region fig 1 shows the zoomed map of four indian megacities of india having distinct topography and micro climate anand et al 2019 the location of india in the global map is also depicted in fig 1 the major roads highways water resource forest cover build up land agriculture land slum areas power plants and industrial locations are marked in each city map delhi is officially known as the national capital territory nct it is a megacity of india containing new delhi the capital of india situated in the country s north at 28 61 n 77 23 e while the whole nct s population was about 17 million delhi s urban area is now considered to extend beyond the nct boundaries and include the neighboring satellite cities of ghaziabad faridabad gurgaon and noida in an area called the national capital region ncr and had an estimated 2016 population of over 26 million people making it the world s second largest urban area according to the united nations un report 2016 geographically delhi is a landlocked city that experiences very hot summers and severe winters and is located at an elevation of 216 m above sea level to cover an area of 1484 sq km the temperature may rise to about 47 c in summers and go down to about 2 c in winter the monsoon starts in late june and lasts until mid september with an average annual rainfall of approximately 886 mm winters are influenced by the western disturbances and cold winds from the himalayas making the winters chilly due to the proximity to the arabian sea mumbai has humid weather during monsoon season mumbai witnesses heavy rainfall mumbai is at an elevation of about 14 m above sea level and has a population of 12 million temperatures do not vary much throughout the year and it remains between 32 c and 40 c humidity is highest during the summer months and it records rainfall of 1800 mm the winds from the western side are the most noticeable feature of mumbai monsoons pune is located in the western ghats of sahyadri mountain range it is about 100 km inland from the western coast of india at 559 m above mean sea level with a population of approximately 9 million the climate of pune is mainly dry with a low latitude semi arid hot climate the city receives an annual rainfall of 722 mm mainly between june and september as a result of the southwest monsoon ahmedabad which is a city in the western state of gujarat has a tropical semiarid climate it is located at an elevation of about 53 m above mean sea level having a population of over 5 million the annual rainfall is about 700 mm this city experiences severe summers with temperatures varying between 24 c and 50 c winters are not very severe here and the temperature does not fall significantly in this study the seasonal variability in the particulate matter levels is considered by taking into account three major seasons namely summer february march april may monsoon june july august september and winter october november december january as per the observed climatology of tropical north western cities of india anand et al 2019 3 safar framework design and implementation this section introduces the strategic framework of safar and its interdisciplinary approach the process of developing such a framework is complex and involves round the clock measurements of various air quality and weather parameters analyzing the same with basic scientific knowledge improving forecasting capabilities with basic scientific research translating science to information products and disseminating the information in very simple and user friendly format so that maximum stakeholders including government agencies educational institutes common public can understand and use the same for their benefit ranging from safeguarding health to mitigation measures the data dissemination in an easy to understand format is ensured by adapting modern communication techniques the safar framework consists of six different components and integrates them 1 observational network air pollutants and weather parameters 2 quality assurance and quality control qa qc above parameters 3 emission inventory for accounting sources of pollutants 4 safar forecasting model establishment of high resolution air quality forecasting model 5 translating data to information concept of aqi 6 technological framework and outreach data management product generation and dissemination the safar data communication framework is shown in figure 2 it has two components namely the remote data transfer and master control centre all servers located in master control centre are connected physically with high speed internet lines the near real time online raw data of different pollutants along with weather parameters measured at various stations located in different locations of a city first saved in the data logger connected physically at each air quality monitoring station aqms represented as monitoring in the right side of fig 2 once stored locally data get transferred remotely through gprs 4g 5g network in to data server located at master control center the safar atmospheric chemistry transport model runs at supercomputer which is located in a different location within the campus and represented as modelling in the left side of fig 2 the model output of desired forecast data is remotely transferred to model data server located in the master control center now onwards all the functions are done in master control center both sets of data consisting of current and forecasted air quality and weather parameters the data is then checked for quality assurance and quality control qa qc as per protocol by expert operational team the mos application is applied here then the data is passed on to ftp master server the algorithm loaded at ftp master server converts this data received in physical units into indian national air quality index aqi and other related parameters in easy to understand format safar products are generated and stored at ftp master server which has the responsibility to channel the data to various disseminating servers like display server web server and cloud servers from where the system products get disseminated to the society via wireless communication network we will discuss each component of safar framework in the subsequent sub section below 3 1 observations network the safar framework consists of more than 40 monitoring stations in four safar cities with nearly 100 monitoring instruments each city network includes 10 air quality monitoring stations aqms which have online analysers that are us epa approved distributed in different microenvironments viz downtown area background industrialized area residential area traffic areas etc in such a way that they cover the whole city and the average can be representative of the city as per wmo guidelines grimmond et al 2014 srinivas et al 2016 beig et al 2015 the automatic weather stations aws to measure different meteorological parameters are collocated with each aqms observational network in the urban complex is required to get near real time air quality and weather data over the strategic locations which can be then used for improving forecast and its validation urban areas are complex and shows variation at micro scale wmo has set up standard guidelines to establish air quality and weather monitoring stations in urban areas wmo 2008 2014 grimmond et al 2014 which get updated from time to time as per the guidelines strategic selection of monitoring stations and their density is needed based on the range of applications and the nature of the variability of the city to develop a forecast system for air quality and weather stations should cover all kinds of land uses e g highly dense urban residential industrial suburban catchments downwind and upwind areas so that it could be representative of an urban cluster megacity bieringer et al 2013 grimmond et al 2014 which has been adopted in this work selecting the density of monitoring station can be decided based on the availability of resources in addition to the installation of instruments to find out prevailing surface characteristics safar framework adopts standard operating procedure sop for robust quality control quality check qa qc to ensure good data quality which is discussed in subsequent section the air quality indicators and weather parameters are monitored round the clock the data is recorded and stored at every 5 min interval at local station air quality observation includes many parameters including pm10 pm2 5 on which current work is focussed the measurements of fine particulate matter pm2 5 in micrograms per cubic meter μg m³ were carried out with the help of beta attenuation monitor bam 1020 during the study period in bam 1020 carbon 14 14c element is used as a radioactive source which gives a constant source of high energy electrons are well known as beta rays and these particles are detected and counted by a scintillation detector low energy beta rays are absorbed by collision with electrons whose number is proportional to the density therefore absorption is a function of the mass of the irradiated material the external pump pulls a measured amount of air sample dust laden afterwards the filter tape weighed down with dust is automatically placed between the source and the detector the attenuation of the beta particle signal is used to determine the mass concentration of aerosols collected on the filter tape the extensive details of the bam 1020 are reported in our previous studies beig et al 2020a yadav et al 2017 bam 1020 measures the mass concentration of particulate matters which can measure up to 10 000 μg m³ with a lower detection limit of 1 μg m³ the span calibration of the instrument is automatically verified on an hourly basis anand et al 2019 yadav et al 2019 the data has been collected for one year during 2019 20 covering all seasons and the 24 h mean of pm2 5 has been computed the meteorological parameters such as wind speed km hr 1 relative humidity and temperature c have been measured using the automatic weather stations anand et al 2019 this near real time online raw data is then transferred to central aqms server at safar control centre remotely at every 15 min interval which is a central data base where data has been validated by expert scientific team fig 2 the data is subsequently averaged to 1 h interval 3 2 quality assurance and quality control qa qc quality control and quality assurance qa qc is the major and essential step in the operational safar early warning framework not only in monitoring instruments but also at each step this need to be performed rigorously before disseminating data the instruments are maintained and operated according to the standard specifications of supplier all air quality and weather monitors need to be operated continuously 24 7 hr for the purpose following operational protocol has been developed to ensure qa qc a based on drift specification instrument environment and other factors the calibration is done at definite time interval for all the analyzers and sensors a software will record and store data at every 5 min interval at local station with wired connectivity in data acquisition system b near real time online raw data get transferred from respective aqms stations to central aqms server remotely at every 15 min interval which will act as a central data base c as part of qa qc we developed an sop at central aqms server to give alert for 1 instrument failure at site 2 communication failure between instrument and local server and 3 communication failure between local server and central aqms server this sop is adopted to prevent data loss and solve the problems with minimum time lag d the data validation is an essential function of technical management at safar control room errors or suspicious data which are flagged by the system is checked and corrected by expert scientific team various quality codes are set to observational values based on information relating to the state of the sensor or measurement the invalid or out of range data is carefully checked and if found spurious it is discarded for subsequent analysis after validation the data is subsequently averaged to 1 h 24 h 8 h based on type of pollutant and aqi formulation requirement on rolling average basis for each hour e technical review and audit review and audit is an integral part of the system field engineers visit the stations on daily basis and perform check to ensure the instruments are working properly field engineers are responsible for reporting the daily status of instrument health to control and command centre on monthly basis review meeting is conducted and monthly audits are performed in which instrument health as well as documentation has been checked by internal auditors consist of safar scientific team members 3 3 emission inventory emission inventory is a key factor in determining the accuracy of air quality modelling results gao et al 2016 it is a fundamental tool to identify all sources of pollutants and its magnitude during a particular time and geographic region which requires both primary activity data collected from field surveys as well as secondary activity data collected from various authentic sources activity data is defined as the quantitative measure of the activity that results in the emissions of air pollutants different kinds of activities are related to a particular source of emission whose extend and intensity determines the strength of emission and it varies from place to place hence there is a need to identify different activities going on in the region which are responsible for the emission of varieties of air pollutants and find out the intensity of those to be able to quantify the emissions to make the present inventory more accurate and robust a large number of site specific primary data has been generated and at the same time all available secondary data sets have been collected from all possible authentic sources for the selected air pollution sources in the region the gridded emission inventory for these 4 safar cities has been developed recently by us and methodology is reported in detail elsewhere beig et al 2018 2019 sahu et al 2011 and hence only briefly discussed in this paper building out a technological emission inventory involves various distinctive major and minor sources of emission during the development of such inventory the first step includes the recognition of each source and the second step consists of the distribution of emission geographically in grids a bottom up approach has been taken to develop a high resolution gridded emission inventory with the well established methodology discussed earlier sahu et al 2015 then the generated data are applied to country specific technological emission factors to estimate the total emission beig et al 2018 huang et al 2018 filonchyk and hurynovich 2020 sahu et al 2011 2015 2017 the activity data for 16 major minor sectors are targeted which was rearranged into six major categories namely transport power industry residential windblown dust re suspended dust and rest others includes many unattended sources like brick kiln crematorium etc an emission factor efs is a representative value that attempts to relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the atmosphere with a particular activity associated with the release of that pollutant typically efs of a fuel depends on the chemical composition of the fuel combustion type temperature and efficiency of any emission control device there are very limited measured efs available in the literature for india incorporating a country specific appropriate ef is a very sensitive part in the development of emission inventory ef defines the source strength as emission per unit time and per unit activity of the process the emission factors based on the technological fuel type have been used to estimate bottom up emissions from each sector a geographic information system gis organises air quality data from a variety of sources in a uniform framework which will not only improve accuracy but also play vital role in data management the emission values from different sources are also organized as a set of thematic layers where the gis based statistical methodology is adopted to prepare gridded emission inventories of particulate matter pm2 5 and pm10 with 1 67 km resolution uncertainty in emission inventory emission inventory is an important input to the air quality forecasting model and hence accuracy of air quality forecast depends on the reliability of emission calculations performed in the emission inventory development in this case it is necessary to identify and estimate uncertainties associated with emission inventories to help modelers to consider the factor while running the forecast models estimating the uncertainty of an emission value is often a more difficult task than estimating the emission value placet et al 2000 quantifying the uncertainties is not an easy task as it requires continuous monitoring of emissions at the source point which is not practical in real conditions till date no such systematic approach for the identification of uncertainty is available as a result the calculated emissions cannot be exactly validated however uncertainties associated with the estimation can roughly be considered following are the factors which account for uncertainty in the emission estimates 1 emission factors 2 activity data 3 spatial distribution of emission 4 source category specification 5 missing data leads to approximation 6 poor understanding of emitting processes 7 uncertainty in efficiency of control equipment s 8 reporting error 9 inaccuracy in gridding process 10 geographical data to allocate emission etc most of occasion there is a considerable uncertainty introduced during inventory development process uncertainty in emission inventory is a function of the uncertainty in input data mainly related to activity data both primary secondary and emission factors a monte carlo analysis is widely used for detailed category by category assessment of uncertainty particularly where uncertainties are not distributed normally present uncertainty analysis is done by incorporating the above mentioned two critical factors in the present work an attempt has been made to collect city specific micro level activity data to reduce uncertainties associated with the data however missing data can lead to certain assumptions and also dependency on available secondary data for certain sectors may lead to uncertainty in the present work monte carlo analysis can be performed at the category level for aggregations of categories or for the inventory as a whole calculation of error propagation is done by critically following the step and by accommodating different past studies for a better comparison and accuracy in analysis the past studies smith et al 2000 gurjar et al 2004 arora et al 2014 are taken into account combined uncertainty is calculated by considering both the emission factor as well as activity data uncertainty the process then repeated for sectoral emissions for different years and the differences between these for the total and any sectors of interest we have adopted region specific emission factors variability in processes producing emissions variation in environmental factors e g temperature humidity etc methods and assumptions used to fill in knowledge gaps about emissions processes and estimated the error of the order of around 25 30 windblown road dust being exceptional concerning particulate matter emission only and is one of the vital contributors to the particulate matter emission having an uncertainty of 30 41 for rest of the pollutants the domestic source which comprises of several fuels including lpg wood kerosene and cow dung i e residential sector shows the largest uncertainty with maximum being 15 25 the activity data collected through field campaign is vital in reducing the uncertainty the most complicated uncertainty estimation calculation was for the transport sector as it involves fuel specific vehicles category which have emission factors according to the age of vehicles hence calculating the uncertainty percentage for emission factor involved critical review of older studies as well the maximum uncertainty estimated for transport sector was 20 35 later accompanies the industrial and power plant sector with uncertainty of 25 32 individually the other sector which comprises of several minor sources showed an uncertainty of 22 45 it is pertinent to mention here that the magnitude of the uncertainty in found to be much higher in majority of the earlier work saikawa et al 2017 3 4 safar air quality forecasting model numerous types of models are available for meteorological and chemical transport modelling these models can be configured according to the desired specifications several models can be combined together for better forecasting and analysis the wrf chem is the most widely used community mesoscale numerical weather model in which a meteorological module is coupled on line with a chemistry module grell et al 2005 this chemistry module consists of various gaseous aerosol and aqueous chemistry processes to represent atmospheric chemistry occurring in the troposphere and stratosphere andrade et al 2015 being a community model different chemistry modules get updated as more and more validation studies are conducted wrf chem features two dynamical cores a data assimilation system and a software architecture facilitating parallel computation and system extensibility the model serves a wide range of meteorological applications across scales from tens of meters to thousands of kilometres wrf offers a flexible and computationally efficient platform for operational forecasting while providing advances in physics numeric and data assimilation contributed by developers in the broader research community the chemistry of chemical species is fully coupled with the dynamical calculations in the model so that the transport scheme emissions mixing horizontal and vertical grids chemical transformation of trace gases aerosols and the physics schemes for subgrid scale transport are the same for both meteorological and chemical components at each time step the indian safar forecasting framework discussed in this work is based on wrf chem weather research and forecast with chemistry model version 3 9 powers et al 2017 grell et al 2005 which provides three day forecasts for important pollutants in delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune safar framework is conceived based on the following three fundamental key components which largely govern the air quality in indian megacities namely 1 local emissions 2 local weather and 3 long to short range transport with distance weather in addition when occasional episodic extreme external pumping coincides with favourable weather it leads to environmental emergency dust storm stubble burning huge forest fire falls under episodic external sources all 3 basic processes are highly coupled with each other and status of air quality cannot be understood in isolation by ignoring one over other a schematic flow diagram for safar air quality forecasting model for indian metropolis is shown in fig 3 where components of meteorology and chemistry are shown in 2 independent boxes under the heading wrf and chem respectively in fig 3 this modelling framework uses a combination of meteorological fields topography data land use land cover data initial and lateral boundary conditions and emission module etc as shown at both ends of fig 3 the spatial representation of emission at city scale 1 67 km was built using the detailed activity data and emission factors using bottom up approach to construct the gridded emission inventory beig et al 2018 2020b sahu et al 2011 discussed in the previous section the results for online simulation for the period from february 1 2019 to january 31 2020 are presented here to cover all 3 seasons of india we have run the model for 80 h in forecasting mode for the reported period and the model output used is forecast for the 3rd day i e valid at 72 h model configuration an accurate representation of physical dynamical chemical processes and their interaction at a fine scale is important to the accurate predictions of meteorology and air quality the use of nesting enables the simulation of feedbacks among various meteorological and chemical processes occurring at various temporal and spatial scales as shown in fig 3 some studies have shown that using nested domains can lead to more accurate predictions of chemical species grell et al 2005 fast et al 2006 the present system uses 2 way nesting which involves feedback from the fine domain to the coarse domain and vice versa we have set 4 nested domains for each city the grid resolution for outermost domain 1 is taken as 45 km 45 km it is considered as 15 km 15 km for domain 2 and 5 km 5 km for domain 3 the grid size of inner most domain 4 was 1 67 1 67 km two outermost domains 1 and 2 which cover parts of europe and asia extends from 10 6 s 56 5 n in the north south direction and 31 e to 120 e in an east west direction with 195 w e x 173 n s grid cells and india stretching from 55 4 e to 95 e 258 grid cells and 2 7 n to 55 4 n 270 grid cells are common for safar forecasting set up of four cities while the 3rd domain for ahmedabad mumbai and pune covers west india 300 324 grid cells in w e and n s direction it covers north india 273 258 grid cells for delhi to take account of regional pollution from indo gangetic plain igp region the innermost domain 4 for delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune contained 69 75 69 75 72 72 and 72 72 grid points in w e and n s direction the centre latitude and longitude are 23 14⁰n and 75 44⁰e respectively the model projection is mercator the relaxation zones are within the grid point sizes although grid point sizes are small total 32 vertical levels reaching to 50 hpa as model top have been used for all domains typically 8 12 levels are there within boundary layer during day time this can represent the vertical structure in daytime the vertical resolution is 100 m for model vertical levels below 500 m 200 m for model height in between 500 m 1km 500 m for model height between 1 and 3 km and 1 km for model height between 5 and 20 km this configuration works well as can be seen in our previous publications for non rainy seasons chen et al 2020 srinivas et al 2016 beig et al 2015 for monsoon season the vertical levels are increased for better vertical resolution of cloud related fields e g cloud water water vapor etc when there is high turbulence and vertical shear overall vertical levels are increased to properly represent pollutant dispersion the model has a lot of in built physical parameterization options to choose from although for a particular chemical scheme we cannot use every physics scheme we have used the parameterization which showed optimal performance different physical parameterization used for set up has been shown in table s1 we have used cbmz mosaic 4 bin chemistry scheme consisting of carbon bond mechanism version z cbmz gas phase mechanism which contains 73 chemical species and 237 reactions and mosaic model for simulating aerosol interactions and chemistry zaveri et al 2008 aerosol scheme that uses 4 sectional bins where 3 bins are assigned for aerosols of diameter less than 2 5 μm and other bin describing the size range 2 5 10 μm the mosaic scheme describes the chemistry of sea salt sodium potassium and chloride ions soil lumped inorganics secondary inorganic aerosols nitrate sulphate and ammonium ions and carbonaceous aerosols organic carbon and black carbon and equilibrium between water vapor 4 inorganic trace gases nh3 h2so4 hno3 and hcl with inorganic ions nitrate sulphate and ammonium and chloride initial and boundary conditions long range transport plays a key role on pollutant concentration along with emissions within the region therefore to consider the influence outside the regions lateral boundary conditions from the global model were used the initial and boundary conditions for meteorological parameters are taken from ncep gfs national centre for environmental prediction global forecast system discussed elsewhere https www emc ncep noaa gov emc pages numerical forecast systems gfs php which provides

ozone profiles etc the meteorological ic bc is processed using wrf pre processing system wps as shown in fig 3 the snow cover is processed from ic in our domains during model initialization using wps we have used model simulated chemical parameters from previous days run as the chemical initial condition for the next day the boundary condition for gaseous and aerosol parameters was taken from waccm whole atmosphere community climate model https www acom ucar edu waccm download shtml marsh et al 2013 and references therein with model output having a horizontal resolution 0 9 1 25 https www2

polar ncep noaa gov sst rtg high res at a resolution of 0 083 0 083 meteorological data and forecasting the ground level concentration of pollutants varies depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions at that time meteorological conditions are the prime factors that determine the dilution rate and dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere therefore meteorological data are essential for air quality forecasting it aids in interpreting spatial and temporal variations of measured air quality data they are also necessary inputs for dispersion model calculations of pollution concentrations the chemical processes such as dust emission fire emission and biogenic emission are dependent on the simulated meteorological parameters such as vertical profiles of wind temperature and relative humidity at each scale the land use canopy and topographical effects are included to realize the regional synoptic meteorological conditions for the finer scales the urban canopy and anthropogenic heat island could also be introduced if necessary the final outputs for each domain are available at 1 h temporal resolution with provision to only use the gridded fields for chemical transport modelling but also to extract the data for either city grids at a regional scale and points of interest at finer resolutions urban scale the urban parameterization is an important aspect for megacities currently we are using default bulk parameterization for urban canopy in wrf chem with detailed land use data at city level we have the provision to use single layer urban canopy model cities are characterized by different physical properties of surface compared to their rural counterparts resulting in a specific regime of the meteorological phenomenon hence to assess the impact of cities on climate inclusion of the urban parameterization is important in high resolution modelling as halenka et al 2019 have detected the urban heat island effect karlicky et al 2018 have evaluated the impact of typical urban surfaces on the central european urban climate in several model simulations performed with the wrf model and regional climate model regcm together with different descriptions of the urban environment they have found that the urban environment improves the weather conditions a little with regard to the pollutant dispersion which could lead to the partly decreased concentration of the primary pollutants with the exception of the daytime in the summer however it may be stressed that only the concentration of primary pollutants can be decreased by urban effects and not the secondary pollutants that are created in the atmosphere huszár et al 2018 however from below 10 km bulk schemes can reproduce parameters like urban heat island but are unlikely to resolve the mixing height or effects on wind at a finer resolution and likely to affect results this is one of the weaknesses in the current model set up lin microphysics which provides water cloud variables in resolved scale has been used in the present framework this scheme is well validated for cloud permitting scale 5 km wang et al 2009 feedback from parameterized convection to the atmospheric radiation and the photolysis schemes is done in coupled online mode in the model in the resolved scale but not below 5 km feedback from the aerosols to the radiation schemes is allowed in all the scale with use of ucm even at single level improve urban heat fluxes evapotranspiration at high resolution city level additionally we can use multi layer urban canopy model e g bep which helps in getting vertically resolved wind and temperature fields but due to high computational and city level build road etc data requirement for multilayer ucms we do not use it in forecasting mode as done by most of other city scale forecasting models with a resolution in the order of 1 km or above the ucms incorporate the subgrid scale physical processes of the urban environment using underlying heterogeneity of the urban surface the required surface parameters are challenging to be defined properly and improper setting hinders model performance grimmond et al 2011 the chemical parameters to simulate chemical parameters properly we provided the latest anthropogenic emissions for gases so2 nox nh3 co nmvoc and aerosol species bc oc pm2 5 pm10 from 5 sectors residential biomass burning power generation small scale industry transportation on land and water for 3 outer domains from edgar htap v4 3 crippa et al 2018 at a resolution of 0 1 0 1 we provided emission inventory for gases so2 nox co nmvoc and aerosol species bc oc pm2 5 pm10 for an additional sector of re suspended road dust at city scale at a horizontal resolution of 1 67 1 67 km for the innermost domain for four cities prepared in our research group as mentioned earlier we use utilities provided by ucar ncar https www2 acom ucar edu wrf chem wrf chem tools community along with some of the tools developed in collaboration during the inception of safar framework in 2010 marappu et al 2014 the emission for compounds from the biosphere is provided for each month using megan v2 01 model of emissions of gases and aerosols from nature which used a database for lai and land cover https bai ess uci edu megan and uses meteorological parameters such as solar radiation temperature and moisture from wrf during runtime the fire emissions during the stubble burning period in winter are taken from our recently developed dynamic emission inventory as discussed in detail elsewhere beig et al 2020b the fire emission for other period and regions were updated from fire inventory from ncar finn v1 5 wiedinmyer et al 2011 which provides emissions of aerosols and gases using a fixed diurnal profile for fire emission daily modis fire data at 1 km x 1 km resolution vegetation data from satellite observation to calculate the dry deposition the parameterization of wesely et al 1989 is used to calculate surface resistance for gases and aerosols except for sulphate for which parameterization of erisman et al 1994 is used challenges the safar faced number of challenges to account the processes with varied geography and topography of a particular city was one of the major challenges in developing safar framework in general open atmosphere that can be seen in central part of india is found to be favourable for the dispersion of pollutants while mumbai is blessed with sea on 3 sides which often send cleaner winds to balance city emission fury pune is located at higher altitude with greener cover and ahmedabad is surrounded by open dry land open geography promotes diffusion of pollutants and hence air pollution emergencies are less likely to occur in those cities not walled up by obstacles in contrast delhi is the landlocked city surrounded by unique geographical features likes himalayas and the thar desert because of extreme weather conditions in the region dispersion of pollutants becomes a major problem also external transport of pollutants due to certain weather conditions is common feature in delhi another challenge is accounting sources of air pollutants with unknown fluxes which are scattered around the city hence to make the forecast accurate one needs robust database of each and every air pollution source located in the city area and its geographical distribution over the region which is achieved to an extend but further high resolution databases are always desirable the model output statistics mos application enhanced operational forecast ability of numerical model was a challenge which resulted in improving the accuracy for specific seasons winter mos application to safar operational forecast to improve the skill and accuracy of forecast and to address the public information system adequately safar framework adopted the mos application for the operational probabilistic forecasting andrés pérez et al 2015 numerous studies have demonstrated the benefit of adjusting site specific air quality model predictions using observational data to reduce systematic model bias miller et al 2010 there are three reasons why statistical reinterpretation of dynamical numerical model output is useful for practical weather air quality forecasting a there are important differences between the real world and its representation in numerical models b the numerical models are often not complete and true representations of the workings of the atmosphere and their forecasts are subjected to errors and c the numerical models are deterministic where no randomness is involved in the development of future states of the system whereas practically the atmospheric environment do involve randomness the mos glahn and lowry 1972 carter et al 1989 is a type of statistical post processing a class of techniques used to improve numerical weather models ability to forecast by relating model outputs to observational or additional model data dennstaedt 2008 ecmwf 2014 and wilks 2006 https www weather gov mdl mos home mos is defined as an objective forecasting technique that consists of determining a statistical relationship between a predictant and variables forecast by a numerical model at some projection time it is in effect the determination of the weather air pollutant related statistics of a numerical model predictor points can come from either point observations or from data that has been calculated to points on a grid the mos products which are more heavily based on true observation points are referred to as station based mos while mos generated based on gridded data is called gridded mos gmos oosthuizen et al 2020 the statistical method used in this work is multiple linear regression other techniques are possible such as polynomial or logistic regression or neural networks wilks 2006 but we adopted the regression methodology due to its advantage with safar kind of observational set up as discussed above a general form of mos equation can be written as below 1 y b0 b1x1 b2x2 b3x3 bnxn 2 ym b0 b1x1 b2x2 b3x3 bnxn where y denotes the predictand here pm2 5 and pm10 and x1 xn denote predictors which are forecasted meteorological parameters b0 expreses intercept and b1 bx are coefficients of predictors are used to improve forecast ym is a improved value obtained after applying regression equation 3 5 translating data to information the process of converting scientific data to useful application is very crucial and important as general public are usually not aware with the complex scientific data terminology or units hence the concept of air quality index aqi is adapted by many countries usepa 2005 2014 to communicate pollution levels to common public in simplified and easy to understand format in india the initial work on the concept of air quality index has been done by the safar in 2010 beig et al 2010 however the official notification by govt of india on national air quality index has been implemented in 2015 to strengthen air quality dissemination system for public awareness and to encourage involvement of common citizens in air quality management plans moefcc 2015 aqi is a rating scale used for reporting the quality of air we breathe in and the associated health effects it provides information in terms of colour and simple numbers without any units which can be easily understood by common public there are six aqi categories namely good satisfactory moderate poor very poor and severe as per official indian government guidelines moefcc 2015 the breakpoint for the concentration for pm10 and pm2 5 is given in table 1 3 6 technological framework data flow and outreach the path from generating raw data to decisions that generates social and economic benefits is complex and needs scientific understanding and their linkages with socioeconomic aspects at each step hence the most essential part of any early warning framework is to design a user friendly system product and information dissemination tolls so that the information products generated through the system can be utilised by various stakeholders this has improved awareness and helped in mitigation planning which is leading to achieve better city better environment better life it will help to achieve faster more inclusive and sustainable growth which we are committed by rendering services on air

spatial distribution of pm2 5 emissions from all sources is shown in fig 4 the estimated total emissions of pm2 5 from all sources are calculated as 77 gg year 57 gg year 45 gg year and 30 gg year for geographical regions of delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune metropolis respectively it is observed from fig 4 that the trend of high emission pm2 5 of the order of 200 1000 ton yr is present over eastern central some part of the south eastern region of delhi which includes major roads network and industrial zones some industrial and slum related residential zones in mumbai are the major point and area sources of pm2 5 with the emission of the order of 200 2000 ton yr grid a large number of pm2 5 hotspots can be seen in central and eastern parts of delhi pimpri chinchwad township in pune and the south south east part of ahmedabad due to industries and rising demand of the vehicle however the western and northern region of delhi shows a comparatively lower value of pm2 5 emission due to agricultural land cover and low population density being semi urban zone the oceanic regions in the mumbai map are shown with blue colour with almost negligible emissions and hence not included in the inner most domain however they are accounted in outer domain the relative contributions of different sectors in different cities are shown in fig 5 high population density due to urbanization is the main reason which directly or indirectly drives the pm2 5 emissions in all four metropolises the most dominating emission source of pm2 5 is transportation whose share is found to be 41 in delhi followed by 40 35 and 31 in pune ahmedabad and mumbai respectively as shown in fig 5 all major traffic junctions are found to have high pm2 5 emissions the numbers of transport vehicles are rising rapidly in delhi and pune leading to congestion some load was reduced after implementation of compressed natural gas cng but the gain was offset by the rapid increase in the number of vehicles in recent times although the share of the transport sector as compared to other sectors in ahmedabad and mumbai is also highest but due to the rapid bus transport system in ahmedabad and local train services known as the lifeline of mumbai has a significant impact in reducing the share of vehicular emissions a large number of pm2 5 hotspots are well scattered and can be identified in all cities due to the presence of industries as a point source and slum clusters as an area source uncontrolled combustion pattern in highly dense slum population in mumbai is significantly high in mumbai the share of biofuel emissions is highest in mumbai 15 5 followed by pune 11 4 ahmedabad 10 2 and delhi 3 the industrial emissions mainly consist of emissions from the product and the fuel used in the unit the relative share is found to be highest 21 6 in pune followed by ahmedabad 18 8 delhi 18 6 and mumbai 31 1 emissions from power plants mainly due to coal combustion are relatively less in all 4 cities low population density drives to limited combustion activities also the sixth category of other sources includes solid waste trash burning brick kiln etc which may individually appear to be very small but collectively contribute a significant amount of pm2 5 emission another major sector that contributes a significant amount of emissions of pm2 5 is the emissions of re suspended windblown dust from paved and unpaved roads and construction activities the re suspended dust is associated with the vehicular movement on the road and is directly proportional to the number of vehicles its weight and speed as well as the amount of dust on roads it is likely to be more serious in a city like delhi due to high vehicle numbers and in ahmedabad due to dry and hot weather it has been found that windblown dust is not a major source of pm2 5 and when compared to other sectors it ranked 2nd in the list for delhi and ahmedabad but 3rd in pune and 4th in mumbai the spatial distributions of pm10 follows almost the same trend as pm2 5 but with different magnitude and the relative share of different sectors in pm10 and the total emissions gg year for each of the 4 cities are also shown in fig 5 the total aggregated emissions from all sources of pm10 are estimated as 177 9 gg year 90 7 gg year 84 6 gg yr and 53 9 gg year for delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune respectively the most dominating emission source of pm10 is found to be windblown resuspended dust whose share is found to be 46 4 in delhi followed by 37 3 28 5 and 25 9 in ahmedabad pune and mumbai respectively as shown in fig 5 vehicle movement over the major road network is the main source of windblown dust and confined to major downtown roads the naturally blowing dust due to winds is a factor but in a heavily populated city like delhi it aggravates due to vehicle movements the estimated windblown dust emission of pm10 is almost three times more than the transport sector emission the uncertainty associated with road dust is assumed to be in largest and estimated to be more than 30 due to emission factors as well as the average weight of the vehicles traveling on the road mixed with prevailing winds which cannot be accurately determined as it is a dynamic and random process paved and unpaved road emissions are found to be lower over the outskirt of all cities as well as over some of the western and northern delhi regions where the transport activity is limited the relative share of industrial emissions in coarser particles pm10 are found to be significant 27 6 in ahmedabad as compared to similar source share in pm2 5 because of the type of industries and unpaved road conditions transporting goods with a heavy load of resuspended dust 4 2 model validation model performance is evaluated using the daily averaged pm2 5 observations at 4 monitoring cities in india delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune for one year period february 1 2019 to january 31 2020 covering all seasons fig 6 a and fig 6 b show the verification of three days predicted temporal variations along with observations in the mass concentration of daily mean pm2 5 and pm10 respectively during the above period at the four safar cities each city consists of around 8 10 different locations the red dots represent observed daily 24hr mean mass concentrations data averaged over these 8 10 stations along with the range of values minimum and maximum in these different micro environments whereas continuous line black represent the model simulated 24hr averaged data of three days forecast for the identical period and grids the deviation from the mean for model simulated data is not show for the sake of clarity in fig 6a and b some higher values are truncated by restricting the scale for better resolution and clarity but data are accounted in the analysis in general the predicted values are found to be in good agreement with observed data in all cities the levels of pm10 and pm2 5 were highest in delhi followed by ahmedabad mumbai and pune the annual mean mass concentrations levels of pm10 and pm2 5 were observed as 183 μg m³ and 93 μg m³ at delhi 120 μg m³ and 61 μg m³ at ahmedabad 96 μg m³ and 51 μg m³ at mumbai and 70 μg m³ and 39 μg m³ at pune respectively during the study period the mean concentrations for pm2 5 in the summer season were 81 μg m³ 77 μg m³ 70 μg m³ and 42 μg m³ for delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune respectively in monsoon mean pm2 5 levels were found to be 43 μg m³ 43 μg m³ 21 μg m³ 21 μg m³ and in winter they were 153 μg m³ 64 μg m³ 62 μg m³ 53 μg m³ for delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune respectively similarly the average pm10 concentrations during summer season were 194 μg m³ 153 μg m³ 119 μg m³ 83 μg m³ in monsoon 116 μg m³ 82 μg m³ 46 μg m³ 39 μg m³ and in winter 239 μg m³ 127 μg m³ 14 μg m³ 88 5 μg m³ for delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune respectively in the monsoon season the particulate matter concentration is lowest as compared to the other seasons in all four cities due to the washout effect the variability of particulate pollutants during monsoon is highly dependent on the number of rainy days and its intensity the levels of these pollutants significantly dropped down in pune and mumbai which have recorded quite high rainfall activity during the monsoon season spread around the entire season the variability and trends in high concentration episodes of pm10 and pm2 5 observed during extreme events were reasonably well captured by the model but often with significantly underestimated magnitude this is one of the major shortcomings of the model for which a special treatment is worked out which will be discussed later in this paper in case of a prolonged spell of an extreme event the difference in predicted magnitude is high on initial days but later the error difference reduces and skill of forecast improves significantly in addition the predicted surface winds during extreme events in winter are often found to be more intense than those observed particularly in delhi leading to a more dilution of aerosol particles to under estimate pm2 5 levels the scatter plots for evaluation of the model performance in different seasons in terms of correlation coefficient are shown in fig 7 a and 7b for pm2 5 and pm10 respectively in general correlation is found to be significant in all the seasons but with varying numbers the correlation is found to be strongest for both pm2 5 and pm10 during winter season in all 4 cities it is relatively weak during monsoon season in delhi due to erratic nature of rainfall the monthly averaged pm10 and pm2 5 mass concentration as simulated by the online safar forecasting model red bars with 3 days lead time in delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune are compared with observations blue bars in fig 8 the standard deviations from the mean across the ten safar locations of each city are also shown on an average model performance is found to be reasonable the scatter in the upper limit of pm10 and pm2 5 in model output in different locations from october to february is found to be high as compared to observations particularly for delhi and during monsoon for pune in ahmedabad the concentration is found to be highest in the months of february to april for both pm10 and pm2 5 this is the time when the temperature is warmer and frequent episodes of local dust lifting takes place thus it is observed that in pune and delhi the levels of particulate matter are higher in the winter season whereas in mumbai pm2 5 concentration is highest at the onset of the summer season ahmedabad has the highest particulate matter concentration during the summer months as opposed to the winter season this is mainly due to the high temperatures and frequent dust storms that occur in the summer season anand et al 2019 fig 9 shows the daily observed and predicted variability in surface temperature wind speed and relative humidity respectively at all four cities during the study period the modeled meteorological parameters are broadly consistent with the observed daily temporal variability in all four cities when we look at the temporal variability of temperature at the four cities it is observed that delhi has the maximum variability in temperature ranging from 5 c to 36 c whereas mumbai showed the least variability in temperature with the temperature varying from 18 c to 30 c fig 9 the wind speed observations showed seasonal variability in all cities except delhi mumbai and ahmedabad had higher wind speeds during the monsoon season whereas pune showed higher wind speed during the pre monsoon period from may to june in delhi the wind speed was lowest during winter as compared to the other seasons relative humidity follows a common pattern in pune and ahmedabad with the peak ranging from 70 to 95 in relative humidity in monsoon season which further extends to october november months in mumbai the relative humidity is higher as it is a coastal city mostly above 50 and during peak monsoon season it is mostly as high as 99 it can be observed that in delhi the relative humidity starts to increase from mid july onwards as the onset of monsoon season here is comparatively late in july as compared to the other cities another relevant parameter for air quality is mixing layer height which has been validated for the whole year and found to be reasonably well simulated except during severe winter days which may likely to introduce some uncertainty in results as discussed later in this paper this may be attributed to coarser resolution of bulk scheme for urban canopy 4 3 model skill and mos application to evaluate the safar model s prediction skill against the measured pm10 and pm2 5 mass concentrations an extensive model performance evaluation was carried out to complement the qualitative graphical time series analysis fig 6a and b in this study the statistical measures namely mean bias mb normalized mean bias nmb mean gross error mge and mean normalized gross error mnge are used to assess model performance in simulating pm10 pm2 5 and meteorological variables these metrics have been applied earlier in numerous studies for the estimation of regional air quality model performances feng et al 2016 sánchez ccoyllo et al 2007 the mb captures the absolute bias in prediction with the positive and negative values represents the data from the dataset is either overestimated or underestimated respectively mge measures the absolute error of model versus observation nmb represents the normalization of mb and quantifies the model error by dividing by observed data mean and mnge represents the mean absolute percentage error between the observed and predicted value relative to observed data the mathematical equations to compute various statistical markers to evaluate the model performance are provided in the supplementary section statistical parameters for model evaluation the us environmental protection agency us epa 2005 guideline states that the performance evaluations results would be acceptable when normalized bias and gross error statistics fall within the range 5 15 and 30 35 respectively table 2 shows the performance evaluation result of the pm10 and pm2 5 modelling for the whole period the normalized bias with safar model forecast for pm10 is 20 7 2 7 1 7 and 9 5 and for pm2 5 it is 16 5 8 5 6 3 and 1 3 in delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune respectively which indicate good performance for all cities except delhi whose bias margin is slightly higher than the acceptable limit as prescribed by us epa table 2 the normalized gross error for delhi is highest among all 4 cities for both pm10 34 8 and pm2 5 34 7 during the whole period whereas for the other cities the normalized gross error during the whole period for both pm10 and pm2 5 lies around 13 20 the normalized gross error for delhi is observed to be highest in the winter season for pm10 and monsoon season for pm2 5 table 2 in mumbai the normalized gross error for pm2 5 is highest in the monsoon season at 25 and for pm10 it is marginally higher in the winter season the normalized gross error 19 7 of pm10 in pune is higher during the monsoon season and for ahmedabad it is 17 higher in the summer season thus the normalized gross error is within the us epa acceptable limits for all the cities when the annual period is considered however for delhi it is just at the margin of acceptable limit during monsoon and winter season the monthly averaged pm10 and pm2 5 mass concentration as simulated by the online safar forecasting model with 3 days lead time in delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune are compared with observations in fig 8 the standard deviations from the mean across the ten safar locations of each city are also shown the model output is shown as an orange bar whereas observational data are shown as blue bar on an average model performance is found to be reasonable the scatter in the upper limit of pm10 and pm2 5 in model output in different locations from october to february is found to be high as compared to observations particularly for delhi and during monsoon for pune in ahmedabad the concentration is found to be highest in the months of february to april for both pm10 and pm2 5 this is the time when the temperature is warmer and frequent episodes of local dust lifting takes place thus it is observed that in pune and delhi the levels of particulate matter are higher in the winter season whereas in mumbai pm2 5 concentration is highest at the onset of the summer season ahmedabad has the highest particulate matter concentration during the summer months as opposed to the winter season this is mainly due to the high temperatures and frequent dust storms that occur in the summer season anand et al 2019 table s4 shows the error analysis and its improvement when mos methodology is applied to the model forecast it is clearly depicted that mos application marginal made some improvement in pm10 and pm2 5 forecast annually however nmb and mnge have indicated the improvement for pm10 and pm2 5 in a few seasons in delhi the normalized bias of pm10 and pm2 5 is improved from 22 30 to 12 16 and 21 95 16 97 respectively in winter when delhi s air quality deteriorates to a maximum and the season is marked by a majority of extreme events the normalized bias in pm10 also improves in summer from 15 14 to 11 10 similarly a normalized gross error has also shown little correction from 37 81 to 36 67 in winter only mos refinement nmb for ahmedabad is found to be 8 97 3 96 in summer for pm2 5 and normalized gross error for pm10 has shown around 1 digit bias correction in summer mos improved nmb have been noticed only for pm2 5 in mumbai from 17 39 to 16 30 in monsoon season and 1 18 to 0 13 improvement in summer whereas for pune nmb for pm10 changed from 9 30 to 0 69 in winter season 5 discussion it is interesting to note that the level of particulate pollution is significantly high during winter in delhi and pune but it is higher during summer in ahmedabad as compared to other seasons unlike other cities in mumbai the pm2 5 levels are higher in summer but pm10 levels are higher in winter as compared to winter and summer respectively this is mainly due to the fact that winter in delhi and pune are relatively cooler where boundary layer height and local meteorology plays a dominating role particularly in delhi where winter is severe in delhi calm wind conditions together with cooler temperature and low inversion layer adversely impact the air quality and keep particulate pollutants close to the surface in addition frequent episodes of radiative fog due to fall in local temperature with high humidity and advective fog originating from indo gangetic plane regions along with westerly disturbances play a major role in deteriorating the air quality and keeping levels of particulate pollutants at elevated levels in addition to this the stubble burning in neighboring northern states with favourable meteorology often leads to extreme pollution episodes in landlock delhi ahmedabad is marked by mild winter but experiences severe summer when the temperature often crosses 40 c leading to the local lifting of dust to elevate levels of coarser particulate matters however such dust lifting episodes as well as dust storms are common during summer in delhi and ahmedabad the occasional peaks during the summer season in delhi are mainly attributed to the migration of dust from desert regions of rajasthan and surrounding regions under the warmer and dry season of summer anand et al 2019 this is the main reason for the seasonal variability observed in these cities the trends in dust storm related extreme events during summer in delhi as well as in ahmedabad are well captured by the model but it often underestimates the magnitude the safar model has a choice of using any of the 2 schemes from georgia institute of technology goddard global ozone chemistry aerosol radiation and transport gocart and air force weather agency afwa the gocart and afwa are two schemes uses different parametrization of dust emission as a function of wind and land parameters e g soil moisture soil texture etc we try to choose between gocart and afwa to get more realistic dust emission and to improve the skill of forecast based on the synoptic condition the choice of using the scheme is decided on the nature of dust episodes by examining satellite image before the start of the model simulation during operational forecasting mumbai is a coastal city with high relative humidity the variability in particulate pollutants is mainly driven by the land ocean land winds whereas seasonal variation in temperature from winter to summer is not very high the simulated concentrations are found to be generally over estimated for pm2 5 but under estimated for pm10 when compared to measurements for mumbai fig 6 mumbai often witnesses lows and high during winter and summer and significant variability from one location to another this trend is due to the pattern of persistent local winds over the land area causing the pollution loads from critical emission areas from one side to the other side however reverse process follows when the coast of mumbai induces the sea breeze circulations and cleans the land area hence under prediction of pm10 could be associated with frequent wind reversal and faster deposition of coarser particles which are probably not simulated by the model as per the ever changing real word situation although wind considers the effect of local heating the model resolution of 1 67 may not well represent the steep change in topography hence the simulated pm2 5 concentration is sometime over estimated as it is associated with residential household emissions from mumbai slums whose day to day variability may be exploited by abrupt change in local winds the pm10 concentration in delhi during the monsoon season shows that during the initial months of the season the concentration does not decrease significantly unlike other cities this is attributed to the late arrival of south west monsoon in delhi as compared to the other 3 cities which are located in the western part of india where the monsoon reaches quite early however the particulate matter concentration is lowest in this season in all 4 cities and the model simulation also captures this in all the cities with larger variability due to uncertainty in simulating the short term rainfall fluctuations during the study period considered the rainfall extended even during october and november months in mumbai and pune due to which the particulate matter concentration was relatively lower however levels of pm start to increase from the beginning of november in these cities generally the southwest monsoon withdraws from the north west part of india by september end october beginning but due to the cyclonic activity in the arabian sea during october and november months mumbai and pune received rainfall thereby reducing the particulate matter concentration even in these months the month to month variability in delhi during winter months is mainly attributed due to the fact that air quality is highly vulnerable to short term variability in weather parameters during winter which is not well simulated by the model particularly the mixing layer height and local wind speed the rainfall in pune is quite erratic during the monsoon season and changes its characteristics frequently in a short time span which might be one of the many reasons for the relatively weaker performance of the model in pune during july to september a sharp increase in the levels of pm10 and pm2 5 is noticed in delhi fig 6 after september which is linked to the withdrawal of monsoon from delhi in the first week of october immediately after the withdrawal of south west monsoon anticyclone establishment is one of the major synoptic features which make the whole atmosphere very stable due to air circulation associated with clear skies and sinking motion which forces stagnant conditions for quite some time beig et al 2019 however when such a condition starts to ease out the temperature starts to drop faster in delhi to bring down the mixing layer at the same time stubble burning in the northern part of india often starts to push parcels of pm2 5 towards delhi based on boundary layer wind direction and speed and the air quality of delhi starts to deteriorate rapidly beig et al 2020b the stubble burning almost stops by the end of november but the air quality of delhi continues to be highly affected even during december and january due to its land lock geography which plays an important role in trapping the pollutants during calm wind and cool conditions observed during these months hama et al 2020 anand et al 2019 the cooler temperature brings down the atmospheric boundary layer further 6 conclusions the air pollutant forecasting is an important part of the air quality early warning framework reported in this work for indian megacities of vivid micro environments but the chaotic nature and complexity of the air pollution itself makes prediction a challenging task particularly in a city which is highly influenced by meteorology due to its geographical location which are considered in this work in this paper the first official indigenous framework for india safar is presented to forecast the concentration of particulate air pollutants which determines the air quality in indian megacities with three days lead time as commited by safar to india s national clean air programme ncap plan bias variance and error evaluation systems were used to verify the stability and accuracy of the forecast the results show that the safar model has reasonably good accuracy and stability in predicting pm10 and pm2 5 levels in contrasting micro environments of indian megacities and capture the trend of the data the statistics verification analysis show that it predicts the extreme pollution event reasonably well but also over estimates the concentrations of pm2 5 and under estimate pm10 the potential weakness of the model system setting is related to usage of coarser bulk scheme for urban canopy which should be improved in the future to account for micro level urban processes connected to urban infrastructure the application of mos when applied to optimize the initial weights and thresholds it reduces the impact of noise on the prediction results by retaining the actual trend of the data however the present model forecast is found to be quite robust and the application of the mos methodology in air quality forecast in indian metropolis improves the accuracy for some seasons which differ from city to city but do not make any significant change author contribution anand bano rathod korhale and parkhi contributed in data curation formal analysis and part writing and discussion sahu and mangaraj

25728,air quality is a strong health driver its accurate assessment and forecast are important in densely populated megacities to take preventive steps we describe the first indian operational air quality framework safar system of air quality and weather forecasting and research meant for decision makers and a research tool with a capability of three days advance forecast in four indian megacities of distinct environment and topography the framework includes six different components from observations and modelling to outreach to evaluate the performance of the forecast we focus on particulate pollutants which largely define air quality of indian metropolis the model prediction skill is tested for the pilot year 2019 20 which is found to be reasonable the normalized gross error of pm2 5 for delhi is found to be highest 35 whereas for other cities it is 13 20 the model output statistics mos application enhanced operational forecast ability of numerical model which resulted in improving the accuracy for specific seasons winter graphical abstract image 1 keywords particulate matters air quality safar meteorology forecasting model megacities environment topography and health 1 introduction during past few decades human activities have changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere considerably at a local regional and global level causing several problems of global concern air pollution global warming climate change are a few of them the problem of air pollution has become serious in indian metropolitan cities after the economic liberalization india has become one of the world s fastest growing economies the economic and social development in india has been reflected in the rapidly growing industrialization urbanization increased transportation etc which on the other hand also contributed in increasing the emissions of air pollutants high levels of particulate matter concentrations impact human health balakrishnan et al 2019 and affect the radiative balance through direct and indirect effects seinfeld and pandis 2006 exposure to pm2 5 for prolonged periods can lead to serious health effects such as decreased lung function chronic bronchitis and premature mortality us epa 2005 2019 ground level ultra fine particulate matter pm2 5 particles having aerodynamic diameter 2 5 μm is the major concern in indian urban complexes and hence national ambient air quality standards naaqs have been set up for such pollutants in india like by many other countries throughout the world the level of pm2 5 routinely exceeds the 24 h standard of 60 μgm 3 established by the indian government moefcc 2015 pollution is largely added to the atmosphere by surface emissions from various sources including anthropogenic and natural emissions in addition to the emissions meteorological processes on various spatial and temporal scales strongly affect air quality the air quality may be affected by distance transport long to short range and local weather meteorological factors that may affect pm include temperature wind speed wind direction relative humidity rh high pressure system mixing height ventilation coefficient and atmospheric stability extreme weather events such as heatwaves droughts and air stagnation are particularly important when air pollutants accumulate over a relatively long time period during the event summer monsoon is an important feature for india and modulates the air quality through various weather processes climate change may directly affect air quality by modulating emission inventories and dispersion patterns understanding the impact of weather on air quality in a changing climate is extremely important as a prerequisite to any prediction system environmental monitoring and early warning system are the basics of long term development of environmental protection work to improve the quality of people s health and life the development of a robust accurate and simple air quality monitoring and early warning system is highly desirable such a system is also essential to effectively fulfil the requirement of a decision support system which includes various components from observations and predictive capabilities to disseminating strategy at a city level air quality event information in advance can assist the general public in coping with health and environmental problems and take more efficient counter measures schell et al 2001 air quality problem and forecasting capability is developed by quite a few developed countries but such systems are sparse in the developing world when india hosted the 19th commonwealth games in 2010 a need was felt to provide the air quality and weather information to around 8000 athletes from 71 commonwealth nations in indian capital megacity delhi as the air pollution is known to impact the performance of athletes shephard 1984 several controlled studies with athletes have shown that exercise while breathing elevated levels of air pollution which may have a direct impact on athletic performance rundell 2012 in order to address the pressing need and to provide better tools for decision makers the indian air quality forecasting framework known as safar system of air quality and weather forecasting and research has been developed for indian megacities safar is the indian government s first official operational air quality forecasting framework successfully conceived designed and developed by indian institute of tropical meteorology pune a constituent of indian ministry of earth sciences the safar project is also adopted as a pilot study of gurme world meteorological organization beig et al 2015 the safar is an early warning framework designed with an objective to predict air quality 3 days in advance along with weather parameters and translate data into information for the benefit to the society after the successful demonstration of safar project in delhi its usefulness to the common public and society became evident thereafter indian government decided to further expand it in three more major cities of india namely pune mumbai and ahmedabad in addition to understanding the scientific processes governing the day to day variability of air quality and weather parameters safar connects scientific outcome with society to increase preparedness amongst common citizens and help decision makers to reduce health risk associated with air pollution hazards since each of the four megacities represent a distinct micro environment and climatology it provided a challenge to forecasting models and an opportunity to understand different processes controlling the air quality in different environments the operational online chemistry transport model ctms with forecasting applications to multiple indian cities of different micro climate was non existent in india until safar was conceived this is mainly due to many difficulties major among them is the deficiency in the gridded emission inventory in absence of micro level activity data sahu et al 2011 in addition to this difficulties also arise in simulating meteorological fields over an area of complex geography with significant variabilities in weather parameters among different cities the objective of the current paper is to discuss the strategic framework of safar development which includes different components consisting of monitoring network emissions modelling forecasting and its validation and communication the ctms which are deterministic models can forecast air pollution concentrations but the accuracy of the forecast is highly affected by the quality of the emission data and the scale used the incomplete knowledge on the sources transport processes and atmospheric chemicals vara vela et al 2016 which have also been addressed in this paper to evaluate the forecasting performance of the safar model we have applied various statistical metrics the model output statistics mos is a type of statistical post processing a class of techniques used to improve numerical models ability to forecast glahn and lowry 1972 carter et al 1989 many forecasting systems around the globe apply the mos application to improve the operational forecasting perez et al 2015 developed the mos algorithm to enhance the air quality forecast in spain impact of data stratification on the efficiency of the mos methodology to a high resolution deterministic air quality forecast in poland is reported by struzewska et al 2016 a comprehensive discussion on improving the atmospheric chemistry forecast using mos application is provided by ma et al 2018 and references therein the safar framework also includes the mos application to test and improve the skill of air quality forecast the translating of the scientific data to information and its effective dissemination is a key to any air quality management system which is also addressed within safar framework 2 climatology of study region fig 1 shows the zoomed map of four indian megacities of india having distinct topography and micro climate anand et al 2019 the location of india in the global map is also depicted in fig 1 the major roads highways water resource forest cover build up land agriculture land slum areas power plants and industrial locations are marked in each city map delhi is officially known as the national capital territory nct it is a megacity of india containing new delhi the capital of india situated in the country s north at 28 61 n 77 23 e while the whole nct s population was about 17 million delhi s urban area is now considered to extend beyond the nct boundaries and include the neighboring satellite cities of ghaziabad faridabad gurgaon and noida in an area called the national capital region ncr and had an estimated 2016 population of over 26 million people making it the world s second largest urban area according to the united nations un report 2016 geographically delhi is a landlocked city that experiences very hot summers and severe winters and is located at an elevation of 216 m above sea level to cover an area of 1484 sq km the temperature may rise to about 47 c in summers and go down to about 2 c in winter the monsoon starts in late june and lasts until mid september with an average annual rainfall of approximately 886 mm winters are influenced by the western disturbances and cold winds from the himalayas making the winters chilly due to the proximity to the arabian sea mumbai has humid weather during monsoon season mumbai witnesses heavy rainfall mumbai is at an elevation of about 14 m above sea level and has a population of 12 million temperatures do not vary much throughout the year and it remains between 32 c and 40 c humidity is highest during the summer months and it records rainfall of 1800 mm the winds from the western side are the most noticeable feature of mumbai monsoons pune is located in the western ghats of sahyadri mountain range it is about 100 km inland from the western coast of india at 559 m above mean sea level with a population of approximately 9 million the climate of pune is mainly dry with a low latitude semi arid hot climate the city receives an annual rainfall of 722 mm mainly between june and september as a result of the southwest monsoon ahmedabad which is a city in the western state of gujarat has a tropical semiarid climate it is located at an elevation of about 53 m above mean sea level having a population of over 5 million the annual rainfall is about 700 mm this city experiences severe summers with temperatures varying between 24 c and 50 c winters are not very severe here and the temperature does not fall significantly in this study the seasonal variability in the particulate matter levels is considered by taking into account three major seasons namely summer february march april may monsoon june july august september and winter october november december january as per the observed climatology of tropical north western cities of india anand et al 2019 3 safar framework design and implementation this section introduces the strategic framework of safar and its interdisciplinary approach the process of developing such a framework is complex and involves round the clock measurements of various air quality and weather parameters analyzing the same with basic scientific knowledge improving forecasting capabilities with basic scientific research translating science to information products and disseminating the information in very simple and user friendly format so that maximum stakeholders including government agencies educational institutes common public can understand and use the same for their benefit ranging from safeguarding health to mitigation measures the data dissemination in an easy to understand format is ensured by adapting modern communication techniques the safar framework consists of six different components and integrates them 1 observational network air pollutants and weather parameters 2 quality assurance and quality control qa qc above parameters 3 emission inventory for accounting sources of pollutants 4 safar forecasting model establishment of high resolution air quality forecasting model 5 translating data to information concept of aqi 6 technological framework and outreach data management product generation and dissemination the safar data communication framework is shown in figure 2 it has two components namely the remote data transfer and master control centre all servers located in master control centre are connected physically with high speed internet lines the near real time online raw data of different pollutants along with weather parameters measured at various stations located in different locations of a city first saved in the data logger connected physically at each air quality monitoring station aqms represented as monitoring in the right side of fig 2 once stored locally data get transferred remotely through gprs 4g 5g network in to data server located at master control center the safar atmospheric chemistry transport model runs at supercomputer which is located in a different location within the campus and represented as modelling in the left side of fig 2 the model output of desired forecast data is remotely transferred to model data server located in the master control center now onwards all the functions are done in master control center both sets of data consisting of current and forecasted air quality and weather parameters the data is then checked for quality assurance and quality control qa qc as per protocol by expert operational team the mos application is applied here then the data is passed on to ftp master server the algorithm loaded at ftp master server converts this data received in physical units into indian national air quality index aqi and other related parameters in easy to understand format safar products are generated and stored at ftp master server which has the responsibility to channel the data to various disseminating servers like display server web server and cloud servers from where the system products get disseminated to the society via wireless communication network we will discuss each component of safar framework in the subsequent sub section below 3 1 observations network the safar framework consists of more than 40 monitoring stations in four safar cities with nearly 100 monitoring instruments each city network includes 10 air quality monitoring stations aqms which have online analysers that are us epa approved distributed in different microenvironments viz downtown area background industrialized area residential area traffic areas etc in such a way that they cover the whole city and the average can be representative of the city as per wmo guidelines grimmond et al 2014 srinivas et al 2016 beig et al 2015 the automatic weather stations aws to measure different meteorological parameters are collocated with each aqms observational network in the urban complex is required to get near real time air quality and weather data over the strategic locations which can be then used for improving forecast and its validation urban areas are complex and shows variation at micro scale wmo has set up standard guidelines to establish air quality and weather monitoring stations in urban areas wmo 2008 2014 grimmond et al 2014 which get updated from time to time as per the guidelines strategic selection of monitoring stations and their density is needed based on the range of applications and the nature of the variability of the city to develop a forecast system for air quality and weather stations should cover all kinds of land uses e g highly dense urban residential industrial suburban catchments downwind and upwind areas so that it could be representative of an urban cluster megacity bieringer et al 2013 grimmond et al 2014 which has been adopted in this work selecting the density of monitoring station can be decided based on the availability of resources in addition to the installation of instruments to find out prevailing surface characteristics safar framework adopts standard operating procedure sop for robust quality control quality check qa qc to ensure good data quality which is discussed in subsequent section the air quality indicators and weather parameters are monitored round the clock the data is recorded and stored at every 5 min interval at local station air quality observation includes many parameters including pm10 pm2 5 on which current work is focussed the measurements of fine particulate matter pm2 5 in micrograms per cubic meter μg m³ were carried out with the help of beta attenuation monitor bam 1020 during the study period in bam 1020 carbon 14 14c element is used as a radioactive source which gives a constant source of high energy electrons are well known as beta rays and these particles are detected and counted by a scintillation detector low energy beta rays are absorbed by collision with electrons whose number is proportional to the density therefore absorption is a function of the mass of the irradiated material the external pump pulls a measured amount of air sample dust laden afterwards the filter tape weighed down with dust is automatically placed between the source and the detector the attenuation of the beta particle signal is used to determine the mass concentration of aerosols collected on the filter tape the extensive details of the bam 1020 are reported in our previous studies beig et al 2020a yadav et al 2017 bam 1020 measures the mass concentration of particulate matters which can measure up to 10 000 μg m³ with a lower detection limit of 1 μg m³ the span calibration of the instrument is automatically verified on an hourly basis anand et al 2019 yadav et al 2019 the data has been collected for one year during 2019 20 covering all seasons and the 24 h mean of pm2 5 has been computed the meteorological parameters such as wind speed km hr 1 relative humidity and temperature c have been measured using the automatic weather stations anand et al 2019 this near real time online raw data is then transferred to central aqms server at safar control centre remotely at every 15 min interval which is a central data base where data has been validated by expert scientific team fig 2 the data is subsequently averaged to 1 h interval 3 2 quality assurance and quality control qa qc quality control and quality assurance qa qc is the major and essential step in the operational safar early warning framework not only in monitoring instruments but also at each step this need to be performed rigorously before disseminating data the instruments are maintained and operated according to the standard specifications of supplier all air quality and weather monitors need to be operated continuously 24 7 hr for the purpose following operational protocol has been developed to ensure qa qc a based on drift specification instrument environment and other factors the calibration is done at definite time interval for all the analyzers and sensors a software will record and store data at every 5 min interval at local station with wired connectivity in data acquisition system b near real time online raw data get transferred from respective aqms stations to central aqms server remotely at every 15 min interval which will act as a central data base c as part of qa qc we developed an sop at central aqms server to give alert for 1 instrument failure at site 2 communication failure between instrument and local server and 3 communication failure between local server and central aqms server this sop is adopted to prevent data loss and solve the problems with minimum time lag d the data validation is an essential function of technical management at safar control room errors or suspicious data which are flagged by the system is checked and corrected by expert scientific team various quality codes are set to observational values based on information relating to the state of the sensor or measurement the invalid or out of range data is carefully checked and if found spurious it is discarded for subsequent analysis after validation the data is subsequently averaged to 1 h 24 h 8 h based on type of pollutant and aqi formulation requirement on rolling average basis for each hour e technical review and audit review and audit is an integral part of the system field engineers visit the stations on daily basis and perform check to ensure the instruments are working properly field engineers are responsible for reporting the daily status of instrument health to control and command centre on monthly basis review meeting is conducted and monthly audits are performed in which instrument health as well as documentation has been checked by internal auditors consist of safar scientific team members 3 3 emission inventory emission inventory is a key factor in determining the accuracy of air quality modelling results gao et al 2016 it is a fundamental tool to identify all sources of pollutants and its magnitude during a particular time and geographic region which requires both primary activity data collected from field surveys as well as secondary activity data collected from various authentic sources activity data is defined as the quantitative measure of the activity that results in the emissions of air pollutants different kinds of activities are related to a particular source of emission whose extend and intensity determines the strength of emission and it varies from place to place hence there is a need to identify different activities going on in the region which are responsible for the emission of varieties of air pollutants and find out the intensity of those to be able to quantify the emissions to make the present inventory more accurate and robust a large number of site specific primary data has been generated and at the same time all available secondary data sets have been collected from all possible authentic sources for the selected air pollution sources in the region the gridded emission inventory for these 4 safar cities has been developed recently by us and methodology is reported in detail elsewhere beig et al 2018 2019 sahu et al 2011 and hence only briefly discussed in this paper building out a technological emission inventory involves various distinctive major and minor sources of emission during the development of such inventory the first step includes the recognition of each source and the second step consists of the distribution of emission geographically in grids a bottom up approach has been taken to develop a high resolution gridded emission inventory with the well established methodology discussed earlier sahu et al 2015 then the generated data are applied to country specific technological emission factors to estimate the total emission beig et al 2018 huang et al 2018 filonchyk and hurynovich 2020 sahu et al 2011 2015 2017 the activity data for 16 major minor sectors are targeted which was rearranged into six major categories namely transport power industry residential windblown dust re suspended dust and rest others includes many unattended sources like brick kiln crematorium etc an emission factor efs is a representative value that attempts to relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the atmosphere with a particular activity associated with the release of that pollutant typically efs of a fuel depends on the chemical composition of the fuel combustion type temperature and efficiency of any emission control device there are very limited measured efs available in the literature for india incorporating a country specific appropriate ef is a very sensitive part in the development of emission inventory ef defines the source strength as emission per unit time and per unit activity of the process the emission factors based on the technological fuel type have been used to estimate bottom up emissions from each sector a geographic information system gis organises air quality data from a variety of sources in a uniform framework which will not only improve accuracy but also play vital role in data management the emission values from different sources are also organized as a set of thematic layers where the gis based statistical methodology is adopted to prepare gridded emission inventories of particulate matter pm2 5 and pm10 with 1 67 km resolution uncertainty in emission inventory emission inventory is an important input to the air quality forecasting model and hence accuracy of air quality forecast depends on the reliability of emission calculations performed in the emission inventory development in this case it is necessary to identify and estimate uncertainties associated with emission inventories to help modelers to consider the factor while running the forecast models estimating the uncertainty of an emission value is often a more difficult task than estimating the emission value placet et al 2000 quantifying the uncertainties is not an easy task as it requires continuous monitoring of emissions at the source point which is not practical in real conditions till date no such systematic approach for the identification of uncertainty is available as a result the calculated emissions cannot be exactly validated however uncertainties associated with the estimation can roughly be considered following are the factors which account for uncertainty in the emission estimates 1 emission factors 2 activity data 3 spatial distribution of emission 4 source category specification 5 missing data leads to approximation 6 poor understanding of emitting processes 7 uncertainty in efficiency of control equipment s 8 reporting error 9 inaccuracy in gridding process 10 geographical data to allocate emission etc most of occasion there is a considerable uncertainty introduced during inventory development process uncertainty in emission inventory is a function of the uncertainty in input data mainly related to activity data both primary secondary and emission factors a monte carlo analysis is widely used for detailed category by category assessment of uncertainty particularly where uncertainties are not distributed normally present uncertainty analysis is done by incorporating the above mentioned two critical factors in the present work an attempt has been made to collect city specific micro level activity data to reduce uncertainties associated with the data however missing data can lead to certain assumptions and also dependency on available secondary data for certain sectors may lead to uncertainty in the present work monte carlo analysis can be performed at the category level for aggregations of categories or for the inventory as a whole calculation of error propagation is done by critically following the step and by accommodating different past studies for a better comparison and accuracy in analysis the past studies smith et al 2000 gurjar et al 2004 arora et al 2014 are taken into account combined uncertainty is calculated by considering both the emission factor as well as activity data uncertainty the process then repeated for sectoral emissions for different years and the differences between these for the total and any sectors of interest we have adopted region specific emission factors variability in processes producing emissions variation in environmental factors e g temperature humidity etc methods and assumptions used to fill in knowledge gaps about emissions processes and estimated the error of the order of around 25 30 windblown road dust being exceptional concerning particulate matter emission only and is one of the vital contributors to the particulate matter emission having an uncertainty of 30 41 for rest of the pollutants the domestic source which comprises of several fuels including lpg wood kerosene and cow dung i e residential sector shows the largest uncertainty with maximum being 15 25 the activity data collected through field campaign is vital in reducing the uncertainty the most complicated uncertainty estimation calculation was for the transport sector as it involves fuel specific vehicles category which have emission factors according to the age of vehicles hence calculating the uncertainty percentage for emission factor involved critical review of older studies as well the maximum uncertainty estimated for transport sector was 20 35 later accompanies the industrial and power plant sector with uncertainty of 25 32 individually the other sector which comprises of several minor sources showed an uncertainty of 22 45 it is pertinent to mention here that the magnitude of the uncertainty in found to be much higher in majority of the earlier work saikawa et al 2017 3 4 safar air quality forecasting model numerous types of models are available for meteorological and chemical transport modelling these models can be configured according to the desired specifications several models can be combined together for better forecasting and analysis the wrf chem is the most widely used community mesoscale numerical weather model in which a meteorological module is coupled on line with a chemistry module grell et al 2005 this chemistry module consists of various gaseous aerosol and aqueous chemistry processes to represent atmospheric chemistry occurring in the troposphere and stratosphere andrade et al 2015 being a community model different chemistry modules get updated as more and more validation studies are conducted wrf chem features two dynamical cores a data assimilation system and a software architecture facilitating parallel computation and system extensibility the model serves a wide range of meteorological applications across scales from tens of meters to thousands of kilometres wrf offers a flexible and computationally efficient platform for operational forecasting while providing advances in physics numeric and data assimilation contributed by developers in the broader research community the chemistry of chemical species is fully coupled with the dynamical calculations in the model so that the transport scheme emissions mixing horizontal and vertical grids chemical transformation of trace gases aerosols and the physics schemes for subgrid scale transport are the same for both meteorological and chemical components at each time step the indian safar forecasting framework discussed in this work is based on wrf chem weather research and forecast with chemistry model version 3 9 powers et al 2017 grell et al 2005 which provides three day forecasts for important pollutants in delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune safar framework is conceived based on the following three fundamental key components which largely govern the air quality in indian megacities namely 1 local emissions 2 local weather and 3 long to short range transport with distance weather in addition when occasional episodic extreme external pumping coincides with favourable weather it leads to environmental emergency dust storm stubble burning huge forest fire falls under episodic external sources all 3 basic processes are highly coupled with each other and status of air quality cannot be understood in isolation by ignoring one over other a schematic flow diagram for safar air quality forecasting model for indian metropolis is shown in fig 3 where components of meteorology and chemistry are shown in 2 independent boxes under the heading wrf and chem respectively in fig 3 this modelling framework uses a combination of meteorological fields topography data land use land cover data initial and lateral boundary conditions and emission module etc as shown at both ends of fig 3 the spatial representation of emission at city scale 1 67 km was built using the detailed activity data and emission factors using bottom up approach to construct the gridded emission inventory beig et al 2018 2020b sahu et al 2011 discussed in the previous section the results for online simulation for the period from february 1 2019 to january 31 2020 are presented here to cover all 3 seasons of india we have run the model for 80 h in forecasting mode for the reported period and the model output used is forecast for the 3rd day i e valid at 72 h model configuration an accurate representation of physical dynamical chemical processes and their interaction at a fine scale is important to the accurate predictions of meteorology and air quality the use of nesting enables the simulation of feedbacks among various meteorological and chemical processes occurring at various temporal and spatial scales as shown in fig 3 some studies have shown that using nested domains can lead to more accurate predictions of chemical species grell et al 2005 fast et al 2006 the present system uses 2 way nesting which involves feedback from the fine domain to the coarse domain and vice versa we have set 4 nested domains for each city the grid resolution for outermost domain 1 is taken as 45 km 45 km it is considered as 15 km 15 km for domain 2 and 5 km 5 km for domain 3 the grid size of inner most domain 4 was 1 67 1 67 km two outermost domains 1 and 2 which cover parts of europe and asia extends from 10 6 s 56 5 n in the north south direction and 31 e to 120 e in an east west direction with 195 w e x 173 n s grid cells and india stretching from 55 4 e to 95 e 258 grid cells and 2 7 n to 55 4 n 270 grid cells are common for safar forecasting set up of four cities while the 3rd domain for ahmedabad mumbai and pune covers west india 300 324 grid cells in w e and n s direction it covers north india 273 258 grid cells for delhi to take account of regional pollution from indo gangetic plain igp region the innermost domain 4 for delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune contained 69 75 69 75 72 72 and 72 72 grid points in w e and n s direction the centre latitude and longitude are 23 14⁰n and 75 44⁰e respectively the model projection is mercator the relaxation zones are within the grid point sizes although grid point sizes are small total 32 vertical levels reaching to 50 hpa as model top have been used for all domains typically 8 12 levels are there within boundary layer during day time this can represent the vertical structure in daytime the vertical resolution is 100 m for model vertical levels below 500 m 200 m for model height in between 500 m 1km 500 m for model height between 1 and 3 km and 1 km for model height between 5 and 20 km this configuration works well as can be seen in our previous publications for non rainy seasons chen et al 2020 srinivas et al 2016 beig et al 2015 for monsoon season the vertical levels are increased for better vertical resolution of cloud related fields e g cloud water water vapor etc when there is high turbulence and vertical shear overall vertical levels are increased to properly represent pollutant dispersion the model has a lot of in built physical parameterization options to choose from although for a particular chemical scheme we cannot use every physics scheme we have used the parameterization which showed optimal performance different physical parameterization used for set up has been shown in table s1 we have used cbmz mosaic 4 bin chemistry scheme consisting of carbon bond mechanism version z cbmz gas phase mechanism which contains 73 chemical species and 237 reactions and mosaic model for simulating aerosol interactions and chemistry zaveri et al 2008 aerosol scheme that uses 4 sectional bins where 3 bins are assigned for aerosols of diameter less than 2 5 μm and other bin describing the size range 2 5 10 μm the mosaic scheme describes the chemistry of sea salt sodium potassium and chloride ions soil lumped inorganics secondary inorganic aerosols nitrate sulphate and ammonium ions and carbonaceous aerosols organic carbon and black carbon and equilibrium between water vapor 4 inorganic trace gases nh3 h2so4 hno3 and hcl with inorganic ions nitrate sulphate and ammonium and chloride initial and boundary conditions long range transport plays a key role on pollutant concentration along with emissions within the region therefore to consider the influence outside the regions lateral boundary conditions from the global model were used the initial and boundary conditions for meteorological parameters are taken from ncep gfs national centre for environmental prediction global forecast system discussed elsewhere https www emc ncep noaa gov emc pages numerical forecast systems gfs php which provides

ozone profiles etc the meteorological ic bc is processed using wrf pre processing system wps as shown in fig 3 the snow cover is processed from ic in our domains during model initialization using wps we have used model simulated chemical parameters from previous days run as the chemical initial condition for the next day the boundary condition for gaseous and aerosol parameters was taken from waccm whole atmosphere community climate model https www acom ucar edu waccm download shtml marsh et al 2013 and references therein with model output having a horizontal resolution 0 9 1 25 https www2

polar ncep noaa gov sst rtg high res at a resolution of 0 083 0 083 meteorological data and forecasting the ground level concentration of pollutants varies depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions at that time meteorological conditions are the prime factors that determine the dilution rate and dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere therefore meteorological data are essential for air quality forecasting it aids in interpreting spatial and temporal variations of measured air quality data they are also necessary inputs for dispersion model calculations of pollution concentrations the chemical processes such as dust emission fire emission and biogenic emission are dependent on the simulated meteorological parameters such as vertical profiles of wind temperature and relative humidity at each scale the land use canopy and topographical effects are included to realize the regional synoptic meteorological conditions for the finer scales the urban canopy and anthropogenic heat island could also be introduced if necessary the final outputs for each domain are available at 1 h temporal resolution with provision to only use the gridded fields for chemical transport modelling but also to extract the data for either city grids at a regional scale and points of interest at finer resolutions urban scale the urban parameterization is an important aspect for megacities currently we are using default bulk parameterization for urban canopy in wrf chem with detailed land use data at city level we have the provision to use single layer urban canopy model cities are characterized by different physical properties of surface compared to their rural counterparts resulting in a specific regime of the meteorological phenomenon hence to assess the impact of cities on climate inclusion of the urban parameterization is important in high resolution modelling as halenka et al 2019 have detected the urban heat island effect karlicky et al 2018 have evaluated the impact of typical urban surfaces on the central european urban climate in several model simulations performed with the wrf model and regional climate model regcm together with different descriptions of the urban environment they have found that the urban environment improves the weather conditions a little with regard to the pollutant dispersion which could lead to the partly decreased concentration of the primary pollutants with the exception of the daytime in the summer however it may be stressed that only the concentration of primary pollutants can be decreased by urban effects and not the secondary pollutants that are created in the atmosphere huszár et al 2018 however from below 10 km bulk schemes can reproduce parameters like urban heat island but are unlikely to resolve the mixing height or effects on wind at a finer resolution and likely to affect results this is one of the weaknesses in the current model set up lin microphysics which provides water cloud variables in resolved scale has been used in the present framework this scheme is well validated for cloud permitting scale 5 km wang et al 2009 feedback from parameterized convection to the atmospheric radiation and the photolysis schemes is done in coupled online mode in the model in the resolved scale but not below 5 km feedback from the aerosols to the radiation schemes is allowed in all the scale with use of ucm even at single level improve urban heat fluxes evapotranspiration at high resolution city level additionally we can use multi layer urban canopy model e g bep which helps in getting vertically resolved wind and temperature fields but due to high computational and city level build road etc data requirement for multilayer ucms we do not use it in forecasting mode as done by most of other city scale forecasting models with a resolution in the order of 1 km or above the ucms incorporate the subgrid scale physical processes of the urban environment using underlying heterogeneity of the urban surface the required surface parameters are challenging to be defined properly and improper setting hinders model performance grimmond et al 2011 the chemical parameters to simulate chemical parameters properly we provided the latest anthropogenic emissions for gases so2 nox nh3 co nmvoc and aerosol species bc oc pm2 5 pm10 from 5 sectors residential biomass burning

so2 nox co nmvoc and aerosol species bc oc pm2 5 pm10 for an additional sector of re suspended road dust at city scale at a horizontal resolution of 1 67 1 67 km for the innermost domain for four cities prepared in our research group as mentioned earlier we use utilities provided by ucar ncar https www2 acom ucar edu wrf chem wrf chem tools community along with some of the tools developed in collaboration during the inception of safar framework in 2010 marappu et al 2014 the emission for compounds from the biosphere is provided for each month using megan v2 01 model of emissions of gases and aerosols from nature which used a database for lai and land cover https bai ess uci edu megan and uses meteorological parameters such as solar radiation temperature and moisture from wrf during runtime the fire emissions during the stubble burning period in winter are taken from our recently developed dynamic emission inventory as discussed in detail elsewhere beig et al 2020b the fire emission for other period and regions were updated from fire inventory from ncar finn v1 5 wiedinmyer et al 2011 which provides emissions of aerosols and gases using a fixed diurnal profile for fire emission daily modis fire data at 1 km x 1 km resolution vegetation data from satellite observation to calculate the dry deposition the parameterization of wesely et al 1989 is used to calculate surface resistance for gases and aerosols except for sulphate for which parameterization of erisman et al 1994 is used challenges the safar faced number of challenges to account the processes with varied geography and topography of a particular city was one of the major challenges in developing safar framework in general open atmosphere that can be seen in central part of india is found to be favourable for the dispersion of pollutants while mumbai is blessed with sea on 3 sides which often send cleaner winds to balance city emission fury pune is located at higher altitude with greener cover and ahmedabad is surrounded by open dry land open geography promotes diffusion of pollutants and hence air pollution emergencies are less likely to occur in those cities not walled up by obstacles in contrast delhi is the landlocked city surrounded by unique geographical features likes himalayas and the thar desert because of extreme weather conditions in the region dispersion of pollutants becomes a major problem also external transport of pollutants due to certain weather conditions is common feature in delhi another challenge is accounting sources of air pollutants with unknown fluxes which are scattered around the city hence to make the forecast accurate one needs robust database of each and every air pollution source located in the city area and its geographical distribution over the region which is achieved to an extend but further high resolution databases are always desirable the model output statistics mos application enhanced operational forecast ability of numerical model was a challenge which resulted in improving the accuracy for specific seasons winter mos application to safar operational forecast to improve the skill and accuracy of forecast and to address the public information system adequately safar framework adopted the mos application for the operational probabilistic forecasting andrés pérez et al 2015 numerous studies have demonstrated the benefit of adjusting site specific air quality model predictions using observational data to reduce systematic model bias miller et al 2010 there are three reasons why statistical reinterpretation of dynamical numerical model output is useful for practical weather air quality forecasting a there are important differences between the real world and its representation in numerical models b the numerical models are often not complete and true representations of the workings of the atmosphere and their forecasts are subjected to errors and c the numerical models are deterministic where no randomness is involved in the development of future states of the system whereas practically the atmospheric environment do involve randomness the mos glahn and lowry 1972 carter et al 1989 is a type of statistical post processing a class of techniques used to improve numerical weather models ability to forecast by relating model outputs to observational or additional model data dennstaedt 2008 ecmwf 2014 and wilks 2006 https www weather gov mdl mos home mos is defined as an objective forecasting technique that consists of determining a statistical relationship between a predictant and variables forecast by a numerical model at some projection time it is in effect the determination of the weather air pollutant related statistics of a numerical model predictor points can come from either point observations or from data that has been calculated to points on a grid the mos products which are more heavily based on true observation points are referred to as station based mos while mos generated based on gridded data is called gridded mos gmos oosthuizen et al 2020 the statistical method used in this work is multiple linear regression other techniques are possible such as polynomial or logistic regression or neural networks wilks 2006 but we adopted the regression methodology due to its advantage with safar kind of observational set up as discussed above a general form of mos equation can be written as below 1 y b0 b1x1 b2x2 b3x3 bnxn 2 ym b0 b1x1 b2x2 b3x3 bnxn where y denotes the predictand here pm2 5 and pm10 and x1 xn denote predictors which are forecasted meteorological parameters b0 expreses intercept and b1 bx are coefficients of predictors are used to improve forecast ym is a improved value obtained after applying regression equation 3 5 translating data to information the process of converting scientific data to useful application is very crucial and important as general public are usually not aware with the complex scientific data terminology or units hence the concept of air quality index aqi is adapted by many countries usepa 2005 2014 to communicate pollution levels to common public in simplified and easy to understand format in india the initial work on the concept of air quality index has been done by the safar in 2010 beig et al 2010 however the official notification by govt of india on national air quality index has been implemented in 2015 to strengthen air quality dissemination system for public awareness and to encourage involvement of common citizens in air quality management plans moefcc 2015 aqi is a rating scale used for reporting the quality of air we breathe in and the associated health effects it provides information in terms of colour and simple numbers without any units which can be easily understood by common public there are six aqi categories namely good satisfactory moderate poor very poor and severe as per official indian government guidelines moefcc 2015 the breakpoint for the concentration for pm10 and pm2 5 is given in table 1 3 6 technological framework data flow and outreach the path from generating raw data to decisions that generates social and economic benefits is complex and needs scientific understanding and their linkages with socioeconomic aspects at each step hence the most essential part of any early warning framework is to design a user friendly system product and information dissemination tolls so that the information products generated through the system can be utilised by various stakeholders this has improved awareness and helped in mitigation

spatial distribution of pm2 5 emissions from all sources is shown in fig 4 the estimated total emissions of pm2 5 from all sources are calculated as 77 gg year 57 gg year 45 gg year and 30 gg year for geographical regions of delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune metropolis respectively it is observed from fig 4 that the trend of high emission pm2 5 of the order of 200 1000 ton yr is present over eastern central some part of the south eastern region of delhi which includes major roads network and industrial zones some industrial and slum related residential zones in mumbai are the major point and area sources of pm2 5 with the emission of the order of 200 2000 ton yr grid a large number of pm2 5 hotspots can be seen in central and eastern parts of delhi pimpri chinchwad township in pune and the south south east part of ahmedabad due to industries and rising demand of the vehicle however the western and northern region of delhi shows a comparatively lower value of pm2 5 emission due to agricultural land cover and low population density being semi urban zone the oceanic regions in the mumbai map are shown with blue colour with almost negligible emissions and hence not included in the inner most domain however they are accounted in outer domain the relative contributions of different sectors in different cities are shown in fig 5 high population density due to urbanization is the main reason which directly or indirectly drives the pm2 5 emissions in all four metropolises the most dominating emission source of pm2 5 is transportation whose share is found to be 41 in delhi followed by 40 35 and 31 in pune ahmedabad and mumbai respectively as shown in fig 5 all major traffic junctions are found to have high pm2 5 emissions the numbers of transport vehicles are rising rapidly in delhi and pune leading to congestion some load was reduced after implementation of compressed natural gas cng but the gain was offset by the rapid increase in the number of vehicles in recent times although the share of the transport sector as compared to other sectors in ahmedabad and mumbai is also highest but due to the rapid bus transport system in ahmedabad and local train services known as the lifeline of mumbai has a significant impact in reducing the share of vehicular emissions a large number of pm2 5 hotspots are well scattered and can be identified in all cities due to the presence of industries as a point source and slum clusters as an area source uncontrolled combustion pattern in highly dense slum population in mumbai is significantly high in mumbai the share of biofuel emissions is highest in mumbai 15 5 followed by pune 11 4 ahmedabad 10 2 and delhi 3 the industrial emissions mainly consist of emissions from the product and the fuel used in the unit the relative share is found to be highest 21 6 in pune followed by ahmedabad 18 8 delhi 18 6 and mumbai 31 1 emissions from power plants mainly due to coal combustion are relatively less in all 4 cities low population density drives to limited combustion activities also the sixth category of other sources includes solid waste trash burning brick kiln etc which may individually appear to be very small but collectively contribute a significant amount of pm2 5 emission another major sector that contributes a significant amount of emissions of pm2 5 is the emissions of re suspended windblown dust from paved and unpaved roads and construction activities the re suspended dust is associated with the vehicular movement on the road and is directly proportional to the number of vehicles its weight and speed as well as the amount of dust on roads it is likely to be more serious in a city like delhi due to high vehicle numbers and in ahmedabad due to dry and hot weather it has been found that windblown dust is not a major source of pm2 5 and when compared to other sectors it ranked 2nd in the list for delhi and ahmedabad but 3rd in pune and 4th in mumbai the spatial distributions of pm10 follows almost the same trend as pm2 5 but with different magnitude and the relative share of different sectors in pm10 and the total emissions gg year for each of the 4 cities are also shown in fig 5 the total aggregated emissions from all sources of pm10 are estimated as 177 9 gg year 90 7 gg year 84 6 gg yr and 53 9 gg year for delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune respectively the most dominating emission source of pm10 is found to be windblown resuspended dust whose share is found to be 46 4 in delhi followed by 37 3 28 5 and 25 9 in ahmedabad pune and mumbai respectively as shown in fig 5 vehicle movement over the major road network is the main source of windblown dust and confined to major downtown roads the naturally blowing dust due to winds is a factor but in a heavily populated city like delhi it aggravates due to vehicle movements the estimated windblown dust emission of pm10 is almost three times more than the transport sector emission the uncertainty associated with road dust is assumed to be in largest and estimated to be more than 30 due to emission factors as well as the average weight of the vehicles traveling on the road mixed with prevailing winds which cannot be accurately determined as it is a dynamic and random process paved and unpaved road emissions are found to be lower over the outskirt of all cities as well as over some of the western and northern delhi regions where the transport activity is limited the relative share of industrial emissions in coarser particles pm10 are found to be significant 27 6 in ahmedabad as compared to similar source share in pm2 5 because of the type of industries and unpaved road conditions transporting goods with a heavy load of resuspended dust 4 2 model validation model performance is evaluated using the daily averaged pm2 5 observations at 4 monitoring cities in india delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune for one year period february 1 2019 to january 31 2020 covering all seasons fig 6 a and fig 6 b show the verification of three days predicted temporal variations along with observations in the mass concentration of daily mean pm2 5 and pm10 respectively during the above period at the four safar cities each city consists of around 8 10 different locations the red dots represent observed daily 24hr mean mass concentrations data averaged over these 8 10 stations along with the range of values minimum and maximum in these different micro environments whereas continuous line black represent the model simulated 24hr averaged data of three days forecast for the identical period and grids the deviation from the mean for model simulated data is not show for the sake of clarity in fig 6a and b some higher values are truncated by restricting the scale for better resolution and clarity but data are accounted in the analysis in general the predicted values are found to be in good agreement with observed data in all cities the levels of pm10 and pm2 5 were highest in delhi followed by ahmedabad mumbai and pune the annual mean mass concentrations levels of pm10 and pm2 5 were observed as 183 μg m³ and 93 μg m³ at delhi 120 μg m³ and 61 μg m³ at ahmedabad 96 μg m³ and 51 μg m³ at mumbai and 70 μg m³ and 39 μg m³ at pune respectively during the study period the mean concentrations for pm2 5 in the summer season were 81 μg m³ 77 μg m³ 70 μg m³ and 42 μg m³ for delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune respectively in monsoon mean pm2 5 levels were found to be 43 μg m³ 43 μg m³ 21 μg m³ 21 μg m³ and in winter they were 153 μg m³ 64 μg m³ 62 μg m³ 53 μg m³ for delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune respectively similarly the average pm10 concentrations during summer season were 194 μg m³ 153 μg m³ 119 μg m³ 83 μg m³ in monsoon 116 μg m³ 82 μg m³ 46 μg m³ 39 μg m³ and in winter 239 μg m³ 127 μg m³ 14 μg m³ 88 5 μg m³ for delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune respectively in the monsoon season the particulate matter concentration is lowest as compared to the other seasons in all four cities due to the washout effect the variability of particulate pollutants during monsoon is highly dependent on the number of rainy days and its intensity the levels of these pollutants significantly dropped down in pune and mumbai which have recorded quite high rainfall activity during the monsoon season spread around the entire season the variability and trends in high concentration episodes of pm10 and pm2 5 observed during extreme events were reasonably well captured by the model but often with significantly underestimated magnitude this is one of the major shortcomings of the model for which a special treatment is worked out which will be discussed later in this paper in case of a prolonged spell of an extreme event the difference in predicted magnitude is high on initial days but later the error difference reduces and skill of forecast improves significantly in addition the predicted surface winds during extreme events in winter are often found to be more intense than those observed particularly in delhi leading to a more dilution of aerosol particles to under estimate pm2 5 levels the scatter plots for evaluation of the model performance in different seasons in terms of correlation coefficient are shown in fig 7 a and 7b for pm2 5 and pm10 respectively in general correlation is found to be significant in all the seasons but with varying numbers the correlation is found to be strongest for both pm2 5 and pm10 during winter season in all 4 cities it is relatively weak during monsoon season in delhi due to erratic nature of rainfall the monthly averaged pm10 and pm2 5 mass concentration as simulated by the online safar forecasting model red bars with 3 days lead time in delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune are compared with observations blue bars in fig 8 the standard deviations from the mean across the ten safar locations of each city are also shown on an average model performance is found to be reasonable the scatter in the upper limit of pm10 and pm2 5 in model output in different locations from october to february is found to be high as compared to observations particularly for delhi and during monsoon for pune in ahmedabad the concentration is found to be highest in the months of february to april for both pm10 and pm2 5 this is the time when the temperature is warmer and frequent episodes of local dust lifting takes place thus it is observed that in pune and delhi the levels of particulate matter are higher in the winter season whereas in mumbai pm2 5 concentration is highest at the onset of the summer season ahmedabad has the highest particulate matter concentration during the summer months as opposed to the winter season this is mainly due to the high temperatures and frequent dust storms that occur in the summer season anand et al 2019 fig 9 shows the daily observed and predicted variability in surface temperature wind speed and relative humidity respectively at all four cities during the study period the modeled meteorological parameters are broadly consistent with the observed daily temporal variability in all four cities when we look at the temporal variability of temperature at the four cities it is observed that delhi has the maximum variability in temperature ranging from 5 c to 36 c whereas mumbai showed the least variability in temperature with the temperature varying from 18 c to 30 c fig 9 the wind speed observations showed seasonal variability in all cities except delhi mumbai and ahmedabad had higher wind speeds during the monsoon season whereas pune showed higher wind speed during the pre monsoon period from may to june in delhi the wind speed was lowest during winter as compared to the other seasons relative humidity follows a common pattern in pune and ahmedabad with the peak ranging from 70 to 95 in relative humidity in monsoon season which further extends to october november months in mumbai the relative humidity is higher as it is a coastal city mostly above 50 and during peak monsoon season it is mostly as high as 99 it can be observed that in delhi the relative humidity starts to increase from mid july onwards as the onset of monsoon season here is comparatively late in july as compared to the other cities another relevant parameter for air quality is mixing layer height which has been validated for the whole year and found to be reasonably well simulated except during severe winter days which may likely to introduce some uncertainty in results as discussed later in this paper this may be attributed to coarser resolution of bulk scheme for urban canopy 4 3 model skill and mos application to evaluate the safar model s prediction skill against the measured pm10 and pm2 5 mass concentrations an extensive model performance evaluation was carried out to complement the qualitative graphical time series analysis fig 6a and b in this study the statistical measures namely mean bias mb normalized mean bias nmb mean gross error mge and mean normalized gross error mnge are used to assess model performance in simulating pm10 pm2 5 and meteorological variables these metrics have been applied earlier in numerous studies for the estimation of regional air quality model performances feng et al 2016 sánchez ccoyllo et al 2007 the mb captures the absolute bias in prediction with the positive and negative values represents the data from the dataset is either overestimated or underestimated respectively mge measures the absolute error of model versus observation nmb represents the normalization of mb and quantifies the model error by dividing by observed data mean and mnge represents the mean absolute percentage error between the observed and predicted value relative to observed data the mathematical equations to compute various statistical markers to evaluate the model performance are provided in the supplementary section statistical parameters for model evaluation the us environmental protection agency us epa 2005 guideline states that the performance evaluations results would be acceptable when normalized bias and gross error statistics fall within the range 5 15 and 30 35 respectively table 2 shows the performance evaluation result of the pm10 and pm2 5 modelling for the whole period the normalized bias with safar model forecast for pm10 is 20 7 2 7 1 7 and 9 5 and for pm2 5 it is 16 5 8 5 6 3 and 1 3 in delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune respectively which indicate good performance for all cities except delhi whose bias margin is slightly higher than the acceptable limit as prescribed by us epa table 2 the normalized gross error for delhi is highest among all 4 cities for both pm10 34 8 and pm2 5 34 7 during the whole period whereas for the other cities the normalized gross error during the whole period for both pm10 and pm2 5 lies around 13 20 the normalized gross error for delhi is observed to be highest in the winter season for pm10 and monsoon season for pm2 5 table 2 in mumbai the normalized gross error for pm2 5 is highest in the monsoon season at 25 and for pm10 it is marginally higher in the winter season the normalized gross error 19 7 of pm10 in pune is higher during the monsoon season and for ahmedabad it is 17 higher in the summer season thus the normalized gross error is within the us epa acceptable limits for all the cities when the annual period is considered however for delhi it is just at the margin of acceptable limit during monsoon and winter season the monthly averaged pm10 and pm2 5 mass concentration as simulated by the online safar forecasting model with 3 days lead time in delhi ahmedabad mumbai and pune are compared with observations in fig 8 the standard deviations from the mean across the ten safar locations of each city are also shown the model output is shown as an orange bar whereas observational data are shown as blue bar on an average model performance is found to be reasonable the scatter in the upper limit of pm10 and pm2 5 in model output in different locations from october to february is found to be high as compared to observations particularly for delhi and during monsoon for pune in ahmedabad the concentration is found to be highest in the months of february to april for both pm10 and pm2 5 this is the time when the temperature is warmer and frequent episodes of local dust lifting takes place thus it is observed that in pune and delhi the levels of particulate matter are higher in the winter season whereas in mumbai pm2 5 concentration is highest at the onset of the summer season ahmedabad has the highest particulate matter concentration during the summer months as opposed to the winter season this is mainly due to the high temperatures and frequent dust storms that occur in the summer season anand et al 2019 table s4 shows the error analysis and its improvement when mos methodology is applied to the model forecast it is clearly depicted that mos application marginal made some improvement in pm10 and pm2 5 forecast annually however nmb and mnge have indicated the improvement for pm10 and pm2 5 in a few seasons in delhi the normalized bias of pm10 and pm2 5 is improved from 22 30 to 12 16 and 21 95 16 97 respectively in winter when delhi s air quality deteriorates to a maximum and the season is marked by a majority of extreme events the normalized bias in pm10 also improves in summer from 15 14 to 11 10 similarly a normalized gross error has also shown little correction from 37 81 to 36 67 in winter only mos refinement nmb for ahmedabad is found to be 8 97 3 96 in summer for pm2 5 and normalized gross error for pm10 has shown around 1 digit bias correction in summer mos improved nmb have been noticed only for pm2 5 in mumbai from 17 39 to 16 30 in monsoon season and 1 18 to 0 13 improvement in summer whereas for pune nmb for pm10 changed from 9 30 to 0 69 in winter season 5 discussion it is interesting to note that the level of particulate pollution is significantly high during winter in delhi and pune but it is higher during summer in ahmedabad as compared to other seasons unlike other cities in mumbai the pm2 5 levels are higher in summer but pm10 levels are higher in winter as compared to winter and summer respectively this is mainly due to the fact that winter in delhi and pune are relatively cooler where boundary layer height and local meteorology plays a dominating role particularly in delhi where winter is severe in delhi calm wind conditions together with cooler temperature and low inversion layer adversely impact the air quality and keep particulate pollutants close to the surface in addition frequent episodes of radiative fog due to fall in local temperature with high humidity and advective fog originating from indo gangetic plane regions along with westerly disturbances play a major role in deteriorating the air quality and keeping levels of particulate pollutants at elevated levels in addition to this the stubble burning in neighboring northern states with favourable meteorology often leads to extreme pollution episodes in landlock delhi ahmedabad is marked by mild winter but experiences severe summer when the temperature often crosses 40 c leading to the local lifting of dust to elevate levels of coarser particulate matters however such dust lifting episodes as well as dust storms are common during summer in delhi and ahmedabad the occasional peaks during the summer season in delhi are mainly attributed to the migration of dust from desert regions of rajasthan and surrounding regions under the warmer and dry season of summer anand et al 2019 this is the main reason for the seasonal variability observed in these cities the trends in dust storm related extreme events during summer in delhi as well as in ahmedabad are well captured by the model but it often underestimates the magnitude the safar model has a choice of using any of the 2 schemes from georgia institute of technology goddard global ozone chemistry aerosol radiation and transport gocart and air force weather agency afwa the gocart and afwa are two schemes uses different parametrization of dust emission as a function of wind and land parameters e g soil moisture soil texture etc we try to choose between gocart and afwa to get more realistic dust emission and to improve the skill of forecast based on the synoptic condition the choice of using the scheme is decided on the nature of dust episodes by examining satellite image before the start of the model simulation during operational forecasting mumbai is a coastal city with high relative humidity the variability in particulate pollutants is mainly driven by the land ocean land winds whereas seasonal variation in temperature from winter to summer is not very high the simulated concentrations are found to be generally over estimated for pm2 5 but under estimated for pm10 when compared to measurements for mumbai fig 6 mumbai often witnesses lows and high during winter and summer and significant variability from one location to another this trend is due to the pattern of persistent local winds over the land area causing the pollution loads from critical emission areas from one side to the other side however reverse process follows when the coast of mumbai induces the sea breeze circulations and cleans the land area hence under prediction of pm10 could be associated with frequent wind reversal and faster deposition of coarser particles which are probably not simulated by the model as per the ever changing real word situation although wind considers the effect of local heating the model resolution of 1 67 may not well represent the steep change in topography hence the simulated pm2 5 concentration is sometime over estimated as it is associated with residential household emissions from mumbai slums whose day to day variability may be exploited by abrupt change in local winds the pm10 concentration in delhi during the monsoon season shows that during the initial months of the season the concentration does not decrease significantly unlike other cities this is attributed to the late arrival of south west monsoon in delhi as compared to the other 3 cities which are located in the western part of india where the monsoon reaches quite early however the particulate matter concentration is lowest in this season in all 4 cities and the model simulation also captures this in all the cities with larger variability due to uncertainty in simulating the short term rainfall fluctuations during the study period considered the rainfall extended even during october and november months in mumbai and pune due to which the particulate matter concentration was relatively lower however levels of pm start to increase from the beginning of november in these cities generally the southwest monsoon withdraws from the north west part of india by september end october beginning but due to the cyclonic activity in the arabian sea during october and november months mumbai and pune received rainfall thereby reducing the particulate matter concentration even in these months the month to month variability in delhi during winter months is mainly attributed due to the fact that air quality is highly vulnerable to short term variability in weather parameters during winter which is not well simulated by the model particularly the mixing layer height and local wind speed the rainfall in pune is quite erratic during the monsoon season and changes its characteristics frequently in a short time span which might be one of the many reasons for the relatively weaker performance of the model in pune during july to september a sharp increase in the levels of pm10 and pm2 5 is noticed in delhi fig 6 after september which is linked to the withdrawal of monsoon from delhi in the first week of october immediately after the withdrawal of south west monsoon anticyclone establishment is one of the major synoptic features which make the whole atmosphere very stable due to air circulation associated with clear skies and sinking motion which forces stagnant conditions for quite some time beig et al 2019 however when such a condition starts to ease out the temperature starts to drop faster in delhi to bring down the mixing layer at the same time stubble burning in the northern part of india often starts to push parcels of pm2 5 towards delhi based on boundary layer wind direction and speed and the air quality of delhi starts to deteriorate rapidly beig et al 2020b the stubble burning almost stops by the end of november but the air quality of delhi continues to be highly affected even during december and january due to its land lock geography which plays an important role in trapping the pollutants during calm wind and cool conditions observed during these months hama et al 2020 anand et al 2019 the cooler temperature brings down the atmospheric boundary layer further 6 conclusions the air pollutant forecasting is an important part of the air quality early warning framework reported in this work for indian megacities of vivid micro environments but the chaotic nature and complexity of the air pollution itself makes prediction a challenging task particularly in a city which is highly influenced by meteorology due to its geographical location which are considered in this work in this paper the first official indigenous framework for india safar is presented to forecast the concentration of particulate air pollutants which determines the air quality in indian megacities with three days lead time as commited by safar to india s national clean air programme ncap plan bias variance and error evaluation systems were used to verify the stability and accuracy of the forecast the results show that the safar model has reasonably good accuracy and stability in predicting pm10 and pm2 5 levels in contrasting micro environments of indian megacities and capture the trend of the data the statistics verification analysis show that it predicts the extreme pollution event reasonably well but also over estimates the concentrations of pm2 5 and under estimate pm10 the potential weakness of the model system setting is related to usage of coarser bulk scheme for urban canopy which should be improved in the future to account for micro level urban processes connected to urban infrastructure the application of mos when applied to optimize the initial weights and thresholds it reduces the impact of noise on the prediction results by retaining the actual trend of the data however the present model forecast is found to be quite robust and the application of the mos methodology in air quality forecast in indian metropolis improves the accuracy for some seasons which differ from city to city but do not make any significant change author contribution anand bano rathod korhale and parkhi contributed in data curation formal analysis and part writing and discussion sahu and mangaraj

25729,modeling the interactions between water and energy is crucial to managing holistically these resources here we simulate water allocations and energy dispatch in the metropolitan region of phoenix arizona in 2008 2017 using the weap and leap models under different spatiotemporal resolutions and coupling configurations we find that increasing the temporal resolution from annual to monthly allows capturing seasonal demands which improves the simulation of water allocations from supply sources to all demand nodes the simulation of energy fluxes is instead less sensitive to the model time step representing the domain with higher spatial granularity enhances the ability to model the correct water portfolio of the power plants finally coupling the models to capture two way feedbacks between water and energy systems improves the simulations of electricity generation and in turn of water fluxes while related to phoenix our findings provide useful insights to improve water energy nexus modeling at other sites keywords water energy nexus environmental modeling model resolution model coupling weap leap 1 introduction the water energy nexus wen is a term used to refer collectively to the dependencies and interdependencies between water and energy systems and resources rio carrillo and frei 2009 siddiqi and anadon 2011 u s department of energy 2014 for example water is required for cooling purposes in thermal power plants and is directly used to produce electricity in hydropower plants energy is needed to pump transport and treat water depending on the region each resource could use a significant amount of the other khan et al 2017 for instance in the u s power plants are estimated to be responsible for 13 of the total water consumption while the energy required to pump transport treat and heat water accounts for 13 of the total primary energy consumption dieter et al 2018 sanders and webber 2012 due to the interdependencies between water and energy climate and anthropogenic stressors e g intense storms heatwaves droughts terrorist attacks etc acting on one system can cause cascading impacts on the other system thus significantly compromising the security of both resources over both short daily and sub daily de amorim et al 2018 hatvani kovacs et al 2016 lubega and stillwell 2018 su et al 2020 and long multiple years bartos and chester 2015 van vliet et al 2016a time periods the adoption of a nexus approach to operate and manage water and energy systems has then become increasingly pressing especially considering the additional stresses that climate change population growth and urbanization will exert on these two resources dai et al 2018 rio carrillo and frei 2009 scott 2011 siddiqi and anadon 2011 van vliet et al 2016a a key step for the adoption of a nexus perspective in policy and decision making is to quantify interactions in water energy systems through numerical models khan et al 2017 these allow identifying synergies and limiting tradeoffs both in current conditions and under possible scenarios of climate change demand growth and expansion of technologies and infrastructure given the broad scopes of wen studies models have been developed using several approaches hamiche et al 2016 for instance schuck and green 2002 relied on econometrics principles to quantify the potential of price variation to conserve water and energy resources grubert and webber 2015 used a life cycle assessment method to estimate future changes in water and energy interdependencies according to various policy choices stercke et al 2020 set up a system dynamics model to explore global and local sustainable development goals that are related to the wen khan et al 2018 and gjorgiev and sansavini 2018 developed resource optimization models to simulate the impacts of changes in water temperature on power generation the same goal was pursued by van vliet et al 2016b combining a large scale hydrologic model with a stream temperature and hydropower and thermoelectric models obringer et al 2019 and dale et al 2015 investigated the implications of climate change for the wen using statistical and simulation modeling respectively as summarized in a review study by dai et al 2018 wen applications have been conducted at different temporal resolutions or time steps these include sub hourly real time simulations of water distribution systems and power transmission networks khatavkar and mays 2018 santhosh et al 2014 and analyses at monthly and annual scales of infrastructure expansion effects of policies and environmental impacts jääskeläinen et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 moreover wen models have incorporated the physical components of water and energy systems with various levels of detail for instance simulations of electricity generation and water demands have been performed both at fine spatial resolution or granularity accounting for each power plant e g mu et al 2020 and at a coarser resolution aggregating the generating stations based on fuel type and cooling technologies e g zhou et al 2019 in general the adoption of given temporal resolution and spatial granularity depends on data availability geographical extent of the study area e g city country or transnational and duration of the simulations e g daily annual or multidecadal in a recent review of current efforts and challenges in wen modeling khan et al 2017 noted that the increasing efforts devoted to capture finer resolutions should be carefully considered in terms of the gained simulation accuracy however very limited research has been dedicated to systematically investigate the importance of spatial and temporal resolutions on model accuracy in wen applications khan et al 2017 also reported that most previous studies of integrated water and energy systems rely on a single model to simulate one system and process its outputs to infer information on the other system in particular these authors found that in most studies e g bouckaert et al 2012 faeth et al 2014 mounir et al 2019 modeling tools are utilized to explicitly simulate the energy sector and estimate its water requirements without including an appropriate representation of the water infrastructure its internal dynamics and the interactions with the energy components other work has applied water management models to simulate the water system and post processed its outputs to estimate energy demand for water uses e g baki and makropoulos 2014 guan et al 2020 a more accurate representation of wen interdependencies would instead require the use of models that explicitly simulate each system and are integrated by linking the computer codes i e hard links or exchanging data in real time i e soft links currently integrated or coupled wen models that capture the feedback loops between the two systems have been adopted in a limited number of cases these include both i the coupling with soft links of existing water and energy models van vliet et al 2016b voisin et al 2020 as done with the water evaluation and planning weap and the long range energy alternatives planning leap platforms dale et al 2015 lin et al 2019 liu et al 2021 and ii the development of hard linked water energy optimization khan et al 2018 parkinson and djilali 2015 and integrated assessment liu et al 2019 miara et al 2017 models despite these promising studies their number is still limited and the added values of coupled simulations compared to simpler approaches based on single models and data postprocessing has not been yet properly quantified in this study we contribute to addressing a number of the research gaps discussed above by investigating how the adoption of single and coupled models under different spatial and temporal resolutions affects the accuracy of wen simulations for this aim we focus on long term water allocations and energy dispatch in the metropolitan region of phoenix arizona this is a compelling study site for wen studies for several reasons first it relies on limited water resources mainly provided by energy intensive sources including groundwater and the central arizona project cap that transfers water from the colorado river to central and southern arizona through a 541 km canal bartos and chester 2014 mounir et al 2019 second while renewable energy sources have been increasing aps 2017 srp 2018 electricity is largely generated by thermal power plants that heavily depend on water including the largest nuclear generating station in the country palo verde finally the phoenix metropolitan region has experienced over the last three decades one of the fastest population growth in the u s that was possible by converting agricultural land into urban areas bausch et al 2015 this shift has caused a dramatic change in water and energy demands the work presented here is built upon our previous effort in the phoenix metropolitan region where the weap platform has been applied to simulate food energy water dynamics under a set of future scenarios of water demand and supply guan et al 2020 and the leap model has been used to quantify the implications of future energy mix alternatives on the wen mounir et al 2019 in both studies weap and leap have been applied at an annual resolution for several decades here we first improve the model configurations by i increasing the temporal resolution of both models from annual to monthly ii expanding the weap network from a single water demand node representing all power plants to an explicit representation of all electricity generating stations and iii coupling weap and leap through soft links we then apply the models under different configurations using independent estimates of observed water and energy fluxes in the region as a reference over the period 2008 2017 first we explore the importance of the temporal resolution by comparing simulations of the coupled weap leap model applied with annual and monthly time steps respectively second we quantify the value of increased spatial granularity by contrasting simulations of weap leap where the weap domain has either a single water demand node representing all power plants or multiple nodes each representing a distinct power plant finally we investigate the added value of capturing two way feedbacks between water and energy systems by comparing simulations with the coupled weap leap model and a standalone approach based on the weap model plus a post processing routine designed to calculate energy fluxes after presenting results of these comparisons that are obtained for a specific study region and model type we discuss a number of implications useful to address challenges of wen modeling more generally 2 materials and methods to properly describe our methodology and case study we initially define water and energy models we refer to a water model as a tool that simulates allocation treatment and distribution of water from supply sources to demand nodes as a function of time similarly we define an energy model as a tool that reproduces electricity generation and dispatch from different power plants to satisfy sectorial demands as a function of time while some of the processes simulated in the water model require energy these interactions are not explicitly captured and assumptions must be made on energy availability e g energy is unlimited a similar argument can be made for the energy model water and energy models can be coupled so that fluxes and information between the two systems are exchanged during the simulation in the following we first describe the study area section 2 1 and provide a brief overview of the adopted water and energy models section 2 2 along with their setup in the study region section 2 3 finally we summarize the modeling configurations used for our analyses section 2 4 2 1 study area we apply the water and energy models to the phoenix active management area ama an administrative region of 14 623 km2 fig 1 managed by the arizona department of water resources adwr and created after the approval of the arizona groundwater management act in 1980 to sustainably manage the regional aquifer the phoenix ama is located in central arizona and entirely includes the phoenix metropolitan area and several irrigation districts the water and energy systems of this region are highly interdependent four main sources supply water to the different users including i surface water from the salt and verde rivers managed by the salt river project srp ii surface water from the colorado river transported from lake havasu to southern arizona through the central arizona project cap canal iii groundwater gw and iv reclaimed water rw over the last decade these water sources delivered 2 800 million m3 annually satisfying the municipal 47 of the demand agricultural 33 native american 11 accounting for domestic and agricultural needs of the three largest communities in the region industrial 5 and power plant 4 demands to achieve this energy is required to operate pumping stations wells water wtps and wastewater wwtps treatment plants and water reclamation facilities wrfs totaling a demand of 1 900 gwh per year 3 6 of the total electricity demand mounir et al 2019 energy supply for the region is largely provided by srp and arizona public service aps utilities which operate eight natural gas generating stations and one nuclear power plant within the region boundary along with 22 large power plants located outside of this area mounir et al 2019 electricity is needed to satisfy the residential 39 of the demand commercial 35 and industrial energy sectors 26 the latter one includes the energy provided to the water infrastructure 2 2 overview of weap leap and coupled weap leap modeling platforms the water evaluation and planning weap yates et al 2005 platform is used here as the water model weap is designed to support water resources planning and management at different scales by optimizing water allocations in a network linking supply sources to demand nodes under mass balance and user specified constraints including demand priorities and infrastructure operation rules among others inputs for weap include fixed and time varying variables characterizing water supply e g aquifer properties river discharge water releases from reservoirs demand nodes e g population water intensities and management rules e g canal and reservoir size outputs include several variables describing fluxes of water demand and supply in the network in previous studies weap has been applied at different time steps ranging from annual e g guan et al 2020 to monthly e g lévite et al 2003 and weekly e g dale et al 2015 and at national e g welsch et al 2014 regional e g yates et al 2013a 2013b and metropolitan e g guan et al 2020 scales the long range energy alternatives planning leap heaps 2020 system is used in this study as the energy model leap is an integrated energy economy environment model designed to support energy resource planning and management it simulates energy generation from diverse fuel types to satisfy demand from different end users through simple dispatch rules it requires inputs characterizing demand including activity levels e g population water flow and energy intensities e g per capita or per unit volume energy consumption and supply such as characteristics of power plants e g fuel type capacity percent of energy losses and reserve margins depending on application and data availability inputs can be constant or vary in time leap outputs time series of energy demand from each end user as well as energy generation and greenhouse gas emissions at each power plant among many other variables in previous applications this modeling tool has been applied

regional e g chang et al 2017 and metropolitan e g mounir et al 2019 scales both weap and leap have been used to model water and energy systems under present climate and infrastructural conditions as well as to explore the impacts of future scenarios of demand and supply e g dale et al 2015 esteve et al 2015 guan et al 2020 gul and qureshi 2012 mounir et al 2019 and new policies e g handayani et al 2017 lévite et al 2003 recently the weap and leap platforms have been coupled to allow simulating the interactions of water energy systems at each time step the coupling is achieved through so called links where i leap reads variables from weap to determine energy demand for specific uses e g groundwater pumping and desalination and or constrain hydropower generation and ii weap reads variables from leap to estimate water requirements for thermal cooling and or electricity generation in hydropower stations these links allow both platforms to communicate iteratively at each time step the coupled weap leap modeling platform was applied by dale et al 2015 to investigate the impact of climate change on water and energy consumption in sacramento california finding that electricity imports in the region may increase to 35 during hot dry years 2 3 set up of weap leap and coupled weap leap in the phoenix ama the weap and leap models are set up in our study region by improving the configurations adopted and validated by guan et al 2020 and mounir et al 2019 respectively by increasing temporal resolution and spatial granularity and by coupling the models it is first noted that the words energy and electricity are used interchangeably in the rest of the paper but our simulations involve only electricity to investigate the effect of temporal resolution we apply the models at an annual scale as in the two studies mentioned above and extend the setup also at monthly resolution we derive the monthly srp and cap water allocations and estimate monthly water demands through the data sources provided in table 1 and the assumptions described in the appendix the network representing the water system of the phoenix ama implemented in weap is exemplified in fig 2 a water from srp cap gw and rw sources is directly distributed to the agricultural sector and is treated in wtps prior to being delivered to the municipal native american and industrial sectors power plants receive water from all sources except for srp water allocations from srp are affected by management rules and natural flow in the salt and verde rivers cap water deliveries depend on the entitlements of colorado river water to the region and rw is generated by treating municipal water in wrfs all these rules and time varying flows are implemented in the model so that water supply is limited and constrained water demand is computed as a function of population and per capita water use for the municipal and industrial nodes while it is directly inputted for the native american node using data from adwr 2018 for the power node we adopt two configurations to investigate the effect of spatial granularity of the energy system in the first a single node represents collectively all power plants as in guan et al 2020 while in the second nine nodes are used to simulate the distinct power plants located in the phoenix ama the transmission links between water supply and demand nodes are set up to represent the physical constraints of infrastructure and water management rules the two networks are presented in figs s1 and s2 more details are provided by guan et al 2020 the energy system implemented in leap is summarized in fig 2b energy supply is provided by nine power plants located within the phoenix ama and 22 outside of this region fueled by coal natural gas uranium and renewable resources i e solar radiation wind and water these 31 generating stations are selected because they are entirely or partially owned by srp and aps the main utilities satisfying electricity demand in the region pwcc 2018 srp 2020a table 2 presents the fuel type total capacity srp and aps capacity entitlement mean annual electricity generation and water source for the nine power plants located within the phoenix ama note that for the nine generating stations water withdrawal is equal to water consumption according to the u s energy information administration eia 2018 2020a for each of the 31 power plants we input fuel type capacity entitled to srp and aps merit or dispatch order efficiency and capacity factor we also specify transmission and distribution losses of 5 and a planned reserve margin of 15 the energy demand structure is designed to focus on water energy interactions and facilitate the coupling with weap it includes i residential and commercial sectors which can be related to the municipal and native american water nodes and ii industrial energy sector which is divided into subsectors that are linked to industrial and agricultural water nodes as well as to water infrastructure components that rely on seven different energy intensities to treat transport pump and convey the different water sources based on this setup the electricity demand of the phoenix ama is assumed to be fully satisfied by the power plant capacities entitled to srp and aps this implies that i energy is imported into the phoenix ama only from the 22 external power plants managed by srp and aps and ii leap does not simulate the electricity exported outside of the phoenix ama boundaries associated with capacity entitlements of other energy companies while we assume no limit in fuel availability at each power plant the electricity generated is practically constrained by energy demand and water availability when weap is coupled to leap further details can be found in mounir et al 2019 we investigate the effect of the coupling strategy by first simulating wen interactions in a standalone mode which is illustrated in fig 3 a in this approach we assume that weap is the only available model time series of water demand from the power plants are prescribed externally using estimates from adwr 2018 and the energy needed for water related uses is calculated by post processing outputs of the water model this involves multiplying the water fluxes from the supply sources simulated by weap by the corresponding energy intensities we note that eia provides data on water withdrawals and consumption for the power plants these data are in good agreement with the adwr estimates but incomplete for several years we then utilize adwr data to be consistent in the second approach we run the weap leap model in coupled mode as shown in fig 3b we create a first set of links to connect the nine power plants located within the phoenix ama implemented in leap with the water demand nodes or node depending on the spatial granularity for power in weap in each link we provide the water withdrawal intensity in m3 kwh obtained from eia 2018 2019 for each power plant multiplied by the ratio between the corresponding total capacity and the entitlement of srp and aps at each time step leap simulates electricity generation in the system and weap uses these links to derive all water needs of each power plant for instance the electricity generation simulated by leap in the palo verde power plant to satisfy the demand of the phoenix ama is used by weap to quantify the water required for the full production including exports at this generating station similarly we create a second group of links that connects the water fluxes simulated by weap in 31 transmission links with the energy demand structure in leap and we input the energy intensities in kwh m3 of each water infrastructure component obtained from mounir et al 2019 at each time step the water fluxes simulated by weap are converted into energy required by the water infrastructure components implemented in the leap demand structure by multiplying the water volumes by the corresponding energy intensity for example the water flow simulated by weap in the transmission link from cap to the municipal demand node is used by leap to calculate the associated energy demand for conveyance and treatment 2 4 modeling configurations we adopt four model configurations to investigate our research questions they are summarized in table 3 in two configurations a single water demand node for power generation is used in weap and the coupled weap leap models are applied at annual and monthly resolutions these are labeled as 1a and 1m 1 power node m monthly and a annual time resolution respectively in an alternative configuration labeled as 9m nine demand nodes are implemented in the weap network to simulate the water demand of each power plant located within the phoenix ama and the coupled weap leap models are run at a monthly temporal resolution finally the configuration called standalone is based on the weap model running at a monthly temporal resolution with nine power nodes plus a post processing routine for the estimation of the energy embedded in water as shown in fig 3b simulations under 1a and 1m configurations are compared to test the effect of temporal resolution those under 1m and 9m to evaluate the impact of spatial granularity and those under 9m and standalone to assess the significance of the coupling approach all simulations are performed from 2008 to 2017 we investigate the accuracy of the modeling experiments in multiple ways we compare historical simulations of 1 monthly electricity generation at distinct power plants with values reported by eia and 2 annual water allocations from supply sources to demand sectors including power plants with estimates from adwr table 1 comparison against historical observations is one of the four main strategies for evaluating integrated assessment models recently reported in the review of wilson et al 2021 to quantify differences between the time series we compute correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and absolute percent error ape when contrasting 1a and 1m simulations we present differences between the constant monthly value of several outputs derived under 1a with the time varying values returned by monthly runs of 1m finally we use sankey diagrams to explore potential disagreements in allocations of water and embedded energy from supply sources to the power plants and to verify whether a given model configuration correctly represents water delivery dynamics 3 results 3 1 effects of time resolution we begin by presenting in fig 4 the electricity generated in 2008 2017 in the three largest power plants located within the phoenix ama see table 2 as reported by eia and as simulated under 1a and 1m the monthly means are also reported in the right panels the electricity generation from eia exhibits marked seasonality with a summer peak at the two natural gas power plants santan and redhawk fig 4a d and winter and summer peaks at the palo verde nuclear generating station fig 4e and f this seasonality and its interannual variability are well captured by 1m simulations cc 0 62 and rmse 0 2 twh in contrast as expected 1a simulations plotted in fig 4 by dividing the annual totals by 12 are not able to reproduce seasonal peaks and in turn the associated peaks of water demand for energy production as further described below despite this the annual electricity generations returned by 1a each year are very close to the 1m simulations aggregated annually ape between the two configurations relative to 1m and evaluated annually 2 we now turn our attention to the water allocation for electricity generation note that for this variable observations from adwr are only available at annual resolution and aggregated for all power plants while eia provides data on water withdrawals only for 2014 2017 without detailed information on the water sources in the domain with a single power node weap allocates water to such node only from rw and gw sources the corresponding mean monthly allocations simulated by 1m are shown in fig 5 a while the single monthly averaged value produced by 1a is presented in fig 5b as suggested by the results on electricity generation of fig 4 water volumes required by power plants are characterized by a lower winter and a more pronounced summer peak this resource is largely provided by rw in summer 84 in august and almost equally supplied by both sources in late winter and spring as expected annual simulations by 1a are unable to capture this variability in time and between the two water sources for example 1a underestimates results of 1m by 2 5 million m3 or 21 in august and overestimates them by 2 2 million m3 or 33 in november we note that the increase of simulated rw is caused by a rise of municipal water demand in summer and is likely overestimated due to the assumption made in the weap setup of a constant water consumption rate of 70 for the municipal water demand see supporting information of guan et al 2020 for details this setup should be improved in the future if observed data on the monthly variability of rw will become available as a next step we analyze the differences between 1a and 1m in terms of annual water supply to all uses in particular we focus on water delivered by cap which is the most energy intensive water source the observed and simulated time series of annual water volume supplied by cap to all demand nodes are displayed in fig 6 a which shows that 1m simulations better capture the adwr estimates especially in early years when supply is lower this finding can be explained by the 1m s ability to better represent key water allocation dynamics occurring within each year to demonstrate this we plot in fig 6b and c the cap monthly supplies to the municipal demand node for two representative years to interpret these figures we highlight that i cap has the second lowest allocation priority in the weap setup ii there is a maximum water volume that cap can distribute to each user due to allocation rights 44 million m3 for the municipal user plotted with a red line labeled cap max in fig 6b and c and iii when cap allocations reach this maximum volume an unmet demand exists that is satisfied by the next available water source simulations under 1a lead to constant monthly cap water allocations which could be either smaller than the maximum allocation as in 2010 fig 6b or reach this value as in 2012 fig 6c depending on water demand in the former case cap allocations satisfy all water demand in the latter case another water source is used throughout the year to meet the unmet demand when simulations are instead conducted under 1m the water demand that cap should satisfy labeled demand in fig 6b and c varies each month and the resulting allocations could be either smaller e g august or larger e g december than 1a similar to 1a there are months when cap allocations reach the maximum value as in e g january november and december of 2010 in this year the annual water demand potentially requested to cap is almost identical under both 1a and 1m however this demand is satisfied using solely cap under 1a while a supplementary source is required under 1m because of this difference annual cap allocations simulated in 2010 are larger under 1a and smaller under 1m which is closer to the observation fig 6a as a final note the 1m s ability to better capture intra annual dynamics of water allocations results also in significant differences in the estimation of energy required to transport and treat water this is illustrated in fig 7 which shows that under 1m this energy ranges from a peak of 173 gwh in july to a minimum of 117 gwh in february simulations at the annual scale suggest instead a constant value of 150 gwh with differences of up to 19 with 1m as found for electricity generation when aggregated annually the differences between 1a and 1m are instead small 1 1 3 2 effects of spatial granularity to investigate how the level of spatial details affects wen simulations we compare results of runs with monthly forcings and two weap networks with one 1m and nine 9m power nodes respectively the sankey diagrams of fig 8 display water allocations and embedded energy from supply sources to power demand nodes we first focus on the monthly mean values fig 8a and b and note that the total water use for power generation is practically identical in the two cases 8 87 million m3 however the sources supplying water for power generation change depending on the spatial granularity under 1m rw and gw are simulated as the only water sources that satisfy this demand fig 8a when each power plant is instead represented in the weap network along with the connections to the associated water supply sources 9m cap is utilized as an additional water source fig 8b in particular cap is the main water provider for kyrene and santan power plants table 2 the use of cap water reduces gw and rw allocations when compared to 1m this change results in an increase of 0 23 gwh or 4 of the annual energy demand for water because cap is more energy intensive 1 31 kwh m3 see the appendix in mounir et al 2019 than gw and rw 0 35 kwh m3 and 0 81 kwh m3 respectively we further investigate differences between water allocations and embedded energy by focusing on the months with the lowest february fig 8c and d and highest august fig 8e and f water needs for power generation in february simulations with one power node indicate gw to be the largest water provider for power when the domain includes instead nine nodes changes in water allocations caused by the use of cap water result in similar volumes supplied by gw and rw this redistribution leads in turn to an increase of energy for water treatment and distribution of 0 37 gwh 8 as compared to the simulation under 1m compare fig 8c with 8d in august the larger water use by the municipal sector increases the availability of rw also due to the assumption made to set up weap as discussed in the previous section which is simulated as the major water source for energy generation in both configurations however the use of cap under 9m leads to i lower rw and higher gw volumes compared to 1m and ii a decrease of energy embedded in the water of 0 28 gwh or 3 compare fig 8e with 8f 3 3 importance of coupling the significance of representing two way interactions in models of water and energy systems is evaluated by comparing simulations with the standalone and the coupled model configurations which are both based on a weap network with nine power plants and monthly simulations a key difference between standalone and coupled models relies on the monthly water volumes required by the power plants in the coupled simulations these fluxes are generated at each time step by converting the energy generated by each power plant simulated by leap into water volumes fig 3b in the standalone configuration these fluxes are instead provided as external inputs to weap fig 3a in our study site annual estimates of water withdrawals by all generating stations combined are available from adwr 2018 thus to conduct standalone simulations assumptions are needed to disaggregate these volumes to each power plant and at monthly resolution details are provided in the appendix fig 9 a c shows the water volumes required by the three largest generating stations which are representative of results obtained across all power plants in some cases e g santan fig 9a the standalone simulations are very similar to the coupled model outputs while in others they overestimate e g redhawk fig 9b or underestimate e g palo verde fig 9c the coupled fluxes with smaller and larger ranges between the maximum and minimum monthly values respectively the two configurations exhibit these same differences in terms of simulated electricity generation as displayed in fig 9d f this is expected since the water used for power generation and the electricity produced are linearly related through the water withdrawal intensities of the power plants note that this is a model limitation that should be addressed to incorporate recent evidences of nonlinear behavior by tidwell et al 2019 more importantly fig 9d f displays also monthly estimates of electricity generation from eia that can be used as a reference to assess the accuracy of the modeling approaches it is apparent that simulations with the coupled models capture much better eia observations than those obtained using the standalone mode as quantified by rmse being lower than 0 2 twh and 0 8 twh for the coupled and standalone runs respectively the discrepancies between the water demand of power plants simulated with the two modeling approaches lead to differences in volumes supplied by cap gw and rw to these users along with the associated energy required for treatment and pumping the mean monthly water fluxes from sources to individual power plants are compared in the sankey diagrams of fig 10 the total water used for power generation provided as input in the standalone configuration is slightly larger than the simulated value in the coupled runs 9 34 vs 8 87 million m3 resulting in higher embedded energy 6 08 vs 5 87 gwh to satisfy the water demand the coupled models simulate a larger smaller fraction of rw gw and cap water compared to the standalone case moreover the two configurations predict different portfolios of water sources for some of the power plants for example i redhawk and west phoenix receive water only from rw in the standalone configuration while they are also supplied by gw in the coupled mode and ii palo verde is supplied by a much smaller fraction of gw in the standalone runs the water allocations from the three sources to the power plants exhibit also temporal differences for instance as illustrated in fig 11 a and b the coupled runs simulate an increasing trend of cap water allocations to all power plants from 2008 to 2017 that is not captured by the standalone configuration under this simpler modeling approach constant annual allocations are predicted that result in an overestimation of cap water throughout the simulation period both modeling types simulate an increasing trend of gw allocations from 2008 to 2015 and a decrease afterward fig 11c however simulations under standalone overestimate underestimate gw monthly fluxes simulated by the coupled models below above 4 5 million m3 see scatterplot in fig 11d leading to lower variability of the monthly fluxes the two modeling approaches simulate instead similar allocations of rw to all power plants fig 11e and f despite this differences are found in terms of rw allocations to distinct generating stations this is demonstrated in fig 12 which shows that outputs of the coupled models are both overestimated e g 104 7 in west phoenix and 31 8 in redhawk and underestimated e g 17 9 in palo verde by the standalone runs 4 discussion and summary while obtained for a specific study site our results provide useful information that could support wen modeling efforts in other regions in particular our findings are relevant for models that simulate wen dynamics over spatial extents of metropolitan regions or larger and at timescales larger than one day they are less applicable to real time simulations at sub hourly resolutions of water distribution and power transmission networks at a city or neighborhood scale as e g in the 24 h simulations conducted by santhosh et al 2014 and khatavkar and mays 2018 4 1 data availability and spatiotemporal disaggregation are key as for all modeling exercises increasing the spatial and temporal resolutions of wen models leads to more complex model setups that require a larger amount of data focusing on the u s chini and stillwell 2017 recently highlighted that obtaining data on water and energy systems demand and supply is a challenging task in particular these authors reported that data on energy are available at higher time frequencies and finer spatial granularity than data on water eia reports the main characteristics of most power plants in the country and their monthly electricity generation as well as energy consumption grouped by sectors at the state level hourly energy demands are also publicly available in numerous balancing areas defined as regions where energy demand and supply must be balanced federal energy regulatory commission 2020 data from eia have been crucial for our modeling study at the metropolitan scale table 1 considering instead water eia reports water withdrawals and consumption for the power plants for other uses the main efforts at the national scale are from the united states geological survey usgs and include water data for the nation usgs 2016 and the national water use information program usgs 2010 the water data for the nation initiative publishes almost in real time streamflow data at daily or sub daily resolution across the country these data could be used to estimate water diversions from rivers at high temporal resolutions up to daily which are needed to apply water models data on water withdrawals from reservoirs pumped volumes from wells and allocations of reclaimed water are instead more difficult to obtain since they depend on policies on data sharing adopted by agencies and utilities managing these supply sources the national water use information program reports every five years water use estimates at the county level which are temporal and spatial resolutions often too coarse for wen modeling studies currently no agency has the mandate to collect national water data at the utility or city scale as eia does with energy chini and stillwell 2017 in our effort we have been able to access a relatively extensive dataset on water including estimates of annual water demand and supply data in the ama by adwr daily water diversions from the closest reservoir to phoenix published online by srp and monthly reports with water volumes allocated to different customers by cap see table 1 and appendix even if data are partially available as in our study region they are very often provided at different resolutions and for limited time periods thus assumptions are needed to disaggregate data temporally and spatially and to extrapolate them in time for their use in more detailed wen simulations khan et al 2017 such assumptions could be supported by reports of local water and energy utilities and irrigation districts in our effort we have disaggregated annual estimates of municipal and agricultural water demand from adwr 2018 to monthly scale through monthly fractions derived from a report published online by the city of phoenix which is one of the largest water providers cpwsd 2011 and from a recent report on irrigated agriculture in arizona by lahmers and eden 2018 respectively for the standalone simulations we have also performed a spatial disaggregation of energy related water demand from adwr 2018 by combining power plant characteristics i e capacity capacity factor and water withdrawal rate see appendix available from eia 2018 2019 alternatively open record requests could be sent to utilities to obtain data as done by chini and stillwell 2017 2018 who contacted water utilities in 127 u s cities to conduct a utility scale analysis of drinking water and wastewater flows along with the embedded energy despite this these authors also warned about potential limitations of data provided by utilities in terms of accuracy e g absence of data quality assurance and control and low resolution e g energy data is not collected at sub monthly resolution 4 2 value of higher temporal resolution in our study region fluxes of water and energy systems are characterized by marked intra annual variability largely due to higher demands in hot summers see figs 4 5 and 9 incorporating this higher temporal variability in simulations of water energy interactions provides critical support for the identification of synergies between the two systems that can guide policy and decision makers in the two sectors this is particularly true in regions where there are large fluctuations of demand for both resources and of surface water supply for example simulating the seasonal water availability for power generation provides detailed information on i which type of power plants is more convenient and sustainable to expand or retire in the future aps 2017 srp 2018 ii reservoir operations to optimize hydropower generation demertzi et al 2014 xuan et al 2020 and iii planning of energy generation and in turn of imports and exports federal energy regulatory commission 2020 capturing the seasonality in water and energy demand and supply is also important to i identify optimal water conservation energy efficiency strategies that save energy water while being cost effective e g bartos and chester 2014 escriva bou et al 2018 white and fane 2002 and ii model impacts of heat waves and low water flows on power production bartos and chester 2015 gjorgiev and sansavini 2018 harto and yan 2011 van vliet et al 2016a results of our work also suggest that adopting higher temporal resolutions increases the accuracy of wen simulations this is particularly true for water fluxes and less critical for energy fluxes for instance the use of annual or monthly temporal resolutions results in a difference of up to 5 in the simulated annual cap water supply fig 6 but practically no difference in simulated annual electricity generation at each power plant this finding can be explained considering that water systems are more rigid because there is a direct connection between demand nodes and their supply sources due to both infrastructural constraints and management rules as a consequence if simulations are performed at the monthly resolution the contribution of each supply source to a given demand node can vary dramatically each month depending on water availability since these seasonal dynamics are not captured in annual simulations there may be marked differences in the simulated water volumes provided by each water source throughout the year two main reasons can instead explain why the simulated annual energy supply is less sensitive to the model temporal resolution the first is that electricity is not directly delivered from specific power plants to distinct users because of the presence of the electric grid therefore even if the overall demand changes monthly electricity generations at individual power plants are not importantly affected by demand changes of each user the second reason is that in our study region water infrastructure contributes only 4 to the total energy demand mounir et al 2019 thus even if different water fluxes are simulated at the two resolutions the difference in associated electricity demands is comparatively very small these outcomes obtained for the phoenix ama with thermoelectric power plants can be used as a reference to assess the value of temporal resolution in wen modeling in other study areas water systems rely everywhere on relatively rigid allocation rules and infrastructure constraints we then expect that the simulation of water allocations from supply sources to demand nodes including power plants will be ubiquitously impacted by the temporal resolution conversely modeling energy supply will likely be less impacted by temporal resolution in several regions in the u s because the power grid is always present and the national average of the percentage of total energy use to pump and treat water is 4 as in the phoenix ama electric power research institute epri 2000 the sensitivity of simulated electricity generation to the wen model temporal resolution is expected to increase in regions where water infrastructure is responsible for a substantial portion of the total energy consumption such as in california where this portion is 10 california public utilities commission cpuc 2010 and in areas greatly dependent on desalination like the uae where desalination uses up to 22 of its total electricity siddiqi and anadon 2011 however increasing temporal resolution to monthly is most likely needed when hydropower represents a large share of the electricity generation due to the need to model streamflow seasonality and reservoir operation as also showed by dale et al 2015 4 3 value of higher spatial granularity our analyses show that when the spatial granularity of the water model domain is increased dynamics of water allocations for energy generation are simulated with higher accuracy this suggests that depending on the specific study site a coarse representation of the energy system components in the water model domain may result in ignoring the contribution of distinct water sources for power generation for example in the phoenix ama allocations of cap water to power plants are only captured using the configuration where each power plant is explicitly represented in the water model fig 8 this modeling capability is important for both the electricity companies that manage the generating stations relying on such water supply and the regional management of water resources while increasing the spatial resolution up to the granularity of single power plants enhances model accuracy it also requires a larger amount of data and adds complexity to the model here we show that this effort is valuable and achievable at the scale of a metropolitan region as the spatial extent of the study region increases e g states or countries capturing the dynamics of water allocations to distinct power plants may become unfeasible and in some cases even unnecessary for example yates et al 2013a coupled weap with the regional energy deployment system reeds to quantify water withdrawals by different users including the power system in southwestern u s which encompasses our study site in doing so these authors aggregated power plants by technology type within balancing areas thus using a much coarser description of the energy system than the one adopted in our study however the differences in cap water supplies simulated in our study for the coarse and fine domains represent only 0 06 of the annual water withdrawals over the southwestern u s as a result the simplified modeling setup adopted by yates et al 2013a is justified to simulate the wen in such a large domain without causing any major loss of information finally the need to disaggregate spatially and increase model complexity could be less critical if the main sources of electricity generation come from solar pv and wind turbines because these require very limited water volumes 4 4 utility of coupled simulations in our study coupled and standalone models are compared to our knowledge for the first time in the same wen system we find that the use of coupled models results in more accurate simulations of electricity generation and its water needs than estimations based on a standalone configuration where a water model is used to infer information on the energy system fig 9 this difference is explained by the assumptions made to generate energy related inputs for the water model which as discussed above are obtained by disaggregating annual estimates of water use for power generation from adwr in space to each power plant and time monthly under these assumptions simulations of energy generation and water demand with the standalone and coupled models are similar at some power plants e g santan but they diverge significantly at others including a large underestimation of water withdrawn by the most water consuming generating station palo verde moreover results from these two approaches differ in terms of i water allocations supplied from each source to the power plants this may be a minor issue elsewhere if power plants are supplied by a single source ii energy embedded in treating and pumping these water volumes and iii intra annual variability of the total water allocation from the different sources these differences highlight the limitations of simpler approaches where a model is used to simulate one system in our case water and infer information about the other system energy clearly the limitations of standalone simulations are less critical when there is enough information and confidence on the assumptions made to constrain the model in our case on the time series of water demand from power plants an additional advantage of coupled models is that they allow a more mechanistic representation of processes and characteristics of water and energy infrastructure this has three important benefits first it facilitates the simulation of wen systems characterized by different temporal and spatial scales a process named synchronization by khan et al 2017 the case of the phoenix ama illustrates this point since the coupled model is capable to simulate electricity generation in all power plants supplying the study area including those located outside of the geographical boundaries that contribute to satisfy the local energy demand these external generating stations are instead not included in the standalone configuration because it is quite hard to make assumptions on their contribution the second benefit of the higher mechanistic nature of integrated models is that they are probably the most accurate tool to simulate wen systems under different future scenarios since they allow implementing in a relatively easy fashion changes of infrastructural components e g number and type of power plants construction or decommission of water infrastructure and their management rules new energy and water efficiency technologies and modifications of water and energy demands in the different sectors among other features the value of this capability has been shown for example by yates et al 2013a who used the coupled reeds weap models to simulate capacity expansion and energy generation according to different future electricity mix scenarios along with water allocations under drought conditions lastly coupled models could be beneficial in data scarce regions to simulate processes for which data are not available provided that reliable assumptions are made on their parameterization through e g values reported in literature or relations with population served 5 conclusions the simulation of the interactions between water and energy systems is crucial to identify synergies and adopt a holistic management approach in this study we investigate how the accuracy of wen simulations is affected by the spatiotemporal resolution and use of coupled models that capture two way feedbacks between the systems we do so by applying the weap and leap models in the phoenix metropolitan region where water resources are limited and energy intensive our results can be summarized as follows i increasing the temporal resolution from annual to monthly allows capturing the marked seasonality of electricity generation and the associated water requirements while the use of both time steps leads to the simulation of similar annual electricity generations at each station annual aggregates of water deliveries from each source vary with the temporal resolution this difference in sensitivity to the model time step is explained by the presence of more rigid infrastructure constraints and allocation rules in water systems compared to energy systems ii the use of a finer spatial granularity by incorporating each power plant in the weap domain allows simulating the correct water portfolios of power plants which the coarser configuration with a single water demand node for power is unable to capture this leads to differences in simulated energy embedded in water for power generation the accuracy achieved by refining the spatial granularity up to the single power plant can be unnecessary in studies applied to regions with a large spatial extent iii simulations with the coupled models reproduce eia observations of electricity generation better than the standalone approach simulations under the two modeling approaches differ in terms of magnitude and intra annual variability of water allocations from distinct sources to each power plant with relative differences exceeding 100 by representing processes and characteristics of water and energy infrastructure in a more mechanistic fashion coupled models facilitate the simulation of wen systems with different temporal and spatial scales and under possible future scenarios once the spatial granularity and complexity of the domain are fixed and data have been collected we believe that the adoption of coupled instead of standalone approaches is not limited by the scale of the problem but rather by the current low availability of these integrated models software and or data availability the

sources used in this publication to determine the monthly variability in some variables to increase the temporal resolution of weap we derive the monthly variability of srp and cap water allocations from the srp s daily water report srp 2020b and cap s monthly delivery report cap 2020 respectively we estimate the monthly water demands of municipal industrial and power plant sectors from the 2011 water plan of the city of phoenix water services department cpwsd 2011 to estimate the monthly agricultural water demand we use data available for yuma county located in southwestern arizona lahmers and eden 2018 we instead assume uniform demand for the native american node because i its magnitude is comparatively much smaller and ii we could not identify any valuable source to disaggregate it to increase the temporal resolution of leap we assume the monthly variability of the capacity factors to match the observed monthly variability in the respective power plant electricity generation reported in eia 2019 for the energy demand the monthly variability is assumed identical to the variability in i the total load obtained from eia 2020b for the activities unrelated to water and ii water demand as described for weap for the activities related to water for example the monthly variability of the energy required to pump cap water to the municipal node is assumed identical to the monthly variability of the water demand by this node to conduct the standalone simulations and generate inputs for weap we disaggregate spatially and temporally annual estimates of adwr water allocations to all power plants to disaggregate spatially we multiply the total annual water volumes of the nine power plants by a weighting coefficient defined as w p c p c f p w r p p 1 9 c p c f p w r p where c p c f p and w r p are capacity annual mean capacity factor and water withdrawal rate of the p th power plant respectively we use instead the variability in monthly capacity factors available from eia 2019 for the temporal disaggregation 
25729,modeling the interactions between water and energy is crucial to managing holistically these resources here we simulate water allocations and energy dispatch in the metropolitan region of phoenix arizona in 2008 2017 using the weap and leap models under different spatiotemporal resolutions and coupling configurations we find that increasing the temporal resolution from annual to monthly allows capturing seasonal demands which improves the simulation of water allocations from supply sources to all demand nodes the simulation of energy fluxes is instead less sensitive to the model time step representing the domain with higher spatial granularity enhances the ability to model the correct water portfolio of the power plants finally coupling the models to capture two way feedbacks between water and energy systems improves the simulations of electricity generation and in turn of water fluxes while related to phoenix our findings provide useful insights to improve water energy nexus modeling at other sites keywords water energy nexus environmental modeling model resolution model coupling weap leap 1 introduction the water energy nexus wen is a term used to refer collectively to the dependencies and interdependencies between water and energy systems and resources rio carrillo and frei 2009 siddiqi and anadon 2011 u s department of energy 2014 for example water is required for cooling purposes in thermal power plants and is directly used to produce electricity in hydropower plants energy is needed to pump transport and treat water depending on the region each resource could use a significant amount of the other khan et al 2017 for instance in the u s power plants are estimated to be responsible for 13 of the total water consumption while the energy required to pump transport treat and heat water accounts for 13 of the total primary energy consumption dieter et al 2018 sanders and webber 2012 due to the interdependencies between water and energy climate and anthropogenic stressors e g intense storms heatwaves droughts terrorist attacks etc acting on one system can cause cascading impacts on the other system thus significantly compromising the security of both resources over both short daily and sub daily de amorim et al 2018 hatvani kovacs et al 2016 lubega and stillwell 2018 su et al 2020 and long multiple years bartos and chester 2015 van vliet et al 2016a time periods the adoption of a nexus approach to operate and manage water and energy systems has then become increasingly pressing especially considering the additional stresses that climate change population growth and urbanization will exert on these two resources dai et al 2018 rio carrillo and frei 2009 scott 2011 siddiqi and anadon 2011 van vliet et al 2016a a key step for the adoption of a nexus perspective in policy and decision making is to quantify interactions in water energy systems through numerical models khan et al 2017 these allow identifying synergies and limiting tradeoffs both in current conditions and under possible scenarios of climate change demand growth and expansion of technologies and infrastructure given the broad scopes of wen studies models have been developed using several approaches hamiche et al 2016 for instance schuck and green 2002 relied on econometrics principles to quantify the potential of price variation to conserve water and energy resources grubert and webber 2015 used a life cycle assessment method to estimate future changes in water and energy interdependencies according to various policy choices stercke et al 2020 set up a system dynamics model to explore global and local sustainable development goals that are related to the wen khan et al 2018 and gjorgiev and sansavini 2018 developed resource optimization models to simulate the impacts of changes in water temperature on power generation the same goal was pursued by van vliet et al 2016b combining a large scale hydrologic model with a stream temperature and hydropower and thermoelectric models obringer et al 2019 and dale et al 2015 investigated the implications of climate change for the wen using statistical and simulation modeling respectively as summarized in a review study by dai et al 2018 wen applications have been conducted at different temporal resolutions or time steps these include sub hourly real time simulations of water distribution systems and power transmission networks khatavkar and mays 2018 santhosh et al 2014 and analyses at monthly and annual scales of infrastructure expansion effects of policies and environmental impacts jääskeläinen et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 moreover wen models have incorporated the physical components of water and energy systems with various levels of detail for instance simulations of electricity generation and water demands have been performed both at fine spatial resolution or granularity accounting for each power plant e g mu et al 2020 and at a coarser resolution aggregating the generating stations based on fuel type and cooling technologies e g zhou et al 2019 in general the adoption of given temporal resolution and spatial granularity depends on data availability geographical extent of the study area e g city country or transnational and duration of the simulations e g daily annual or multidecadal in a recent review of current efforts and challenges in wen modeling khan et al 2017 noted that the increasing efforts devoted to capture finer resolutions should be carefully considered in terms of the gained simulation accuracy however very limited research has been dedicated to systematically investigate the importance of spatial and temporal resolutions on model accuracy in wen applications khan et al 2017 also reported that most previous studies of integrated water and energy systems rely on a single model to simulate one system and process its outputs to infer information on the other system in particular these authors found that in most studies e g bouckaert et al 2012 faeth et al 2014 mounir et al 2019 modeling tools are utilized to explicitly simulate the energy sector and estimate its water requirements without including an appropriate representation of the water infrastructure its internal dynamics and the interactions with the energy components other work has applied water management models to simulate the water system and post processed its outputs to estimate energy demand for water uses e g baki and makropoulos 2014 guan et al 2020 a more accurate representation of wen interdependencies would instead require the use of models that explicitly simulate each system and are integrated by linking the computer codes i e hard links or exchanging data in real time i e soft links currently integrated or coupled wen models that capture the feedback loops between the two systems have been adopted in a limited number of cases these include both i the coupling with soft links of existing water and energy models van vliet et al 2016b voisin et al 2020 as done with the water evaluation and planning weap and the long range energy alternatives planning leap platforms dale et al 2015 lin et al 2019 liu et al 2021 and ii the development of hard linked water energy optimization khan et al 2018 parkinson and djilali 2015 and integrated assessment liu et al 2019 miara et al 2017 models despite these promising studies their number is still limited and the added values of coupled simulations compared to simpler approaches based on single models and data postprocessing has not been yet properly quantified in this study we contribute to addressing a number of the research gaps discussed above by investigating how the adoption of single and coupled models under different spatial and temporal resolutions affects the accuracy of wen simulations for this aim we focus on long term water allocations and energy dispatch in the metropolitan region of phoenix arizona this is a compelling study site for wen studies for several reasons first it relies on limited water resources mainly provided by energy intensive sources including groundwater and the central arizona project cap that transfers water from the colorado river to central and southern arizona through a 541 km canal bartos and chester 2014 mounir et al 2019 second while renewable energy sources have been increasing aps 2017 srp 2018 electricity is largely generated by thermal power plants that heavily depend on water including the largest nuclear generating station in the country palo verde finally the phoenix metropolitan region has experienced over the last three decades one of the fastest population growth in the u s that was possible by converting agricultural land into urban areas bausch et al 2015 this shift has caused a dramatic change in water and energy demands the work presented here is built upon our previous effort in the phoenix metropolitan region where the weap platform has been applied to simulate food energy water dynamics under a set of future scenarios of water demand and supply guan et al 2020 and the leap model has been used to quantify the implications of future energy mix alternatives on the wen mounir et al 2019 in both studies weap and leap have been applied at an annual resolution for several decades here we first improve the model configurations by i increasing the temporal resolution of both models from annual to monthly ii expanding the weap network from a single water demand node representing all power plants to an explicit representation of all electricity generating stations and iii coupling weap and leap through soft links we then apply the models under different configurations using independent estimates of observed water and energy fluxes in the region as a reference over the period 2008 2017 first we explore the importance of the temporal resolution by comparing simulations of the coupled weap leap model applied with annual and monthly time steps respectively second we quantify the value of increased spatial granularity by contrasting simulations of weap leap where the weap domain has either a single water demand node representing all power plants or multiple nodes each representing a distinct power plant finally we investigate the added value of capturing two way feedbacks between water and energy systems by comparing simulations with the coupled weap leap model and a standalone approach based on the weap model plus a post processing routine designed to calculate energy fluxes after presenting results of these comparisons that are obtained for a specific study region and model type we discuss a number of implications useful to address challenges of wen modeling more generally 2 materials and methods to properly describe our methodology and case study we initially define water and energy models we refer to a water model as a tool that simulates allocation treatment and distribution of water from supply sources to demand nodes as a function of time similarly we define an energy model as a tool that reproduces electricity generation and dispatch from different power plants to satisfy sectorial demands as a function of time while some of the processes simulated in the water model require energy these interactions are not explicitly captured and assumptions must be made on energy availability e g energy is unlimited a similar argument can be made for the energy model water and energy models can be coupled so that fluxes and information between the two systems are exchanged during the simulation in the following we first describe the study area section 2 1 and provide a brief overview of the adopted water and energy models section 2 2 along with their setup in the study region section 2 3 finally we summarize the modeling configurations used for our analyses section 2 4 2 1 study area we apply the water and energy models to the phoenix active management area ama an administrative region of 14 623 km2 fig 1 managed by the arizona department of water resources adwr and created after the approval of the arizona groundwater management act in 1980 to sustainably manage the regional aquifer the phoenix ama is located in central arizona and entirely includes the phoenix metropolitan area and several irrigation districts the water and energy systems of this region are highly interdependent four main sources supply water to the different users including i surface water from the salt and verde rivers managed by the salt river project srp ii surface water from the colorado river transported from lake havasu to southern arizona through the central arizona project cap canal iii groundwater gw and iv reclaimed water rw over the last decade these water sources delivered 2 800 million m3 annually satisfying the municipal 47 of the demand agricultural 33 native american 11 accounting for domestic and agricultural needs of the three largest communities in the region industrial 5 and power plant 4 demands to achieve this energy is required to operate pumping stations wells water wtps and wastewater wwtps treatment plants and water reclamation facilities wrfs totaling a demand of 1 900 gwh per year 3 6 of the total electricity demand mounir et al 2019 energy supply for the region is largely provided by srp and arizona public service aps utilities which operate eight natural gas generating stations and one nuclear power plant within the region boundary along with 22 large power plants located outside of this area mounir et al 2019 electricity is needed to satisfy the residential 39 of the demand commercial 35 and industrial energy sectors 26 the latter one includes the energy provided to the water infrastructure 2 2 overview of weap leap and coupled weap leap modeling platforms the water evaluation and planning weap yates et al 2005 platform is used here as the water model weap is designed to support water resources planning and management at different scales by optimizing water allocations in a network linking supply sources to demand nodes under mass balance and user specified constraints including demand priorities and infrastructure operation rules among others inputs for weap include fixed and time varying variables characterizing water supply e g aquifer properties river discharge water releases from reservoirs demand nodes e g population water intensities and management rules e g canal and reservoir size outputs include several variables describing fluxes of water demand and supply in the network in previous studies weap has been applied at different time steps ranging from annual e g guan et al 2020 to monthly e g lévite et al 2003 and weekly e g dale et al 2015 and at national e g welsch et al 2014 regional e g yates et al 2013a 2013b and metropolitan e g guan et al 2020 scales the long range energy alternatives planning leap heaps 2020 system is used in this study as the energy model leap is an integrated energy economy environment model designed to support energy resource planning and management it simulates energy generation from diverse fuel types to satisfy demand from different end users through simple dispatch rules it requires inputs characterizing demand including activity levels e g population water flow and energy intensities e g per capita or per unit volume energy consumption and supply such as characteristics of power plants e g fuel type capacity percent of energy losses and reserve margins depending on application and data availability inputs can be constant or vary in time leap outputs time series of

regional e g chang et al 2017 and metropolitan e g mounir et al 2019 scales both weap and leap have been used to model water and energy systems under present climate and infrastructural conditions as well as to explore the impacts of future scenarios of demand and supply e g dale et al 2015 esteve et al 2015 guan et al 2020 gul and qureshi 2012 mounir et al 2019 and new policies e g handayani et al 2017 lévite et al 2003 recently the weap and leap platforms have been coupled to allow simulating the interactions of water energy systems at each time step the coupling is achieved through so called links where i leap reads variables from weap to determine energy demand for specific uses e g groundwater pumping and desalination and or constrain hydropower generation and ii weap reads variables from leap to estimate water requirements for thermal cooling and or electricity generation in hydropower stations these links allow both platforms to communicate iteratively at each time step the coupled weap leap modeling platform was applied by dale et al 2015 to investigate the impact of climate change on water and energy consumption in sacramento california finding that electricity imports in the region may increase to 35 during hot dry years 2 3 set up of weap leap and coupled weap leap in the phoenix ama the weap and leap models are set up in our study region by improving the configurations adopted and validated by guan et al 2020 and mounir et al 2019 respectively by increasing temporal resolution and spatial granularity and by coupling the models it is first noted that the words energy and electricity are used interchangeably in the rest of the paper but our simulations involve only electricity to investigate the effect of temporal resolution we apply the models at an annual scale as in the two studies mentioned above and extend the setup also at monthly resolution we derive the monthly srp and cap water allocations and estimate monthly water demands through the data sources provided in table 1 and the assumptions described in the appendix the network representing the water system of the phoenix ama implemented in weap is exemplified in fig 2 a water from srp cap gw and rw sources is directly distributed to the agricultural sector and is treated in wtps prior to being delivered to the municipal native american and industrial sectors power plants receive water from all sources except for srp water allocations from srp are affected by management rules and natural flow in the salt and verde rivers cap water deliveries depend on the entitlements of colorado river water to the region and rw is generated by treating municipal water in wrfs all these rules and time varying flows are implemented in the model so that water supply is limited and constrained water demand is computed as a function of population and per capita water use for the municipal and industrial nodes while it is directly inputted for the native american node using data from adwr 2018 for the power node we adopt two configurations to investigate the effect of spatial granularity of the energy system in the first a single node represents collectively all power plants as in guan et al 2020 while in the second nine nodes are used to simulate the distinct power plants located in the phoenix ama the transmission links between water supply and demand nodes are set up to represent the physical constraints of infrastructure and water management rules the two networks are presented in figs s1 and s2 more details are provided by guan et al 2020 the energy system implemented in leap is summarized in fig 2b energy supply is provided by nine power plants located within the phoenix ama and 22 outside of this region fueled by coal natural gas uranium and renewable resources i e solar radiation wind and water these 31 generating stations are selected because they are entirely or partially owned by srp and aps the main utilities satisfying electricity demand in the region pwcc 2018 srp 2020a table 2 presents the fuel type total capacity srp and aps capacity entitlement mean annual electricity generation and water source for the nine power plants located within the phoenix ama note that for the nine generating stations water withdrawal is equal to water consumption according to the u s energy information administration eia 2018 2020a for each of the 31 power plants we input fuel type capacity entitled to srp and aps merit or dispatch order efficiency and capacity factor we also specify transmission and distribution losses of 5 and a planned reserve margin of 15 the energy demand structure is designed to focus on water energy interactions and facilitate the coupling with weap it includes i residential and commercial sectors which can be related to the municipal and native american water nodes and ii industrial energy sector which is divided into subsectors that are linked to industrial and agricultural water nodes as well as to water infrastructure components that rely on seven different energy intensities to treat transport pump and convey the different water sources based on this setup the electricity demand of the phoenix ama is assumed to be fully satisfied by the power plant capacities entitled to srp and aps this implies that i energy is imported into the phoenix ama only from the 22 external power plants managed by srp and aps and ii leap does not simulate the electricity exported outside of the phoenix ama boundaries associated with capacity entitlements of other energy companies while we assume no limit in fuel availability at each power plant the electricity generated is practically constrained by energy demand and water availability when weap is coupled to leap further details can be found in mounir et al 2019 we investigate the effect of the coupling strategy by first simulating wen interactions in a standalone mode which is illustrated in fig 3 a in this approach we assume that weap is the only available model time series of water demand from the power plants are prescribed externally using estimates from adwr 2018 and the energy needed for water related uses is calculated by post processing outputs of the water model this involves multiplying the water fluxes from the supply sources simulated by weap by the corresponding energy intensities we note that eia provides data on water withdrawals and consumption for the power plants these data are in good agreement with the adwr estimates but incomplete for several years we then utilize adwr data to be consistent in the second approach we run the weap leap model in coupled mode as shown in fig 3b we create a first set of links to connect the nine power plants located within the phoenix ama implemented in leap with the water demand nodes or node depending on the spatial granularity for power in weap in each link we provide the water withdrawal intensity in m3 kwh obtained from eia 2018 2019 for each power plant multiplied by the ratio between the corresponding total capacity and the entitlement of srp and aps at each time step leap simulates electricity generation in the system and weap uses these links to derive all water needs of each power plant for instance the electricity generation simulated by leap in the palo verde power plant to satisfy the demand of the phoenix ama is used by weap to quantify the water required for the full production including exports at this generating station similarly we create a second group of links that connects the water fluxes simulated by weap in 31 transmission links with the energy demand structure in leap and we input the energy intensities in kwh m3 of each water infrastructure component obtained from mounir et al 2019 at each time step the water fluxes simulated by weap are converted into energy required by the water infrastructure components implemented in the leap demand structure by multiplying the water volumes by the corresponding energy intensity for example the water flow simulated by weap in the transmission link from cap to the municipal demand node is used by leap to calculate the associated energy demand for conveyance and treatment 2 4 modeling configurations we adopt four model configurations to investigate our research questions they are summarized in table 3 in two configurations a single water demand node for power generation is used in weap and the coupled weap leap models are applied at annual and monthly resolutions these are labeled as 1a and 1m 1 power node m monthly and a annual time resolution respectively in an alternative configuration labeled as 9m nine demand nodes are implemented in the weap network to simulate the water demand of each power plant located within the phoenix ama and the coupled weap leap models are run at a monthly temporal resolution finally the configuration called standalone is based on the weap model running at a monthly temporal resolution with nine power nodes plus a post processing routine for the estimation of the energy embedded in water as shown in fig 3b simulations under 1a and 1m configurations are compared to test the effect of temporal resolution those under 1m and 9m to evaluate the impact of spatial granularity and those under 9m and standalone to assess the significance of the coupling approach all simulations are performed from 2008 to 2017 we investigate the accuracy of the modeling experiments in multiple ways we compare historical simulations of 1 monthly electricity generation at distinct power plants with values reported by eia and 2 annual water allocations from supply sources to demand sectors including power plants with estimates from adwr table 1 comparison against historical observations is one of the four main strategies for evaluating integrated assessment models recently reported in the review of wilson et al 2021 to quantify differences between the time series we compute correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and absolute percent error ape when contrasting 1a and 1m simulations we present differences between the constant monthly value of several outputs derived under 1a with the time varying values returned by monthly runs of 1m finally we use sankey diagrams to explore potential disagreements in allocations of water and embedded energy from supply sources to the power plants and to verify whether a given model configuration correctly represents water delivery dynamics 3 results 3 1 effects of time resolution we begin by presenting in fig 4 the electricity generated in 2008 2017 in the three largest power plants located within the phoenix ama see table 2 as reported by eia and as simulated under 1a and 1m the monthly means are also reported in the right panels the electricity generation from eia exhibits marked seasonality with a summer peak at the two natural gas power plants santan and redhawk fig 4a d and winter and summer peaks at the palo verde nuclear generating station fig 4e and f this seasonality and its interannual variability are well captured by 1m simulations cc 0 62 and rmse 0 2 twh in contrast as expected 1a simulations plotted in fig 4 by dividing the annual totals by 12 are not able to reproduce seasonal peaks and in turn the associated peaks of water demand for energy production as further described below despite this the annual electricity generations returned by 1a each year are very close to the 1m simulations aggregated annually ape between the two configurations relative to 1m and evaluated annually 2 we now turn our attention to the water allocation for electricity generation note that for this variable observations from adwr are only available at annual resolution and aggregated for all power plants while eia provides data on water withdrawals only for 2014 2017 without detailed information on the water sources in the domain with a single power node weap allocates water to such node only from rw and gw sources the corresponding mean monthly allocations simulated by 1m are shown in fig 5 a while the single monthly averaged value produced by 1a is presented in fig 5b as suggested by the results on electricity generation of fig 4 water volumes required by power plants are characterized by a lower winter and a more pronounced summer peak this resource is largely provided by rw in summer 84 in august and almost equally supplied by both sources in late winter and spring as expected annual simulations by 1a are unable to capture this variability in time and between the two water sources for example 1a underestimates results of 1m by 2 5 million m3 or 21 in august and overestimates them by 2 2 million m3 or 33 in november we note that the increase of simulated rw is caused by a rise of municipal water demand in summer and is likely overestimated due to the assumption made in the weap setup of a constant water consumption rate of 70 for the municipal water demand see supporting information of guan et al 2020 for details this setup should be improved in the future if observed data on the monthly variability of rw will become available as a next step we analyze the differences between 1a and 1m in terms of annual water supply to all uses in particular we focus on water delivered by cap which is the most energy intensive water source the observed and simulated time series of annual water volume supplied by cap to all demand nodes are displayed in fig 6 a which shows that 1m simulations better capture the adwr estimates especially in early years when supply is lower this finding can be explained by the 1m s ability to better represent key water allocation dynamics occurring within each year to demonstrate this we plot in fig 6b and c the cap monthly supplies to the municipal demand node for two representative years to interpret these figures we highlight that i cap has the second lowest allocation priority in the weap setup ii there is a maximum water volume that cap can distribute to each user due to allocation rights 44 million m3 for the municipal user plotted with a red line labeled cap max in fig 6b and c and iii when cap allocations reach this maximum volume an unmet demand exists that is satisfied by the next available water source simulations under 1a lead to constant monthly cap water allocations which could be either smaller than the maximum allocation as in 2010 fig 6b or reach this value as in 2012 fig 6c depending on water demand in the former case cap allocations satisfy all water demand in the latter case another water source is used throughout the year to meet the unmet demand when simulations are instead conducted under 1m the water demand that cap should satisfy labeled demand in fig 6b and c varies each month and the resulting allocations could be either smaller e g august or larger e g december than 1a similar to 1a there are months when cap allocations reach the maximum value as in e g january november and december of 2010 in this year the annual water demand potentially requested to cap is almost identical under both 1a and 1m however this demand is satisfied using solely cap under 1a while a supplementary source is required under 1m because of this difference annual cap allocations simulated in 2010 are larger under 1a and smaller under 1m which is closer to the observation fig 6a as a final note the 1m s ability to better capture intra annual dynamics of water allocations results also in significant differences in the estimation of energy required to transport and treat water this is illustrated in fig 7 which shows that under 1m this energy ranges from a peak of 173 gwh in july to a minimum of 117 gwh in february simulations at the annual scale suggest instead a constant value of 150 gwh with differences of up to 19 with 1m as found for electricity generation when aggregated annually the differences between 1a and 1m are instead small 1 1 3 2 effects of spatial granularity to investigate how the level of spatial details affects wen simulations we compare results of runs with monthly forcings and two weap networks with one 1m and nine 9m power nodes respectively the sankey diagrams of fig 8 display water allocations and embedded energy from supply sources to power demand nodes we first focus on the monthly mean values fig 8a and b and note that the total water use for power generation is practically identical in the two cases 8 87 million m3 however the sources supplying water for power generation change depending on the spatial granularity under 1m rw and gw are simulated as the only water sources that satisfy this demand fig 8a when each power plant is instead represented in the weap network along with the connections to the associated water supply sources 9m cap is utilized as an additional water source fig 8b in particular cap is the main water provider for kyrene and santan power plants table 2 the use of cap water reduces gw and rw allocations when compared to 1m this change results in an increase of 0 23 gwh or 4 of the annual energy demand for water because cap is more energy intensive 1 31 kwh m3 see the appendix in mounir et al 2019 than gw and rw 0 35 kwh m3 and 0 81 kwh m3 respectively we further investigate differences between water allocations and embedded energy by focusing on the months with the lowest february fig 8c and d and highest august fig 8e and f water needs for power generation in february simulations with one power node indicate gw to be the largest water provider for power when the domain includes instead nine nodes changes in water allocations caused by the use of cap water result in similar volumes supplied by gw and rw this redistribution leads in turn to an increase of energy for water treatment and distribution of 0 37 gwh 8 as compared to the simulation under 1m compare fig 8c with 8d in august the larger water use by the municipal sector increases the availability of rw also due to the assumption made to set up weap as discussed in the previous section which is simulated as the major water source for energy generation in both configurations however the use of cap under 9m leads to i lower rw and higher gw volumes compared to 1m and ii a decrease of energy embedded in the water of 0 28 gwh or 3 compare fig 8e with 8f 3 3 importance of coupling the significance of representing two way interactions in models of water and energy systems is evaluated by comparing simulations with the standalone and the coupled model configurations which are both based on a weap network with nine power plants and monthly simulations a key difference between standalone and coupled models relies on the monthly water volumes required by the power plants in the coupled simulations these fluxes are generated at each time step by converting the energy generated by each power plant simulated by leap into water volumes fig 3b in the standalone configuration these fluxes are instead provided as external inputs to weap fig 3a in our study site annual estimates of water withdrawals by all generating stations combined are available from adwr 2018 thus to conduct standalone simulations assumptions are needed to disaggregate these volumes to each power plant and at monthly resolution details are provided in the appendix fig 9 a c shows the water volumes required by the three largest generating stations which are representative of results obtained across all power plants in some cases e g santan fig 9a the standalone simulations are very similar to the coupled model outputs while in others they overestimate e g redhawk fig 9b or underestimate e g palo verde fig 9c the coupled fluxes with smaller and larger ranges between the maximum and minimum monthly values respectively the two configurations exhibit these same differences in terms of simulated electricity generation as displayed in fig 9d f this is expected since the water used for power generation and the electricity produced are linearly related through the water withdrawal intensities of the power plants note that this is a model limitation that should be addressed to incorporate recent evidences of nonlinear behavior by tidwell et al 2019 more importantly fig 9d f displays also monthly estimates of electricity generation from eia that can be used as a reference to assess the accuracy of the modeling approaches it is apparent that simulations with the coupled models capture much better eia observations than those obtained using the standalone mode as quantified by rmse being lower than 0 2 twh and 0 8 twh for the coupled and standalone runs respectively the discrepancies between the water demand of power plants simulated with the two modeling approaches lead to differences in volumes supplied by cap gw and rw to these users along with the associated energy required for treatment and pumping the mean monthly water fluxes from sources to individual power plants are compared in the sankey diagrams of fig 10 the total water used for power generation provided as input in the standalone configuration is slightly larger than the simulated value in the coupled runs 9 34 vs 8 87 million m3 resulting in higher embedded energy 6 08 vs 5 87 gwh to satisfy the water demand the coupled models simulate a larger smaller fraction of rw gw and cap water compared to the standalone case moreover the two configurations predict different portfolios of water sources for some of the power plants for example i redhawk and west phoenix receive water only from rw in the standalone configuration while they are also supplied by gw in the coupled mode and ii palo verde is supplied by a much smaller fraction of gw in the standalone runs the water allocations from the three sources to the power plants exhibit also temporal differences for instance as illustrated in fig 11 a and b the coupled runs simulate an increasing trend of cap water allocations to all power plants from 2008 to 2017 that is not captured by the standalone configuration under this simpler modeling approach constant annual allocations are predicted that result in an overestimation of cap water throughout the simulation period both modeling types simulate an increasing trend of gw allocations from 2008 to 2015 and a decrease afterward fig 11c however simulations under standalone overestimate underestimate gw monthly fluxes simulated by the coupled models below above 4 5 million m3 see scatterplot in fig 11d leading to lower variability of the monthly fluxes the two modeling approaches simulate instead similar allocations of rw to all power plants fig 11e and f despite this differences are found in terms of rw allocations to distinct generating stations this is demonstrated in fig 12 which shows that outputs of the coupled models are both overestimated e g 104 7 in west phoenix and 31 8 in redhawk and underestimated e g 17 9 in palo verde by the standalone runs 4 discussion and summary while obtained for a specific study site our results provide useful information that could support wen modeling efforts in other regions in particular our findings are relevant for models that simulate wen dynamics over spatial extents of metropolitan regions or larger and at timescales larger than one day they are less applicable to real time simulations at sub hourly resolutions of water distribution and power transmission networks at a city or neighborhood scale as e g in the 24 h simulations conducted by santhosh et al 2014 and khatavkar and mays 2018 4 1 data availability and spatiotemporal disaggregation are key as for all modeling exercises increasing the spatial and temporal resolutions of wen models leads to more complex model setups that require a larger amount of data focusing on the u s chini and stillwell 2017 recently highlighted that obtaining data on water and energy systems demand and supply is a challenging task in particular these authors reported that data on energy are available at higher time frequencies and finer spatial granularity than data on water eia reports the main characteristics of most power plants in the country and their monthly electricity generation as well as energy consumption grouped by sectors at the state level hourly energy demands are also publicly available in numerous balancing areas defined as regions where energy demand and supply must be balanced federal energy regulatory commission 2020 data from eia have been crucial for our modeling study at the metropolitan scale table 1 considering instead water eia reports water withdrawals and consumption for the power plants for other uses the main efforts at the national scale are from the united states geological survey usgs and include water data for the nation usgs 2016 and the national water use information program usgs 2010 the water data for the nation initiative publishes almost in real time streamflow data at daily or sub daily resolution across the country these data could be used to estimate water diversions from rivers at high temporal resolutions up to daily which are needed to apply water models data on water withdrawals from reservoirs pumped volumes from wells and allocations of reclaimed water are instead more difficult to obtain since they depend on policies on data sharing adopted by agencies and utilities managing these supply sources the national water use information program reports every five years water use estimates at the county level which are temporal and spatial resolutions often too coarse for wen modeling studies currently no agency has the mandate to collect national water data at the utility or city scale as eia does with energy chini and stillwell 2017 in our effort we have been able to access a relatively extensive dataset on water including estimates of annual water demand and supply data in the ama by adwr daily water diversions from the closest reservoir to phoenix published online by srp and monthly reports with water volumes allocated to different customers by cap see table 1 and appendix even if data are partially available as in our study region they are very often provided at different resolutions and for limited time periods thus assumptions are needed to disaggregate data temporally and spatially and to extrapolate them in time for their use in more detailed wen simulations khan et al 2017 such assumptions could be supported by reports of local water and energy utilities and irrigation districts in our effort we have disaggregated annual estimates of municipal and agricultural water demand from adwr 2018 to monthly scale through monthly fractions derived from a report published online by the city of phoenix which is one of the largest water providers cpwsd 2011 and from a recent report on irrigated agriculture in arizona by lahmers and eden 2018 respectively for the standalone simulations we have also performed a spatial disaggregation of energy related water demand from adwr 2018 by combining power plant characteristics i e capacity capacity factor and water withdrawal rate see appendix available from eia 2018 2019 alternatively open record requests could be sent to utilities to obtain data as done by chini and stillwell 2017 2018 who contacted water utilities in 127 u s cities to conduct a utility scale analysis of drinking water and wastewater flows along with the embedded energy despite this these authors also warned about potential limitations of data provided by utilities in terms of accuracy e g absence of data quality assurance and control and low resolution e g energy data is not collected at sub monthly resolution 4 2 value of higher temporal resolution in our study region fluxes of water and energy systems are characterized by marked intra annual variability largely due to higher demands in hot summers see figs 4 5 and 9 incorporating this higher temporal variability in simulations of water energy interactions provides critical support for the identification of synergies between the two systems that can guide policy and decision makers in the two sectors this is particularly true in regions where there are large fluctuations of demand for both resources and of surface water supply for example simulating the seasonal water availability for power generation provides detailed information on i which type of power plants is more convenient and sustainable to expand or retire in the future aps 2017 srp 2018 ii reservoir operations to optimize hydropower generation demertzi et al 2014 xuan et al 2020 and iii planning of energy generation and in turn of imports and exports federal energy regulatory commission 2020 capturing the seasonality in water and energy demand and supply is also important to i identify optimal water conservation energy efficiency strategies that save energy water while being cost effective e g bartos and chester 2014 escriva bou et al 2018 white and fane 2002 and ii model impacts of heat waves and low water flows on power production bartos and chester 2015 gjorgiev and sansavini 2018 harto and yan 2011 van vliet et al 2016a results of our work also suggest that adopting higher temporal resolutions increases the accuracy of wen simulations this is particularly true for water fluxes and less critical for energy fluxes for instance the use of annual or monthly temporal resolutions results in a difference of up to 5 in the simulated annual cap water supply fig 6 but practically no difference in simulated annual electricity generation at each power plant this finding can be explained considering that water systems are more rigid because there is a direct connection between demand nodes and their supply sources due to both infrastructural constraints and management rules as a consequence if simulations are performed at the monthly resolution the contribution of each supply source to a given demand node can vary dramatically each month depending on water availability since these seasonal dynamics are not captured in annual simulations there may be marked differences in the simulated water volumes provided by each water source throughout the year two main reasons can instead explain why the simulated annual energy supply is less sensitive to the model temporal resolution the first is that electricity is not directly delivered from specific power plants to distinct users because of the presence of the electric grid therefore even if the overall demand changes monthly electricity generations at individual power plants are not importantly affected by demand changes of each user the second reason is that in our study region water infrastructure contributes only 4 to the total energy demand mounir et al 2019 thus even if different water fluxes are simulated at the two resolutions the difference in associated electricity demands is comparatively very small these outcomes obtained for the phoenix ama with thermoelectric power plants can be used as a reference to assess the value of temporal resolution in wen modeling in other study areas water systems rely everywhere on relatively rigid allocation rules and infrastructure constraints we then expect that the simulation of water allocations from supply sources to demand nodes including power plants will be ubiquitously impacted by the temporal resolution conversely modeling energy supply will likely be less impacted by temporal resolution in several regions in the u s because the power grid is always present and the national average of the percentage of total energy use to pump and treat water is 4 as in the phoenix ama electric power research institute epri 2000 the sensitivity of simulated electricity generation to the wen model temporal resolution is expected to increase in regions where water infrastructure is responsible for a substantial portion of the total energy consumption such as in california where this portion is 10 california public utilities commission cpuc 2010 and in areas greatly dependent on desalination like the uae where desalination uses up to 22 of its total electricity siddiqi and anadon 2011 however increasing temporal resolution to monthly is most likely needed when hydropower represents a large share of the electricity generation due to the need to model streamflow seasonality and reservoir operation as also showed by dale et al 2015 4 3 value of higher spatial granularity our analyses show that when the spatial granularity of the water model domain is increased dynamics of water allocations for energy generation are simulated with higher accuracy this suggests that depending on the specific study site a coarse representation of the energy system components in the water model domain may result in ignoring the contribution of distinct water sources for power generation for example in the phoenix ama allocations of cap water to power plants are only captured using the configuration where each power plant is explicitly represented in the water model fig 8 this modeling capability is important for both the electricity companies that manage the generating stations relying on such water supply and the regional management of water resources while increasing the spatial resolution up to the granularity of single power plants enhances model accuracy it also requires a larger amount of data and adds complexity to the model here we show that this effort is valuable and achievable at the scale of a metropolitan region as the spatial extent of the study region increases e g states or countries capturing the dynamics of water allocations to distinct power plants may become unfeasible and in some cases even unnecessary for example yates et al 2013a coupled weap with the regional energy deployment system reeds to quantify water withdrawals by different users including the power system in southwestern u s which encompasses our study site in doing so these authors aggregated power plants by technology type within balancing areas thus using a much coarser description of the energy system than the one adopted in our study however the differences in cap water supplies simulated in our study for the coarse and fine domains represent only 0 06 of the annual water withdrawals over the southwestern u s as a result the simplified modeling setup adopted by yates et al 2013a is justified to simulate the wen in such a large domain without causing any major loss of information finally the need to disaggregate spatially and increase model complexity could be less critical if the main sources of electricity generation come from solar pv and wind turbines because these require very limited water volumes 4 4 utility of coupled simulations in our study coupled and standalone models are compared to our knowledge for the first time in the same wen system we find that the use of coupled models results in more accurate simulations of electricity generation and its water needs than estimations based on a standalone configuration where a water model is used to infer information on the energy system fig 9 this difference is explained by the assumptions made to generate energy related inputs for the water model which as discussed above are obtained by disaggregating annual estimates of water use for power generation from adwr in space to each power plant and time monthly under these assumptions simulations of energy generation and water demand with the standalone and coupled models are similar at some power plants e g santan but they diverge significantly at others including a large underestimation of water withdrawn by the most water consuming generating station palo verde moreover results from these two approaches differ in terms of i water allocations supplied from each source to the power plants this may be a minor issue elsewhere if power plants are supplied by a single source ii energy embedded in treating and pumping these water volumes and iii intra annual variability of the total water allocation from the different sources these differences highlight the limitations of simpler approaches where a model is used to simulate one system in our case water and infer information about the other system energy clearly the limitations of standalone simulations are less critical when there is enough information and confidence on the assumptions made to constrain the model in our case on the time series of water demand from power plants an additional advantage of coupled models is that they allow a more mechanistic representation of processes and characteristics of water and energy infrastructure this has three important benefits first it facilitates the simulation of wen systems characterized by different temporal and spatial scales a process named synchronization by khan et al 2017 the case of the phoenix ama illustrates this point since the coupled model is capable to simulate electricity generation in all power plants supplying the study area including those located outside of the geographical boundaries that contribute to satisfy the local energy demand these external generating stations are instead not included in the standalone configuration because it is quite hard to make assumptions on their contribution the second benefit of the higher mechanistic nature of integrated models is that they are probably the most accurate tool to simulate wen systems under different future scenarios since they allow implementing in a relatively easy fashion changes of infrastructural components e g number and type of power plants construction or decommission of water infrastructure and their management rules new energy and water efficiency technologies and modifications of water and energy demands in the different sectors among other features the value of this capability has been shown for example by yates et al 2013a who used the coupled reeds weap models to simulate capacity expansion and energy generation according to different future electricity mix scenarios along with water allocations under drought conditions lastly coupled models could be beneficial in data scarce regions to simulate processes for which data are not available provided that reliable assumptions are made on their parameterization through e g values reported in literature or relations with population served 5 conclusions the simulation of the interactions between water and energy systems is crucial to identify synergies and adopt a holistic management approach in this study we investigate how the accuracy of wen simulations is affected by the spatiotemporal resolution and use of coupled models that capture two way feedbacks between the systems we do so by applying the weap and leap models in the phoenix metropolitan region where water resources are limited and energy intensive our results can be summarized as follows i increasing the temporal resolution from annual to monthly allows capturing the marked seasonality of electricity generation and the associated water requirements while the use of both time steps leads to the simulation of similar annual electricity generations at each station annual aggregates of water deliveries from each source vary with the temporal resolution this difference in sensitivity to the model time step is explained by the presence of more rigid infrastructure constraints and allocation rules in water systems compared to energy systems ii the use of a finer spatial granularity by incorporating each power plant in the weap domain allows simulating the correct water portfolios of power plants which the coarser configuration with a single water demand node for power is unable to capture this leads to differences in simulated energy embedded in water for power generation the accuracy achieved by refining the spatial granularity up to the single power plant can be unnecessary in studies applied to regions with a large spatial extent iii simulations with the coupled models reproduce eia observations of electricity generation better than the standalone approach simulations under the two modeling approaches differ in terms of magnitude and intra annual variability of water allocations from distinct sources to each power plant with relative differences exceeding 100 by representing processes and characteristics of water and energy infrastructure in a more mechanistic fashion coupled models facilitate the simulation of wen systems with different temporal and spatial scales and under possible future scenarios once the spatial granularity and complexity of the domain are fixed and data have been collected we believe that the adoption of coupled instead of standalone approaches is not limited by the scale of the problem but rather by the current low availability of these integrated models software and or data availability the

sources used in this publication to determine the monthly variability in some variables to increase the temporal resolution of weap we derive the monthly variability of srp and cap water allocations from the srp s daily water report srp 2020b and cap s monthly delivery report cap 2020 respectively we estimate the monthly water demands of municipal industrial and power plant sectors from the 2011 water plan of the city of phoenix water services department cpwsd 2011 to estimate the monthly agricultural water demand we use data available for yuma county located in southwestern arizona lahmers and eden 2018 we instead assume uniform demand for the native american node because i its magnitude is comparatively much smaller and ii we could not identify any valuable source to disaggregate it to increase the temporal resolution of leap we assume the monthly variability of the capacity factors to match the observed monthly variability in the respective power plant electricity generation reported in eia 2019 for the energy demand the monthly variability is assumed identical to the variability in i the total load obtained from eia 2020b for the activities unrelated to water and ii water demand as described for weap for the activities related to water for example the monthly variability of the energy required to pump cap water to the municipal node is assumed identical to the monthly variability of the water demand by this node to conduct the standalone simulations and generate inputs for weap we disaggregate spatially and temporally annual estimates of adwr water allocations to all power plants to disaggregate spatially we multiply the total annual water volumes of the nine power plants by a weighting coefficient defined as w p c p c f p w r p p 1 9 c p c f p w r p where c p c f p and w r p are capacity annual mean capacity factor and water withdrawal rate of the p th power plant respectively we use instead the variability in monthly capacity factors available from eia 2019 for the temporal disaggregation
