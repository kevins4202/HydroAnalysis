832003 pr china handling editor dr b e clothier water use efficiency wue is key indicator of balance between crop water demand and artificial water input in irrigation management this makes specific importance of accurate evaluating largely diverse wue of plants differently distant from the drip tube in the enlarged lateral space els drip irrigation wheat systems to achieve this we compared wue calculated from differentiation of stable carbon isotopes δ13c wue13 c with those from grain yield wueyield or dry matter accumulation wuedm per evaportranspirated water in a two year field trial with different els patterns in xinjiang seven patterns were included the normal els pattern by simply expanding drip tube to plant rows ratio from four tr4 conventional pattern to six tr6 and eight tr8 with row space rs of 15 cm modified els by narrowing rs nrs to 10 cm to leave large inter block space ibs of 35 cm and 45 cm for tr6l and tr8l respectively and shortened ibs to 25 cm of tr6s and tr8s compared with tr4 els effectively improved all wue parameters due to significant wue increase in the outermost rows to drip tube probably as a result of reduced received irrigation water riw this led to large variations in wue between rows with inter row coefficient of variation c v of 6 2 13 6 for tr6 and tr8 only 0 2 2 3 for tr4 respectively the modified els patterns effectively reduced inter row c v to 2 9 7 0 for tr6l and tr8l and 2 2 5 7 for tr6s and tr8s respectively nrs and sibs effectively reduced the inter row wue heterogeneity and facilitated overall yield and wue considering satisfied wue and high yield tr6s was recommended the optimum els drip irrigation pattern moreover wue13 c was less fluctuant in response to reduced riw as wuedm and wueyield and was suggested proper indicator reflecting wue of different rows in els patterns the results should help guide better wue evaluation under complex conditions and optimize more water saving and productive drip irrigated wheat patterns keywords drip irrigation plants and drip tube configuration spring wheat water use efficiency water management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water shortage has become a global problem wang et al 2013a mphande et al 2021 leading to large gap between demand of increasing production and shortage of water resources in agricultural production yu et al 2020 xue et al 2019 abbate et al 2004 the situation is especially severe in arid and semi arid areas such as xinjiang uygur autonomous region china where the annual rainfall is only one tenth of annual evaporation deng et al 2006 lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 to cope with water shortage a variety of water saving irrigation practices are developed of which the drip irrigation is the most efficient and broadly extended one chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 lv et al 2019 for instance drip irrigation is widely adopted since its first launch in wheat production in xinjiang in 2008 chen et al 2015 unlike the large size and wide row space drip irrigated crops such as corn and cotton of which one drip tube usually serves one or two rows of plants in conventional drip irrigated wheat one drip tube has to serve four rows drip tube to plant rows tr ratio of 4 with a row space rs of 15 cm to reduce usage of drip tube chen et al 2015 to further reduce the cost of drip tube we developed an enlarged lateral space els irrigation pattern of tr5 at the same row space of 15 cm which performs similar grain yield to tr4 lv et al 2019 recently we further developed a more profitable els pattern of tr6s by narrowing rs to 10 cm and shortening the inter block space ibs to 25 cm supplementary fig 1 which showed satisfied productivity and profit with much less drip tube input than tr4 wan et al 2022 water use efficiency wue is one key indicator guiding irrigation in crop production since wue is highly in accordance with water deficit li et al 2018 si et al 2020 and well reflects the balance between plant growth in most cases grain yield and water supply zhang et al 2020 namely less irrigation usually benefits wue but with negative effect on yield abbate et al 2004 si et al 2020 chen et al 2015 therefore it is very important to monitor wue in irrigation decisions however it becomes very difficult to accurate quantify the largely varied wue of plants at rows differently distant to drip tube due to the large fluctuation of grain yield and distribution of irrigation water between rows in the els patterns lv et al 2019 in drip irrigation system accepted water amount by wheat plants highly depends on the distance between drip tube and wheat rows lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 and wheat far away from the drip tube receives less irrigation water and yield less payero et al 2008 wang et al 2013b lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 in this sense it is very important to accurately evaluating wue of each row differently distant to drip tube to guide the each irrigation in els drip irrigation patterns the soil water balance method has been widely used in evaluation of crop wue xue et al 2019 wang et al 2019 huang et al 2005 chen et al 2015 however this method seems inapplicable in evaluating wue of different rows under els pattern since it is hard to accurately and conveniently quantify the evapotranspiration of different rows of wheat plants in drip irrigation the infiltration form of soil moisture largely differs with the traditional border irrigation due to the limited moistening area around the drip tip yang et al 2020 this leads to certain difference in moisture or received irrigation water at different distance to the drip tube which further causes large difference in evapotranspiration and wue of plants in els patterns lv et al 2019 previously we estimated the received irrigation water riw by monitoring soil volumetric water content to indicate the amount of water absorbed by wheat plants at different rows lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 this could be inaccurate since we assume that wheat roots are strictly evenly distributed in the soil of the given row which obviously is biased moreover to monitor soil moisture is quite time and labor cost the remote sensing technology and penman monteith model are reported to capable to accurately assess crop evapotranspiration mohammad 2015 mohammed et al 2022 unfortunately these methods are regional scale oriented thus incapable to measure evapotranspiration in such a small scale as at a row level of wheat crop the differentiation of stable carbon isotopes δ13c could provide with an effective way to explore wue between rows under els drip irrigation system the proportion of two carbon stable isotopes 13c and 12c in nature is constant l2c was 98 9 and l3c was 1 1 the non uniformity of carbon isotopes within different compounds could therefore reveal the information about the physical chemical and metabolic processes of carbon transformations farquhar et al 1984 the abundance of 13c relative to l2c in plant tissue is commonly less than in nature co2 which indicates that carbon isotope fractionating occurs during transformation of co2 to biomass farquharet al 1984 wright et al 1998 it has been well accepted that δ13c value in leaf is an ideal indicator of plant wue reflecting the long term internal carbon fixation vs water evapotranspiration in leaves chen et al 2014 sun and guy 1996 wright et al 1998 previous derived the quantification equation of wue and δ13c based on the relevant research on wue and carbon isotope composition in wheat farquhar et al 1982 1984 1989 it should be noted that the mass spectrometry technology developed very fast in past year freund and hegeman 2017 ren 2020 which allows analyzing carbon isotope in rapid accurate and low amount of sample way fullana pericàs et al 2022 ren 2020 oteng frimpong et al 2015 this led to wide adoption of the carbon isotope differentiation method into researches of plant wue chen et al 2014 impa et al 2005 wang et al 2013a cabrera bosquet et al 2007 given carbon fixation and water evapotranspiration occurs in plant tissues there is no need to measure soil water content and evaporation to evaluate wue using the carbon isotope differentiation method chen et al 2014 we then assume that the carbon isotope differentiation method could conveniently accurately and directly evaluate wue of wheat plants differently distant to drip tube in els patterns to test this hypothesis we evaluated performances of the wue indicators in a two year spring wheat trial with different drip irrigation patters the objectives were i to evaluate the variation of wue between wheat rows based on the stable carbon isotope δ13c and based on yield and dry matter accumulation that calculated by riw under the els drip irrigation systems ii to analyze the relationship between yield and wue under different drip irrigation systems and iii to evaluate the accuracy of different wue calculations the results should provide better wue indicator of crops under uneven irrigation and further optimize of irrigation strategy in the els drip irrigation patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1

shown in table 1 two locally widely planted spring wheat cultivars xinchun 44 and xinchun 22 were selected the former owns much higher variation of grain yield between different rows than the later in the preliminary experiment the sowing dates were 28th march and 1st april in 2019 and 2020 respectively and the harvest dates were 15th july in both year seven patterns were designed based on the configurations of drip tube vs row number and row space of the plants as shown in supplementary fig 1 in detail the locally adopted drip irrigation system of one drip tube serving four rows of wheat tr4 with row space of 15 cm and lateral space of 60 cm was set as the control ck two normally enlarged lateral space els patterns were designed by separately increasing the plant rows served by single tube to six tr6 with lateral space of 90 cm and eight tr8 with lateral space of 120 cm at the same row space of 15 cm as tr4 two modified patterns of els without changing the lateral space were further designed to reduced the watering distance from the drip tube to the outermost row by narrowing row space nrs from 15 cm to 10 cm in this case the two nrs patterns included tr6l with larger inter block space ibs of 35 cm since the row space was narrowed to 10 cm at the lateral space of 90 cm and tr8l with large ibs of 45 cm at row space of 10 cm and lateral space of 120 cm the nrs patterns were further optimized by shortening ibs sibs from 35 cm tr6l and 45 cm tr8l to 25 cm to give two sibs patterns tr6s and tr8s the experiment was a split plot design with wheat cultivar as main factor and configuration pattern as sub plot factor each treatment was conducted with three replicates the plant density was 180 104 plants ha 1 since the total row number in the same size of plot is the same in tr4 tr6 tr8 tr6l and tr8l the same grain number was sowing in each row but there was more rows in tr6s and tr8s and grain number per row was according reduced to ensure the unity of plant density in different pattern we have developed wheat precision planters for each drip irrigation patter the electronic control system of precise sowing quantity was applied in each wheat precision planters to ensure that the target sowing density the synchronous drip tubes positioning unit was also equipped in each planter in addition each plot size was higher than 100 m2 for the convenience of mechanical sowing in both years the irrigation and fertilization strategies followed our previous report and local recommendations as shown in table 2 liu et al 2013 jin et al 2014 lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 2 2 sampling and measurements 2 2 1 water use efficiency wue calculated from discrimination of stable carbon isotopes δ13c wue13 c the test sample was prepared according to the method of he et al 2012 with a few modifications leaves of 20 wheat plants were taken in each row at the maturity stage followed by fully dried at 70 to constant weight the leaves were then ground and passed through 80 mesh sieve the value of δ13c was measured by a sercon 20 22 stable isotope mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific cn usa pdb pee dee belemnite was taken as standard for determination of δ13c in plants and air using the wue13 c of wheat was calculated using the quantitative equation for c3 plants eq 1 farquhar et al 1982 1984 1989 1 w u e 13 c mmolc mol 1 h 2 o 1 θ c

respiration of other organs which is taken 0 3 evans 1983 t and rh refer to average daytime leaf temperature and relative air humidity in canopy respectively chen et al 2014 hu et al 2010 the automatic temperature and humidity recorder taws1000 sw compbell scientific usa was installed in the field used to record the temperature and canopy air humidity in the whole growth period of wheat among them leaf temperature is generally calculated by crop canopy air temperature hu et al 2010 chen et al 2014 abbate et al 2004 allen 2003 for wheat the actual leaf temperature is about 72 of the canopy air temperature allen 2003 in addition 0 611 is the saturated vapor pressure on the pure horizontal surface at t 0 2 2 2 the received irrigation water riw and wue calculated from grain yield wueyield and dry matter accumulation wuedm and water expense the pr2 tubes special tubes for profile probe type delta t devices cambridge england were pre embedded at the center of soil of each row after seeding for measurement of soil water content we measured the soil volume water content 0 100 cm soil layer at each row just after each irrigation event and just before the next irrigation event following our previous method lv et al 2019 the soil volume water content after irrigation multiplying soil volume allocated to each row of wheat gave the irrigation amount of different wheat rows after irrigation the soil volume water content before irrigation multiplying soil volume allocated to each row of wheat gave the residual irrigation amount of different wheat rows after irrigation lv et al 2019 the total amount of the received irrigation water riw during the whole growth period was the difference in the total irrigation amount mm and the total residual irrigation mm lv et al 2019 the evapotranspiration etc was calculated according to eq 2 rana and katerji 2000 kresović et al 2016 2 e t c i p c r r f d p δ s etc is the evapotranspiration mm of wheat over the whole growth period the parameter i represents the total irrigation amount mm and riw gives the total irrigation amount at different wheat rows in this study p is rainfall over the whole growing period mm in this experiment rainfall of each row was the row space based mean of total rainfall since rainfall distributed evenly in the field cr dp and rf are capillary rise mm percolation mm and runoff mm in the field respectively in the experimental site there is no intense rainfall and therefore no runoff and the local groundwater table is very low and no drainage occurs in normal years cr rf and dp are then set zero wan et al 2022 δs is the change of soil moisture content before sowing and after harvest mm thereafter wueyield and wuedm were separately calculated as grain yield kg and total biomass divided by etc mm du et al 2008 payero et al 2008 kresović et al 2016 2 2 3 grain yield dry matter accumulation and harvest index hi at maturity plants of 2 m in length of each row was separately harvested for determining grain yield of the corresponding row g m 2 the overall yield kg ha 1 was the sum of yield of all rows in addition twenty plants in each row were harvested at maturity and oven dried at 85 to constant weight to get dry matter accumulation of each row the overall dry matter accumulation kg ha 1 was the sum of dry matter accumulation of all rows harvest index hi was calculated as grain weight kg divided by total dry matter accumulation lv et al 2019 2 3 statistical analysis the data of different wheat rows under different drip irrigated systems were submitted to one way analysis of variance anova to compare the differences among patterns and among different wheat rows using the software statistical product and service solutions spss inc chicago il usa all charts were generated with microsoft excel office 2016 and origin 9 originlab usa 3 results 3 1 enlarging lateral space els effectively improved overall wue of wheat all els planting patterns tr6 tr6l tr6s tr8 tr8l and tr8s generally increased the overall wue13 c in relation to the conventional patter of tr4 fig 1 here the normal els planting patterns tr6 and tr8 significantly improved wue13 c as compared to tr4 with the only exception that there was no significant difference in wue13 c between tr6 and tr4 in xinchun 44 in 2019 in most cases narrowing row space nrs patterns of tr6l and tr8l also improved wue13 c in relation to tr4 but the increases were less than that the corresponding normal els planting patterns further shortening inter block space sibs planting patterns of tr6s and tr8s also increased wue13 c however there was no significant difference in wue13 c between the sibs patterns and tr4 with exceptions that wue13 c of tr4 was significantly lower than tr8s and tr6s in xinchun 22 in 2019 and significantly lower than tr6s in xinchun 44 in 2020 3 2 els improved wue was largely ascribed to the much increased wue of plants along with distance to drip tube wue13 c generally increased from the innermost rows to the outermost rows fig 1 this could be further proved that along with distance from drip tube wue obviously increased in terms of 13c differentiation wue13 c grain yield wueyield and biomass wuedm per unit water consumption with few exceptions at 17 5 cm away from the drip tube fig 2 in detail in relation to at 7 5 cm away from drip tube the wue13 c increment percentage was 1 5 2 9 5 8 9 17 and 15 27 at 17 5 cm 22 5 cm 27 5 cm 37 5 cm and 52 5 cm from the drip tube respectively wueyield showed more obvious trend than wue13 c with increment percentage of 2 11 20 35 36 72 53 114 and 50 180 respectively wuedm also performed stronger increase than wue13 c the increment percentage were 8 5 5 20 29 67 27 72 and 41 99 respectively it is very interesting that though there was large variations in wue within different rows distant to drip tube in the normal non narrowing row space els patterns the spatial wue heterogeneity was obviously minimized by nrs and sibs fig 1 and fig 2 for instance in the two year trials the coefficient of variation among the rows in wue13 c c v13 c of tr4 normal els patterns tr6 and tr8 nrs patterns tr6l and tr8l and sibs patterns tr6s and tr8s were 0 2 2 3 were 0 2 2 3 6 2 13 6 2 9 7 0 and 2 2 5 7 respectively fig 1 3 3 the received irrigation water riw by wheat plants decreased along with the distance to drip tube the received irrigation water riw at each wheat plant row showed an almost linearly gradient decrease along with the distance from the drip tube fig 3 as compared to at 7 5 cm from the drip tube r1 riw reduced 6 9 30 34 43 46 62 65 and 85 89 at 17 5 cm 22 5 cm 27 5 cm 37 5 cm and 52 5 cm from the drip tube respectively 4 discussion 4 1 els effectively improved overall wue but with high inter row wue heterogeneity improving water use efficiency wue is of key importance to balance the water consumption for maintaining high crop productivity and the shortage of irrigation water resource in arid and semi arid agricultural regions zhao et al 2020 xue et al 2019 yang et al 2020 morison et al 2008 wang et al 2019 in our previous studies we suggested more profitable irrigation systems with enlarged lateral space els which gained similar yield to tr4 one tube serving five rows of wheat tr5 lv et al 2019 and one tube serving six rows by shortening row space tr6s wan et al 2022 however the wue performance was less considered on these systems here we observed that wue13 c calculated from the differentiation of 13c was largely improved by els as compared with the conventional tr4 pattern fig 1 we further proposed that the improved wue13 c was related to the increased wue of plants at rows distant to the drip tube this was approved by the increasing wue in terms of wue13 c wueyield grain yield per mm evaportranspiration water and wuedm biomass produced per mm evaportranspiration water along with the distance to the drip tube fig 2 wue is closely related to responses of crop to water status and moderate water shortage usually resulted in more efficient usage of water abbate et al 2004 zhang et al 2020 pate 2001 anyia et al 2007 farquharet al 1984 our report here well agreed this conclusion since the received irrigation water riw gradually descended along with distance to drip tube as shown in fig 3 this also suggested that els tended to raise the risk of large fluctuations in wue between different rows distant to drip tube moreover the inter row coefficient of variation c v of yield wan et al 2022 paralleled with inter row c v of wue fig 1 indicating that the inter row heterogeneity of wue could be detrimental to grain yield stability 4 2 wue negatively correlated to grain yield of wheat at different rows with reducing use of drip tube els also resulted in gradient grain yield decrease along with distance to the drip tube fig 4a our previous experiments also revealed that grain yield obvious descended from the innermost rows to the outermost rows in els patterns lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 therefore negative relationships existed between wue in the name of wue13 c wueyield and wuedm and grain yield as shown in fig 5 this was in line with the conclusions of si et al 2020 abbate et al 2004 and chen et al 2015 under moderate drought stress conditions while disagreed by yu et al 2020 that there was no relationship between wue and yield it is generally accepted that drought tends to reduce crop productivity reversely but improve wue zhang et al 2020 abbate et al 2004 pate 2001 anyia et al 2007 farquhar et al 1984 it should be noted that the wue was not linearly correlated to the grain yield fig 5 in most cases the amplitude of increased wue was higher than amplitude of decreased yield fig 6a1 this should be acceptable since the decline of yield was much less than riw by wheat plants along with the distance from drip tube in our previous study lv et al 2019 this also indicated that inter row wue variation was greater than inter row yield variation but was close to inter row riw variation in another word the influence of riw on wue was greater than grain yield in our els patterns 4 3 wue13 c is more reliable in evaluating wheat wue of different rows than wuedm and wueyield it was also observed that sensitivity of the three wue indicators in response to reducing riw was different fig 6b1 here wueyield was most sensitive to less water followed by wuedm and then wue13 c this is reasonable since wue13 c was more related to co2 assimilation amount per transpiration water wang et al 2013a ali and talukder 2008 qiu et al 2008 which was dependant on the capacity of photosynthesis and the function of stoma in leaves chen et al 2014 farquhar et al 1982 1984 1989 moreover wue13 c is calculated according to a relative long term interaction consequence between carbon fixation and water consumption of leaves chen et al 2014 farquhar et al 1982 1984 1989 namely the data of evaportranspiration is not included in the calculation of wue13 c and the measurement of soil water supply and plant water consumption do not affect the value of wue13 c reversely wueyield and wuedm is defined as grain yield or biomass accumulation per unit water consumption wang et al 2013a plant growth is very sensitive to water shortage wang et al 2013a lv et al 2019 chen et al 2015 wan et al 2022 as the deposit of leaf photo assimilates in plants chen et al 2021 yang et al 2020 liu et al 2016 it is accepted that biomass of plants at the distant rows is easily depressed by water deficit lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 moreover water status usually fluctuated largely over the cycle of irrigation drying evapotranspiration re irrigation especially for the distant rows to the drip tube in the els drip irrigation patterns lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 this further affected the plant growth and biomass accumulation in wheat this could well explain why the sensitivity in wuedm was much higher than wue13 c in response to reduction in riw in distant rows to drip tube in els patterns fig 6b1 furthermore grain yield is the product of total biomass and harvest index hi wheeler et al 1996 plaut et al 2004 or product of ears per unit area grain number per ear and the 1000 grain weight si et al 2020 lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 then yield is a more complex trait than biomass under environmental fluctuations such as drought high temperature the photo assimilates temporarily stored in vegetative organs of cereal crops usually stored in stems and sheaths as part of biomass could re translocate into grain to partially compensate the depressed biomass accumulation si et al 2020 moll et al 1994 lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 in our case the loss of biomass was higher than grain yield of the outermost rows of wheat plants which frequently suffered from severe water deficit over the whole growth stage in the els drip irrigation patterns fig 4a and fig 4b moreover harvest index hi was obviously improved for wheat plants distant to the drip tube fig 4c therefore it is also reasonable that wueyield was much more sensitive to wuedm of plants distant to drip tube in the els patterns fig 6b1 it should also be noted that the evaluation of wueyield and wuedm could be not so accurate since riw might not truly reflect the water absorbed by wheat plants at the given row there were at least two uncertainties water was highly movable in soil between rows and roots exhibited hydrotropic growth li et al 2020 loomis and ewan 1936 henry and hooker 1915 and highly extended across other rows payero et al 2008 wang et al 2013b lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 therefore wue13 c could be more accurate wue indicator than wueyield and wuedm for plants at different rows in drip irrigation system since wue13 c evaluation is the reflection of the long term accumulative internal gas exchange co2 δ13c and water in leaf cabrera bosquet et al 2007 chen et al 2014 farquhar et al 1982 1984 1989 impa et al 2005 sun and guy 1996 wang et al 2013a and no soil moisture monitoring is needed chen et al 2014 of course to quantify wueyield and wuedm via wue13 c would be very helpful to better guide irrigation scheme in els system in the future however cluster analysis shows that the correlation coefficient is not high supplementary fig 3 therefore more accurate quantitative methods need to be further studied 4 4 nrs and sibs effectively reduced inter row wue heterogeneity though els resulted in high heterogeneity of wue between rows and meanwhile improved the overall wue as compared the conventional tr4 pattern fig 1 the shortened row space tr6l and tr8l and their combination with shortened block space tr6s and tr8s well stabilized the large variations in wue between rows as compared to the normal els patterns tr6 and tr8 considering the negative relationship between wue and grain yield of different rows of plants tr6s was recommended the best els drip irrigation pattern with satisfied wue and high yield and profit in xinjiang as reported previously similar grain yield and higher profit wan et al 2022 was received in tr6s with higher wue than the conventional tr4 pattern as reported here it has to be mentioned that in the present study the same amount of water was input in all irrigation patterns which followed the conventional tr4 pattern the shorten row space els patterns such as tr6s could potentially be more water saving therefore better irrigation strategy for tr6s should be developed in the future 5 conclusion we found that enlarging lateral space els can effectively improve wue13 c but increase the heterogeneity c v of wue13 c among the rows this was approved by the increasing wue13 c wueyield grain yield per mm evaportranspiration water and wuedm biomass produced per mm evaportranspiration water along with the distance to the drip tube narrowing row space nrs or nrs in combination with shortening the inter block space sibs can obviously reduce the heterogeneity of wue13 c among the rows considering that wue negatively related to grain yield in the conditions of both between rows and between irrigation patterns to balance satisfied wue and high yield as well as profit tr6s was recommended the best els pattern for drip irrigation in xinjiang wue13 c is the most stable index to water loss and it is the best index to reflect the difference of wue among rows however the accurate quantification of wueyield and wuedm based on wue13 c is not clear which needs further exploration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

832003 pr china handling editor dr b e clothier water use efficiency wue is key indicator of balance between crop water demand and artificial water input in irrigation management this makes specific importance of accurate evaluating largely diverse wue of plants differently distant from the drip tube in the enlarged lateral space els drip irrigation wheat systems to achieve this we compared wue calculated from differentiation of stable carbon isotopes δ13c wue13 c with those from grain yield wueyield or dry matter accumulation wuedm per evaportranspirated water in a two year field trial with different els patterns in xinjiang seven patterns were included the normal els pattern by simply expanding drip tube to plant rows ratio from four tr4 conventional pattern to six tr6 and eight tr8 with row space rs of 15 cm modified els by narrowing rs nrs to 10 cm to leave large inter block space ibs of 35 cm and 45 cm for tr6l and tr8l respectively and shortened ibs to 25 cm of tr6s and tr8s compared with tr4 els effectively improved all wue parameters due to significant wue increase in the outermost rows to drip tube probably as a result of reduced received irrigation water riw this led to large variations in wue between rows with inter row coefficient of variation c v of 6 2 13 6 for tr6 and tr8 only 0 2 2 3 for tr4 respectively the modified els patterns effectively reduced inter row c v to 2 9 7 0 for tr6l and tr8l and 2 2 5 7 for tr6s and tr8s respectively nrs and sibs effectively reduced the inter row wue heterogeneity and facilitated overall yield and wue considering satisfied wue and high yield tr6s was recommended the optimum els drip irrigation pattern moreover wue13 c was less fluctuant in response to reduced riw as wuedm and wueyield and was suggested proper indicator reflecting wue of different rows in els patterns the results should help guide better wue evaluation under complex conditions and optimize more water saving and productive drip irrigated wheat patterns keywords drip irrigation plants and drip tube configuration spring wheat water use efficiency water management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water shortage has become a global problem wang et al 2013a mphande et al 2021 leading to large gap between demand of increasing production and shortage of water resources in agricultural production yu et al 2020 xue et al 2019 abbate et al 2004 the situation is especially severe in arid and semi arid areas such as xinjiang uygur autonomous region china where the annual rainfall is only one tenth of annual evaporation deng et al 2006 lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 to cope with water shortage a variety of water saving irrigation practices are developed of which the drip irrigation is the most efficient and broadly extended one chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 lv et al 2019 for instance drip irrigation is widely adopted since its first launch in wheat production in xinjiang in 2008 chen et al 2015 unlike the large size and wide row space drip irrigated crops such as corn and cotton of which one drip tube usually serves one or two rows of plants in conventional drip irrigated wheat one drip tube has to serve four rows drip tube to plant rows tr ratio of 4 with a row space rs of 15 cm to reduce usage of drip tube chen et al 2015 to further reduce the cost of drip tube we developed an enlarged lateral space els irrigation pattern of tr5 at the same row space of 15 cm which performs similar grain yield to tr4 lv et al 2019 recently we further developed a more profitable els pattern of tr6s by narrowing rs to 10 cm and shortening the inter block space ibs to 25 cm supplementary fig 1 which showed satisfied productivity and profit with much less drip tube input than tr4 wan et al 2022 water use efficiency wue is one key indicator guiding irrigation in crop production since wue is highly in accordance with water deficit li et al 2018 si et al 2020 and well reflects the balance between plant growth in most cases grain yield and water supply zhang et al 2020 namely less irrigation usually benefits wue but with negative effect on yield abbate et al 2004 si et al 2020 chen et al 2015 therefore it is very important to monitor wue in irrigation decisions however it becomes very difficult to accurate quantify the largely varied wue of plants at rows differently distant to drip tube due to the large fluctuation of grain yield and distribution of irrigation water between rows in the els patterns lv et al 2019 in drip irrigation system accepted water amount by wheat plants highly depends on the distance between drip tube and wheat rows lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 and wheat far away from the drip tube receives less irrigation water and yield less payero et al 2008 wang et al 2013b lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 in this sense it is very important to accurately evaluating wue of each row differently distant to drip tube to guide the each irrigation in els drip irrigation patterns the soil water balance method has been widely used in evaluation of crop wue xue et al 2019 wang et al 2019 huang et al 2005 chen et al 2015 however this method seems inapplicable in evaluating wue of different rows under els pattern since it is hard to accurately and conveniently quantify the evapotranspiration of different rows of wheat plants in drip irrigation the infiltration form of soil moisture largely differs with the traditional border irrigation due to the limited moistening area around the drip tip yang et al 2020 this leads to certain difference in moisture or received irrigation water at different distance to the drip tube which further causes large difference in evapotranspiration and wue of plants in els patterns lv et al 2019 previously we estimated the received irrigation water riw by monitoring soil volumetric water content to indicate the amount of water absorbed by wheat plants at different rows lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 this could be inaccurate since we assume that wheat roots are strictly evenly distributed in the soil of the given row which obviously is biased moreover to monitor soil moisture is quite time and labor cost the remote sensing technology and penman monteith model are reported to capable to accurately assess crop evapotranspiration mohammad 2015 mohammed et al 2022 unfortunately these methods are regional scale oriented thus incapable to measure evapotranspiration in such a small scale as at a row level of wheat crop the differentiation of stable carbon isotopes δ13c could provide with an effective way to explore wue between rows under els drip irrigation system the proportion of two carbon stable isotopes 13c and 12c in nature is constant l2c was 98 9 and l3c was 1 1 the non uniformity of carbon isotopes within different compounds could therefore reveal the information about the physical chemical and metabolic processes of carbon transformations farquhar et al 1984 the abundance of 13c relative to l2c in plant tissue is commonly less than in nature co2 which indicates that carbon isotope fractionating occurs during transformation of co2 to biomass farquharet al 1984 wright et al 1998 it has been well accepted that δ13c value in leaf is an ideal indicator of plant wue reflecting the long term internal carbon fixation vs water evapotranspiration in leaves chen et al 2014 sun and guy 1996 wright et al 1998 previous derived the quantification equation of wue and δ13c based on the relevant research on wue and carbon isotope composition in wheat farquhar et al 1982 1984 1989 it should be noted that the mass spectrometry technology developed very fast in past year freund and hegeman 2017 ren 2020 which allows analyzing carbon isotope in rapid accurate and low amount of sample way fullana pericàs et al 2022 ren 2020 oteng frimpong et al 2015 this led to wide adoption of the carbon isotope differentiation method into researches of plant wue chen et al 2014 impa et al 2005 wang et al 2013a cabrera bosquet et al 2007 given carbon fixation and water evapotranspiration occurs in plant tissues there is no need to measure soil water content and evaporation to evaluate wue using the carbon isotope differentiation method chen et al 2014 we then assume that the carbon isotope differentiation method could conveniently accurately and directly evaluate wue of wheat plants differently distant to drip tube in els patterns to test this hypothesis we evaluated performances of the wue indicators in a two year spring wheat trial with different drip irrigation patters the objectives were i to evaluate the variation of wue between wheat rows based on the stable carbon isotope δ13c and based on yield and dry matter accumulation that calculated by riw under the els drip irrigation systems ii to analyze the relationship between yield and wue under different drip irrigation systems and iii to evaluate the accuracy of different wue calculations the results should provide better wue indicator of crops under uneven irrigation and further optimize of irrigation strategy in the els drip irrigation patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was conducted in 2019 and 2020 at the experimental farm of shihezi university xinjiang uygur autonomous region china it is described as temperate continental climate with strong radiation and very low rainfall the daily maximum and minimum temperature and rainfall were shown in supplementary fig 2 the physical and chemical properties of soil before sowing were shown in table 1 two locally widely planted spring wheat cultivars xinchun 44 and xinchun 22 were selected the former owns much higher variation of grain yield between different rows than the later in the preliminary experiment the sowing dates were 28th march and 1st april in 2019 and 2020 respectively and the harvest dates were 15th july in both year seven patterns were designed based on the configurations of drip tube vs row number and row space of the plants as shown in supplementary fig 1 in detail the locally adopted drip irrigation system of one drip tube serving four rows of wheat tr4 with row space of 15 cm and lateral space of 60 cm was set as the control ck two normally enlarged lateral space els patterns were designed by separately increasing the plant rows served by single tube to six tr6 with lateral space of 90 cm and eight tr8 with lateral space of 120 cm at the same row space of 15 cm as tr4 two modified patterns of els without changing the lateral space were further designed to reduced the watering distance from the drip tube to the outermost row by narrowing row space nrs from 15 cm to 10 cm in this case the two nrs patterns included tr6l with larger inter block space ibs of 35 cm since the row space was narrowed to 10 cm at the lateral space of 90 cm and tr8l with large ibs of 45 cm at row space of 10 cm and lateral space of 120 cm the nrs patterns were further optimized by shortening ibs sibs from 35 cm tr6l and 45 cm tr8l to 25 cm to give two sibs patterns tr6s and tr8s the experiment was a split plot design with wheat cultivar as main factor and configuration pattern as sub plot factor each treatment was conducted with three replicates the plant density was 180 104 plants ha 1 since the total row number in the same size of plot is the same in tr4 tr6 tr8 tr6l and tr8l the same grain number was sowing in each row but there was more rows in tr6s and tr8s and grain number per row was according reduced to ensure the unity of plant density in different pattern we have developed wheat precision planters for each drip irrigation patter the electronic control system of precise sowing quantity was applied in each wheat precision planters to ensure that the target sowing density the synchronous drip tubes positioning unit was also equipped in each planter in addition each plot size was higher than 100 m2 for the convenience of mechanical sowing in both years the irrigation and fertilization strategies followed our previous report and local recommendations as shown in table 2 liu et al 2013 jin et al 2014 lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 2 2 sampling and measurements 2 2 1 water use efficiency wue calculated from discrimination of stable carbon isotopes δ13c wue13 c the test sample was prepared according to the method of he et al 2012 with a few modifications leaves of 20 wheat plants were taken in each row at the maturity stage followed by fully dried at 70 to constant weight the leaves were then ground and passed through 80 mesh sieve the value of δ13c was measured by a sercon 20 22 stable isotope mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific cn usa pdb pee dee belemnite was taken as standard for

automatic temperature and humidity recorder taws1000 sw compbell scientific usa was installed in the field used to record the temperature and canopy air humidity in the whole growth period of wheat among them leaf temperature is generally calculated by crop canopy air temperature hu et al 2010 chen et al 2014 abbate et al 2004 allen 2003 for wheat the actual leaf temperature is about 72 of the

wueyield and dry matter accumulation wuedm and water expense the pr2 tubes special tubes for profile probe type delta t devices cambridge england were pre embedded at the center of soil of each row after seeding for measurement of soil water content we measured the soil volume water content 0 100 cm soil layer at each row just after each irrigation event and just before the next irrigation event following our previous method lv et al 2019 the soil volume water content after irrigation multiplying soil volume allocated to each row of wheat gave the irrigation amount of different wheat rows after irrigation the soil volume water content before irrigation multiplying soil volume allocated to each row of wheat gave the residual irrigation amount of different wheat rows after irrigation lv et al 2019 the total amount of the received irrigation water riw during the whole growth period was the difference in the total irrigation amount mm and the total residual irrigation mm lv et al 2019 the evapotranspiration etc was calculated according to eq 2 rana and katerji 2000 kresović et al 2016 2 e t c i p c r r f d p δ s etc is the evapotranspiration mm of wheat over the whole growth period the parameter i represents the total irrigation amount mm and riw gives the total irrigation amount at different wheat rows in this study p is rainfall over the whole growing period mm in this experiment rainfall of each row was the row space based mean of total rainfall since rainfall distributed evenly in the field cr dp and rf are capillary rise mm percolation mm and runoff mm in the field respectively in the experimental site there is no intense rainfall and therefore no runoff and the local groundwater table is very low and no drainage occurs in normal years cr rf and dp are

harvested for determining grain yield of the corresponding row g m 2 the overall yield kg ha 1 was the sum of yield of all rows in addition twenty plants in each row were harvested at maturity and oven dried at 85 to constant weight to get dry matter accumulation of each row the overall dry matter accumulation kg ha 1 was the sum of dry matter accumulation of all rows harvest index hi was calculated as grain weight kg divided by total dry matter accumulation lv et al 2019 2 3 statistical analysis the data of different wheat rows under different drip irrigated systems were submitted to one way analysis of variance anova to compare the differences among patterns and among different wheat rows using the software statistical product and service solutions spss inc chicago il usa all charts were generated with microsoft excel office 2016 and origin 9 originlab usa 3 results 3 1 enlarging lateral space els effectively improved overall wue of wheat all els planting patterns tr6 tr6l tr6s tr8 tr8l and tr8s generally increased the overall wue13 c in relation to the conventional patter of tr4 fig 1 here the normal els planting patterns tr6 and tr8 significantly improved wue13 c as compared to tr4 with the only exception that there was no significant difference in wue13 c between tr6 and tr4 in xinchun 44 in 2019 in most cases narrowing row space nrs patterns of tr6l and tr8l also improved wue13 c in relation to tr4 but the increases were less than that the corresponding normal els planting patterns further shortening inter block space sibs planting patterns of tr6s and tr8s also increased wue13 c however there was no significant difference in wue13 c between the sibs patterns and tr4 with exceptions that wue13 c of tr4 was significantly lower than tr8s and tr6s in xinchun 22 in 2019 and significantly lower than tr6s in xinchun 44 in 2020 3 2 els improved wue was largely ascribed to the much increased wue of plants along with distance to drip tube wue13 c generally increased from the innermost rows to the outermost rows fig 1 this could be further proved that along with distance from drip tube wue obviously increased in terms of 13c differentiation wue13 c grain yield wueyield and biomass wuedm per unit water consumption with few exceptions at 17 5 cm away from the drip tube fig 2 in detail in relation to at 7 5 cm away from drip tube the wue13

percentage of 2 11 20 35 36 72 53 114 and 50 180 respectively wuedm also performed stronger increase than wue13 c the increment percentage were 8 5 5 20 29 67 27 72 and 41 99 respectively it is very interesting that though there was large variations in wue within different rows distant to drip tube in the normal non narrowing row space els patterns the spatial wue heterogeneity was obviously minimized by nrs and sibs fig 1 and fig 2 for instance in the two year trials the coefficient of variation among the rows in wue13 c c v13 c of tr4 normal els patterns tr6 and tr8 nrs patterns tr6l and tr8l and sibs patterns tr6s and tr8s were 0 2 2 3 were 0 2 2 3 6 2 13 6 2 9 7 0 and 2 2 5 7 respectively fig 1 3 3 the received irrigation water riw by wheat plants decreased along with the distance to drip tube the received irrigation water riw at each wheat plant row showed an almost linearly gradient decrease along with the distance from the drip tube fig 3 as compared to at 7 5 cm from the drip tube r1 riw reduced 6 9 30 34 43 46 62 65 and 85 89 at 17 5 cm 22 5 cm 27 5 cm 37 5 cm and 52 5 cm from the drip tube respectively 4 discussion 4 1 els effectively improved overall wue but with high inter row wue heterogeneity improving water use efficiency wue is of key importance to balance the water consumption for maintaining high crop productivity and the shortage of irrigation water resource in arid and semi arid agricultural regions zhao et al 2020 xue et al 2019 yang et al 2020 morison et al 2008 wang et al 2019 in our previous studies we suggested more profitable irrigation systems with enlarged lateral space els which gained similar yield to tr4 one tube serving five rows of wheat tr5 lv et al 2019 and one tube serving six rows by shortening row space tr6s wan et al 2022 however the wue performance was less considered on these systems here we observed that wue13 c calculated from the differentiation of 13c was largely improved by els as compared with the conventional tr4 pattern fig 1 we further proposed that the improved wue13 c was related to the increased wue of plants at rows distant to the drip tube this was approved by the increasing wue in terms of wue13 c wueyield grain yield per mm evaportranspiration water and wuedm biomass produced per mm evaportranspiration water along with the distance to the drip tube fig 2 wue is closely related to responses of crop to water status and moderate water shortage usually resulted in more efficient usage of water abbate et al 2004 zhang et al 2020 pate 2001 anyia et al 2007 farquharet al 1984 our report here well agreed this conclusion since the received irrigation water riw gradually descended along with distance to drip tube as shown in fig 3 this also suggested that els tended to raise the risk of large fluctuations in wue between different rows distant to drip tube moreover the inter row coefficient of variation c v of yield wan et al 2022 paralleled with inter row c v of wue fig 1 indicating that the inter row heterogeneity of wue could be detrimental to grain yield stability 4 2 wue negatively correlated to grain yield of wheat at different rows with reducing use of drip tube els also resulted in gradient grain yield decrease along with distance to the drip tube fig 4a our previous experiments also revealed that grain yield obvious descended from the innermost rows to the outermost rows in els patterns lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 therefore negative relationships existed between wue in the name of wue13 c wueyield and wuedm and grain yield as shown in fig 5 this was in line with the conclusions of si et al 2020 abbate et al 2004 and chen et al 2015 under moderate drought stress conditions while disagreed by yu et al 2020 that there was no relationship between wue and yield it is generally accepted that drought tends to reduce crop productivity reversely but improve wue zhang et al 2020 abbate et al 2004 pate 2001 anyia et al 2007 farquhar et al 1984 it should be noted that the wue was not linearly correlated to the grain yield fig 5 in most cases the amplitude of increased wue was higher than amplitude of decreased yield fig 6a1 this should be acceptable since the decline of yield was much less than riw by wheat plants along with the distance from drip tube in our previous study lv et al 2019 this also indicated that inter row wue variation was greater than inter row yield variation but was close to inter row riw variation in another word the influence of riw on wue was greater than grain yield in our els patterns 4 3 wue13 c is more reliable in evaluating wheat wue of different rows than wuedm and wueyield it was also observed that sensitivity of the three wue indicators in response to reducing riw was different fig 6b1 here wueyield was most sensitive to less water followed by wuedm and then wue13 c this is reasonable since wue13 c was more related to co2 assimilation amount per transpiration water wang et al 2013a ali and talukder 2008 qiu et al 2008 which was dependant on the capacity of photosynthesis and the function of stoma in leaves chen et al 2014 farquhar et al 1982 1984 1989 moreover wue13 c is calculated according to a relative long term interaction consequence between carbon fixation and water consumption of leaves chen et al 2014 farquhar et al 1982 1984 1989 namely the data of evaportranspiration is not included in the calculation of wue13 c and the measurement of soil water supply and plant water consumption do not affect the value of wue13 c reversely wueyield and wuedm is defined as grain yield or biomass accumulation per unit water consumption wang et al 2013a plant growth is very sensitive to water shortage wang et al 2013a lv et al 2019 chen et al 2015 wan et al 2022 as the deposit of leaf photo assimilates in plants chen et al 2021 yang et al 2020 liu et al 2016 it is accepted that biomass of plants at the distant rows is easily depressed by water deficit lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 moreover water status usually fluctuated largely over the cycle of irrigation drying evapotranspiration re irrigation especially for the distant rows to the drip tube in the els drip irrigation patterns lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 this further affected the plant growth and biomass accumulation in wheat this could well explain why the sensitivity in wuedm was much higher than wue13 c in response to reduction in riw in distant rows to drip tube in els patterns fig 6b1 furthermore grain yield is the product of total biomass and harvest index hi wheeler et al 1996 plaut et al 2004 or product of ears per unit area grain number per ear and the 1000 grain weight si et al 2020 lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 then yield is a more complex trait than biomass under environmental fluctuations such as drought high temperature the photo assimilates temporarily stored in vegetative organs of cereal crops usually stored in stems and sheaths as part of biomass could re translocate into grain to partially compensate the depressed biomass accumulation si et al 2020 moll et al 1994 lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 in our case the loss of biomass was higher than grain yield of the outermost rows of wheat plants which frequently suffered from severe water deficit over the whole growth stage in the els drip irrigation patterns fig 4a and fig 4b moreover harvest index hi was obviously improved for wheat plants distant to the drip tube fig 4c therefore it is also reasonable that wueyield was much more sensitive to wuedm of plants distant to drip tube in the els patterns fig 6b1 it should also be noted that the evaluation of wueyield and wuedm could be not so accurate since riw might not truly reflect the water absorbed by wheat plants at the given row there were at least two uncertainties water was highly movable in soil between rows and roots exhibited hydrotropic growth li et al 2020 loomis and ewan 1936 henry and hooker 1915 and highly extended across other rows payero et al 2008 wang et al 2013b lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 therefore wue13 c could be more accurate wue indicator than wueyield and wuedm for plants at different rows in drip irrigation system since wue13 c evaluation is the reflection of the long term accumulative internal gas exchange co2 δ13c and water in leaf cabrera bosquet et al 2007 chen et al 2014 farquhar et al 1982 1984 1989 impa et al 2005 sun and guy 1996 wang et al 2013a and no soil moisture monitoring is needed chen et al 2014 of course to quantify wueyield and wuedm via wue13 c would be very helpful to better guide irrigation scheme in els system in the future however cluster analysis shows that the correlation coefficient is not high supplementary fig 3 therefore more accurate quantitative methods need to be further studied 4 4 nrs and sibs effectively reduced inter row wue heterogeneity though els resulted in high heterogeneity of wue between rows and meanwhile improved the overall wue as compared the conventional tr4 pattern fig 1 the shortened row space tr6l and tr8l and their combination with shortened block space tr6s and tr8s well stabilized the large variations in wue between rows as compared to the normal els patterns tr6 and tr8 considering the negative relationship between wue and grain yield of different rows of plants tr6s was recommended the best els drip irrigation pattern with satisfied wue and high yield and profit in xinjiang as reported previously similar grain yield and higher profit wan et al 2022 was received in tr6s with higher wue than the conventional tr4 pattern as reported here it has to be mentioned that in the present study the same amount of water was input in all irrigation patterns which followed the conventional tr4 pattern the shorten row space els patterns such as tr6s could potentially be more water saving therefore better irrigation strategy for tr6s should be developed in the future 5 conclusion we found that enlarging lateral space els can effectively improve wue13 c but increase the heterogeneity c v of wue13 c among the rows this was approved by the increasing wue13 c wueyield grain yield per mm evaportranspiration water and wuedm biomass produced per mm evaportranspiration water along with the distance to the drip tube narrowing row space nrs or nrs in combination with shortening the inter block space sibs can obviously reduce the heterogeneity of wue13 c among the rows considering that wue negatively related to grain yield in the conditions of both between rows and between irrigation patterns to balance satisfied wue and high yield as well as profit tr6s was recommended the best els pattern for drip irrigation in xinjiang wue13 c is the most stable index to water loss and it is the best index to reflect the difference of wue among rows however the accurate quantification of wueyield and wuedm based on wue13 c is not clear which needs further exploration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9246,mulching an agricultural management measure widely used in arid and semi arid regions of china can effectively improve the hydrothermal environment of farmland and increase crop yield and crop water productivity wpc however previous studies on the effects of mulching on water saving yield increase and emission reduction of maize have provided inconsistent results therefore a meta analysis was used in this study to 1 evaluate the effect of mulching types plastic film pm straw sm and degradable film dm on maize yield evapotranspiration wpc and greenhouse gas emissions and 2 determine the effects of mulching measures on water saving yield increase and emission reduction in maize farmland under different climatic conditions compared with the no mulching control mulching significantly raised maize yield wpc and carbon dioxide co2 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions the pm sm and dm increased maize yield by 27 31 6 98 and 16 55 compared with no mulching respectively and correspondingly wpc by 34 08 11 48 and 24 20 the pm and sm significantly increased co2 emissions by 39 91 and 16 43 respectively and n2o emissions by 51 1 and 30 12 but had no significant effect on methane absorption for maize planting in areas with altitudes 500 and 1000 m average annual rainfall 1000 mm average annual air temperature of 5 15 c and average annual evaporation 1500 mm a combination of pm and ridge furrow planting can achieve the best effect of increasing production and saving water in areas with an altitude of 1000 1500 m and average annual evaporation of 1500 2000 mm the dm had the greatest effect of improving yield by 16 17 and saving water with a decrease in evapotranspiration of 8 82 and an increase in wpc of 24 71 the local level of mechanization and labor costs should be considered when choosing a maize mulching pattern keywords mulching maize yield evapotranspiration crop water productivity greenhouse gases emissions data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in recent years the trend of climatic aridity has had an extremely adverse impact on agriculture of china and water shortage has become a key factor restricting agricultural production of china ma 2020 therefore how to further improve crop yield and crop water productivity wpc is the key to realizing the sustainable development of agricultural production in china studies have shown that mulching of different types plastic film pm straw sm and degradable film dm can effectively reduce soil water loss caused by surface runoff and ineffective evapotranspiration et improve the interception efficiency of precipitation and soil water content and achieve high efficiency utilization of natural precipitation xia et al 2014 in addition mulching can improve soil physical and chemical properties to a certain extent maintain soil structure and prevent pests and weeds thereby promoting crop growth and increasing crop yield chen and zhang 2009 liu et al 2001 the massive emissions of major greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o and the resulting global warming have attracted much attention for decades zhang et al 2012 emissions of ch4 and n2o from agricultural activities account for 50 and 60 of the total global emissions respectively chen et al 2014 co2 is the main gas causing the greenhouse effect the total annual co2 emission reaches tens of billions of tons worldwide thus controlling the emission of greenhouse gases is urgent ipcc 2014 numerous experimental studies have investigated surface mulching with most showing that mulching practice can reduce crop et and increase crop yield and wpc chai et al 2022 chen et al 2022 however some studies have shown that pm inhibits infiltration of precipitation and reduces the effective use of water thereby reducing crop yield in years with abundant precipitation deng et al 2020 li et al 2001 wen et al 2010 found that compared with no mulching control maize yield under pm and sm increased by 19 4 and 24 4 respectively with corresponding increases in wpc of 16 6 and 19 5 however zhang et al 2015 found that maize yield with sm decreased by 5 8 there are also some differences in the effect of mulching on greenhouse gas emissions from farmland some studies have shown that mulching significantly increases the emission flux and cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases but others found that mulching can significantly reduce or have no significant impact on greenhouse gas emission li et al 2016 zhu et al 2020 li et al 2014 previous studies generally had shortcomings such as scattered experiment sites and short duration of experiment years with great differences or even opposite results among their researches therefore these results have no universality and guidance for the realization of crop yield increase water saving and emission reduction in the whole region using maize as the research object this meta analysis explored the effect of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions under different climatic conditions in china with the aim to determine the effects of mulching types on water saving yield increase and emission reduction of maize farmland under different climatic conditions this study would provide a reference basis for ensuring chinese food security realizing water saving agriculture and achieving carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we conducted a literature search to collect data on the effects of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions in china for 1980 2020 data were collected from the web of science and china national knowledge infrastructure by searching for mulching maize yield evapotranspiration crop water productivity nitrous oxide n2o carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 and their combinations in the titles abstracts and keywords of published papers in order to avoid distortions from publication selection the data chosen had to satisfy the following criteria 1 the experiments were conducted in china and the sites and years were clear 2 experiments were field experiments and the experimental material was maize 3 field studies had to contain a control treatment flat planting without mulching and 4 mean standard deviation or standard errors and sample size of the variables were directly available or could be calculated from data a total of 89 available publications were selected containing 609 pairs of observations 217 for grain yield 178 for et 190 for wpc and 24 for greenhouse gas emissions 2 2 data classification according to the classification of different mulching materials and the application of main mulching practices in china the mulching methods were divided into three main categories pm sm and dm in order to explain the response of maize yield et wpc and greenhouse gas emissions to climate conditions maize planting areas were divided into four altitude categories 500 500 1000 1000 1500 and 1500 m four categories of average annual temperature 5 5 10 10 15 and 15 c four categories of average annual rainfall 500 500 1000 1000 1500 and 1500 mm four categories of average annual evaporation 1000 1000 1500 1500 2000 and 2000 mm and two planting patterns flat and ridge furrow planting 2 3 calculation of wpc the calculation of wpc as follows 1 w p c y i e l d e t c k g h a 1 m 3 h a 1 where yield is maize yield etc is crop evapotranspiration which is the water actually used by crops 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 standard deviation calculated as an important parameter in meta analysis standard deviation is the basis for calculating the weight of each study when the standard deviation of yield et wpc or greenhouse gas emissions was listed in the publication this value was directly adopted when the standard deviation was not provided in the literature but multiple repeated experiment values were listed or the standard deviation and repeated experiment values were not provided the results of multi year field studies were regarded as experiment replication and the standard deviation was calculated 2 4 2 meta analysis the response ratio r is used to explore the mulching effect in this study its calculation formula follows 2 r x e x c 3 ln r ln x e x c ln x e ln x c where xe and xc are the mean values of maize yield et wpc and greenhouse gas emissions in mulching treatments and the control group respectively to reflect the water saving yield increase and emission reduction effects of mulching more intuitively the effect size lnr is converted into the percentage of change as follows 4 z e lnr 1 100 if the 95 confidence interval ci is greater than 0 it indicates that mulching has significantly improved maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions compared with no mulching control if the 95 ci is less than 0 it indicates that mulching has significantly reduced crop yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions the mean percentage change is considered not significantly positive or negative when 95 ci overlaps with zero the effect sizes are considered to differ significantly from each other when the 95 ci between categories do not overlap 2 4 3 data analysis in this study excel 2016 was used for data collecting meta win 2 1 was used for integrated analysis and origin 2021 was used for creating graphs 3 results 3 1 overall effects of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions the pm sm and dm significantly increased maize yield by 27 31 6 98 and 16 55 compared with no mulching control respectively and correspondingly decreased et by 5 34 2 79 and 7 89 and increased wpc by 34 08 11 48 and 24 2 fig 1a c therefore among mulching treatments the water saving and yield increasing effects of pm were greater in maize planting the pm and sm significantly increased n2o emissions by 51 10 and 30 12 respectively and co2 emissions by 39 91 and 16 43 the absorption of ch4 was not significant in either pm or sm treatments fig 1d 3 2 effect of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions under different environmental factors 3 2 1 altitude in areas with altitude 500 m maize yield and wpc increased the most for pm by 14 04 and 29 16 compared with no mulching control respectively the decrease of et in pm was the largest with 14 81 the pm sm and dm significantly increased maize yield by 15 81 6 44 and 16 17 respectively and correspondingly increased maize wpc by 24 25 9 95 and 17 08 and decreased et by 8 28 2 88 and 3 68 at altitude of 1000 1500 m the yield increase effect under pm was slightly lower than that of dm but the water saving effect under pm was significantly better than both other mulching practices maize yield and wpc had the largest increase in pm at altitude 1500 m with 56 11 and 56 46 respectively and the water saving and yield increasing effects for pm were better than for sm and dm fig 2a c compared with no mulching the n2o emissions under sm and pm significantly increased by 30 11 and 66 11 at altitudes 500 and 500 1000 m respectively fig 2d the effect of mulching on co2 emissions was not significant at different altitudes fig 2e the absorption of ch4 increased by 13 78 for pm relative to no mulching at altitude of 500 1000 m fig 2f 3 2 2 rainfall compared with no mulching in areas with average annual rainfall 500 and 500 1000 mm the increases in maize yield were 38 46 and 19 82 respectively and corresponding decreases in et were 5 82 and 4 77 and increases in wpc were 45 46 and 25 14 in pm the water saving and yield increasing effects in pm were greater than for sm and dm fig 3a c both pm and sm significantly increased the n2o and co2 emissions at average annual rainfall of 500 1000 mm with increases of 51 10 and 39 91 for pm respectively and 24 67 and 17 85 for sm in areas with average annual rainfall of 500 1000 mm the absorption of ch4 decreased by 5 89 and 28 45 for pm and sm respectively fig 3d f 3 2 3 air temperature the increases in maize yield and wpc for pm were higher than for sm and dm compared with no mulching at average annual air temperature of 5 15 c for average annual air temperature of 5 10 c the yield increasing and water saving effects were in the order of pm dm sm et for pm sm and dm was 3 99 3 90 and 5 58 less than for no mulching respectively the dm decreased et by 9 49 while sm increased et by 4 45 compared with no mulching for average annual air temperature of 10 15 c fig 4a c mulching increased n2o and co2 emissions for different average annual air temperatures for an average annual air temperature of 5 10 c pm and sm increased n2o emissions by 58 49 and 36 13 respectively and reduced ch4 absorption by 24 73 and 34 93 compared with control treatment pm and sm increased co2 emissions by 39 91 and 10 05 respectively and pm increased ch4 absorption by 14 78 for an average annual air temperature of 10 15 c fig 4d f 3 2 4 evaporation in areas with average annual evaporation 1000 and 1000 1500 mm both maize yield and wpc had the greatest increase in pm among mulching treatments with yield increased by 23 27 and 40 37 respectively and wpc increased by 20 40 and 47 95 the decrease of et in dm was the largest for an average annual evaporation of 1000 1500 and 1500 2000 mm with 5 12 and 8 82 respectively the pm sm and dm all significantly increased maize yield and wpc for an average annual evaporation 2000 mm maize yield had the greatest increase for dm of 23 89 and pm had the greatest effect on decreasing et and increasing wpc with a decrease of 14 19 and an increase of 40 12 respectively fig 5a c the sm significantly increased n2o and co2 emissions by 23 87 and 13 83 respectively and decreased ch4 absorption by 18 40 compared with no mulching for an average annual evaporation 1000 mm the pm significantly increased n2o emissions by 25 23 significantly decreased ch4 absorption by 30 73 and non significantly increased co2 emissions for an average annual evaporation of 1500 2000 mm fig 5d f 3 3 effect of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions under different planting patterns the maize yield and wpc increased to varying degrees regardless of flat or ridge furrow planting in the three mulching practices maize yield and wpc in pm with ridge furrow planting were significantly increased by 28 75 and 39 61 respectively compared with flat planting which were the greatest effects of ridge furrow planting the combination of pm and ridge furrow planting had significant water saving and yield increasing effects on maize planting however dm had the greatest effect on decreasing et for both flat and ridge furrow planting with decreases of 5 59 and 9 54 respectively fig 6a c for flat planting sm significantly increased n2o and co2 emissions by 27 99 and 17 85 respectively and pm also increased n2o and co2 emissions and decreased ch4 absorption with no significant effects fig 6d f 3 4 correlation between et and yield and wpc there was a significant parabolic relationship between et and maize yield yield increased first and then decreased with the increase of et in three mulching practices in pm treatment the yield changed most obviously with et fig 7a c in pm and dm treatment wpc decreased with the increase of et however this phenomenon did not appear in sm treatment dm has a better correlation between et and wpc compared with pm and sm fig 7d f 4 discussion 4 1 overall effects of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions our meta analysis showed that compared with no mulching the three mulching practices significantly improved maize yield and wpc consistent with many results in previous studies lu et al 2017 qi et al 2016 chen et al 2015 cai et al 2011 gu et al 2022 fang et al 2020 but the average effect of sm on maize yield and wpc was generally lower than that of pm and dm this may be because straw residues create suitable temperature and soil conditions to increase the incidence of pests and diseases chen et al 2009 in addition sm hinders the absorption of solar radiation by soil and so reduces soil temperature thereby inhibiting germination and early stage growth and decreasing crop yield zhao et al 2007 deng et al 2020 found that compared with no mulching average soil temperature during the whole growth period of maize under pm increased by 2 4 c but decreased by 0 36 c under sm in the loess plateau of china in our study the three mulching practices reduced the et of maize during the growth period but sm had the least effect relative to pm and dm possibly because sm can inhibit the infiltration of some precipitation and irrigation water resulting in water losses when the amount of straw mulch reaches a certain level q f yu et al 2018 y x yu et al 2018 our study showed that pm and sm significantly increased soil n2o emissions compared with no mulching however some studies also found that soil n2o decreases throughout the year under pm and dm possibly due to differences in farmland management methods caused by different climatic conditions and experiment areas chen et al 2019 in this study pm promoted n2o emission possibly because mulching increased the growth and activity of microbial populations improved soil hydrothermal conditions and thus was conducive to the production and emission of n2o q f yu et al 2018 y x yu et al 2018 the reason for the increase of n2o emissions with sm may be that the mineralization of organic nitrogen and carbon in the straw left on the soil surface provides a substrate for denitrification or nitrification chen et al 2017 the co2 emission from maize farmland increased in pm consistent with results of li et al 2016 and zhu et al 2020 because the increase in soil temperature could promote microorganism growth and activity and accelerate decomposition of organic matter thereby promoting co2 emissions gao et al 2019 straw carbon promoted the transformation of mineral nutrients and the microbial decomposition of organic matter thus increasing the co2 emission in sm chen et al 2017 4 2 effect of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions under different environmental factors climatic conditions are important factors determining the effects of mulching our study showed that mulching practices were more effective in areas with high altitude low air temperature low rainfall and high evaporation in areas with altitude 1500 m rainfall 500 mm air temperatures of 5 10 c and average annual evaporation 2000 mm the effect of pm on water saving and yield increase was the greatest among mulching treatments the pm can not only reduce soil water evaporation preserve soil moisture and make full use of limited rainfall but also increases soil surface temperature at relatively low temperatures pm can accelerate the emergence of seeds and ultimately promote increased maize yield and wpc gao et al 2019 kar et al 2007 zhao et al 2012 therefore pm is recommended for maize planting in areas of high altitude and low air temperature this study showed that in areas with rainfall 500 mm the increases in maize yield and wpc were greater for pm than dm possibly because compared with pm the degradable film was degraded at a later stage of growth and increased soil water evaporation which led to limited rainfall inhibiting both yield and wpc gao et al 2014 li et al 2018 environmental factors may contribute to differences in greenhouse gas emissions due to mulching practices in our study pm had a significant promoting effect on n2o emission at an average annual air temperature of 5 10 c which may be attributed to extremely low air temperature inhibiting activities of enzymes and bacteria while pm produced higher soil temperature which could increase these activities zhu et al 2020 for sm there was no significant difference in n2o emissions at an average annual air temperature of 5 10 c due to the adverse effect of straw mulch on soil temperature which would slow microbial activity and the release of straw nitrogen thereby reducing the impact of straw mulch on n2o emission wang et al 2021 in this study the effect of sm on co2 was not significant at different air temperature conditions because the entry of straw carbon into the soil may lead to higher co2 emissions but the decrease in temperature would offset this promoting effect resulting in the overall non significant increase in co2 zhao et al 2016 for ch4 emissions rainfed maize soil is usually a sink for ch4 but water logging may occur with high rainfall and so the retention of soil moisture by pm and sm may aggravate soil flooding periods providing a more suitable environment for ch4 production in some cases cuello et al 2015 however favorable soil moisture conditions under pm and sm may contribute to more ch4 absorption due to improved soil physical properties chen et al 2017 therefore the mechanisms of ch4 trophic and oxidative bacteria in waterlogged soils may be more complex and uncertain resulting in no significant difference in ch4 absorption in sm and pm for this study 4 3 effect of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions under different planting patterns in our study the yield and wpc of maize increased to a certain extent under flat and ridge furrow planting for the three mulching practices consistent with previous experimental results yang et al 2020 ma et al 2020 guo et al 2022 fang et al 2021 gu et al 2021 however some experiments showed that ridge furrow planting does not improve crop yield and wpc possibly related to climatic conditions and water requirements during the crop growth stage in the experimental years cai et al 2011 wang et al 2009 for example the effect of collecting rainwater in furrows is not obvious and the adaptability of crops to the environment may also be affected if the precipitation during the crop growth stage is high zhang et al 2015 the difference between the two planting patterns was minor the increase of wpc in ridge furrow planting was slightly larger in our study therefore ridge furrow planting should be used in areas with a high degree of mechanization and flat planting used in areas with low degree of mechanization and high labor costs our study shows that mulching promoted n2o emission with flat planting likely because the flat planting soil experienced more frequent alternating wetting drying cycles which stimulated n2o release huygens et al 2011 in this study the effect of mulching on n2o and co2 emissions with ridge furrow planting was not investigated but zhang et al 2021 found that ridge furrow planting could reduce n2o emissions from summer maize soil for which there are two possible explanations first the n2o emission area in ridge furrow planting was reduced by nearly half compared with flat planting so the accumulated n2o emission was greatly decreased second the ridge and furrow increased wpc by increasing the available soil water thereby improving maize productivity and increasing nitrogen consumption thus inhibiting n2o emission ren et al 2008 asgedom et al 2011 5 conclusion 1 compared with no mulching pm sm and dm increased maize yield by 27 31 6 98 and 16 55 respectively and wpc by 34 08 11 48 and 24 21 the pm and sm significantly increased co2 emissions by 39 91 and 16 43 respectively and n2o emissions by 51

9246,mulching an agricultural management measure widely used in arid and semi arid regions of china can effectively improve the hydrothermal environment of farmland and increase crop yield and crop water productivity wpc however previous studies on the effects of mulching on water saving yield increase and emission reduction of maize have provided inconsistent results therefore a meta analysis was used in this study to 1 evaluate the effect of mulching types plastic film pm straw sm and degradable film dm on maize yield evapotranspiration wpc and greenhouse gas emissions and 2 determine the effects of mulching measures on water saving yield increase and emission reduction in maize farmland under different climatic conditions compared with the no mulching control mulching significantly raised maize yield wpc and carbon dioxide co2 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions the pm sm and dm increased maize yield by 27 31 6 98 and 16 55 compared with no mulching respectively and correspondingly wpc by 34 08 11 48 and 24 20 the pm and sm significantly increased co2 emissions by 39 91 and 16 43 respectively and n2o emissions by 51 1 and 30 12 but had no significant effect on methane absorption for maize planting in areas with altitudes 500 and 1000 m average annual rainfall 1000 mm average annual air temperature of 5 15 c and average annual evaporation 1500 mm a combination of pm and ridge furrow planting can achieve the best effect of increasing production and saving water in areas with an altitude of 1000 1500 m and average annual evaporation of 1500 2000 mm the dm had the greatest effect of improving yield by 16 17 and saving water with a decrease in evapotranspiration of 8 82 and an increase in wpc of 24 71 the local level of mechanization and labor costs should be considered when choosing a maize mulching pattern keywords mulching maize yield evapotranspiration crop water productivity greenhouse gases emissions data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in recent years the trend of climatic aridity has had an extremely adverse impact on agriculture of china and water shortage has become a key factor restricting agricultural production of china ma 2020 therefore how to further improve crop yield and crop water productivity wpc is the key to realizing the sustainable development of agricultural production in china studies have shown that mulching of different types plastic film pm straw sm and degradable film dm can effectively reduce soil water loss caused by surface runoff and ineffective evapotranspiration et improve the interception efficiency of precipitation and soil water content and achieve high efficiency utilization of natural precipitation xia et al 2014 in addition mulching can improve soil physical and chemical properties to a certain extent maintain soil structure and prevent pests and weeds thereby promoting crop growth and increasing crop yield chen and zhang 2009 liu et al 2001 the massive emissions of major greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o and the resulting global warming have attracted much attention for decades zhang et al 2012 emissions of ch4 and n2o from agricultural activities account for 50 and 60 of the total global emissions respectively chen et al 2014 co2 is the main gas causing the greenhouse effect the total annual co2 emission reaches tens of billions of tons worldwide thus controlling the emission of greenhouse gases is urgent ipcc 2014 numerous experimental studies have investigated surface mulching with most showing that mulching practice can reduce crop et and increase crop yield and wpc chai et al 2022 chen et al 2022 however some studies have shown that pm inhibits infiltration of precipitation and reduces the effective use of water thereby reducing crop yield in years with abundant precipitation deng et al 2020 li et al 2001 wen et al 2010 found that compared with no mulching control maize yield under pm and sm increased by 19 4 and 24 4 respectively with corresponding increases in wpc of 16 6 and 19 5 however zhang et al 2015 found that maize yield with sm decreased by 5 8 there are also some differences in the effect of mulching on greenhouse gas emissions from farmland some studies have shown that mulching significantly increases the emission flux and cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases but others found that mulching can significantly reduce or have no significant impact on greenhouse gas emission li et al 2016 zhu et al 2020 li et al 2014 previous studies generally had shortcomings such as scattered experiment sites and short duration of experiment years with great differences or even opposite results among their researches therefore these results have no universality and guidance for the realization of crop yield increase water saving and emission reduction in the whole region using maize as the research object this meta analysis explored the effect of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions under different climatic conditions in china with the aim to determine the effects of mulching types on water saving yield increase and emission reduction of maize farmland under different climatic conditions this study would provide a reference basis for ensuring chinese food security realizing water saving agriculture and achieving carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we conducted a literature search to collect data on the effects of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions in china for 1980 2020 data were collected from the web of science and china national knowledge infrastructure by searching for mulching maize yield evapotranspiration crop water productivity nitrous oxide n2o carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 and their combinations in the titles abstracts and keywords of published papers in order to avoid distortions from publication selection the data chosen had to satisfy the following criteria 1 the experiments were conducted in china and the sites and years were clear 2 experiments were field experiments and the experimental material was maize 3 field studies had to contain a control treatment flat planting without mulching and 4 mean standard deviation or standard errors and sample size of the variables were directly available or could be calculated from data a total of 89 available publications were selected containing 609 pairs of observations 217 for grain yield 178 for et 190 for wpc and 24 for greenhouse gas emissions 2 2 data classification according to the classification of different mulching materials and the application of main mulching practices in china the mulching methods were divided into three main categories pm sm and dm in order to explain the response of maize yield et wpc and greenhouse gas emissions to climate conditions maize planting areas were divided into four altitude categories 500 500 1000 1000 1500 and 1500 m four categories of average annual temperature 5 5 10 10 15 and 15 c four categories of average annual rainfall 500 500 1000 1000 1500 and 1500 mm four categories of average annual evaporation 1000 1000 1500 1500 2000 and 2000 mm and two planting patterns flat and ridge furrow planting 2 3 calculation of wpc the calculation of wpc as follows 1 w p c y i e l d e t c k g h a 1 m 3 h a 1 where yield is maize yield etc is crop evapotranspiration which is the water actually used by crops 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 standard deviation calculated as an important parameter in meta analysis standard deviation is the basis for calculating the weight of each study when the standard deviation of yield et wpc or greenhouse gas emissions was listed in the publication this value was directly adopted when the standard deviation was not provided in the literature but multiple repeated experiment values were listed or the standard deviation and repeated experiment values were not provided the results of multi year field studies were regarded as experiment replication and the standard deviation was calculated 2 4 2 meta analysis the response ratio r is used to explore the mulching effect in this study its calculation formula follows 2 r x e x c 3 ln r ln x e x c ln x e ln x c where xe and xc are the mean values of maize yield et wpc and greenhouse gas emissions in mulching treatments and the control group respectively to reflect the water saving yield increase and emission reduction effects of mulching more intuitively the effect size lnr is converted into the percentage of change as follows 4 z e lnr 1 100 if the 95 confidence interval ci is greater than 0 it indicates that mulching has significantly improved maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions compared with no mulching control if the 95 ci is less than 0 it indicates that mulching has significantly reduced crop yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions the mean percentage change is considered not significantly positive or negative when 95 ci overlaps with zero the effect sizes are considered to differ significantly from each other when the 95 ci between categories do not overlap 2 4 3 data analysis in this study excel 2016 was used for data collecting meta win 2 1 was used for integrated analysis and origin 2021 was used for creating graphs 3 results 3 1 overall effects of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions the pm sm and dm significantly increased maize yield by 27 31 6 98 and 16 55 compared with no mulching control respectively and correspondingly decreased et by 5 34 2 79 and 7 89 and increased wpc by 34 08 11 48 and 24 2 fig 1a c therefore among mulching treatments the water saving and yield increasing effects of pm were greater in maize planting the pm and sm significantly increased n2o emissions by 51 10 and 30 12 respectively and co2 emissions by 39 91 and 16 43 the absorption of ch4 was not significant in either pm or sm treatments fig 1d 3 2 effect of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions under different environmental factors 3 2 1 altitude in areas with altitude 500 m maize yield and wpc increased the most for pm by 14 04 and 29 16 compared with no mulching control respectively the decrease of et in pm was the largest with 14 81 the pm sm and dm significantly increased maize yield by 15 81 6 44 and 16 17 respectively and correspondingly increased maize wpc by 24 25 9 95 and 17 08 and decreased et by 8 28 2 88 and 3 68 at altitude of 1000 1500 m the yield increase effect under pm was slightly lower than that of dm but the water saving effect under pm was significantly better than both other mulching practices maize yield and wpc had the largest increase in pm at altitude 1500 m with 56 11 and 56 46 respectively and the water saving and yield increasing effects for pm were better than for sm and dm fig 2a c compared with no mulching the n2o emissions under sm and pm significantly increased by 30 11 and 66 11 at altitudes 500 and 500 1000 m respectively fig 2d the effect of mulching on co2 emissions was not significant at different altitudes fig 2e the absorption of ch4 increased by 13 78 for pm relative to no mulching at altitude of 500 1000 m fig 2f 3 2 2 rainfall compared with no mulching in areas with average annual rainfall 500 and 500 1000 mm the increases in maize yield were 38 46 and 19 82 respectively and corresponding decreases in et were 5 82 and 4 77 and increases in wpc were 45 46 and 25 14 in pm the water saving and yield increasing effects in pm were greater than for sm and dm fig 3a c both pm and sm significantly increased the n2o and co2 emissions at average annual rainfall of 500 1000 mm with increases of 51 10 and 39 91 for pm respectively and 24 67 and 17 85 for sm in areas with average annual rainfall of 500 1000 mm the absorption of ch4 decreased by 5 89 and 28 45 for pm and sm respectively fig 3d f 3 2 3 air temperature the increases in maize yield and wpc for pm were higher than for sm and dm compared with no mulching at average annual air temperature of 5 15 c for average annual air temperature of 5 10 c the yield increasing and water saving effects were in the order of pm dm sm et for pm sm and dm was 3 99 3 90 and 5 58 less than for no mulching respectively the dm decreased et by 9 49 while sm increased et by 4 45 compared with no mulching for average annual air temperature of 10 15 c fig 4a c mulching increased n2o and co2 emissions for different average annual air temperatures for an average annual air temperature of 5 10 c pm and sm increased n2o emissions by 58 49 and 36 13 respectively and reduced ch4 absorption by 24 73 and 34 93 compared with control treatment pm and sm increased co2 emissions by 39 91 and 10 05 respectively and pm increased ch4 absorption by 14 78 for an average annual air temperature of 10 15 c fig 4d f 3 2 4 evaporation in areas with average annual evaporation 1000 and 1000 1500 mm both maize yield and wpc had the greatest increase in pm among mulching treatments with yield increased by 23 27 and 40 37 respectively and wpc increased by 20 40 and 47 95 the decrease of et in dm was the largest for an average annual evaporation of 1000 1500 and 1500 2000 mm with 5 12 and 8 82 respectively the pm sm and dm all significantly increased maize yield and wpc for an average annual evaporation 2000 mm maize yield had the greatest increase for dm of 23 89 and pm had the greatest effect on decreasing et and increasing wpc with a decrease of 14 19 and an increase of 40 12 respectively fig 5a c the sm significantly increased n2o and co2 emissions by 23 87 and 13 83 respectively and decreased ch4 absorption by 18 40 compared with no mulching for an average annual evaporation 1000 mm the pm significantly increased n2o emissions by 25 23 significantly decreased ch4 absorption by 30 73 and non significantly increased co2 emissions for an average annual evaporation of 1500 2000 mm fig 5d f 3 3 effect of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions under different planting patterns the maize yield and wpc increased to varying degrees regardless of flat or ridge furrow planting in the three mulching practices maize yield and wpc in pm with ridge furrow planting were significantly increased by 28 75 and 39 61 respectively compared with flat planting which were the greatest effects of ridge furrow planting the combination of pm and ridge furrow planting had significant water saving and yield increasing effects on maize planting however dm had the greatest effect on decreasing et for both flat and ridge furrow planting with decreases of 5 59 and 9 54 respectively fig 6a c for flat planting sm significantly increased n2o and co2 emissions by 27 99 and 17 85 respectively and pm also increased n2o and co2 emissions and decreased ch4 absorption with no significant effects fig 6d f 3 4 correlation between et and yield and wpc there was a significant parabolic relationship between et and maize yield yield increased first and then decreased with the increase of et in three mulching practices in pm treatment the yield changed most obviously with et fig 7a c in pm and dm treatment wpc decreased with the increase of et however this phenomenon did not appear in sm treatment dm has a better correlation between et and wpc compared with pm and sm fig 7d f 4 discussion 4 1 overall effects of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions our meta analysis showed that compared with no mulching the three mulching practices significantly improved maize yield and wpc consistent with many results in previous studies lu et al 2017 qi et al 2016 chen et al 2015 cai et al 2011 gu et al 2022 fang et al 2020 but the average effect of sm on maize yield and wpc was generally lower than that of pm and dm this may be because straw residues create suitable temperature and soil conditions to increase the incidence of pests and diseases chen et al 2009 in addition sm hinders the absorption of solar radiation by soil and so reduces soil temperature thereby inhibiting germination and early stage growth and decreasing crop yield zhao et al 2007 deng et al 2020 found that compared with no mulching average soil temperature during the whole growth period of maize under pm increased by 2 4 c but decreased by 0 36 c under sm in the loess plateau of china in our study the three mulching practices reduced the et of maize during the growth period but sm had the least effect relative to pm and dm possibly because sm can inhibit the infiltration of some precipitation and irrigation water resulting in water losses when the amount of straw mulch reaches a certain level q f yu et al 2018 y x yu et al 2018 our study showed that pm and sm significantly increased soil n2o emissions compared with no mulching however some studies also found that soil n2o decreases throughout the year under pm and dm possibly due to differences in farmland management methods caused by different climatic conditions and experiment areas chen et al 2019 in this study pm promoted n2o emission possibly because mulching increased the growth and activity of microbial populations improved soil hydrothermal conditions and thus was conducive to the production and emission of n2o q f yu et al 2018 y x yu et al 2018 the reason for the increase of n2o emissions with sm may be that the mineralization of organic nitrogen and carbon in the straw left on the soil surface provides a substrate for denitrification or nitrification chen et al 2017 the co2 emission from maize farmland increased in pm consistent with results of li et al 2016 and zhu et al 2020 because the increase in soil temperature could promote microorganism growth and activity and accelerate decomposition of organic matter thereby promoting co2 emissions gao et al 2019 straw carbon promoted the transformation of mineral nutrients and the microbial decomposition of organic matter thus increasing the co2 emission in sm chen et al 2017 4 2 effect of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions under different environmental factors climatic conditions are important factors determining the effects of mulching our study showed that mulching practices were more effective in areas with high altitude low air temperature low rainfall and high evaporation in areas with altitude 1500 m rainfall 500 mm air temperatures of 5 10 c and average annual evaporation 2000 mm the effect of pm on water saving and yield increase was the greatest among mulching treatments the pm can not only reduce soil water evaporation preserve soil moisture and make full use of limited rainfall but also increases soil surface temperature at relatively low temperatures pm can accelerate the emergence of seeds and ultimately promote increased maize yield and wpc gao et al 2019 kar et al 2007 zhao et al 2012 therefore pm is recommended for maize planting in areas of high altitude and low air temperature this study showed that in areas with rainfall 500 mm the increases in maize yield and wpc were greater for pm than dm possibly because compared with pm the degradable film was degraded at a later stage of growth and increased soil water evaporation which led to limited rainfall inhibiting both yield and wpc gao et al 2014 li et al 2018 environmental factors may contribute to differences in greenhouse gas emissions due to mulching practices in our study pm had a significant promoting effect on n2o emission at an average annual air temperature of 5 10 c which may be attributed to extremely low air temperature inhibiting activities of enzymes and bacteria while pm produced higher soil temperature which could increase these activities zhu et al 2020 for sm there was no significant difference in n2o emissions at an average annual air temperature of 5 10 c due to the adverse effect of straw mulch on soil temperature which would slow microbial activity and the release of straw nitrogen thereby reducing the impact of straw mulch on n2o emission wang et al 2021 in this study the effect of sm on co2 was not significant at different air temperature conditions because the entry of straw carbon into the soil may lead to higher co2 emissions but the decrease in temperature would offset this promoting effect resulting in the overall non significant increase in co2 zhao et al 2016 for ch4 emissions rainfed maize soil is usually a sink for ch4 but water logging may occur with high rainfall and so the retention of soil moisture by pm and sm may aggravate soil flooding periods providing a more suitable environment for ch4 production in some cases cuello et al 2015 however favorable soil moisture conditions under pm and sm may contribute to more ch4 absorption due to improved soil physical properties chen et al 2017 therefore the mechanisms of ch4 trophic and oxidative bacteria in waterlogged soils may be more complex and uncertain resulting in no significant difference in ch4 absorption in sm and pm for this study 4 3 effect of mulching on maize yield wpc and greenhouse gas emissions under different planting patterns in our study the yield and wpc of maize increased to a certain extent under flat and ridge furrow planting for the three mulching practices consistent with previous experimental results yang et al 2020 ma et al 2020 guo et al 2022 fang et al 2021 gu et al 2021 however some experiments showed that ridge furrow planting does not improve crop yield and wpc possibly related to climatic conditions and water requirements during the crop growth stage in the experimental years cai et al 2011 wang et al 2009 for example the effect of collecting rainwater in furrows is not obvious and the adaptability of crops to the environment may also be affected if the precipitation during the crop growth stage is high zhang et al 2015 the difference between the two planting patterns was minor the increase of wpc in ridge furrow planting was slightly larger in our study therefore ridge furrow planting should be used in areas with a high degree of mechanization

ridge furrow planting was reduced by nearly half compared with flat planting so the accumulated n2o emission was greatly decreased second the ridge and furrow increased wpc by increasing the available soil water thereby improving maize productivity and increasing nitrogen consumption thus inhibiting n2o emission ren et al 2008 asgedom et al 2011 5 conclusion 1 compared with no mulching pm sm and dm increased maize yield by 27 31 6 98 and 16 55 respectively and wpc by 34 08 11 48 and 24 21 the pm and sm significantly increased co2 emissions by 39 91 and 16 43 respectively and n2o emissions by 51

9247,this paper assesses the feasibility and robustness of an index based insurance scheme against hydrological droughts under climate change to this end we develop a grand ensemble that samples both modeling and scenario uncertainty in the estimation of the insurance risk premium so to reveal potential unfavorable surprises and minimize regret in the design of the proposed insurance scheme the grand ensemble combines four microeconomic models and seven gamlss models which are run for three alternative climate change scenarios stationary climate no climate change rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 methods are illustrated with an application to the cega river sub basin crs in central spain results indicate that for a conventional deductible of 30 the proposed index based insurance scheme would be actuarially feasible and affordable under all models for the stationary climate scenario i e robust for climate change scenarios rcp 2 6 and 8 5 and a 30 deductible the suggested index based insurance would be actuarially feasible under most models albeit some outliers point towards potential unfavorable surprises lower deductibles decrease feasibility particularly for deductibles 10 keywords index based drought insurance irrigation economics climate change water constraints deep uncertainty gamlss data availability the data and code used to reproduce the article can be found at the zenodo link in the online supplementary material 1 introduction water scarcity and droughts exacerbated by climate change are an existential threat to societies and nature in many parts of the world undrr 2021 if we continue using water as we do now water demand will exceed the currently available and reliable supply by 40 by 2030 water resources group 2030 2019 reducing gdp growth by as much as 6 in southern mediterranean basins i e continued negative growth world bank 2016 this will be aggravated by climate change which in the mediterranean region is expected to significantly reduce streamflow and increase its volatility medium high confidence ipcc 2022 as a result temporary water supply demand imbalances also known as hydrological droughts will become more frequent and intense ipcc 2019 decision makers are exploring several economic engineering and regulatory instruments to address the economic and environmental impacts of hydrological droughts most of these instruments focus on damage prevention mainly through grey e g reservoirs canals and green engineering e g wetland restoration solutions that expand the supply base un 2018 sometimes complemented with regulations e g quota based systems and economic instruments e g water charges voluntary agreements market based instruments that modulate demand oecd 2015 notwithstanding these efforts towards damage prevention there are damages that are technically difficult to prevent and in some cases it may not be economically efficient to do so this is especially true for agriculture the largest water user which accumulates the least valuable uses of the resource pérez blanco et al 2021 and covers 50 of the world s habitable land fao 2021 moreover there is a considerable level of uncertainty in water supply and demand forecasts that may result in unexpected damages that overcome prevention barriers marchau et al 2019 taleb 2008 accordingly there is now a move toward innovation in damage compensation instruments most notably through crop insurance mechanisms gómez limón 2020 insurance is a risk sharing strategy through which an agent the insured transfers part of the risk it bears to another agent the insurer in exchange of a payment the risk premium in turn the insurer commits to compensate the insured agent if a covered risk realizes crop insurance policies can cover against a wide array of risks which are often grouped in three categories pérez blanco et al 2017 production risks due to extreme meteorological phenomena and other adverse events such as theft or fire market risks due to price and cost variability and the institutional risk associated with shifting policy choices that can affect farm s output e g discretionary water reallocations during hydrological droughts which is typically not insured crop insurance is most frequently delivered through yield insurance that addresses production risks often bundling several risks together e g hail floods fire more sophisticated crop insurance schemes offer comprehensive income revenue insurance packages that address both production and market risks albeit these insurance products have significantly higher costs and lower market penetration than yield insurance liesivaara and myyra 2014 pérez blanco et al 2016 critically available insurance schemes only cover drought damages in rainfed agriculture that is hydrological drought damages in higher value added and potentially costlier to insure irrigated agriculture are excluded bardají et al 2016 ruiz et al 2015 as a result hydrological drought damages in irrigated agriculture are either compensated using instruments such as state aid rejda and mcnamara 2014 averted through informal water withdrawals from buffer stocks typically aquifers which are often overallocated and thus transfer the burden of drought damage from the economy to the environment gómez and pérez blanco 2012 or absorbed by farms economic losses two major challenges have thwarted the development of hydrological drought insurance in irrigated agriculture first beyond the probabilistic residual risk that remains after all damage prevention instruments are considered there are significant sources of non probabilistic uncertainty that emerge from the non mechanistic dynamics and multiple potential equilibria of complex socioecological systems anderies 2015 which can lead to unfavorable surprises that significantly amplify drought damages and the costs of insurance this is known as knightian or deep uncertainty knight 1921 marchau et al 2019 a situation where experts do not know or the parties to a decision cannot agree upon i the external context of the system i e scenario uncertainty e g due to climate change or future damage prevention planning ii how the system works and its boundaries i e parameter and structural uncertainties within models and or iii the outcomes of interest from the system and or their relative importance i e weighting lempert et al 2003 p 11 while appropriate under probabilistic risk the conventional consolidative modeling approach that has been traditionally used to make point predictions towards calculating expected compensations indemnities and insurance premiums is no longer adequate under deep uncertainty because it can provide more information than is warranted by available evidence and artificially reduce uncertainty as demonstrated by recent unfavorable surprises experienced by the insurance industry e g during the massive 2021 summer floods in central europe deep uncertainty can be particularly harmful in the case of hydrological droughts a systemic risk that can lead to the breakdown of entire agricultural systems rather than the failure of individual parts as happens with e g hail which can potentially affect the stability of the insurance system and raise solvency issues bielza et al 2009 rey et al 2019 accordingly insuring hydrological drought risk in irrigated agriculture under deep uncertainty calls for alternative actuarial modeling frameworks that replace consolidative modeling and point predictions by ensemble experiments that sample uncertainty and inform no regret or low regret robust solutions that prioritize the avoidance of unfavorable contingencies marchau et al 2019 second hydrological drought insurance in irrigated agriculture faces a considerable degree of institutional risk and uncertainty crop insurance is closely linked to existent damage prevention instruments which often involve discretionary policy choices that condition realized damages the extent of the compensation and the viability of the insurance scheme surminski et al 2015 notably because water allotments during hydrological droughts are decided by the water authority which might be subject to users lobbying including irrigators guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 the damages caused by water restrictions are not entirely owed to the vagaries of water supply and can become difficult to predict which can further inflate uncertainty regarding the second challenge actuarial research has posited that institutional risk can be addressed through index based crop insurance a type of insurance that gives a preestablished compensation to farmers when a predetermined threshold is surpassed in the case of index based hydrological drought insurance compensations indemnities are calculated based on an external index correlated with the risk addressed instead of the realized water allocation decision by the water authority which reduces uncertainty in the calculation of the risk premium gómez limón 2020 external indices can be designed as a function of precipitation buchholz and musshoff 2014 accumulated discharge leiva and skees 2008 pérez blanco and gómez 2014 stock in reservoirs guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 or the combination thereof arandara et al 2019 gómez limón 2020 moghaddasi et al 2014 for the case of hydrological drought insurance consolidative index based research has reported risk premiums that are either below irrigators willingness to pay or represent a low to moderate share of their variable costs and thus are considered affordable alcon et al 2014 gómez limón 2020 the first challenge remains largely unaddressed though index based and other crop insurance research and applications still rely on consolidative modeling thus failing to account for the non probabilistic modeling and scenario uncertainties that are characteristic of complex socioecological systems the modeling frameworks used in the literature on crop insurance typically adopt a risk assessment model to provide a complete probabilistic description of the risk i e scenario uncertainty is ignored which are then used to feed an economic model typically a mathematical programming model to obtain a point prediction of expected compensations and risk premiums i e parameter and structural uncertainties within models are also ignored moreover in the case of hydrological drought risk these point predictions rely on stationary series of hydrological variables meaning that not only uncertainty in scenarios and modeling is not accounted for but also that the repercussions of climate change are excluded altogether the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of a robust index based insurance against hydrological droughts in irrigated agriculture that accounts for modeling and scenario uncertainty while mainstreaming climate change impacts into the analysis following pérez blanco and gómez 2014 2013 and gómez limón 2020 we use the drought indices in drought management plans as a reference index for the proposed index based insurance scheme regarding scenario uncertainty we explore different representative concentration pathway rcp emission scenarios for the 21st century so to generate non stationary hydrological inputs that account for conditions of global warming to this end we use a generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss stasinopoulos et al 2020 a non linear distributional regression model that elicits the parameters of the assumed distribution for the response variable in our case the drought index in the drought management plan using additive functions of the explanatory variables thus gamlss makes possible to assess the impacts on both the first and second moments of the distribution of the explanatory variables which in the case of droughts can be used to discern the effects of climate change on the drought index through projections of temperatures and precipitation under selected rcp scenarios regarding modeling uncertainty we use an ensemble encompassing various gamlss with alternative model structure and parameter values to estimate the probability distribution of the drought index under alternative climate change scenarios and a second ensemble of mathematical programming models that assesses the behavior and adaptive responses of irrigators to the water restrictions set based on the drought index by combining the expected damage under each plausible value of the drought index obtained with the ensemble of mathematical programming models with the probability distribution of the drought index under each climate change scenario obtained with the gamlss ensemble we can calculate the expected damage under each climate scenario and plausible combination of models this makes possible to sample both model and scenario uncertainty through a database of simulations that reports the economic performance of the proposed insurance scheme including damages compensation indemnity and risk premium under multiple plausible futures where each plausible future is represented by a unique combination of models and scenarios and to assess its feasibility and robustness methods are illustrated with an application to the cega river sub basin in spain 2 background to the case study the cega river sub basin in spain the cega river sub basin crs is located to the south east of the douro river basin drb in spain see fig 1 the average annual water supply of the crs is estimated at 208 3 hm3 1 hm3 1 million m3 and projected to decrease by up to 11 by 2030 magrama 2017 while annual water demand is estimated at 76 3 hm3 80 3 of which comes from agriculture drba 2020 of these 76 3 hm3 year 4 5 hm3 year 5 9 come from on average water abundant yet unregulated and volatile surface water bodies while the remaining 71 8 hm3 year 94 1 are abstracted from reliable yet overallocated aquifers mostly from the arenales aquifer due to groundwater overallocation the arenales aquifer shows a poor ecological status with high levels of arsenic pollution that recurrently constrain the local population a high priority water use claiming 4 79 hm3 year to rely on tankers for household water supply the crs is managed by the douro river basin authority drba the drba allocates surface and groundwater resources among users and operates a network of canals and other water works to distribute surface water resources groundwater infrastructures are privately operated by users despite the drba efforts to address groundwater overallocation through quota reductions and engineering solutions for managed aquifer recharge the piezometric levels and qualitative status of the arenales aquifer have shown little improvement quota reductions have been bypassed through irrigation modernization which increases the consumed fraction of water abstracted while reducing return flows and infiltration to the aquifer or straightaway violated via water theft wwf 2020 while supply expansion through managed aquifer recharge has fallen short of the growing demand in this context the drba is considering a ban on groundwater abstractions in an area comprising 2800 ha of the circa 4000 ha in the crs that currently irrigate using groundwater resources and substitute them with surface water resources this substitution was initially planned to be supported with the construction of the lastras de cuéllar reservoir in the crs 44 hm3 and the ciguiñuela 29 hm3 and carbonero reservoirs 13 2 hm3 in the nearby eresma sub basin to be connected to the crs through canals and other complementary water works however the construction of the lastras de cuéllar reservoir has been already discarded following a negative environmental assessment while the approval of the ciguiñuela and carbonero reservoirs is unlikely high representative of the douro river basin authority 2022 and has been postponed at minimum to 2033 drba 2020 plans to substitute groundwater with surface water resources to address aquifer overallocation problems continue nonetheless accordingly the irrigated agriculture of the crs is expected to transition and adapt to a significantly more volatile water source which will amplify hydrological drought risk in the area during hydrological droughts the drba curtails water allocations based on the drb s drought management plan dmp drba 2017 spanish dmps are a damage prevention mechanism that re allocates scarce water resources to ensure that essential uses such as household supply or minimum environmental flows are met while the economic damage is minimized e g giving priority to industrial uses with high value added per unit of water input over agricultural water uses to this end dmps set different priorities among uses from higher environmental households to lower irrigation dmps divide basins into territorial scarcity units tsu hydrological units that typically match a sub basin in our case the crs and share a common source of water in the case of the crs tsu the cega river and its tributaries during hydrological droughts each tsu assesses drought severity through a drought index based on which available water resources are re allocated at the beginning of the irrigation season in april since the crs is a non regulated catchment the crs tsu drought index assesses drought severity based on discharge data instead of storage data that is typically used in highly engineered catchments gathered at two monitoring stations at the cega and pirón rivers the latter being a tributary to the cega river see fig 1 non regulated catchments or marginally regulated catchments those with small dams whose capacity is significantly lower than demand abound worldwide including in spain one of the countries with most developed water infrastructure in the world for example 24 of the tsu in the drb 24 of the tsu in the guadiana rb 12 of the tsu in the tagus rb and 80 of the tsu in the cantábrico rb assess drought severity based on discharge data only corba 2018 drba 2017 grba 2018 trba 2018 focusing on a non regulated catchment also has the advantage of removing the uncertainty related to future water storage in reservoirs which depends not only on natural but also on management variables e g water release for hydropower generation that are challenging to predict particularly under climate change isimip 2022 in fact to circumvent this challenge several proposed index based insurance products for regulated catchments are designed as a function of precipitation or external discharge buchholz and musshoff 2014 leiva and skees 2008 in the crs tsu the drought index is built as a weighted average of the six months rolling sum of discharge in the two monitoring stations at the cega and pirón rivers and subsequently normalized dividing by the maximum historical value to range between 0 absolute scarcity and 1 no drought in turn water allocation is obtained as a piecewise function of the crs tsu drought index as follows 1 normality drought index 0 5 1 water allocation for irrigation is linearly reduced between 0 indicator equals 1 and 10 indicator equals 0 5 2 pre alert drought index 0 3 0 5 water allocation for irrigation is linearly reduced between 10 indicator equals 0 5 and 25 indicator equals 0 3 3 alert drought index 0 15 0 3 water allocation for irrigation is linearly reduced between 25 indicator equals 0 3 and 50 indicator equals 0 15 4 emergency drought index 0 0 15 water allocation for irrigation is linearly reduced between 50 indicator equals 0 15 and 100 indicator equals 0 following gómez limón 2020 we use the crs tsu hydrological drought index above as a reference to calculate damages to irrigated agriculture which in turn give us the necessary information to calculate potential compensations indemnities and risk premiums our analysis focuses on the 2 agricultural water demand units awdus in the crs that presently rely on surface water or are transitioning towards its adoption fig 1 the cega awdu awdu2000168 and the pirón river awdu awdu 2000159 awdus are the basic irrigation unit in spain and comprise groups of irrigators sharing a common source of water territorial administrative and hydrological characteristics these awdus are one of the most productive agricultural areas in central spain largely irrigated with sprinklers in the cega awdu about 40 of the 832 13 ha of irrigated land in the crs are devoted to high value added horticultural crops such as carrot garlic and onion whose expected profits range between 5 430 and 16 896 5 eur ha average profit 10 906 8 eur ha in the pirón river awdu about 64 of the 40 3 ha of irrigated land in the crs are devoted to high value added horticultural crops such as onion whose expected profits is 1 267 1 eur ha other relevant crops in the crs include sugar beet 7 of the awdus combined surface potato 13 and alfalfa 19 magrama 2020a 2020b awdus are the agents in the ensemble of mathematical programming models meaning simulations are conducted independently for each awdu albeit simulation results are subsequently aggregated and presented at the district level in section 4 i e the crs 3 methodology our methods nest two ensembles to create an ensemble of ensembles or grand ensemble capable of sampling scenario and modeling uncertainty in the first layer of the grand ensemble there is a gamlss ensemble encompassing various econometric models with alternative structure and parameter values which are used to estimate the probability distribution of the drought index with and without climate change in the second layer of the grand ensemble there is a microeconomic ensemble of mathematical programming models to assess the adaptive responses of irrigators to the water restrictions set based on the drought index and estimate damages under drought events of different intensity emergency alert pre alert normality next we combine each model within the gamlss ensemble with each model within the microeconomic ensemble and each climate change scenario and run a simulation to estimate the expected drought damage thus we create a database of simulations that reports the economic performance of the proposed insurance scheme under multiple plausible futures where each plausible future is represented by a unique combination of models and scenarios a graphical workflow of our methods is presented in fig 2 3 1 gamlss to simulate drought indices under climate change the gamlss is a statistical model designed to overcome the limitations associated with conventional generalized linear models glms and generalized additive models gams the critical innovation of gamlss is that instead of predicting the response of the mean of the distribution it makes possible to assess how the different independent variables in the model affect the second third and fourth moments of the distribution of the independent variable variance asymmetry kurtosis in our case this potential is used to explore the effect of changes in temperatures and precipitation on the expected value and variance of the drought index a typical gamlss is defined as follows stasinopoulos et al 2020 1 y ind d μ σ ν τ 2 η 1 g 1 μ x 1 β 1 s 11 x 11 s 1 j 1 x 1 j 1 3 η 2 g 2 σ x 2 β 2 s 21 x 21 s 2 j 2 x 2 j 2 4 η 3 g 3 ν x 3 β 3 s 31 x 31 s 3 j 3 x 3 j 3 5 η 4 g 4 τ x 4 β 4 s 41 x 41 s 4 j 4 x 4 j 4 where y y1 yn is the vector with the dependent variable observations which are independently distributed and have a distribution d which is defined by its four moments μ σ ν and τ some distributions as the normal or the beta distribution only need to model the first two moments two parameters instead of four the predictors ηi explain the moments of the distribution through a function that depends on the chosen probability distribution xi is a ni pi matrix pi ri 1 containing the r covariate columns chosen for the ith predictor plus a column of ones if a constant is required and βi is the vector of coefficients for the variables selected in the equation of the ith predictor finally sij is a nonparametric smoothing function applied to the covariate xij of the ith predictor for ji 1 ji smoothed variables i e the function that establishes the non linear effects on the parameters of the distribution in gamlss the effect of the independent variables on the parameters of the distribution is allowed to be non linear thus letting data determine the relationship between the predictor e g η1 g μ and the explanatory variables rather than enforcing a linear or polynomial relationship the methods used to define these relationships are known as supervised machine learning since the algorithm iteratively models the relationship making predictions about the data and is corrected on a recurring basis during this process the estimation procedure stops when the algorithm has converged that is when it reaches a predetermined level of performance which might be modified in our application to the cega tsu we use the drought index in april as the dependent variable which is calculated using historical discharge data from the cega and pirón monitoring stations this data is available at several separate webpages in the cedex 2021 database and was downloaded using a web scraping script coded in r on the other hand the independent variables are the weighted average of the six month rolling sum of precipitation and the weighted average of monthly differences of temperatures between april and march in the observed year which is obtained from historical meteorological data measured in the two discharge monitoring stations at the cega and pirón rivers available at copernicus climate change service c3s climate data store cs3 2022 precipitation and temperature are the two key forces used in multi model ensemble experiments to predict impacts on discharge as well as on other key hydrological variables isimip 2022 cmip6 2022 accordingly forecasts of these two variables are available for long periods into the future a key piece of information that we will use to mainstream climate change in our model the database with the dependent and independent variables used to run gamlss is available in annex i of the online supplementary material since the drought index is standardized between 0 and 1 we use beta as the reference distribution which is continuous and ranges from 0 to 1 we also explore alternative models that use other distributions such as the logisticnormal logitno or the generalized beta type 1 gb1 from this set of distributions we generate 17 models by adjusting the degrees of freedom and using alternative smoothing functions all 17 models and the coding used to obtain them in r are available in annex ii of the online supplementary material the models intertwine the smoothing functions between variables which is performed in order to model various levels of complexity and find different ways of fitting the drought index to both precipitation and temperatures among the 17 models generated using this approach we choose the top seven that show a satisfactory predictive performance according to the aic akaike information criterion and bic bayesian information criterion criteria i e aic lower than 41 5 and bic lower than 37 5 aic allows more complex models e g using smoothing functions for some variables whereas bic tends to penalize complexity and chooses more parsimonious models as seen by the population distribution of the models only the beta distribution models satisfy the aforementioned requirements each of the seven gamlss models used in the ensemble is described in the table 1 as seen in the table above model 11 is the one which performs best under the bic on the other hand model 15 is the best under the aic one option at this point is to apply performance tests to choose one of the two models nevertheless that would attribute all the predictive capacity to a single model and would not allow for sampling modeling uncertainty which is a key objective of this research thus we use all seven models in our research through an ensemble of gamlss models fig 3 shows the centiles plot of the effect of each independent variable precipitation and temperatures on the distribution of all models once the ensemble of seven gamlss models is calibrated we gather data from euro cordex predictions on future precipitation and temperatures in the crs for the period 2017 last year with historical data available to 2100 to account for climate change euro cordex 2022 these forecasts are obtained for two climate change scenarios for the 21st century rcp 2 6 and 8 5 while other scenarios such as rcp 4 5 or rcp 6 can be considered our main objective here is to provide worst case and best case climate change scenarios as compared to stationary climate next each model in the gamlss ensemble uses the euro cordex forecasts as an input data to predict the drought index throughout the 2017 2100 series in other words we use the already trained gamlss ensemble trained with the past observations to transform the future values of precipitation and temperatures into predictions of the drought index this is the approach that we have used to allow for climate change using precipitation and temperature forecasts in euro cordex for two key climate change scenarios and given these as an input predicting the future values of the crs tsu drought index once we have the predictions of both mu and sigma of the drought index per year we can estimate the parameters of the population distribution by averaging mu and sigma for each rcp scenario in this way we have estimated the parameters of the drought index distribution under each climate change scenario finally we simulate the underlying population distribution of the model e g beta using the parameters obtained with the 2017 2100 forecasts mean of future values reaching eventually two probability density functions for each model out of which we can extract the probabilities of each drought situation normality pre alert alert and emergency this information is then combined with the drought damage simulations run with the ensemble of mathematical programming models to obtain an expected compensation indemnity and insurance premium for each combination of scenarios and models 3 2 mathematical programming models to simulate irrigators responses to water reallocations this section presents a multi model ensemble comprising several microeconomic mathematical programming models which are used to sample modeling structural and parameter uncertainty in the representation of human responses to water allocation restrictions under drought pérez blanco et al 2021 sapino et al 2020 the ensemble includes two positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup and two positive mathematical programming pmp models in all four models the agent an irrigator aims to maximize its utility u x within a domain f as follows 6 max u x f z 1 x z 2 x z m x subject to 7 x i 0 8 i 1 n x i 1 9 x f 10 x r n 11 z 1 x z 2 x z m x z x r m where u x is a monotonically increasing utility function i e increasing the provision of any utility relevant attribute z 1 x z 2 x z m x increases the utility for the agent thus all attributes are defined so that more is better meaning less is better attributes are transformed accordingly e g risk is measured as risk avoidance we explore the relevance of five attributes in our microeconomic ensemble profit z 1 measured as the expected gross margin the only relevant attribute for pmp models and a relevant attribute for pmaup models as well and a critical variable to estimate drought damage and the risk premium risk avoidance z 2 and management complexity avoidance measured through three proxies total labor avoidance z 3 hired labor avoidance z 4 and direct costs avoidance z 5 a comprehensive description and mathematical formulation of each attribute as well as a database including all the input data used to quantify attributes provision in the awdus including source and reference year is available in annex i of the online supplementary material x is the decision variable or crop portfolio a vector indicating the share of land allotted to each crop x i in which is revised on a yearly basis at the beginning of the irrigation campaign in april we consider both irrigated and rainfed crops in the portfolio for simulation purposes to allow for super extensive margin adaptations crop switching towards rainfed crops each crop x i delivers a unique combination of utility relevant attributes z x f represents the set of constraints that conform the domain including the water allocation constraint of relevance for our research since it is the variable directly affected by the dmp 12 i 1 n w i x i w where w i represents the water needs by crop x i and w represents the water allocation on a per hectare basis the other constraints conforming the domain f are presented in annex iii of the online supplementary material the pmp and pmaup models included in the ensemble of mathematical programming models use the same data inputs and share a common specification of the domain but differ in the form of the utility function u x and calibration method used pmp models adopt a single attribute quadratic utility function where the only utility relevant attribute is profit z 1 pmp models are calibrated in three steps i an additional area constraint that bounds the model calibration results to observed choices is introduced in the domain and the dual values associated to the constraint for each crop obtained ii these dual values are used to add a non linear component to the utility function typically a quadratic cost function or shadow cost and iii the utility non linear function obtained in ii is maximized subject to a similar set of constraints to those considered in the original problem which perfectly reproduces the observed agent s behavior heckelei et al 2012 the two pmp models used in our ensemble are the classical pmp model developed by howitt 1995 and a variation of this model developed by júdez et al 2002 which skips the first step in the calibration procedure above on the other hand pmaup models use a multi attribute utility function that in our case includes profit risk avoidance and management complexity avoidance pmaup replaces the dual variables added to the utility function in pmp models with agent s preference parameters represented as shares of a utility function the arguments of which are competing attributes e g profits v risk avoidance the two pmaup models included in the ensemble differ on the functional form and calibration method used building on work by gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 gómez limón et al 2016 adopt a non linear cobb douglas utility function that is calibrated using a projection method conventional pmaup while montilla lópez et al 2018 adopt a linear utility function that is calibrated using a weighted goals programming method wgp pmaup à là sumpsi et al 1997 pmaup and pmp models are calibrated for the year 2017 which is also the last year in the data series used in the gamlss ensemble calibration results and calibration errors for the pmaup models are available in annex iv in the online supplementary material calibration results for pmp models are not reported since they perfectly calibrate to the observed decision crop portfolio so the error is always null and the only relevant attribute is profit as per the metrics for performance assessment of pmaup models in essenfelder et al 2018 all awdus have a very low calibration error average error 10 in the conventional pmaup model while in the wgp pmaup model 2 awdus have a very low calibration error and 2 of them have a moderate calibration error average error in the range of 10 15 4 results and discussion the sub sections below present the i losses and ii fair risk premium estimations obtained through the application of our methods to the crs as noted in section 2 and elsewhere in the paper modeling is performed at an awdu level and afterwards aggregated to the level of a representative farm for the whole crs hence even though results are robust at an awdu and sub basin level the performance of the insurance on individual farms would show heterogeneity depending on the individual crop mix and economic preferences i e robust performance of the drought insurance scheme for the average crs agent does not ensure robust performance for every single farmer over the sub basin 4 1 simulation results drought damages we first run a series of simulations with the ensemble of mathematical programming models to assess irrigators responses to alternative water allocations under normality 100 or full water allocation to 90 pre alert 90 75 alert 75 50 and emergency 50 0 to this end we progressively strengthen the water allocation constraint from 100 to 0 at 1 point intervals and estimate the corresponding expected damages in each of the 100 simulation runs measured through changes in profit z 1 under different water restrictions as compared to the situation with a full water allocation second we estimate the probability distribution of the drought index for each of the seven models in the gamlss ensemble under three alternative climate change scenarios no climate change rcp 2 6 and rcp8 5 finally we combine the expected damage under each plausible value of the drought index obtained with the ensemble of mathematical programming models with the probability distribution of the drought index under each climate change scenario obtained with the gamlss ensemble to calculate the expected damage under each climate scenario and combination of models the resultant ensemble of ensembles or grand ensemble yields 84 alternative predictions ensemble elements 7 gamlss models times 4 mathematical programming models times 3 climate change scenarios that assess modeling and scenario uncertainty the range of foregone profit forecasts under each climate scenario is shown in fig 4 our results show two clusters of predictions ensemble elements the first cluster in the upper part of the figure comprises the grand ensemble elements that result from the combination of the wgp model in the microeconomic ensemble with the models in the gamlss ensemble and predicts damages in the range of 985 6 1767 6 ha the second cluster in the lower part of the figure comprises the grand ensemble elements resulting from the combination of every other microeconomic model with the models in the gamlss ensemble and predict drought damages in the range of 26 9 433 2 ha the non trivial differences observed between the two clusters in the grand ensemble are primarily owed to the drought damages estimated in the wgp model which differ significantly from the estimations of other models in the microeconomic ensemble see fig 5 when an emergency drought is declared drought index value of 0 15 and water allocation is reduced by 50 the wgp microeconomic model estimates an expected profit of 1381 ha while the other three models estimate an expected profit in the range of 3524 3688 6 ha more than twice as much meaning the wgp overestimates drought damage under emergency as compared to the other three models in the microeconomic ensemble the wgp also overestimates drought damage as compared to the other three microeconomic models under alert and most of the pre alert values on the other hand the wgp underestimates drought damage under normality which partly but not fully offsets the higher damages under pre alert alert and emergency when combining the drought damage estimated using the microeconomic model with the probability distribution of the drought index estimated using gamlss what explains these differences it should be noted that the wgp pmaup is the only microeconomic model in the ensemble of mathematical programming models that has a linear utility function linear models have been often criticized in the academic literature because of their tendency to yield over specialized or even corner solutions the irrigator chooses the crop with the highest utility at the maximum level i e maximum possible land allocated to that crop until a constraint becomes binding and prevents the agent from further specialization for a review of these models see e g graveline 2016 this results in a jumpy behavior and simulated crop portfolio choices that seem too far from reality at least in the short term graveline 2016 to illustrate the responses of irrigators in linear v non linear models fig 6 shows the crop portfolio responses the decision variable in the ensemble of microeconomic models x predicted by the four models in the microeconomic ensemble under emergency alert pre alert and normality drought index thresholds fig 6 shows how irrigators responses differ significantly between the wgp pmaup and the other three models in the microeconomic ensemble whose crop portfolio simulations are also closer to observed irrigators choices as a result the wgp pmaup has significantly higher calibration errors than the other three models see annex iv in the online supplementary material with this in mind we could employ model selection techniques to compare and choose among the models in the ensemble those that perform better in terms of calibration errors which would lead to the exclusion of the wgp pmaup on the other hand calibration errors cannot be directly compared among all the mathematical programming models in the ensemble since these errors are independent cloke et al 2013 moreover while we can assess the capacity of microeconomic models to reproduce observed behavior through realized crop portfolio choices and calibration errors data on irrigators responses to water allocation reductions is limited to drought years since 2007 the year dmps were first approved meaning that we do not have sufficient data to evaluate the predictive performance and prediction errors of the models in the microeconomic ensemble assessing the predictive performance of models is a critical step in model selection konishi and kitagawa 2008 which can be also used towards improving model calibration notably through the use of machine learning techniques as it is done in gamlss without this information we cannot conclude that the wgp pmaup predicts worse than the other models in the ensemble just because it has relatively high calibration errors on the contrary it may occur that a model with a relatively high calibration error is a better predictor for non observed data than other alternative models with relatively low calibration errors pindyck 2015 it can be argued that the higher calibration error of the wgp pmaup is a valuable piece of information to improve our analysis e g by allotting different weights to the models in the microeconomic ensemble yet this is challenging due to the subjectivity involved in defining prior assumptions about the accuracy and weight attributable to each model tebaldi and knutti 2007 besides ensemble experiments that assign weights to models typically do so based on the predictive performance of the model taner et al 2019 which cannot be assessed due to the above mentioned data constraint accordingly rather than excluding models with high calibration errors or using a weighting approach we consider all the models in the microeconomic ensemble including the wgp pmaup and adopt an un weighted approach 1 1 it has been argued that when probabilistic information is not considered each potential vulnerability is equally important on the overall robustness which can also be interpreted as an implicitly equal weighting taner et al 2019 yet in our case we cannot claim that each model has an equal weight because these weights are essentially unknown this allows us to more thoroughly sample modeling uncertainty identify a larger number of potential surprises as compared to ensembles excluding specific models and related predictions ensemble elements and minimize potential regret thus contributing to a more robust analysis on the feasibility of the proposed index based drought insurance scheme 4 2 fair premium estimations next we use the predictions on expected damages see fig 4 to calculate the corresponding fair risk premiums under each climate change scenario the fair risk premium is a critical variable to assess the feasibility of insurance and can be interpreted as the minimum long term annuity cost for the proposed drought insurance scheme to be supplied by a competitive and risk neutral insurance firm the fair risk premium is obtained as the ratio of the expected compensation to the insured asset in our case the insured asset equals the expected profit under full 100 water allocation in constant prices while the expected compensation or indemnity is obtained as a function of the expected damage under each climate scenario reported in fig 4 and the deductible applied by the insurance industry the deductible is a mandatory out of pocket expense by the insured that is typically required before any compensation is paid represented as the fraction of the potential economic damage that is not covered by the insurance company in spanish crop insurance schemes the deductible is typically set at 30 ruiz et al 2015 if the deductible is 0 the company compensates the irrigator for all drought damages on the other hand when there is a deductible the company only compensates the irrigator if damages are higher than the deductible multiplied by the value of the insured asset and the compensation paid amounts to the damages in excess of the deductible for example if the deductible is 30 and a drought causes damages equaling 32 of the value of the insured asset the company would compensate the irrigator with an amount equaling 2 of the value of the insured asset damage in excess of the deductible for any damage of 30 or lower there would be no compensation deductibles are a key instrument to address moral hazard behavior without deductibles irrigators would have no incentives to reduce their drought exposure and drought damages because they do not bear the cost of that risk thus deductibles are typically applied to crop insurance schemes worldwide pérez blanco et al 2017 by reducing the share of damages to be compensated deductibles also reduce the fair risk premium and make insurance policies more affordable to farmers fig 7 reports the range of the fair risk premium in under each climate change scenario for deductibles of 1 5 10 and 30 in the scenario with stationary climate no climate change the fair risk premium ranges between 0 2 and 22 of the insured asset for a 1 deductible between 0 01 and 18 2 for a 5 deductible between 0 and 15 for a 10 deductible and between 0 and 6 8 for a 30 deductible in the rcp 2 6 scenario the fair risk premium ranges between 2 and 30 3 of the insured asset for a 1 deductible between 1 1 and 26 8 for a 5 deductible between 0 and 23 8 for a 10 deductible and between 0 and 14 for a 30 deductible in the rcp8 5 scenario the fair risk premium ranges between 3 6 and 37 1 of the insured asset for a 1 deductible between 2 3 and 33 6 for a 5 deductible between 1 5 and 30 3 for a 10 deductible and between 0 1 and 19 for a 30 deductible it is important noting that the cost of the insurance policy depends on top of the fair risk premium on the commercial premium administration commercialization albeit for index based insurance schemes with low administration and commercialization costs commercial premiums are minor and typically increase fair risk premiums by 10 20 bielza et al 2009 guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 accounting for this additional margin has no impact on our results in table 2 thus for the sake of simplicity we treat insurance costs and fair risk premium as synonyms the feasibility of drought risk in irrigated agriculture depends on the affordability of the estimated fair risk premiums which calls for additional information on irrigators willingness and or ability to pay for the proposed drought insurance scheme estimating the willingness to pay for crop insurance requires ad hoc fieldwork interviews and modeling through revealed preference pérez blanco et al 2016 or stated preference methods e g contingent valuation liesivaara and myyra 2014 a task that is out of the scope of this paper on the other hand the ability to pay of economic agents is often assessed in the literature by comparing the risk premium to the other variable costs already paid by the agent for example gómez limón 2020 assesses the affordability of an hypothetical drought insurance scheme through the ratio of the fair risk premium in absolute instead of relative terms to variable costs which we weight by the probabilities of each water constraint so as to determine the simulated cost according to this author if the fair risk premium represents less than 20 of the variable costs the insurance policy can be considered affordable albeit the preferred threshold is 10 table 2 shows the fair risk premium to variable costs ratios for different deductibles in the crs for a conventional deductible of 30 the proposed index based insurance would be actuarially feasible fair risk premium to variable costs ratio 20 under all models for the current stationary climate i e robust and under all models except for the wgp pmaup which overestimates drought damage as compared to the other three models in the microeconomic ensemble for the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate change scenarios based on the median estimate which is more robust to the wgp outlier the proposed index based insurance scheme would be actuarially feasible under all models and scenarios as well as all deductibles if we consider the mean estimate the proposed index based insurance scheme would be unfeasible under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios unless a deductible of 30 10 in the case of rcp2 6 is applied it is worth noting that the information on the wgp pmaup outliers warns us about potential unfavorable surprises which can trigger massive damages and threaten the feasibility of the proposed index based insurance to prevent these damages from realizing and particularly in the case of systemic risks such as droughts insurers often hire re insurance instruments to hedge against potentially massive damages without the need to immobilize large amounts of money rejda and mcnamara 2014 the exploration of these outliers can thus provide valuable information for insurers assessing the development of hydrological insurance and the acquisition of re insurance instruments 5 conclusions this paper assesses the feasibility and robustness of an index based insurance scheme against droughts in irrigated agriculture under climate change to this end we develop a grand ensemble that samples both modeling and scenario uncertainty in the estimation of the insurance risk premium the grand ensemble combines four microeconomic models and seven gamlss models which are run for three alternative climate change scenarios methods allow us to reveal potential unfavorable surprises and minimize regret in the design and development of the proposed drought insurance scheme methods are illustrated with an application to the crs in spain where we find that for a conventional deductible of 30 the proposed index based insurance is actuarially feasible under all models for the current stationary climate i e robust under climate change rcp2 6 and 8 5 all models considered with the exception of the pmaup wgp show that the risk premium is affordable all deductibles we envision several ways in which further research can improve the methods presented here first ad hoc studies on the willingness to pay for drought insurance in irrigated agriculture are necessary to obtain more conclusive results on the feasibility of the proposed insurance scheme second our analysis has been applied considering the current approach to water resources management in the crs if water resources management in the area changes e g new infrastructures are built such as reservoirs and or tsu drought indices are revised our assessment will have to be updated to account for these changes and reassess the feasibility of index based hydrological drought insurance in the area third assessments on the costs of re insurance policies and its impact on risk premiums are necessary to assess the feasibility of the proposed index based hydrological drought insurance fourth crop insurance may trigger moral hazard because the insured agent has an incentive to increase its exposure to risk given it does not bear the full costs of that risk recent research has suggested that moral hazard tends to negatively affect autonomous climate change adaptation efforts by farmers through a reduction in self protection behavior such as the adoption of drought resistant crops with a lower expected profit and risk miao 2020 müller et al 2017 moral hazard has been traditionally addressed through insurance deductibles albeit new approaches have suggested that risk based pricing can play a relevant role in reducing moral hazard while also encouraging self protection behavior surminski et al 2015 further research should also explore the impact of risk based pricing and other incentives supporting autonomous adaptation on the performance and affordability of hydrological drought insurance fifth in line with conventional mathematical programming modeling the decision variable used in the microeconomic ensemble refers exclusively to crop portfolio choices land allocation while this allows for extensive land reallocations towards less water intensive crops and super extensive land reallocations from irrigated to rainfed agriculture margin adjustments it excludes intensive margin adjustments through deficit irrigation an increasingly relevant adaptation option to irrigators in water stressed areas albeit still of marginal relevance in the crs graveline and mérel 2014 as the new generation of mathematical programming models allows for intensive margin adjustments and an ensemble of such models can be conformed we expect the microeconomic ensemble to become more realistic and potentially more accurate in the predictions of irrigators responses finally additional relevant scenarios and systems could be incorporated into the analysis to more thoroughly sample uncertainty critically our methodology combines the impact of future climatic variables on water availability with microeconomic simulations using historical and climate stationary agricultural data on water need crop yield crop prices and farming costs all of which will be likely affected by climate change agmip 2022 this limitation should be explored in further research e g by expanding our gamlss modeling to predict changes in these variables or by explicitly incorporating additional systems and their models e g macroeconomic modeling to assess price

9247,this paper assesses the feasibility and robustness of an index based insurance scheme against hydrological droughts under climate change to this end we develop a grand ensemble that samples both modeling and scenario uncertainty in the estimation of the insurance risk premium so to reveal potential unfavorable surprises and minimize regret in the design of the proposed insurance scheme the grand ensemble combines four microeconomic models and seven gamlss models which are run for three alternative climate change scenarios stationary climate no climate change rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 methods

in the online supplementary material 1 introduction water scarcity and droughts exacerbated by climate change are an existential threat to societies and nature in many parts of the world undrr 2021 if we continue using water as we do now water demand will exceed the currently available and reliable supply by 40 by 2030 water resources group 2030 2019 reducing gdp growth by as much as 6 in southern mediterranean basins i e continued negative growth world bank 2016 this will be aggravated by climate change which in the mediterranean region is expected to significantly reduce streamflow and increase its volatility medium high confidence ipcc 2022 as a result temporary water supply demand imbalances also known as hydrological droughts will become more frequent and intense ipcc 2019 decision makers are exploring several economic engineering and regulatory instruments to address the economic and environmental impacts of hydrological droughts most of these instruments focus on damage prevention mainly through grey e g reservoirs canals and green engineering e g wetland restoration solutions that expand the supply base un 2018 sometimes complemented with regulations e g quota based systems and economic instruments e g water charges voluntary agreements market based instruments that modulate demand oecd 2015 notwithstanding these efforts towards damage prevention there are damages that are technically difficult to prevent and in some cases it may not be economically efficient to do so this is especially true for agriculture the largest water user which accumulates the least valuable uses of the resource pérez blanco et al 2021 and covers 50 of the world s habitable land fao 2021 moreover there is a considerable level of uncertainty in water supply and demand forecasts that may result in unexpected damages that overcome prevention barriers marchau et al 2019 taleb 2008 accordingly there is now a move toward innovation in damage compensation instruments most notably through crop insurance mechanisms gómez limón 2020 insurance is a risk sharing strategy through which an agent the insured transfers part of the risk it bears to another agent the insurer in exchange of a payment the risk premium in turn the insurer commits to compensate the insured agent if a covered risk realizes crop insurance policies can cover against a wide array of risks which are often grouped in three categories pérez blanco et al 2017 production risks due to extreme meteorological phenomena and other adverse events such as theft or fire market risks due to price and cost variability and the institutional risk associated with shifting policy choices that can affect farm s output e g discretionary water reallocations during hydrological droughts which is typically not insured crop insurance is most frequently delivered through yield insurance that addresses production risks often bundling several risks together e g hail floods fire more sophisticated crop insurance schemes offer comprehensive income revenue insurance packages that address both production and market risks albeit these insurance products have significantly higher costs and lower market penetration than yield insurance liesivaara and myyra 2014 pérez blanco et al 2016 critically available insurance schemes only cover drought damages in rainfed agriculture that is hydrological drought damages in higher value added and potentially costlier to insure irrigated agriculture are excluded bardají et al 2016 ruiz et al 2015 as a result hydrological drought damages in irrigated agriculture are either compensated using instruments such as state aid rejda and mcnamara 2014 averted through informal water withdrawals from buffer stocks typically aquifers which are often overallocated and thus transfer the burden of drought damage from the economy to the environment gómez and pérez blanco 2012 or absorbed by farms economic losses two major challenges have thwarted the development of hydrological drought insurance in irrigated agriculture first beyond the probabilistic residual risk that remains after all damage prevention instruments are considered there are significant sources of non probabilistic uncertainty that emerge from the non mechanistic dynamics and multiple potential equilibria of complex socioecological systems anderies 2015 which can lead to unfavorable surprises that significantly amplify drought damages and the costs of insurance this is known as knightian or deep uncertainty knight 1921 marchau et al 2019 a situation where experts do not know or the parties to a decision cannot agree upon i the external context of the system i e scenario uncertainty e g due to climate change or future damage prevention planning ii how the system works and its boundaries i e parameter and structural uncertainties within models and or iii the outcomes of interest from the system and or their relative importance i e weighting lempert et al 2003 p 11 while appropriate under probabilistic risk the conventional consolidative modeling approach that has been traditionally used to make point predictions towards calculating expected compensations indemnities and insurance premiums is no longer adequate under deep uncertainty because it can provide more information than is warranted by available evidence and artificially reduce uncertainty as demonstrated by recent unfavorable surprises experienced by the insurance industry e g during the massive 2021 summer floods in central europe deep uncertainty can be particularly harmful in the case of hydrological droughts a systemic risk that can lead to the breakdown of entire agricultural systems rather than the failure of individual parts as happens with e g hail which can potentially affect the stability of the insurance system and raise solvency issues bielza et al 2009 rey et al 2019 accordingly insuring hydrological drought risk in irrigated agriculture under deep uncertainty calls for alternative actuarial modeling frameworks that replace consolidative modeling and point predictions by ensemble experiments that sample uncertainty and inform no regret or low regret robust solutions that prioritize the avoidance of unfavorable contingencies marchau et al 2019 second hydrological drought insurance in irrigated agriculture faces a considerable degree of institutional risk and uncertainty crop insurance is closely linked to existent damage prevention instruments which often involve discretionary policy choices that condition realized damages the extent of the compensation and the viability of the insurance scheme surminski et al 2015 notably because water allotments during hydrological droughts are decided by the water authority which might be subject to users lobbying including irrigators guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 the damages caused by water restrictions are not entirely owed to the vagaries of water supply and can become difficult to predict which can further inflate uncertainty regarding the second challenge actuarial research has posited that institutional risk can be addressed through index based crop insurance a type of insurance that gives a preestablished compensation to farmers when a predetermined threshold is surpassed in the case of index based hydrological drought insurance compensations indemnities are calculated based on an external index correlated with the risk addressed instead of the realized water allocation decision by the water authority which reduces uncertainty in the calculation of the risk premium gómez limón 2020 external indices can be designed as a function of precipitation buchholz and musshoff 2014 accumulated discharge leiva and skees 2008 pérez blanco and gómez 2014 stock in reservoirs guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 or the combination thereof arandara et al 2019 gómez limón 2020 moghaddasi et al 2014 for the case of hydrological drought insurance consolidative index based research has reported risk premiums that are either below irrigators willingness to pay or represent a low to moderate share of their variable costs and thus are considered affordable alcon et al 2014 gómez limón 2020 the first challenge remains largely unaddressed though index based and other crop insurance research and applications still rely on consolidative modeling thus failing to account for the non probabilistic modeling and scenario uncertainties that are characteristic of complex socioecological systems the modeling frameworks used in the literature on crop insurance typically adopt a risk assessment model to provide a complete probabilistic description of the risk i e scenario uncertainty is ignored which are then used to feed an economic model typically a mathematical programming model to obtain a point prediction of expected compensations and risk premiums i e parameter and structural uncertainties within models are also ignored moreover in the case of hydrological drought risk these point predictions rely on stationary series of hydrological variables meaning that not only uncertainty in scenarios and modeling is not accounted for but also that the repercussions of climate change are excluded altogether the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of a robust index based insurance against hydrological droughts in irrigated agriculture that accounts for modeling and scenario uncertainty while mainstreaming climate change impacts into the analysis following pérez blanco and gómez 2014 2013 and gómez limón 2020 we use the drought indices in drought management plans as a reference index for the proposed index based insurance scheme regarding scenario uncertainty we explore different representative concentration pathway rcp emission scenarios for the 21st century so to generate non stationary hydrological inputs that account for conditions of global warming to this end we use a generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss stasinopoulos et al 2020 a non linear distributional regression model that elicits the parameters of the assumed distribution for the response variable in our case the drought index in the drought management plan using additive functions of the explanatory variables thus gamlss makes possible to assess the impacts on both the first and second moments of the distribution of the explanatory variables which in the case of droughts can be used to discern the effects of climate change on the drought index through projections of temperatures and precipitation under selected rcp scenarios regarding modeling uncertainty we use an ensemble encompassing various gamlss with alternative model structure and parameter values to estimate the probability distribution of the drought index under alternative climate change scenarios and a second ensemble of mathematical programming models that assesses the behavior and adaptive responses of irrigators to the water restrictions set based on the drought index by combining the expected damage under each plausible value of the drought index obtained with the ensemble of mathematical programming models with the probability distribution of the drought index under each climate change scenario obtained with the gamlss ensemble we can calculate the expected damage under each climate scenario and plausible combination of models this makes possible to sample both model and scenario uncertainty through a database of simulations that reports the economic performance of the proposed insurance scheme including damages compensation indemnity and risk premium under multiple plausible futures where each plausible future is represented by a unique combination of models and scenarios and to assess its feasibility and robustness methods are illustrated with an application to the cega river sub basin in spain 2 background to the case study the cega river sub basin in spain the cega river sub basin crs is located to the south east of the douro river basin drb in spain see fig 1 the average annual water supply of the crs is estimated at 208 3 hm3 1 hm3 1 million m3 and projected to decrease by up to 11 by 2030 magrama 2017 while annual water demand is estimated at 76 3 hm3 80 3 of which comes from agriculture drba 2020 of these 76 3 hm3 year 4 5 hm3 year 5 9 come from on average water abundant yet unregulated and volatile surface water bodies while the remaining 71 8 hm3 year 94 1 are abstracted from reliable yet overallocated aquifers mostly from the arenales aquifer due to groundwater overallocation the arenales aquifer shows a poor ecological status with high levels of arsenic pollution that recurrently constrain the local population a high priority water use claiming 4 79 hm3 year to rely on tankers for household water supply the crs is managed by the douro river basin authority drba the drba allocates surface and groundwater resources among users and operates a network of canals and other water works to distribute surface water resources groundwater infrastructures are privately operated by users despite the drba efforts to address groundwater overallocation through quota reductions and engineering solutions for managed aquifer recharge the piezometric levels and qualitative status of the arenales aquifer have shown little improvement quota reductions have been bypassed through irrigation modernization which increases the consumed fraction of water abstracted while reducing return flows and infiltration to the aquifer or straightaway violated via water theft wwf 2020 while supply expansion through managed aquifer recharge has fallen short of the growing demand in this context the drba is considering a ban on groundwater abstractions in an area comprising 2800 ha of the circa 4000 ha in the crs that currently irrigate using groundwater resources and substitute them with surface water resources this substitution was initially planned to be supported with the construction of the lastras de cuéllar reservoir in the crs 44 hm3 and the ciguiñuela 29 hm3 and carbonero reservoirs 13 2 hm3 in the nearby eresma sub basin to be connected to the crs through canals and other complementary water works however the construction of the lastras de cuéllar reservoir has been already discarded following a negative environmental assessment while the approval of the ciguiñuela and carbonero reservoirs is unlikely high representative of the douro river basin authority 2022 and has been postponed at minimum to 2033 drba 2020 plans to substitute groundwater with surface water resources to address aquifer overallocation problems continue nonetheless accordingly the irrigated agriculture of the crs is expected to transition and adapt to a significantly more volatile water source which will amplify hydrological drought risk in the area during hydrological droughts the drba curtails water allocations based on the drb s drought management plan dmp drba 2017 spanish dmps are a damage prevention mechanism that re allocates scarce water resources to ensure that essential uses such as household supply or minimum environmental flows are met while the economic damage is minimized e g giving priority to industrial uses with high value added per unit of water input over agricultural water uses to this end dmps set different priorities among uses from higher environmental households to lower irrigation dmps divide basins into territorial scarcity units tsu hydrological units that typically match a sub basin in our case the crs and share a common source of water in the case of the crs tsu the cega river and its tributaries during hydrological droughts each tsu assesses drought severity through a drought index based on which available water resources are re allocated at the beginning of the irrigation season in april since the crs is a non regulated catchment the crs tsu drought index assesses drought severity based on discharge data instead of storage data that is typically used in highly engineered catchments gathered at two monitoring stations at the cega and pirón rivers the latter being a tributary to the cega river see fig 1 non regulated catchments or marginally regulated catchments those with small dams whose capacity is significantly lower than demand abound worldwide including in spain one of the countries with most developed water infrastructure in the world for example 24 of the tsu in the drb 24 of the tsu in the guadiana rb 12 of the tsu in the tagus rb and 80 of the tsu in the cantábrico rb assess drought severity based on discharge data only corba 2018 drba 2017 grba 2018 trba 2018 focusing on a non regulated catchment also has the advantage of removing the uncertainty related to future water storage in reservoirs which depends not only on natural but also on management variables e g water release for hydropower generation that are challenging to predict particularly under climate change isimip 2022 in fact to circumvent this challenge several proposed index based insurance products for regulated catchments are designed as a function of precipitation or external discharge buchholz and musshoff 2014 leiva and skees 2008 in the crs tsu the drought index is built as a weighted average of the six months rolling sum of discharge in the two monitoring stations at the cega and pirón rivers and subsequently normalized dividing by the maximum historical value to range between 0 absolute scarcity and 1 no drought in turn water allocation is obtained as a piecewise function of the crs tsu drought index as follows 1 normality drought index 0 5 1 water allocation for irrigation is linearly reduced between 0 indicator equals 1 and 10 indicator equals 0 5 2 pre alert drought index 0 3 0 5 water allocation for irrigation is linearly reduced between 10 indicator equals 0 5 and 25 indicator equals 0 3 3 alert drought index 0 15 0 3 water allocation for irrigation is linearly reduced between 25 indicator equals 0 3 and 50 indicator equals 0 15 4 emergency drought index 0 0 15 water allocation for irrigation is linearly reduced between 50 indicator equals 0 15 and 100 indicator equals 0 following gómez limón 2020 we use the crs tsu hydrological drought index above as a reference to calculate damages to irrigated agriculture which in turn give us the necessary information to calculate potential compensations indemnities and risk premiums our analysis focuses on the 2 agricultural water demand units awdus in the crs that presently rely on surface water or are transitioning towards its adoption fig 1 the cega awdu awdu2000168 and the pirón river awdu awdu 2000159 awdus are the basic irrigation unit in spain and comprise groups of irrigators sharing a common source of water territorial administrative and hydrological characteristics these awdus are one of the most productive agricultural areas in central spain largely irrigated with sprinklers in the cega awdu about 40 of the 832 13 ha of irrigated land in the crs are devoted to high value added horticultural crops such as carrot garlic and onion whose expected profits range between 5 430 and 16 896 5 eur ha average profit 10 906 8 eur ha in the pirón river awdu about 64 of the 40 3 ha of irrigated land in the crs are devoted to high value added horticultural crops such as onion whose expected profits is 1 267 1 eur ha other relevant crops in the crs include sugar beet 7 of the awdus combined surface potato 13 and alfalfa 19 magrama 2020a 2020b awdus are the agents in the ensemble of mathematical programming models meaning simulations are conducted independently for each awdu albeit simulation results are subsequently aggregated and presented at the district level in section 4 i e the crs 3 methodology our methods nest two ensembles to create an ensemble of ensembles or grand ensemble capable of sampling scenario and modeling uncertainty in the first layer of the grand ensemble there is a gamlss ensemble encompassing various econometric models with alternative structure and parameter values which are used to estimate the probability distribution of the drought index with and without climate change in the second layer of the grand ensemble there is a microeconomic ensemble of mathematical programming models to assess the adaptive responses of irrigators to the water restrictions set based on the drought index and estimate damages under drought events of different intensity emergency alert pre alert normality next we combine each model within the gamlss ensemble with each model within the microeconomic ensemble and each climate change scenario and run a simulation to estimate the expected drought damage thus we create a database of simulations that reports the economic performance of the proposed insurance scheme under multiple plausible futures where each plausible future is represented by a unique combination of models and scenarios a graphical workflow of our methods is presented in fig 2 3 1 gamlss to simulate drought indices under climate change the gamlss is a statistical model designed to overcome the limitations associated with conventional generalized linear models glms and generalized additive models gams the critical innovation of gamlss is that instead of predicting the response of the mean of the distribution it makes possible to assess how the different independent variables in the model affect the second third and fourth moments of the distribution of the independent variable variance asymmetry kurtosis in our case this potential is used to explore the effect of changes in temperatures and precipitation on the expected value and variance of the drought index a typical gamlss is defined as follows stasinopoulos et al 2020 1 y ind d μ σ ν τ 2 η 1 g 1 μ x 1 β 1 s 11 x 11 s 1 j 1 x 1 j 1 3 η 2 g 2 σ x 2 β 2 s 21 x 21 s 2 j 2 x 2 j 2 4 η 3 g 3 ν x 3 β 3 s 31 x 31 s 3 j 3 x 3 j 3 5 η 4 g 4 τ x 4 β 4 s 41 x 41 s 4 j 4 x 4 j 4 where y y1 yn is the vector with the dependent variable observations which are independently distributed and have a distribution d which is defined by its four moments μ σ ν and τ some distributions as the normal or the beta distribution only need to model the first two moments two parameters instead of four the predictors ηi explain the moments of the distribution through a function that depends on the chosen probability distribution xi is a ni pi matrix pi ri 1 containing the r covariate columns chosen for the ith predictor plus a column of ones if a constant is required and βi is the vector of coefficients for the variables selected in the equation of the ith predictor finally sij is a nonparametric smoothing function applied to the covariate xij of the ith predictor for ji 1 ji smoothed variables i e the function that establishes the non linear effects on the parameters of the distribution in gamlss the effect of the independent variables on the parameters of the distribution is allowed to be non linear thus letting data determine the relationship between the predictor e g η1 g μ and the explanatory variables rather than enforcing a linear or polynomial relationship the methods used to define these relationships are known as supervised machine learning since the algorithm iteratively models the relationship making predictions about the data and is corrected on a recurring basis during this process the estimation procedure stops when the algorithm has converged that is when it reaches a predetermined level of performance which might be modified in our application to the cega tsu we use the drought index in april as the dependent variable which is calculated using historical discharge data from the cega and pirón monitoring stations this data is available at several separate webpages in the cedex 2021 database and was downloaded using a web scraping script coded in r on the other hand the independent variables are the weighted average of the six month rolling sum of precipitation and the weighted average of monthly differences of temperatures between april and march in the observed year which is obtained from historical meteorological data measured in the two discharge monitoring stations at the cega and pirón rivers available at copernicus climate change service c3s climate data store cs3 2022 precipitation and temperature are the two key forces used in multi model ensemble experiments to predict impacts on discharge as well as on other key hydrological variables isimip 2022 cmip6 2022 accordingly forecasts of these two variables are available for long periods into the future a key piece of information that we will use to mainstream climate change in our model the database with the dependent and independent variables used to run gamlss is available in annex i of the online supplementary material since the drought index is standardized between 0 and 1 we use beta as the reference distribution which is continuous and ranges from 0 to 1 we also explore alternative models that use other distributions such as the logisticnormal logitno or the generalized beta type 1 gb1 from this set of distributions we generate 17 models by adjusting the degrees of freedom and using alternative smoothing functions all 17 models and the coding used to obtain them in r are available in annex ii of the online supplementary material the models intertwine the smoothing functions between variables which is performed in order to model various levels of complexity and find different ways of fitting the drought index to both precipitation and temperatures among the 17 models generated using this approach we choose the top seven that show a satisfactory predictive performance according to the aic akaike information criterion and bic bayesian information criterion criteria i e aic lower than 41 5 and bic lower than 37 5 aic allows more complex models e g using smoothing functions for some variables whereas bic tends to penalize complexity and chooses more parsimonious models as seen by the population distribution of the models only the beta distribution models satisfy the aforementioned requirements each of the seven gamlss models used in the ensemble is described in the table 1 as seen in the table above model 11 is the one which performs best under the bic on the other hand model 15 is the best under the aic one option at this point is to apply performance tests to choose one of the two models nevertheless that would attribute all the predictive capacity to a single model and would not allow for sampling modeling uncertainty which is a key objective of this research thus we use all seven models in our research through an ensemble of gamlss models fig 3 shows the centiles plot of the effect of each independent variable precipitation and temperatures on the distribution of all models once the ensemble of seven gamlss models is calibrated we gather data from euro cordex predictions on future precipitation and temperatures in the crs for the period 2017 last year with historical data available to 2100 to account for climate change euro cordex 2022 these forecasts are obtained for two climate change scenarios for the 21st century rcp 2 6 and 8 5 while other scenarios such as rcp 4 5 or rcp 6 can be considered our main objective here is to provide worst case and best case climate change scenarios as compared to stationary climate next each model in the gamlss ensemble uses the euro cordex forecasts as an input data to predict the drought index throughout the 2017 2100 series in other words we use the already trained gamlss ensemble trained with the past observations to transform the future values of precipitation and temperatures into predictions of the drought index this is the approach that we have used to allow for climate change using precipitation and temperature forecasts in euro cordex for two key climate change scenarios and given these as an input predicting the future values of the crs tsu drought index once we have the predictions of both mu and sigma of the drought index per year we can estimate the parameters of the population distribution by averaging mu and sigma for each rcp scenario in this way we have estimated the parameters of the drought index distribution under each climate change scenario finally we simulate the underlying population distribution of the model e g beta using the parameters obtained with the 2017 2100 forecasts mean of future values reaching eventually two probability density functions for each model out of which we can extract the probabilities of each drought situation normality pre alert alert and emergency this information is then combined with the drought damage simulations run with the ensemble of mathematical programming models to obtain an expected compensation indemnity and insurance premium for each combination of scenarios and models 3 2 mathematical programming models to simulate irrigators responses to water reallocations this section presents a multi model ensemble comprising several microeconomic mathematical programming models which are used to sample modeling structural and parameter uncertainty in the representation of human responses to water allocation restrictions under drought pérez blanco et al 2021 sapino et al 2020 the ensemble includes two positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup and two positive mathematical programming pmp models in all four models the agent an irrigator aims to maximize its utility u x within a domain f as follows 6 max u x f z 1 x z 2 x z m x subject to 7 x i 0 8 i 1 n x i 1 9 x f 10 x r n 11 z 1 x z 2 x z m x z x r m where u x is a monotonically increasing utility function i e increasing the provision of any utility relevant attribute z 1 x z 2 x z m x increases the utility for the agent thus all attributes are defined so that more is better meaning less is better attributes are transformed accordingly e g risk is measured as risk avoidance we explore the relevance of five attributes in our microeconomic ensemble profit z 1 measured as the expected gross margin the only relevant attribute for pmp models and a relevant attribute for pmaup models as well and a critical variable to estimate drought damage and the risk premium risk avoidance z 2 and management complexity avoidance measured through three proxies total labor avoidance z 3 hired labor avoidance z 4 and direct costs avoidance z 5 a comprehensive description and mathematical formulation of each attribute as well as a database including all the input data used to quantify attributes provision in the awdus including source and reference year is available in annex i of the online supplementary material x is the decision variable or crop portfolio a vector indicating the share of land allotted to each crop x i in which is revised on a yearly basis at the beginning of the irrigation campaign in april we consider both irrigated and rainfed crops in the portfolio for simulation purposes to allow for super extensive margin adaptations crop switching towards rainfed crops each crop x i delivers a unique combination of utility relevant attributes z x f represents the set of constraints that conform the domain including the water allocation constraint of relevance for our research since it is the variable directly affected by the dmp 12 i 1 n w i x i w where w i represents the water needs by crop x i and w represents the water allocation on a per hectare basis the other constraints conforming the domain f are presented in annex iii of the online supplementary material the pmp and pmaup models included in the ensemble of mathematical programming models use the same data inputs and share a common specification of the domain but differ in the form of the utility function u x and calibration method used pmp models adopt a single attribute quadratic utility function where the only utility relevant attribute is profit z 1 pmp models are calibrated in three steps i an additional area constraint that bounds the model calibration results to observed choices is introduced in the domain and the dual values associated to the constraint for each crop obtained ii these dual values are used to add a non linear component to the utility function typically a quadratic cost function or shadow cost and iii the utility non linear function obtained in ii is maximized subject to a similar set of constraints to those considered in the original problem which perfectly reproduces the observed agent s behavior heckelei et al 2012 the two pmp models used in our ensemble are the classical pmp model developed by howitt 1995 and a variation of this model developed by júdez et al 2002 which skips the first step in the calibration procedure above on the other hand pmaup models use a multi attribute utility function that in our case includes profit risk avoidance and management complexity avoidance pmaup replaces the dual variables added to the utility function in pmp models with agent s preference parameters represented as shares of a utility function the arguments of which are competing attributes e g profits v risk avoidance the two pmaup models included in the ensemble differ on the functional form and calibration method used building on work by gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 gómez limón et al 2016 adopt a non linear cobb douglas utility function that is calibrated using a projection method conventional pmaup while montilla lópez et al 2018 adopt a linear utility function that is calibrated using a weighted goals programming method wgp pmaup à là sumpsi et al 1997 pmaup and pmp models are calibrated for the year 2017 which is also the last year in the data series used in the gamlss ensemble calibration results and calibration errors for the pmaup models are available in annex iv in the online supplementary material calibration results for pmp models are not reported since they perfectly calibrate to the observed decision crop portfolio so the error is always null and the only relevant attribute is profit as per the metrics for performance assessment of pmaup models in essenfelder et al 2018 all awdus have a very low calibration error average error 10 in the conventional pmaup model while in the wgp pmaup model 2 awdus have a very low calibration error and 2 of them have a moderate calibration error average error in the range of 10 15 4 results and discussion the sub sections below present the i losses and ii fair risk premium estimations obtained through the application of our methods to the crs as noted in section 2 and elsewhere in the paper modeling is performed at an awdu level and afterwards aggregated to the level of a representative farm for the whole crs hence even though results are robust at an awdu and sub basin level the performance of the insurance on individual farms would show heterogeneity depending on the individual crop mix and economic preferences i e robust performance of the drought insurance scheme for the average crs agent does not ensure robust performance for every single farmer over the sub basin 4 1 simulation results drought damages we first run a series of simulations with the ensemble of mathematical programming models to assess irrigators responses to alternative water allocations under normality 100 or full water allocation to 90 pre alert 90 75 alert 75 50 and emergency 50 0 to this end we progressively strengthen the water allocation constraint from 100 to 0 at 1 point intervals and estimate the corresponding expected damages in each of the 100 simulation runs measured through changes in profit z 1 under different water restrictions as compared to the situation with a full water allocation second we estimate the probability distribution of the drought index for each of the seven models in the gamlss ensemble under three alternative climate change scenarios no climate change rcp 2 6 and rcp8 5 finally we combine the expected damage under each plausible value of the drought index obtained with the ensemble of mathematical programming models with the probability distribution of the drought index under each climate change scenario obtained with the gamlss ensemble to calculate the expected damage under each climate scenario and combination of models the resultant ensemble of ensembles or grand ensemble yields 84 alternative predictions ensemble elements 7 gamlss models times 4 mathematical programming models times 3 climate change scenarios that assess modeling and scenario uncertainty the range of foregone profit forecasts under each climate scenario is shown in fig 4 our results show two clusters of predictions ensemble elements the first cluster in the upper part of the figure comprises the grand ensemble elements that result from the combination of the wgp model in the microeconomic ensemble with the models in the gamlss ensemble and predicts damages in the range of 985 6 1767 6 ha the second cluster in the lower part of the figure comprises the grand ensemble elements resulting from the combination of every other microeconomic model with the models in the gamlss ensemble and predict drought damages in the range of 26 9 433 2 ha the non trivial differences observed between the two clusters in the grand ensemble are primarily owed to the drought damages estimated in the wgp model which differ significantly from the estimations of other models in the microeconomic ensemble see fig 5 when an emergency drought is declared drought index value of 0 15 and water allocation is reduced by 50 the wgp microeconomic model estimates an expected profit of 1381 ha while the other three models estimate an expected profit in the range of 3524 3688 6 ha more than twice as much meaning the wgp overestimates drought damage under emergency as compared to the other three models in the microeconomic ensemble the wgp also overestimates drought damage as compared to the other three microeconomic models under alert and most of the pre alert values on the other hand the wgp underestimates drought damage under normality which partly but not fully offsets the higher damages under pre alert alert and emergency when combining the drought damage estimated using the microeconomic model with the probability distribution of the drought index estimated using gamlss what explains these differences it should be noted that the wgp pmaup is the only microeconomic model in the ensemble of mathematical programming models that has a linear utility function linear models have been often criticized in the academic literature because of their tendency to yield over specialized or even corner solutions the irrigator chooses the crop with the highest utility at the maximum level i e maximum possible land allocated to that crop until a constraint becomes binding and prevents the agent from further specialization for a review of these models see e g graveline 2016 this results in a jumpy behavior and simulated crop portfolio choices that seem too far from reality at least in the short term graveline 2016 to illustrate the responses of irrigators in linear v non linear models fig 6 shows the crop portfolio responses the decision variable in the ensemble of microeconomic models x predicted by the four models in the microeconomic ensemble under emergency alert pre alert and normality drought index thresholds fig 6 shows how irrigators responses differ significantly between the wgp pmaup and the other three models in the microeconomic ensemble whose crop portfolio simulations are also closer to observed irrigators choices as a result the wgp pmaup has significantly higher calibration errors than the other three models see annex iv in the online supplementary material with this in mind we could employ model selection techniques to compare and choose among the models in the ensemble those that perform better in terms of calibration errors which would lead to the exclusion of the wgp pmaup on the other hand calibration errors cannot be directly compared among all the mathematical programming models in the ensemble since these errors are independent cloke et al 2013 moreover while we can assess the capacity of microeconomic models to reproduce observed behavior through realized crop portfolio choices and calibration errors data on irrigators responses to water allocation reductions is limited to drought years since 2007 the year dmps were first approved meaning that we do not have sufficient data to evaluate the predictive performance and prediction errors of the models in the microeconomic ensemble assessing the predictive performance of models is a critical step in model selection konishi and kitagawa 2008 which can be also used towards improving model calibration notably through the use of machine learning techniques as it is done in gamlss without this information we cannot conclude that the wgp pmaup predicts worse than the other models in the ensemble just because it has relatively high calibration errors on the contrary it may occur that a model with a relatively high calibration error is a better predictor for non observed data than other alternative models with relatively low calibration errors pindyck 2015 it can be argued that the higher calibration error of the wgp pmaup is a valuable piece of information to improve our analysis e g by allotting different weights to the models in the microeconomic ensemble yet this is challenging due to the subjectivity involved in defining prior assumptions about the accuracy and weight attributable to each model tebaldi and knutti 2007 besides ensemble experiments that assign weights to models typically do so based on the predictive performance of the model taner et al 2019 which cannot be assessed due to the above mentioned data constraint accordingly rather than excluding models with high calibration errors or using a weighting approach we consider all the models in the microeconomic ensemble including the wgp pmaup and adopt an un weighted approach 1 1 it has been argued that when probabilistic information is not considered each potential vulnerability is equally important on the overall robustness which can also be interpreted as an implicitly equal weighting taner et al 2019 yet in our case we cannot claim that each model has an equal weight because these weights are essentially unknown this allows us to more thoroughly sample modeling uncertainty identify a larger number of potential surprises as compared to ensembles excluding specific models and related predictions ensemble elements and minimize potential regret thus contributing to a more robust analysis on the feasibility of the proposed index based drought insurance scheme 4 2 fair premium estimations next we use the predictions on expected damages see fig 4 to calculate the corresponding fair risk premiums under each climate change scenario the fair risk premium is a critical variable to assess the feasibility of insurance and can be interpreted as the minimum long term annuity cost for the proposed drought insurance scheme to be supplied by a competitive and risk neutral insurance firm the fair risk premium is obtained as the ratio of the expected compensation to the insured asset in our case the insured asset equals the expected profit under full 100 water allocation in constant prices while the expected compensation or indemnity is obtained as a function of the expected damage under each climate scenario reported in fig 4 and the deductible applied by the insurance industry the deductible is a mandatory out of pocket expense by the insured that is typically required before any compensation is paid represented as the fraction of the potential economic damage that is not covered by the insurance company in spanish crop insurance schemes the deductible is typically set at 30 ruiz et al 2015 if the deductible is 0 the company compensates the irrigator for all drought damages on the other hand when there is a deductible the company only compensates the irrigator if damages are higher than the deductible multiplied by the value of the insured asset and the compensation paid amounts to the damages in excess of the deductible for example if the deductible is 30 and a drought causes damages equaling 32 of the value of the insured asset the company would compensate the irrigator with an amount equaling 2 of the value of the insured asset damage in excess of the deductible for any damage of 30 or lower there would be no compensation deductibles are a key instrument to address moral hazard behavior without deductibles irrigators would have no incentives to reduce their drought exposure and drought damages because they do not bear the cost of that risk thus deductibles are typically applied to crop insurance schemes worldwide pérez blanco et al 2017 by reducing the share of damages to be compensated deductibles also reduce the fair risk premium and make insurance policies more affordable to farmers fig 7 reports the range of the fair risk premium in under each climate change scenario for deductibles of 1 5 10 and 30 in the scenario with stationary climate no climate change the fair risk premium ranges between 0 2 and 22 of the insured asset for a 1 deductible between 0 01 and 18 2 for a 5 deductible between 0 and 15 for a 10 deductible and between 0 and 6 8 for a 30 deductible in the rcp 2 6 scenario the fair risk premium ranges between 2 and 30 3 of the insured asset for a 1 deductible between 1 1 and 26 8 for a 5 deductible between 0 and 23 8 for a 10 deductible and between 0 and 14 for a 30 deductible in the rcp8 5 scenario the fair risk premium ranges between 3 6 and 37 1 of the insured asset for a 1 deductible between 2 3 and 33 6 for a 5 deductible between 1 5 and 30 3 for a 10 deductible and between 0 1 and 19 for a 30 deductible it is important noting that the cost of the insurance policy depends on top of the fair risk premium on the commercial premium administration commercialization albeit for index based insurance schemes with low administration and commercialization costs commercial premiums are minor and typically increase fair risk premiums by 10 20 bielza et al 2009 guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 accounting for this additional margin has no impact on our results in table 2 thus for the sake of simplicity we treat insurance costs and fair risk premium as synonyms the feasibility of drought risk in irrigated agriculture depends on the affordability of the estimated fair risk premiums which calls for additional information on irrigators willingness and or ability to pay for the proposed drought insurance scheme estimating the willingness to pay for crop insurance requires ad hoc fieldwork interviews and modeling through revealed preference pérez blanco et al 2016 or stated preference methods e g contingent valuation liesivaara and myyra 2014 a task that is out of the scope of this paper on the other hand the ability to pay of economic agents is often assessed in the literature by comparing the risk premium to the other variable costs already paid by the agent for example gómez limón 2020 assesses the affordability of an hypothetical drought insurance scheme through the ratio of the fair risk premium in absolute instead of relative terms to variable costs which we weight by the probabilities of each water constraint so as to determine the simulated cost according to this author if the fair risk premium represents less than 20 of the variable costs the insurance policy can be considered affordable albeit the preferred threshold is 10 table 2 shows the fair risk premium to variable costs ratios for different deductibles in the crs for a conventional deductible of 30 the proposed index based insurance would be actuarially feasible fair risk premium to variable costs ratio 20 under all models for the current stationary climate i e robust and under all models except for the wgp pmaup which overestimates drought damage as compared to the other three models in the microeconomic ensemble for the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 climate change scenarios based on the median estimate which is more robust to the wgp outlier the proposed index based insurance scheme would be actuarially feasible under all models and scenarios as well as all deductibles if we consider the mean estimate the proposed index based insurance scheme would be unfeasible under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios unless a deductible of 30 10 in the case of rcp2 6 is applied it is worth noting that the information on the wgp pmaup outliers warns us about potential unfavorable surprises which can trigger massive damages and threaten the feasibility of the proposed index based insurance to prevent these damages from realizing and particularly in the case of systemic risks such as droughts insurers often hire re insurance instruments to hedge against potentially massive damages without the need to immobilize large amounts of money rejda and mcnamara 2014 the exploration of these outliers can thus provide valuable information for insurers assessing the development of hydrological insurance and the acquisition of re insurance instruments 5 conclusions this paper assesses the feasibility and robustness of an index based insurance scheme against droughts in irrigated agriculture under climate change to this end we develop a grand ensemble that samples both modeling and scenario uncertainty in the estimation of the insurance risk premium the grand ensemble combines four microeconomic models and seven gamlss models which are run for three alternative climate change scenarios methods allow us to reveal potential unfavorable surprises and minimize regret in the design and development of the proposed drought insurance scheme methods are illustrated with an application to the crs in spain where we find that for a conventional deductible of 30 the proposed index based insurance is actuarially feasible under all models for the current stationary climate i e robust under climate change rcp2 6 and 8 5 all models considered with the exception of the pmaup wgp show that the risk premium is affordable all deductibles we envision several ways in which further research can improve the methods presented here first ad hoc studies on the willingness to pay for drought insurance in irrigated agriculture are necessary to obtain more conclusive results on the feasibility of the proposed insurance scheme second our analysis has been applied considering the current approach to water resources management in the crs if water resources management in the area changes e g new infrastructures are built such as reservoirs and or tsu drought indices are revised our assessment will have to be updated to account for these changes and reassess the feasibility of index based hydrological drought insurance in the area third assessments on the costs of re insurance policies and its impact on risk premiums are necessary to assess the feasibility of the proposed index based hydrological drought insurance fourth crop insurance may trigger moral hazard because the insured agent has an incentive to increase its exposure to risk given it does not bear the full costs of that risk recent research has suggested that moral hazard tends to negatively affect autonomous climate change adaptation efforts by farmers through a reduction in self protection behavior such as the adoption of drought resistant crops with a lower expected profit and risk miao 2020 müller et al 2017 moral hazard has been traditionally addressed through insurance deductibles albeit new approaches have suggested that risk based pricing can play a relevant role in reducing moral hazard while also encouraging self protection behavior surminski et al 2015 further research should also explore the impact of risk based pricing and other incentives supporting autonomous adaptation on the performance and affordability of hydrological drought insurance fifth in line with conventional mathematical programming modeling the decision variable used in the microeconomic ensemble refers exclusively to crop portfolio choices land allocation while this allows for extensive land reallocations towards less water intensive crops and super extensive land reallocations from irrigated to rainfed agriculture margin adjustments it excludes intensive margin adjustments through deficit irrigation an increasingly relevant adaptation option to irrigators in water stressed areas albeit still of marginal relevance in the crs graveline and mérel 2014 as the new generation of mathematical programming models allows for intensive margin adjustments and an ensemble of such models can be conformed we expect the microeconomic ensemble to become more realistic and potentially more accurate in the predictions of irrigators responses finally additional relevant scenarios and systems could be incorporated into the analysis to more thoroughly sample uncertainty critically our methodology combines the impact of future climatic variables on water availability with microeconomic simulations using historical and climate stationary agricultural data on water need crop yield crop prices and farming costs all of which will be likely affected by climate change agmip 2022 this limitation should be explored in further research e g by expanding our gamlss modeling to predict changes in these variables or by explicitly incorporating additional systems and their models e g macroeconomic modeling to assess price

9248,microirrigation system is an efficient irrigation method that saves up to 60 of water and nutrients however the huge investment for installation of modern microirrigation systems is beyond of many smallholder crop producers therefore this study focuses to model and develop the capillary wick irrigation system for greenhouse crop production to address this issue the results revealed on tested wick materials that the maximum capillary height and maximum water holding capacity were observed in cotton bonded non woven wick material compared to other materials p 0 05 water level wick length and pot size linearly affected the discharge of wick emitter in hanging and buried capillary wick irrigation system cwis in this study the discharge equations for wick emitter of hanging and buried cwis were successfully developed comparison of calculated discharge using newly developed equation with actual measured discharge of buried wick for potted tomatoes in greenhouse proved the accuracy of the equation the effects of evapotranspiration were also found linearly on discharge of wick emitter and the relation between emitter discharge pot size and evapotranspiration were lead the development of wick discharge linear curve wdlc wdlc introduced to estimate the required discharge for potted crops under cwis then solver program was used to successfully simulate the wick discharge for different potted crops under a cwis outcomes of the study can be beneficial for smallholder farmers for greenhouse crop production for adopting cwis as low cost and highly efficient microirrigation system keywords microirrigation capillary wick irrigation hanging wick buried wick greenhouse potted crops data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction almost 70 of our planet is covered with water but unfortunately only about 3 of earth s water is fresh and of that less than 1 water is usable wwf 2021 water scarcity and agriculture are intrinsically linked as agriculture consumes 72 of available fresh water compared to 16 by municipalities for domestic use and 12 by industries un water 2019 according to the un s food and agriculture organization fao approximately 60 of fresh water used in agriculture sector wasted due to inefficient applications therefore there is an urgent need to develop and adopt efficient irrigation methods and proper irrigation management strategies one of the irrigation management strategies is the adoption of microirrigation such as drip irrigation system levidow et al 2014 drip irrigation has been proven to save significant amounts of water and labor cost increase yield and enhance product quality compared to other microirrigation systems catin and kara 2021 however its high investment and energy costs prevent the wider applications among farmers especially subsistence farmers muhammad 2015 greenhouse plant production is a good option in boosting agricultural production it helps to meet the food demands of today s world increasing population nevertheless the costs of current microirrigation systems are out of reach for many smallholder crop producers especially in developing asian countries therefore there has been immense interest in developing new microirrigation systems and wick irrigation system is promising irrigation method to address this issue brainbridge 2014 the self watering system employing a wick was used by dolar and keeney 1971 and helmut 1972 capillary wick irrigation system cwis is a sub irrigation system that utilizes a device strip which provides water through capillary movement from a reservoir to the plant growing medium semananda et al 2018 fultariya et al 2017 the cwis is economical in terms of time and labor costs in comparison with overhead irrigation systems for potted plants semananda et al 2018 it is also water and nutrient efficient and therefore it is ideal for greenhouse crop production so et al 2003 the capillary irrigation system produces better quality with less water loss as there is no runoff decreases chances of pests and diseases attacks and it also offers easy and economical cost of installation and operation bainbridge 2002 rowshon et al 2019 heidari et al 2022 the self watering system also increases the efficiency of root water and nutrient uptake million et al 2007 al mayahi et al 2020 bhatt and kanzariya 2017 reported 54 6 increase in yield and 82 4 water saving in tomato solanum lycopersicum using wick irrigation compared to the basin irrigation method wick irrigation method was reported as an effective method to produce quality azaleas compared to other irrigation method million et al 2007 chaturvedi et al 2021 evaluated the physiological efficiency with mechanistic understanding of chili okra and tomato crop under wick irrigation method compared to conventional irrigation and found wick irrigation significantly efficient over conventional irrigation since the introduction of the system there were a few drawbacks but with the passage of time and a little attention of scientists these problems were solved i e wesonga et al 2014 stated that the ability of a cwis for raising water ranges from 10 to 20 cm however selections of wick materials play an important role in cwis lee et al 2010 moreover cotton bonded non woven wick material cnw is the most studied and only commercially available wick material muhammad 2015 in most of earlier studies the wicks were used from the bottom of the pot wesonga et al 2014 muhammad 2015 therefore the height of the pots was limited due to the wick inability to raise water to the upper part of the pots this limitation could be overcome by using wick from the surface of the pots muhammad 2015 moreover there was also a challenge of roots not penetrating in wick emitters resulting in the reduction of capillary action this problem was later addressed by masuda 2008 by developing a root proof cwis for long term vegetable production to protect the emitters from penetration by the roots despite numerous advantages of the wick irrigation system the wick irrigation has not received enough attention from researchers and very few studies applied this method in addition several materials could be suitable for wick emitters however very few materials have been tested as wick emitters thus there is still a need for scientific concern the available literature on wick discharge and its relation to discharge controlling factors are also limited as in previous studies the discharge rate of wick emitter was neglected therefore the current study was conducted to develop a systematic capillary wick irrigation system hanging and buried for greenhouse crop production the objectives were 1 to evaluate the performance of wick emitter under different arrangements both in laboratory and greenhouse conditions 2 to develop wick emitter discharge equation for buried and hanging wick irrigation system and 3 to develop a simulation model for estimating the recommended wick discharge for different greenhouse potted crops 2 methodology 2 1 evaluation of wick experiments were carried out in the soil physics laboratory universiti putra malaysia with three replications to select the optimal wick material s for use in the capillary wick irrigation system following a methodology adopted in wesonga et al 2014 but with slight modifications three different wick materials each of 10 mm wide and 400 mm long 1 40 cm were evaluated in this study the cotton bonded non woven wick cnw and two other local wick materials the gunny bag material gbm and cotton material cm car towel duster the cnw was imported from south korea and composed of 10 nylon 10 polyester and 80 of cotton the gbm made of hessian fabric burlap formed from jute whilst the cm made of cotton three parameters were measured in this study water holding capacity whc capillarity action and maximum capillary height mhc water holding capacity whc was determined by firstly oven drying the wick materials at 50 c until a constant weight was obtained using analytical balance sartorius bt 224 s subsequently the wick materials were soaked in a shallow basin of water and allowed to saturate for 10 min the saturated wick materials were weighed and placed on a piece of netting to drain excess water for 5 min water holding capacity of each material was calculated using equation 1 whc ms md ms 100 where whc is water holding capacity ms is the mass of saturated wick material g and md the dry mass of a wick material g for capillary rise the wick materials were oven dried and then pegged on a string clamped on two rings stand the bottom end of each wick material was inserted into a water filled beaker and red color marker ink was added to the water to enhance the visual observation water rise was observed visually and then measured in centimeters using measuring tape every hour thereafter maximum capillary height was recorded after three hours when there was no further water rise wesonga et al 2014 2 2 determination of wick discharge under different arrangements the capillary wick irrigation system absorbed water from the pvc pipe and supplied it into the potted substrate or collection beaker by gravity the laboratory experiment was set up for the discharge measurement fig 1 wick material cotton bonded non woven wick 1 cm wide 40 cm long and polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe 9 cm diameter were used and discharge rates of the hanging and buried wicks were measured under various combinations of the controlling factors for hanging wick the correlation of five different water levels inside the pvc pipe 5 6 7 8 and 9 cm and three different wick lengths inside the pipe 7 9 and 11 cm were evaluated the elevation difference between ground and pvc pipes was 32 cm while end caps of pvc pipes were modified through cutting according to the desired water level to manage water level inside pipe water was collected for 24 h using a beaker and then measured using gratitude cylinder and the experiment was replicated five times for buried wick peat moss peatgro standard grade was used as a growing media with five different water levels inside the pipe 5 6 7 8 and 9 cm three different wick lengths inside the pvc pipe 7 9 and 11 cm two different initial water contents of the growing media 10 and 20 and three different pot sizes by volume 3 l 6 l and 12 l the discharge rate of the wick was measured for 24 h using an analytical balance while initial water content was measured using a soil sensor spectrum technologies inc 2 3 estimation of the discharge of the wick emitter muhammad 2015 derived equations for compensating wick emitter discharge for buried and hanging eqs 2 and 3 following the continuity equation for water flow eq 4 keller and bliesner 1990 by replacing pressure head of a drip emitter with a capillary height of the wicking emitter 2 qe 60 8 h c 0 66 for buried wick 3 and qe 32 85 h c 0 26 for hanging wick where q e emitter discharge ml hr and h c capillary height mm 4 q e k e h e x where q e emitter discharge k e emitter discharge coefficient h e pressure head x an exponent dimensionless which varies between 0 and 1 muhammad 2015 used distance between water level and the top edge of pvc pipe as capillary height in the above equations however there are also some other factors e g size of pvc pipe diameter water level inside pipe wick length inside pipe distance between water level and top edge of the pvc pipe in both hanging and buried wicks and pot size which are directly responsible for controlling discharge of buried and hanging wicks therefore an attempt was made to develop the wick discharge equation with maximum possible discharge controlling factors in order to develop wick discharge equation the continuity equation for water flow was solved by calculating x exponent and ke emitter discharge coefficient as per eqs 5 and 6 5 x log q 1 q 2 log h 1 h 2 6 and k e q e h e x where q1 and q2 minimum and maximum discharges respectively and h1 and h2 minimum and maximum pressure head respectively while q emitter discharge ml hr and h pressure head which was replaced with controlling factors fc in this study the relationship between emitter discharge q e and controlling factors fc was used for developing of the wick discharge equation through a series of laboratory experiments furthermore irrigation uniformity of cnw wick emitter was already discussed in detail by muhammad and rowshon 2015 who reported 95 65 and 92 67 uniformity coefficient and distribution uniformity of cnw wick emitter respectively and the same findings were confirmed in our current study 2 4 tomato nursery a local hybrid variety of tomato was selected for greenhouse experiment the seeds were sown in small pots one l containing soil and sand 2 1 and irrigated manually after three weeks plants were transplanted to the pots used in experiment containing peat moss peatgro standard grade 2 5 experimental setup in greenhouse furthermore greenhouse experiments were conducted to measure the discharge of buried wick and also to observe the effects of evapotranspiration et on the discharge of buried wick the performance of buried wick irrigation was tested with potted tomatoes the experimental setup was installed at ladang 2 universiti putra malaysia three plastic pots of 3 6 and 12 l capacity were regulated under two different water level 50 4 5 cm and 75 6 75 cm the pot sizes were selected as recommended in this paper joseph 2010 the treatments were replicated six times on six pvc pipes each of 90 mm in diameter and 3658 mm in length giving a total of 6 treatments subsequently total 36 wick emitters each of 40 cm in length 9 cm inside pvc pipe and 10 12 and 16 cm depth of wick emitter in 3 l 6 l and 12 l pot respectively were used the elevation differences between pot and pipes were 7 cm 11 cm and 13 cm for 12 l 6 l and 3 l respectively as shown in fig 2 2 6 measurement of wick discharge in greenhouse discharges were measured for 24 h with an analytical balance sf 400 two pots from each treatment were randomly selected for discharge measurement round shaped plastic trays were placed at the bottom of every pot to collect excess water drained out from the pots and the pre weighed pots were weighed after 24 h using an analytical balance sf 400 and the discharge was measured using the eq 7 7 q iw fw et where iw is initial weight g fw final weight g and et is evapotranspiration ml 2 7 evapotranspiration determination evapotranspiration was determined using the gravimetric method with monitoring of the pot weight loss over a given time interval kirnak et al 2001 in order to determine the et by gravimetric methods the tomato plants were grown in the same sized pots used in the treatments and were irrigated to saturation and then left for one hour the pots were weighed using an analytical balance sf 400 consequently the decrease in the pot weights after 24 h was the amount of water consumed by the evapotranspiration process 2 8 estimation of wick discharge for different crops the wick discharges were estimated as per wick discharge simulation chart fig 3 for different crops i e eggplant cabbage cauliflower strawberries and sweet peppers the selected crops were studied at flowering and fruiting stages under glasshouse condition in tropical climate because these stages are known as peak stages of crops and required high amount of water to estimate the required discharge for the selected crop crop characteristics were needed i e crop et and recommended pot size evapotranspiration was estimated using cropwat software anon 2009 the climatic data were collected from the malaysian metrological department finally the crop et was obtained using the eq 8 salama 2011 8 etc kceto where etc crop evapotranspiration kc crop coefficient and eto reference evapotranspiration crop coefficient was adopted from anon 2016 based on et and pot size the required discharge was estimated using wick discharge linear curve wdlc and finally discharges were calculated for selected crop using wick discharge eq solver 3 results the wick materials differed considerably in water absorption p 0 05 over the entire period as presented in table 1 the cotton boded non woven wick material cnw exhibited the highest water absorption pattern with 20 cm at 180 min while the lowest capillary action was recorded in the cotton material cm with 6 cm at 180 min capillary action was in order cnw gbm cm over the entire period the cnw material used as wick material performed significantly better than gbm and cm the maximum capillary height was recorded in cnw followed by gbm followed by cm with 20 cm 8 cm and 6 cm respectively cnw gbm and cm were also significantly different from each other in the water holding capacity with 85 80 84 50 and 82 20 respectively table 2 shows the individual effects of water level and wick length inside the pipe on the discharge of hanging wick the maximum mean discharge was recorded as 12 1 ml hr at 9 cm while the minimum mean discharge was recorded as 7 7 ml hr at 5 cm for different water levels inside the pipe moreover the maximum mean discharge was recorded as 11 0 ml hr at 11 cm while the minimum mean discharge was recorded 8 8 ml hr at 7 cm for different wick lengths inside the pipe furthermore the water level and wick length inside the pipe were linearly correlated with the discharge of hanging wick with a strong correlation of r2 0 9993 and r2 0 9973 respectively table 3 shows the individual effects of water level pot size wick length and initial moisture contents on the discharge of buried wick where the maximum mean discharge 13 2 ml hr at 9 cm and the minimum mean discharge 8 9 ml hr at 5 cm for different water levels inside the pipe likewise the maximum mean discharge 13 8 ml hr in 12 l and the minimum mean discharge 8 7 ml hr in 3 l for different pot size moreover the maximum mean discharge of 12 2 ml hr at 11 cm and the minimum mean discharge of 10 0 ml hr at 7 cm for different wick lengths inside the pipe furthermore the lower mean discharge of 10 9 ml hr in 20 as compared to 11 4 ml hr in 10 initial water was recorded moreover linear effects of water level pot size and wick length on discharge of buried wick was r2 0 9985 r2 0 9955 and r2 0 9901 respectively fig 4 shows the effects of initial volumetric contents on the discharge of buried wick for 24 h with interval of six hours the effects of initial volumetric contents were observed with the increase of water contents by decreasing in discharge of buried wick over time the equations developed by muhammad 2015 to estimate the wick discharge was dealing with the capillary height of wick emitter distance from the water level to the top edge of pvc pipe and having reverse relation of capillary height and discharge however there are some other factors that have been shown to have a direct effect on discharge of wick i e size of pvc pipe diameter water level inside pipe wick length inside pipe distance between water level and top edge of the pvc pipe in both hanging and buried wicks and pot size etc in buried wick therefore based on this observation the h c was replaced with fc controlling factors and wick emitter discharge equations eq 9 and eq 10 were developed with a correlation of maximum possible discharge controlling factors 9 q e 2 383 fc 0 369 for hanging 10 q e 3 961 fc 0 327 for buried where qe is emitter discharge ml hr and fc is controlling factors to find out fc two equations were further developed for hanging eq 11 and for buried eq 12 11 fc wl h for hanging 12 f c wl h ps 12 for buried where fc is controlling factor wl is water level inside the pipe cm and ps is pot size in volume liters and 12 is constant which will remain the same and h is height cm which can be determined as per eq 13 13 h lw d where h is for height and lw is wick length used inside the pipe cm and d is a distance which can be measured by eq 14 14 d td wl where td is for total diameter of pipe cm and wl is for water level cm to make it further easy a wick discharge equation solver was developed to solve the equation the solver can also be used to develop a wick discharge equation for other wick materials fig 5 the wick width does have impact on discharge kang et al 2009 but it was not considered in the equation developed as the only wick available in the market was 10 mm wide which had sufficient discharge for most crops grown in greenhouse muhammad 2015 3 1 relationship of discharge et water level and pot size under greenhouse conditions fig 6 shows the relationship of discharge et water level and pot size the highest discharge was recorded as 19 9 ml hr in pot size 12 l volume at 75 water level and 6 04 mm et while the lowest discharge was recorded 5 5 ml hr in pot size 3 l volume at 50 of water level and 3 78 mm et the results of laboratory experiments have already proven the linear effects of the water level and pot size on the discharge of buried wick irrigation and the results under greenhouse conditions shown almost the same effects of pot size and water level on the discharge of buried wick however it was noticed that the et also affected the discharge of buried wick with increases in et linearly increasing the discharge of buried wick under greenhouse the evapotranspiration linearly affected the discharge of buried wick at r² 0 947 0 900 and 0 872 in 3 l 6 l and 12 l pot size respectively at 50 water level whilst at 75 water level r² was 0 857 0 905 and 0 888 in 3 l 6 l and 12 l pot size respectively table 4 shows the estimated discharge of buried wick using a wick emitter discharge equation and compared with the actual mean of measured discharge in the greenhouse it can be seen that the estimated discharge is very close to the mean measured discharge the results proved that the wick discharge equation works properly and discharge can be estimated using a wick discharge equation 3 2 estimation of wick discharge for different crops the wick discharge linear curve fig 7 was developed based on the results obtained from the greenhouse experiment the required discharges for selected crops under a capillary wick irrigation system buried were estimated based on et and recommended pot size using wick discharge linear curve the wdlc is based on the correlation of et pot size and discharge so the required discharge for any crop under buried wick irrigation system can be easily estimated if the et and recommended pot size are known furthermore estimated discharges were calculated using wick equation solver basically the equation solver is for estimating the discharge of wick emitter by putting known conditions wick length and water level inside pipe and diameter of pipe for hanging and adding pot size too for buried but it also can be used to estimate the required conditions to achieve the desired discharge moreover it can be seen in table 5 that required discharge for each selected crop can be achieved with a single wick emitter using different pipe size water level and wick length so the results revealed that the single emitter can be sufficient for eggplants cabbage cauliflower strawberries and sweet peppers if grown in a greenhouse under wick irrigation system additionally the wick discharge equation solver and wick discharge linear curve successfully suggest the required wick discharge conditions for selected crop under wick irrigation based on et and recommended pot size 4 discussion selection of wick material is the most important factor for the establishment of capillary wick irrigation system wesonga et al 2014 water holding capacity and maximum capillary action are the key factors to evaluate the best wick material since they are self watering sub irrigation systems using wick to absorb water so et al 2003 son et al 2006 in the current study two local materials gunny bag material gbm and cotton cloth material cm were compared with imported cotton bonded non woven wick cnw the results revealed significant difference among all tested material for mch and whc cnw had 20 cm mch and 85 8 whc and these results are very close to findings from previous studies 14 19 cm wesonga et al 2014 and 19 cm muhammad 2015 while the poor performance was recorded in cl in previous studies other materials were tested as wick emitter i e bonded non woven fabric so et al 2003 blanket material wesonga et al 2014 polyester capillary mat chanseetis et al 2001 and rolled polyester cloth however cnw material reveals best attribute for capillary wick irrigation system therefore recommended as best suitable wick emitter results obtained from laboratory experiment revealed the linear effects of water level and wick length on the discharge of buried and hanging wick similarly the effects of pot size and initial moisture contents on the discharge of buried wick were also linear these results were in line with the findings of an previous studies conducted by muhammad 2015 muhammad and rowshon 2015 who reported the significant effects of wick length and initial moisture contents on wick discharge however till the date no study has been conducted to evaluate the effects of water level and pot size on wick discharge as the wick emitters supply water continuously through absorption and gravity so the pot size and initial moisture contents are important factors to be studied effects of size and types of pots on efficacy of subirrigation was also reported in previous studies bailey et al 2014 beeks and evans 2013 besides that pot size directly affects plant leaf area shoot biomass and root biomass poorter et al 2012 gallegos et al 2020 therefore this study was designed to evaluate the effects of all possible factors on wick discharge and their relation this relation among the discharge and discharge controlling factors were used for the development of wick emitter discharge equations wick emitter discharge equation was developed by replacing capillary height h c muhammad 2015 with controlling factors fc in this regard a series of equations were developed to find out fc furthermore wick discharge equation solver was developed which can easily solve wick discharge equation by putting required data into it i e total pipe diameter in cm wick length inside the pipe cm and the water level inside the pipe cm for buried and hanging wicks however pot size l is also required to estimate the discharge of buried wick cnw noticeably the solver can also be used to develop a wick discharge equation for other wick materials emitters as well by adding some additional information the results also showed that the estimated discharge using wick emitter discharge equation is closely matched to the mean of measured discharge in the greenhouse hence it proved that the discharge of wick emitter cnw can be successfully estimated using wick emitter discharge equation moreover the recorded discharge for potted tomatoes in glasshouse was ranged from 132 to 478 ml day in different arrangements of capillary wick irrigation system while salokhe et al 2005 reported maximum water requirements for drip irrigated tomatoes under glasshouse in the tropics is 400 ml day the effects of evapotranspiration on the discharge of buried wick revealed that with an increase in et linearly increases the discharge this relation between discharge and et helped to create a wick discharge linear curve for estimating required discharge under cwis for different crops based on et and pot size basically the water needed for metabolic need of the plant is negligible therefore et can be considered as equal to consumptive use of water by plants salama 2011 and ewaid et al 2019 stated that crop water requirement is the amount of water required to compensate the evapotranspiration loss from plants therefore it is an important consideration to improve water use efficiency the study also showed that using a wick discharge linear curve and wick equation solver the required conditions of wick irrigation system for any greenhouse crop can be easily estimated moreover results inferred that the required discharge under wick irrigation system for the above selected crops can be achieved using single wick emitter 5 conclusion the cotton bonded non woven wick material has higher maximum capillary and water holding capacity i e 20 cm and 85 80 respectively over the other tested materials thus identified as best wick material for the wick irrigation system the discharge of selected wick material cnw in buried and hanging wick were linearly affected by wick length inside pipe and water level inside the pipe whilst discharge of buried wick was linearly affected by pot size these relations led to successfully development of a new discharge equation for both wick irrigation systems however the measured discharges under laboratory condition were higher in buried wick as compared to hanging wick therefore based on these results the preference has given to the buried wick for further investigation under glasshouse for potted tomatoes and the relation among the evapotranspiration size of pots and water level inside pipe were observed the glasshouse experiment also proved the results obtained in the laboratory to investigate the effects of water level and wick length inside the pipe furthermore wick discharge linear curve and wick equation solver were successfully developed to estimate the water and emitter

9248,microirrigation system is an efficient irrigation method that saves up to 60 of water and nutrients however the huge investment for installation of modern microirrigation systems is beyond of many smallholder crop producers therefore this study focuses to model and develop the capillary wick irrigation system for greenhouse crop production to address this issue the results revealed on tested wick materials that the maximum capillary height and maximum water holding capacity were observed in cotton bonded non woven wick material compared to other materials p 0 05 water level wick length and pot size linearly affected the discharge of wick emitter in hanging and buried capillary wick irrigation system cwis in this study the discharge equations for wick emitter of hanging and buried cwis were successfully developed comparison of calculated discharge using newly developed equation with actual measured discharge of buried wick for potted tomatoes in greenhouse proved the accuracy of the equation the effects of evapotranspiration were also found linearly on discharge of wick emitter and the relation between emitter discharge pot size and evapotranspiration were lead the development of wick discharge linear curve wdlc wdlc introduced to estimate the required discharge for potted crops under cwis then solver program was used to successfully simulate the wick discharge for different potted crops under a cwis outcomes of the study can be beneficial for smallholder farmers for greenhouse crop production for adopting cwis as low cost and highly efficient microirrigation system keywords microirrigation capillary wick irrigation hanging wick buried wick greenhouse potted crops data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction almost 70 of our planet is covered with water but unfortunately only about 3 of earth s water is fresh and of that less than 1 water is usable wwf 2021 water scarcity and agriculture are intrinsically linked as agriculture consumes 72 of available fresh water compared to 16 by municipalities for domestic use and 12 by industries un water 2019 according to the un s food and agriculture organization fao approximately 60 of fresh water used in agriculture sector wasted due to inefficient applications therefore there is an urgent need to develop and adopt efficient irrigation methods and proper irrigation management strategies one of the irrigation management strategies is the adoption of microirrigation such as drip irrigation system levidow et al 2014 drip irrigation has been proven to save significant amounts of water and labor cost increase yield and enhance product quality compared to other microirrigation systems catin and kara 2021 however its high investment and energy costs prevent the wider applications among farmers especially subsistence farmers muhammad 2015 greenhouse plant production is a good option in boosting agricultural production it helps to meet the food demands of today s world increasing population nevertheless the costs of current microirrigation systems are out of reach for many smallholder crop producers especially in developing asian countries therefore there has been immense interest in developing new microirrigation systems and wick irrigation system is promising irrigation method to address this issue brainbridge 2014 the self watering system employing a wick was used by dolar and keeney 1971 and helmut 1972 capillary wick irrigation system cwis is a sub irrigation system that utilizes a device strip which provides water through capillary movement from a reservoir to the plant growing medium semananda et al 2018 fultariya et al 2017 the cwis is economical in terms of time and labor costs in comparison with overhead irrigation systems for potted plants semananda et al 2018 it is also water and nutrient efficient and therefore it is ideal for greenhouse crop production so et al 2003 the capillary irrigation system produces better quality with less water loss as there is no runoff decreases chances of pests and diseases attacks and it also offers easy and economical cost of installation and operation bainbridge 2002 rowshon et al 2019 heidari et al 2022 the self watering system also increases the efficiency of root water and nutrient uptake million et al 2007 al mayahi et al 2020 bhatt and kanzariya 2017 reported 54 6 increase in yield and 82 4 water saving in tomato solanum lycopersicum using wick irrigation compared to the basin irrigation method wick irrigation method was reported as an effective method to produce quality azaleas compared to other irrigation method million et al 2007 chaturvedi et al 2021 evaluated the physiological efficiency with mechanistic understanding of chili okra and tomato crop under wick irrigation method compared to conventional irrigation and found wick irrigation significantly efficient over conventional irrigation since the introduction of the system there were a few drawbacks but with the passage of time and a little attention of scientists these problems were solved i e wesonga et al 2014 stated that the ability of a cwis for raising water ranges from 10 to 20 cm however selections of wick materials play an important role in cwis lee et al 2010 moreover cotton bonded non woven wick material cnw is the most studied and only commercially available wick material muhammad 2015 in most of earlier studies the wicks were used from the bottom of the pot wesonga et al 2014 muhammad 2015 therefore the height of the pots was limited due to the wick inability to raise water to the upper part of the pots this limitation could be overcome by using wick from the surface of the pots muhammad 2015 moreover there was also a challenge of roots not penetrating in wick emitters resulting in the reduction of capillary action this problem was later addressed by masuda 2008 by developing a root proof cwis for long term vegetable production to protect the emitters from penetration by the roots despite numerous advantages of the wick irrigation system the wick irrigation has not received enough attention from researchers and very few studies applied this method in addition several materials could be suitable for wick emitters however very few materials have been tested as wick emitters thus there is still a need for scientific concern the available literature on wick discharge and its relation to discharge controlling factors are also limited as in previous studies the discharge rate of wick emitter was neglected therefore the current study was conducted to develop a systematic capillary wick irrigation system hanging and buried for greenhouse crop production the objectives were 1 to evaluate the performance of wick emitter under different arrangements both in laboratory and greenhouse conditions 2 to develop wick emitter discharge equation for buried and hanging wick irrigation system and 3 to develop a simulation model for estimating the recommended wick discharge for different greenhouse potted crops 2 methodology 2 1 evaluation of wick experiments were carried out in the soil physics laboratory universiti putra malaysia with three replications to select the optimal wick material s for use in the capillary wick irrigation system following a methodology adopted in wesonga et al 2014 but with slight modifications three different wick materials each of 10 mm wide and 400 mm long 1 40 cm were evaluated in this study the cotton bonded non woven wick cnw and two other local wick materials the gunny bag material gbm and cotton material cm car towel duster the cnw was imported from south korea and composed of 10 nylon 10 polyester and 80 of cotton the gbm made of hessian fabric burlap formed from jute whilst the cm made of cotton three parameters were measured in this study water holding capacity whc capillarity action and maximum capillary height mhc water holding capacity whc was determined by firstly oven drying the wick materials at 50 c until a constant weight was obtained using analytical balance sartorius bt 224 s subsequently the wick materials were soaked in a shallow basin of water and allowed to saturate for 10 min the saturated wick materials were weighed and placed on a piece of netting to drain excess water for 5 min water holding capacity of each material was calculated using equation 1 whc ms md ms 100 where whc is water holding capacity ms is the mass of saturated wick material g and md the dry mass of a wick material g for capillary rise the wick materials were oven dried and then pegged on a string clamped on two rings stand the bottom end of each wick material was inserted into a water filled beaker and red color marker ink was added to the water to enhance the visual observation water rise was observed visually and then measured in centimeters using measuring tape every hour thereafter maximum capillary height was recorded after three hours when there was no further water rise wesonga et al 2014 2 2 determination of wick discharge under different arrangements the capillary wick irrigation system absorbed water from the pvc pipe and supplied it into the potted substrate or collection beaker by gravity the laboratory experiment was set up for the discharge measurement fig 1 wick material cotton bonded non woven wick 1 cm wide 40 cm long and polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe 9 cm diameter were used and discharge rates of the hanging and buried wicks were measured under various combinations of the controlling factors for hanging wick the correlation of five different water levels inside the pvc pipe 5 6 7 8 and 9 cm and three different wick lengths inside the pipe 7 9 and 11 cm were evaluated the elevation difference between ground and pvc pipes was 32 cm while end caps of pvc pipes were modified through cutting according to the desired water level to manage water level inside pipe water was collected for 24 h using a beaker and then measured using gratitude cylinder and the experiment was replicated five times for buried wick peat moss peatgro standard grade was used as a growing media with five different water levels inside the pipe 5 6 7 8 and 9 cm three different wick lengths inside the pvc pipe 7 9 and 11 cm two different initial water contents of the growing media 10 and 20 and three different pot sizes by volume 3 l 6 l and 12 l the discharge rate of the wick was measured for 24 h using an analytical balance while initial water content was measured using a soil sensor spectrum technologies inc 2 3 estimation of the discharge of the wick emitter muhammad 2015 derived equations for compensating wick emitter discharge for buried and hanging eqs 2 and 3 following the continuity equation for water flow eq 4 keller and bliesner 1990 by replacing pressure head of a drip emitter with a capillary height of the wicking emitter 2 qe 60 8 h c 0 66 for buried wick 3 and qe 32 85 h c 0 26 for hanging wick where q e emitter discharge ml hr and h c capillary height mm 4 q e k e h e x where q e emitter discharge k e emitter discharge coefficient h e pressure head x an exponent dimensionless which varies between 0 and 1 muhammad 2015 used distance between water level and the top edge of pvc pipe as capillary height in the above equations however there are also some other factors e g size of pvc pipe diameter water level inside pipe wick length inside pipe distance between water level and top edge of the pvc pipe in both hanging and buried wicks and pot size which are directly responsible for controlling discharge of buried and hanging wicks therefore an attempt was made to develop the wick discharge equation with maximum possible discharge controlling factors in order to develop wick discharge equation the continuity equation for water flow was solved by calculating x exponent and ke emitter discharge coefficient as per eqs 5 and 6 5 x log q 1 q 2 log h 1 h 2 6 and k e q e h e x where q1 and q2 minimum and maximum discharges respectively and h1 and h2 minimum and maximum pressure head respectively while q emitter discharge ml hr and h pressure head which was replaced with controlling factors fc in this study the relationship between emitter discharge q e and controlling factors fc was used for developing of the wick discharge equation through a series of laboratory experiments furthermore irrigation uniformity of cnw wick emitter was already discussed in detail by muhammad and rowshon 2015 who reported 95 65 and 92 67 uniformity coefficient and distribution uniformity of cnw wick emitter respectively and the same findings were confirmed in our current study 2 4 tomato nursery a local hybrid variety of tomato was selected for greenhouse experiment the seeds were sown in small pots one l containing soil and sand 2 1 and irrigated manually after three weeks plants were transplanted to the pots used in experiment containing peat moss peatgro standard grade 2 5 experimental setup in greenhouse furthermore greenhouse experiments were conducted to measure the discharge of buried wick and also to observe the effects of evapotranspiration et on the discharge of buried wick the performance of buried wick irrigation was tested with potted tomatoes the experimental setup was installed at ladang 2 universiti putra malaysia three plastic pots of 3 6 and 12 l capacity were regulated under two different water level 50 4 5 cm and 75 6 75 cm the pot sizes were selected as recommended in this paper joseph 2010 the treatments were replicated six times on six pvc pipes each of 90 mm in diameter and 3658 mm in length giving a total of 6 treatments subsequently total 36 wick emitters each of 40 cm in length 9 cm inside pvc pipe and 10 12 and 16 cm depth of wick emitter in 3 l 6 l and 12 l pot respectively were used the elevation differences between pot and pipes were 7 cm 11 cm and 13 cm for 12 l 6 l and 3 l respectively as shown in fig 2 2 6 measurement of wick discharge in greenhouse discharges were measured for 24 h with an analytical balance sf 400 two pots from each treatment were randomly selected for discharge measurement round shaped plastic trays were placed at the bottom of every pot to collect excess water drained out from the pots and the pre weighed pots were weighed after 24 h using an analytical balance sf 400 and the discharge was measured using the eq 7 7 q iw fw et where iw is initial weight g fw final weight g and et is evapotranspiration ml 2 7 evapotranspiration determination evapotranspiration was determined using the gravimetric method with monitoring of the pot weight loss over a given time interval kirnak et al 2001 in order to determine the et by gravimetric methods the tomato plants were grown in the same sized pots used in the treatments and were irrigated to saturation and then left for one hour the pots were weighed using an analytical balance sf 400 consequently the decrease in the pot weights after 24 h was the amount of water consumed by the evapotranspiration process 2 8 estimation of wick discharge for different crops the wick discharges were estimated as per wick discharge simulation chart fig 3 for different crops i e eggplant cabbage cauliflower strawberries and sweet peppers the selected crops were studied at flowering and fruiting stages under glasshouse condition in tropical climate because these stages are known as peak stages of crops and required high amount of water to estimate the required discharge for the selected crop crop characteristics were needed i e crop et and recommended pot size evapotranspiration was estimated using cropwat software anon 2009 the climatic data were collected from the malaysian metrological department finally the crop et was obtained using the eq 8 salama 2011 8 etc kceto where etc crop evapotranspiration kc crop coefficient and eto reference evapotranspiration crop coefficient was adopted from anon 2016 based on et and pot size the required discharge was estimated using wick discharge linear curve wdlc and finally discharges were calculated for selected crop using wick discharge eq solver 3 results the wick materials differed considerably in water absorption p 0 05 over the entire period as presented in table 1 the cotton boded non woven wick material cnw exhibited the highest water absorption pattern with 20 cm at 180 min while the lowest capillary action was recorded in the cotton material cm with 6 cm at 180 min capillary action was in order cnw gbm cm over the entire period the cnw material used as wick material performed significantly better than gbm and cm the maximum capillary height was recorded in cnw followed by gbm followed by cm with 20 cm 8 cm and 6 cm respectively cnw gbm and cm were also significantly different from each other in the water holding capacity with 85 80 84 50 and 82 20 respectively table 2 shows the individual effects of water level and wick length inside the pipe on the discharge of hanging wick the maximum mean discharge was recorded as 12 1 ml hr at 9 cm while the minimum mean discharge was recorded as 7 7 ml hr at 5 cm for different water levels inside the pipe moreover the maximum mean discharge was recorded as 11 0 ml hr at 11 cm while the minimum mean discharge was recorded 8 8 ml hr at 7 cm for different wick lengths inside the pipe furthermore the water level and wick length inside the pipe were linearly correlated with the discharge of hanging wick with a strong correlation of r2 0 9993 and r2 0 9973 respectively table 3 shows the individual effects of water level pot size wick length and initial moisture contents on the discharge of buried wick where the maximum mean discharge 13 2 ml hr at 9 cm and the minimum mean discharge 8 9 ml hr at 5 cm for different water levels inside the pipe likewise the maximum mean discharge 13 8 ml hr in 12 l and the minimum mean discharge 8 7 ml hr in 3 l for different pot size moreover the maximum mean discharge of 12 2 ml hr at 11 cm and the minimum mean discharge of 10 0 ml hr at 7 cm for different wick lengths inside the pipe furthermore the lower mean discharge of 10 9 ml hr in 20 as compared to 11 4 ml hr in 10 initial water was recorded moreover linear effects of water level pot size and wick length on discharge of buried wick was r2 0 9985 r2 0 9955 and r2 0 9901 respectively fig 4 shows the effects of initial volumetric contents on the discharge of buried wick for 24 h with interval of six hours the effects of initial volumetric contents were observed with the increase of water contents by decreasing in discharge of buried wick over time the equations developed by muhammad 2015 to estimate the wick discharge was dealing with the capillary height of wick emitter distance from the water level to the top edge of pvc pipe and having reverse relation of capillary height and discharge however there are some other factors that have been shown to have a direct effect on discharge of wick i e size of pvc pipe diameter water level inside pipe wick length inside pipe distance between water level and top edge of the pvc pipe in both hanging and buried wicks and pot size etc in buried wick therefore based on this observation the h c was replaced with fc controlling factors and wick emitter discharge equations eq 9 and eq 10 were developed with a correlation of maximum possible discharge controlling factors 9 q e 2 383 fc 0 369 for hanging 10 q e 3 961 fc 0 327 for buried where qe is emitter discharge ml hr and fc is controlling factors to find out fc two equations

previous studies other materials were tested as wick emitter i e bonded non woven fabric so et al 2003 blanket material wesonga et al 2014 polyester capillary mat chanseetis et al 2001 and rolled polyester cloth however cnw material reveals best attribute for capillary wick irrigation system therefore recommended as best suitable wick emitter results obtained from laboratory experiment revealed the linear effects of water level and wick length on the discharge of buried and hanging wick similarly the effects of pot size and initial moisture contents on the discharge of buried wick were also linear these results were in line with the findings of an previous studies conducted by muhammad 2015 muhammad and rowshon 2015 who reported the significant effects of wick length and initial moisture contents on wick discharge however till the date no study has been conducted to evaluate the effects of water level and pot size on wick discharge as the wick emitters supply water continuously through absorption and gravity so the pot size and initial moisture contents are important factors to be studied effects of size and types of pots on efficacy of subirrigation was also reported in previous studies bailey et al 2014 beeks and evans 2013 besides that pot size directly affects plant leaf area shoot biomass and root biomass poorter et al 2012 gallegos et al 2020 therefore this study was designed to evaluate the effects of all possible factors on wick discharge and their relation this relation among the discharge and discharge controlling factors were used for the development of wick emitter discharge equations wick emitter discharge equation was developed by replacing capillary height h c muhammad 2015 with controlling factors fc in this regard a series of equations were developed to find out fc furthermore wick discharge equation solver was developed which can easily solve wick discharge equation by putting required data into it i e total pipe diameter in cm wick length inside the pipe cm and the water level inside the pipe cm for buried and hanging wicks however pot size l is also required to estimate the discharge of buried wick cnw noticeably the solver can also be used to develop a wick discharge equation for other wick materials emitters as well by adding some additional information the results also showed that the estimated discharge using wick emitter discharge equation is closely matched to the mean of measured discharge in the greenhouse hence it proved that the discharge of wick emitter cnw can be successfully estimated using wick emitter discharge equation moreover the recorded discharge for potted tomatoes in glasshouse was ranged from 132 to 478 ml day in different arrangements of capillary wick irrigation system while salokhe et al 2005 reported maximum water requirements for drip irrigated tomatoes under glasshouse in the tropics is 400 ml day the effects of evapotranspiration on the discharge of buried wick revealed that with an increase in et linearly increases the discharge this relation between discharge and et helped to create a wick discharge linear curve for estimating required discharge under cwis for different crops based on et and pot size basically the water needed for metabolic need of the plant is negligible therefore et can be considered as equal to consumptive use of water by plants salama 2011 and ewaid et al 2019 stated that crop water requirement is the amount of water required to compensate the evapotranspiration loss from plants therefore it is an important consideration to improve water use efficiency the study also showed that using a wick discharge linear curve and wick equation solver the required conditions of wick irrigation system for any greenhouse crop can be easily estimated moreover results inferred that the required discharge under wick irrigation system for the above selected crops can be achieved using single wick emitter 5 conclusion the cotton bonded non woven wick material has higher maximum capillary and water holding capacity i e 20 cm and 85 80 respectively over the other tested materials thus identified as best wick material for the wick irrigation system the discharge of selected wick material cnw in buried and hanging wick were linearly affected by wick length inside pipe and water level inside the pipe whilst discharge of buried wick was linearly affected by pot size these relations led to successfully development of a new discharge equation for both wick irrigation systems however the measured discharges under laboratory condition were higher in buried wick as compared to hanging wick therefore based on these results the preference has given to the buried wick for further investigation under glasshouse for potted tomatoes and the relation among the evapotranspiration size of pots and water level inside pipe were observed the glasshouse experiment also proved the results obtained in the laboratory to investigate the effects of water level and wick length inside the pipe furthermore wick discharge linear curve and wick equation solver were successfully developed to estimate the water and emitter

9249,greenhouse gas intensity ghgi the evaluation of ghg emissions per unit yield rather than per unit land area has recently received much attention plastic film mulching pfm is one of the major agricultural practices in semi arid areas but few studies have synthetically studied the effects of pfm on ghgi grain yield soil characteristics and their potential relationships at different winter wheat triticum aestivum l growing stages here in the semi arid chinese loess plateau we simultaneously investigated two cropping systems from 2018 to 2020 pfm with 100 cover and no film mulching control averaged across two growing seasons the pfm treatment significantly increased soil temperature water filled pore spaces and soil water storage while sustaining high aboveground biomass 31 9 and grain yield 45 5 the pfm treatment significantly increased cumulative n2o emissions by 56 2 co2 emissions by 39 7 and ch4 uptake by 151 4 compared to the control treatment ghgi are on average 14 2 lower in the pfm treatment than in the control treatment moreover the pfm treatment significantly improved soil enzyme activities alkaline phosphatase catalase invertase and urease and microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen from grain filling to maturity stage altogether the reductions in ghgi suggest that pfm induced increases in grain yield could outweigh the adverse impacts on ghg emissions underscoring the potential to apply pfm for sustainable intensification of crop production in semi arid areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords global warming potential greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse gas intensity grain yield loess plateau data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction global agriculture largely contributes to anthropogenic greenhouse effects ipcc 2014 van groenigen et al 2013 some greenhouse effects are affected by agricultural practices such as plastic film mulching pfm which covers the soil with polyethylene plastic film chen et al 2017 smith et al 2007 in modern intensive agriculture pfm has been used widely in cropping systems in recent decades steinmetz et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 pfm can affect soil hydrothermal status and improve crop production diaz perez 2010 liu et al 2014b zhang et al 2011 to meet the increasing challenges for food security and climate change in the coming decades sustainable agricultural management should aim to maximize crop production and minimize greenhouse gas ghg emissions berger et al 2013 cuello et al 2015 liu et al 2018 lisson et al 2016 however increasing crop production while mitigating ghg emissions from agricultural soils remains challenging smith et al 2007 yu et al 2021 global warming potential gwp and greenhouse gas intensity ghgi can account for the relative ability of ghg emissions in agricultural planting systems frolking et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 thus knowledge of how gwp and ghgi respond to pfm could help to develop soil ghg mitigation strategies van groenigen et al 2013 stated the need to evaluate ghg emissions from rice paddies in relation to crop production rather than agricultural land area world cereal yields must keep increasing to meet the global food demands of the growing population cassman et al 2003 ipcc 2014 therefore it is crucial to understand the linkages between changes in ghgi i e yield scaled ghg emissions and future atmospheric conditions in some studies pfm increased soil temperature and soil water content rapidly increasing crop production chai et al 2022 yu et al 2017 other studies found that pfm increased unchanged or decreased ghg emissions berger et al 2013 cuello et al 2015 kim et al 2017 liu et al 2014b zhao et al 2020 thus efforts to increase crop production under pfm must consider changes in gwp which can be done by measuring ghg emissions per unit yield rather than per unit planting area berger et al 2013 van groenigen et al 2013 however grain yield gwp ghgi and their potential links under pfm are rarely documented simultaneously in relatively dry farmland limiting our understanding of pfm induced changes between environmental effects and grain yield the chinese

2009 winter wheat triticum aestivum l is the primary grain crop ensuring national food security chen et al 2017 ding et al 2019 to meet the growing food demands in the coming decades particularly in semi arid regions with insufficient annual precipitation scientists have sought effective and sustainable agricultural practices to rapidly increase crop production ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 including mulching soil with artificial materials such as polyethylene film chen et al 2017 steinmetz et al 2016 some studies have reported that pfm suppresses weed growth cuello et al 2015 reduces

compared following a randomized block plot design with three replicates for each treatment fig 1 and fig s7 each plot area was 20 m2 5 m 4 m with at least 1 m buffer zones on each side winter wheat triticum aestivum l cv xiaoyan no 22 was planted at 187 4 kg ha 1 with a row spacing of 25 cm before sowing calcium superphosphate 12 p2o5 and urea 46 n were applied to pfm and control plots supplying about 125 kg p ha 1 and 225 kg n ha 1 according to the local expert evaluation potassium fertilizer k2o was not added because the local soil is rich in potassium li et al 2022a after sowing new transparent plastic film 0 008 mm thick and 80 cm wide was spread evenly on the soil surface of pfm plots with soil placed on the edges of the film to hold it in place the films were torn manually if young winter wheat shoots could not break through them during the winter wheat growing period the film was managed following local practices such as covering them with soil if damaged and removing them after the winter wheat harvest detailed information for sowing harvesting and fertilization can be found in table s1 no irrigation was added during the entire experimental period as per local practices other field management practices such as pesticides and weed control were the same for both treatments following local agricultural management agricultural inputs for winter wheat in the

zhang et al 2016 2 3 sample collection and measurements 2 3 1 greenhouse gas emissions we measured in situ ghg n2o ch4 and co2 emissions using the closed static chamber method and gas chromatography techniques during the 2018 19 and 2019 20 winter wheat growing seasons to avoid any disturbance a stainless steel pedestal with a groove was inserted 20 cm into the soil between the winter wheat rows in each plot during both growing seasons with no winter wheat plants in the sampling chambers the closed static chamber had two parts a closed chamber 40 40 40 cm with a reflective film and a stainless steel pedestal with a groove 40 40 20 cm fig 1 the reflective film reduces temperature changes within the chamber during gas sampling the stainless steel pedestals were inserted 10 cm into the soil in each plot after sowing the chambers were inserted into the water filled groove during the sampling to seal the chamber and avoid air leakage the chamber was equipped with a temperature probe to measure air temperature inside the chambers a small fan with a 5 v voltage to mix the gas inside the chamber a polyvinyl chloride gas pipe with a three way stopcock was used for gas sampling before each gas sampling the injector was pushed uniformly 8 10 times to mix the gas in the gas collection pipe gas sampling was collected with a 60 ml plastic syringe equipped with a three way stopcock the first gas sample was taken immediately after deployment of the chamber with three additional samples at 10 min intervals the total collected gas volume was 40 ml to capture any hotspots gas sampling was conducted continuously for one week after fertilization and then about every 7 10 days until harvest the gases were measured between 09 00 a m and 11 00 a m to obtain the best estimation for a mean flux over the day the n2o co2 and ch4 concentrations were evaluated simultaneously using gas chromatography agilent 7890 a agilent technologies inc santa clara usa specifically

winter wheat yield at harvest june 5 2019 and jun 8 2020 1 m2 quadrat of winter wheat fig 1 was manually cut close to the soil surface in the middle of each experiment plot to determine aboveground biomass and grain yield averaged across the three plot replicates grain samples were dried to a constant weight at 75 c in a fan oven all mass values are expressed in relation to dry weight 2 4 statistical analysis prior to the statistical analyses the observational data were tested for normality using the kolmogorov smirnov method and equality of variances using the levene test at p 0 05 the analyses were performed with r software version 4 1 2 r core team 2020 figures were plotted using the r package ggplot2 the three way anova was conducted in r software using linear mixed effects models in the nlme package pinheiro et al 2016 for the linear mixed effects models treatment was set as a fixed effect and block as a random effect to separately assess differences in aboveground biomass grain yield gwp and ghgi in each growing season for aboveground biomass grain yield gwp and ghgi treatment growing season and their interactive effects were set as fixed effects and block as a random effect to evaluate cumulative n2o emissions co2 emissions and ch4 fluxes during both growing seasons treatment growth stage and their interactive effects were set as fixed effects and block as a random effect for soil alkaline phosphatase catalase invertase urease mbc mbn doc don mbc mbn and doc don across the two growing seasons treatment growth stage and their interactive effects were regarded as fixed effects and block was a random effect correlations between ghg emissions and soil properties at three growth stages were analyzed using the gpairs package of r 3 results 3 1 pfm effects on soil temperature wfps and soil water storage pfm significantly increased soil temperature by 1 4 c in the 2018 19 growing season and 1 0 c in the 2019 20 growing season with an average increase of 1 2 c 9 1 across the two growing seasons fig 2a b seasonal mean wfps fluctuated day to day but generally increased up to the beginning of stage 2 and then decreased at stage 3 fig s2c d significant pfm induced effects on sws were observed at stage 1 and stage 2 when averaged across both growing seasons fig s5 specifically the pfm treatment increased sws within the 0 100 cm soil layer by 21 2 at stage 1 and 38 1 at stage 2 relative to the control treatment 3 2 pfm effects on n2o ch4 and co2 emissions the linear mixed effects model revealed significant effects of treatment growth stage and treatment stage on seasonal cumulative n2o emissions ch4 uptake and seasonal co2 emissions table s2 across both growing seasons the pfm treatment significantly increased n2o emissions by 38 3 at stage 1 329 1 at stage 2 and 93 7 at stage 3 relative to the control treatment fig 3a b soil n2o emissions were high immediately after fertilizer application decreasing over time fig s3a b averaged across both growing seasons the pfm treatment had 108 7 246 3 and 232 5 higher cumulative ch4 uptake at stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 respectively than the control treatment fig 3c d the pfm treatment had 31 3 30 9 and 24 8 higher cumulative co2 emissions at stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 respectively than the control treatment averaged across both growing seasons fig 3e f fig s3 3 3 pfm effects on soil enzyme activities mbc mbn doc and don averaged at stage 3 the pfm treatment significantly increased alkaline phosphatase activity by 10 7 catalase activity by 12 9 invertase activity by 14 5 and urease activity by 5 1 relative to the control treatment fig 4 but had no effect at the other two growth stages no significant effects of treatment growth stage or treatment stage on alkaline phosphatase catalase and urease activities across both growing seasons table s3 the pfm treatment had 5 9 and 40 9 higher mbc and mbn than the control treatment at stage 3 averaged across both growing seasons but did not affect doc or don in either growing season figs 5 and 6 the linear mixed effects models showed significant effects of growth stage and treatment stage on mbc and mbn table s4 but no significant effects for doc or don across the two growing seasons fig 6 table s4 3 4 pfm effects on grain yield aboveground biomass gwp and ghgi pfm significantly increased grain yield gwp and aboveground biomass by 32 3 41 8 and 9 5 relative to control treatment across both growing seasons fig 7a c interestingly pfm significantly decreased ghgi by 16 6 in the 2018 19 growing season and 47 4 in the 2019 20 growing season with an average decrease of 34 8 across both growing seasons fig 7d significant treatment season and treatment season effects occurred for grain yield and ghgi while gwp only had a significant treatment effect table 1 in addition ghgi negatively correlated with grain yield fig s3b p 001 and aboveground biomass but gwp did not correlate with aboveground biomass in either growing season fig s4 3 5 relationships between ghg emissions and soil properties averaged across both growing seasons pfm induced changes in ghg co2 ch4 and n2o emissions significantly correlated with soil temperature and wfps at stage 2 fig 8b p 001 however no clear relationships occurred between pfm induced changes in ghg co2 ch4 and n2o emissions and alkaline phosphatase catalase invertase or urease activities at stage 1 fig 8a similarly no clear relationships occurred between pfm induced changes in ghg co2 ch4 and n2o emissions and mbc doc don mbc mbn or doc don at any stage in either growing season across both growing seasons n2o and co2 emissions positively correlated with sws at stage 1 and stage 2 fig s6 and ch4 flux negatively correlated with sws at stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 4 discussion 4 1 changes in ghg emissions with pfm studies have reported that pfm has positive cuello et al 2015 kim et al 2017 neutral liu et al 2014b or negative effects on n2o emissions berger et al 2013 yu et al 2017 our results showed that the pfm treatment significantly increased cumulative n2o emissions relative to the control treatment fig 3 which could be related to soil hydrothermal conditions cuello et al 2015 okuda et al 2007 this is supported by nishimura et al 2012 who stated that n2o emissions can permeate pfm and its permeability could increase with increasing soil temperature our study also showed that pfm induced changes in n2o emissions strongly correlated with wfps and soil temperature fig 8 similarly wang et al 2016a reported that the higher soil water content and wfps under pfm can increase soil n2o emissions therefore critical evaluations of the impacts of pfm on soil temperature and soil moisture are needed to predict changes in soil n2o emissions which may contribute to the development of sustainable management strategies for n2o mitigation berger et al 2013 sintim et al 2019 the pfm treatment had higher soil co2 emissions than the control treatment fig 3 and s3 across the two growing seasons as zhang et al 2017 reported moreover significant correlations occurred between pfm induced changes in soil temperature and soil water content and the corresponding changes in soil co2 emissions fig 8 this is consistent with other field studies where pfm induced changes in soil hydrothermal conditions affected soil properties such as the soil microbial population and activities and mineralization processes eventually affecting the production and transfer of soil co2 emissions singh 2013 zhang et al 2012 the pfm induced increase in soil co2 emissions is probably due to its positive effects on soil c assimilation gong et al 2015 for example chen et al 2017 reported that pfm increased soil co2 emissions in two consecutive wheat maize rotation cycles due to enhanced c inputs in contrast li et al 2012 and okuda et al 2007 reported that pfm decreased co2 emissions the effects of pfm on soil co2 emissions could be due to 1 pfm physically hindering soil co2 diffusion chen et al 2017 2 pfm retaining soil co2 facilitating crop photosynthesis and decreasing soil co2 emissions an et al 2015 3 increased soil temperatures under pfm stimulating crop root growth and soil microbial activities by accelerating organic matter decomposition and thus increasing co2 emissions cuello et al 2015 li et al 2022c the pfm treatment had significantly higher cumulative ch4 uptake than the control treatment in both growing seasons fig 3 chen et al 2017 which could be because pfm provides an optimal soil temperature increasing the absorption and oxidation by methanotrophic microorganisms dalal et al 2008 nan et al 2016 stewart et al 2013 several factors can influence ch4 uptake including soil properties e g texture water content and substrate availability weather conditions precipitation and air temperature and management practices fertilizer rate and cropping system benanti et al 2014 deshmukh et al 2020 hiltbrunner et al 2012 our results are consistent with earlier findings that dryland soils could be the sinks for atmospheric ch4 due to methanotrophs in agricultural soils oxidizing ch4 under relatively dry conditions cuello et al 2015 chen et al 2017 4 2 changes in soil properties with pfm soil enzyme activity is a critical indicator for assessing various management practices in agriculture revealing the synergistic impacts of multiple complex soil microbial activities and associated chemical processes ananbeh et al 2019 chen et al 2018 chen and sinsabaugh 2020 kooch et al 2020 xia et al 2020 in this study the pfm treatment improved soil alkaline phosphatase catalase invertase and urease activities fig 4 and table s3 consistent with subrahmaniyan et al 2008 similarly chen et al 2021 reported that pfm significantly increased average enzymatic activities of catalase sucrase and urease by 1 3 2 6 and 25 1 respectively compared to no film mulching one reason might be that pfm can extend the crop growing season increase soil water content and improve root activities relative to no mulching an et al 2015 an explanation supported by kooch et al 2020 and song et al 2020 who reported that pfm changed the soil micro environment e g moisture temperature and n content potentially stimulating soil enzyme activities besides a recent meta analysis found that film mulching application affected soil microbial parameters increasing soil microbial abundance and soil enzyme activities compared to no film mulching li et al 2022c averaged across both growing seasons the pfm treatment significantly increased soil mbc and mbn fig 5 as reported by yang et al 2018 possible reasons why pfm stimulated a shift in soil microbial biomass include 1 pfm can support microbial metabolic activities and microbial growth increasing mbc and mbn massaccesi et al 2020 2 pfm provides a stable soil hydrothermal environment stimulating crop root activities and root exudation release and thus increasing soil microbial biomass ding et al 2021 pérez guzmán et al 2020 song et al 2020 subrahmaniyan et al 2008 in addition our results showed no significant effect of pfm on doc or don contents fig 6 suggesting that doc and don are controlled by microbial metabolites and or soil microorganisms across various cropping systems montaño et al 2007 neff and asner 2001 yu et al 2021 therefore more research on pfm induced changes in soil microorganisms should be undertaken 4 3 pfm induced changes in grain yield and ghgi due to significant increases in soil temperature and soil moisture pfm can substantially promote crop growth and increase crop production anikwe et al 2007 cuello et al 2015 gan et al 2013 ren et al 2021 as observed in this study where pfm significantly increased aboveground biomass and yield of winter wheat fig 7 p 05 and elsewhere ding et al 2019 he et al 2018 kim et al 2017 one explanation might be that pfm stores more soil water to sustain or increase crop production ren et al 2021 yu et al 2021 moreover the 2018 19 growing season produced higher grain yields in control and pfm treatments than the 2019 20 growing season fig 7 possibly due to the different precipitation in each growing season peng et al 2020 this is supported by li et al 2013 and xie et al 2005 who reported that pfm significantly increased precipitation use efficiency and reduced evaporation during the growing season due to water conservation while grain yield in control and pfm treatments decreased in the 2019 20 growing season the pfm treatment significantly increased grain yield across both growing seasons highlighting the advantage of pfm in improving soil hydrothermal conditions and thus increasing crop production in semi arid areas ghgi can be used to assess ghg emissions from farmland based on grain yield rather than cropland area grassini and cassman 2012 van groenigen et al 2010 ipcc 2014 reported that ghgi is a potential indicator of global warming caused by farmland management for crop production averaged across both growing seasons the pfm treatment significantly decreased ghgi relative to the control treatment mainly due to the substantially higher winter wheat yield fig 7 table 4 our results suggest that increased winter wheat yield could counteract pfm induced increases in gwp berger et al 2013 he et al 2018 liu et al 2014b indeed increases in winter wheat yield after two growing seasons under pfm correlated with changes in gwp and ghgi fig s4 in line with several recent studies on optimizing crop yield while mitigating ghg emissions liu et al 2014b steinmetz et al 2016 wang et al 2016a yuan et al 2019 that is increasing crop yield could be one approach for offsetting increased ghg emissions he et al 2018 sharma et al 2011 5 conclusion our study showed that the pfm treatment significantly increased aboveground biomass grain yield and gwp compared to the control treatment during the 2018 19 and 2019 20 winter wheat growing seasons averaged across both growing seasons the pfm treatment decreased ghgi by 23 2 relative to the control moreover the pfm treatment significantly improved soil enzyme activities i e alkaline phosphatase catalase invertase and urease mbc and mbn from grain filling to maturity in both growing seasons linear mixed effects models showed significant interactive effects of treatment and growth stages on cumulative n2o emissions ch4 uptake and co2 emissions across the two growing seasons these results suggest the potential for meeting food demands and mitigating climate impacts in this ecologically sensitive area by applying pfm our results indicate that it is feasible to increase winter wheat production for sustainable agriculture by reducing soil ghg emissions and improving soil fertility through pfm in the short term to apply this new knowledge in broad areas long term continuous observations are warranted particularly on the biotic and

9249,greenhouse gas intensity ghgi the evaluation of ghg emissions per unit yield rather than per unit land area has recently received much attention plastic film mulching pfm is one of the major agricultural practices in semi arid areas but few studies have synthetically studied the effects of pfm on ghgi grain yield soil characteristics and their potential relationships at different winter wheat triticum aestivum l growing stages here in the semi arid chinese loess plateau we simultaneously investigated two cropping systems from 2018 to 2020 pfm with 100 cover and no film mulching control averaged across two growing seasons the pfm treatment significantly increased soil temperature water filled pore spaces and soil water storage while sustaining high aboveground biomass 31 9 and grain yield 45 5 the pfm treatment significantly increased cumulative n2o emissions by 56 2 co2 emissions by 39 7 and ch4 uptake by 151 4 compared to the control treatment ghgi are on average 14 2 lower in the pfm treatment than in the control treatment moreover the pfm treatment significantly improved soil enzyme activities alkaline phosphatase catalase invertase and urease and microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen from grain filling to maturity stage altogether the reductions in ghgi suggest that pfm induced increases in grain yield could outweigh the adverse impacts on ghg emissions underscoring the potential to apply pfm for sustainable intensification of crop production in semi arid areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords global warming potential greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse gas intensity grain yield loess plateau data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction global agriculture largely contributes to anthropogenic greenhouse effects ipcc 2014 van groenigen et al 2013 some greenhouse effects are affected by agricultural practices such as plastic film mulching pfm which covers the soil with polyethylene plastic film chen et al 2017 smith et al 2007 in modern intensive agriculture pfm has been used widely in cropping systems in recent decades steinmetz et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 pfm can affect soil hydrothermal status and improve crop production diaz perez 2010 liu et al 2014b zhang et al 2011 to meet the increasing challenges for food security and climate change in the coming decades sustainable agricultural management should aim to maximize crop production and minimize greenhouse gas ghg emissions berger et al 2013 cuello et al 2015 liu et al 2018 lisson et al 2016 however increasing crop production while mitigating ghg emissions from agricultural soils remains challenging smith et al 2007 yu et al 2021 global warming potential gwp and greenhouse gas intensity ghgi can account for the relative ability of ghg emissions in agricultural planting systems frolking et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 thus knowledge of how gwp and ghgi respond to pfm could help to develop soil ghg mitigation strategies van groenigen et al 2013 stated the need to evaluate ghg emissions from rice paddies in relation to crop production rather than agricultural land area world cereal yields must keep increasing to meet the global food demands of the growing population cassman et al 2003 ipcc 2014 therefore it is crucial to understand the linkages between changes in ghgi i e yield scaled ghg emissions and future atmospheric conditions in some studies pfm increased soil temperature and soil water content rapidly increasing crop production chai et al 2022 yu et al 2017 other studies found that pfm increased unchanged or decreased ghg emissions berger et al 2013 cuello et al 2015 kim et al 2017 liu et al 2014b zhao et al 2020 thus efforts to increase crop production under pfm must consider changes in gwp which can be done by measuring ghg emissions per unit yield rather than per unit planting area berger et al 2013 van groenigen et al 2013 however grain yield gwp ghgi and their potential links under pfm are rarely documented simultaneously in relatively dry farmland limiting our understanding of pfm induced changes between environmental effects and grain yield the chinese loess plateau one of the most ecologically susceptible and sensitive regions to climate change is a typical semi arid agriculture zone with high evapotranspiration and uneven precipitation liu et al 2009 winter wheat triticum aestivum l is the primary grain crop ensuring national food security chen et al 2017 ding et al 2019 to meet the growing food demands in the coming decades particularly in semi arid regions with insufficient annual precipitation scientists have sought effective and sustainable agricultural practices to rapidly increase crop production ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 including mulching soil with artificial materials such as polyethylene film chen et al 2017 steinmetz et al 2016 some studies have reported that pfm suppresses weed growth cuello et al 2015 reduces evaporation sharma et al 2011 liu et al 2010 and increases soil water or nitrogen n use efficiencies gao et al 2014 kim et al 2017 thus increasing crop production zhao et al 2020 relative to no film

production on the loess plateau pfm induced effects on soil characteristics e g soil microbial biomass or soil enzyme activities and ghg emissions at different winter wheat growth stages and their potential relationships have not been evaluated synthetically efficient management practices that increase crop production and mitigate ghg emissions are strongly desired berger et al 2013 in

compared following a randomized block plot design with three replicates for each treatment fig 1 and fig s7 each plot area was 20 m2 5 m 4 m with at least 1 m buffer zones on each side winter wheat triticum aestivum l cv xiaoyan no 22 was planted at 187 4 kg ha 1 with a row spacing of 25 cm before sowing calcium superphosphate 12 p2o5 and urea 46 n were applied to pfm and control plots supplying about 125 kg p ha 1 and 225 kg n ha 1 according to the local expert evaluation potassium fertilizer k2o was not added because the local soil is rich in potassium li et al 2022a after sowing new transparent plastic film 0 008 mm thick and 80 cm wide was spread evenly on the soil surface of pfm plots with soil placed on the edges of the film to hold it in place the films were torn manually if young winter wheat shoots could not break through them during the winter wheat growing period the film was managed following local practices such as covering them with soil if damaged and removing them after the winter wheat harvest detailed information for sowing harvesting and fertilization can be found in table s1 no irrigation was added during the entire experimental period as per local practices other field management practices such as pesticides and weed control were the same for both treatments following local agricultural management agricultural inputs for winter wheat in the control and pfm systems were as follows pesticide production and transportation i e herbicides 2 kg ha 1 insecticides 1 kg ha 1 plastic film mulching 60 kg ha 1 for pfm treatment in addition the ghg

zhang et al 2016 2 3 sample collection and measurements 2 3 1 greenhouse gas emissions we measured in situ ghg n2o ch4 and co2 emissions using the closed static chamber method and gas chromatography techniques during the 2018 19 and 2019 20 winter wheat growing seasons to avoid any disturbance a stainless steel pedestal with a groove was inserted 20 cm into the soil between the winter wheat rows in each plot during both growing seasons with no winter wheat plants in the sampling chambers the closed static chamber had two parts a closed chamber 40 40 40 cm with a reflective film and a stainless steel pedestal with a groove 40 40 20 cm fig 1 the reflective film reduces temperature changes within the chamber during gas sampling the stainless steel pedestals were inserted 10 cm into the soil in each plot after sowing the chambers were inserted into the water filled groove during the sampling to seal the chamber and avoid air leakage the chamber was equipped with a temperature probe to measure air temperature inside the chambers a small fan with a 5 v voltage to mix the gas inside the chamber a polyvinyl chloride gas pipe with a three way stopcock was used for gas sampling before each gas sampling the injector was pushed uniformly 8 10 times to mix the gas in the gas collection pipe gas sampling was collected with a 60 ml plastic syringe equipped with a three way stopcock the first gas sample was taken immediately after deployment of the chamber with three additional samples at 10 min intervals the total collected gas volume was 40 ml to capture any hotspots gas sampling was conducted continuously for one week after fertilization and then about every 7 10 days until harvest the gases were measured between 09 00 a m and 11 00 a m to obtain the best estimation for a mean flux over the day the n2o co2 and ch4 concentrations were evaluated simultaneously using gas chromatography agilent 7890 a agilent technologies inc santa clara usa specifically

the animal debris visible plant and large stones were removed in the field after soil sampling before immediately shipping the soil samples to the laboratory and storing in a refrigerator at 4 for further analysis detailed measurements associated with soil enzymatic activities are in guan 1986 and li et al 2022a briefly alkaline phosphatase was analyzed as follows the mixture fresh soil 10 g

statistical analysis prior to the statistical analyses the observational data were tested for normality using the kolmogorov smirnov method and equality of variances using the levene test at p 0 05 the analyses were performed with r software version 4 1 2 r core team 2020 figures were plotted using the r package ggplot2 the three way anova was conducted in r software using linear mixed effects models in the nlme package pinheiro et al 2016 for the linear mixed effects models treatment was set as a fixed effect and block as a random effect to separately assess differences in aboveground biomass grain yield gwp and ghgi in each growing season for aboveground biomass grain yield gwp and ghgi treatment growing season and their interactive effects were set as fixed effects and block as a

effects on soil temperature wfps and soil water storage pfm significantly increased soil temperature by 1 4 c in the 2018 19 growing season and 1 0 c in the 2019 20 growing season with an average increase of 1 2 c 9 1 across the two growing seasons fig 2a b seasonal mean wfps fluctuated day to day but generally increased up to the beginning of stage 2 and then decreased at stage 3 fig s2c d significant pfm induced effects on sws were observed at stage 1 and stage 2 when averaged across both growing seasons fig s5 specifically the pfm treatment increased sws within the 0 100 cm soil layer by 21 2 at stage 1 and 38 1 at stage 2 relative to the control treatment 3 2 pfm effects on n2o ch4 and co2 emissions the linear mixed effects model revealed significant effects of treatment growth stage and treatment stage on seasonal cumulative n2o emissions ch4 uptake and seasonal co2 emissions table s2 across both growing seasons the pfm treatment significantly increased n2o emissions by 38 3 at stage 1 329 1 at stage 2 and 93 7 at stage 3 relative to the control treatment fig 3a b soil n2o emissions were high immediately after fertilizer application decreasing over time fig s3a b averaged across both growing seasons the pfm treatment had 108 7 246 3 and 232 5 higher cumulative ch4 uptake at stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 respectively than the control treatment fig 3c d the pfm treatment had 31 3 30 9 and 24 8 higher cumulative co2 emissions at stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 respectively than the control treatment averaged across both growing seasons fig 3e f fig s3 3 3 pfm effects on soil enzyme activities mbc mbn doc and don averaged at stage 3 the pfm treatment significantly increased alkaline phosphatase activity by 10 7 catalase activity by 12 9 invertase activity by 14 5 and urease activity by 5 1 relative to the control treatment fig 4 but had no effect at the other two growth stages no significant effects of treatment growth stage or treatment stage on alkaline phosphatase catalase and urease activities across both growing seasons table s3 the pfm treatment had 5 9 and 40 9 higher mbc and mbn than the control treatment at stage 3 averaged across both growing seasons but did not affect doc or don in either growing season figs 5 and 6 the linear mixed effects models showed significant effects of growth stage and treatment stage on mbc and mbn table s4 but no significant effects for doc or don across the two growing seasons fig 6 table s4 3 4 pfm effects on grain yield aboveground biomass gwp and ghgi pfm significantly increased grain yield gwp and aboveground biomass by 32 3 41 8 and 9 5 relative to control treatment across both growing seasons fig 7a c interestingly pfm significantly decreased ghgi by 16 6 in the 2018 19 growing season and 47 4 in the 2019 20 growing season with an average decrease of 34 8 across both growing seasons fig 7d significant treatment season and treatment season effects occurred for grain yield and ghgi while gwp only had a significant treatment effect table 1 in addition ghgi negatively correlated with grain yield fig s3b p 001 and aboveground biomass but gwp did not correlate with aboveground biomass in either growing season fig s4 3 5 relationships between ghg emissions and soil properties averaged across both growing seasons pfm induced changes in ghg co2 ch4 and n2o emissions significantly correlated with soil temperature and wfps at stage 2 fig 8b p 001 however no clear relationships occurred between pfm induced changes in ghg co2 ch4 and n2o emissions and alkaline phosphatase catalase invertase or urease activities at stage 1 fig 8a similarly no clear relationships occurred between pfm induced changes in ghg co2 ch4 and n2o emissions and mbc doc don mbc mbn or doc don at any stage in either growing season across both growing seasons n2o and co2 emissions positively correlated with sws at stage 1 and stage 2 fig s6 and ch4 flux negatively correlated with sws at stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 4 discussion 4 1 changes in ghg emissions with pfm studies have reported that pfm has positive cuello et al 2015 kim et al 2017 neutral liu et al 2014b or negative effects on n2o emissions berger et al 2013 yu et al 2017 our results showed that the pfm treatment significantly increased cumulative n2o emissions relative to the control treatment fig 3 which could be related to soil hydrothermal conditions cuello et al 2015 okuda et al 2007 this is supported by nishimura et al 2012 who stated that n2o emissions can permeate pfm and its permeability could increase with increasing soil temperature our study also showed that pfm induced changes in n2o emissions strongly correlated with wfps and soil temperature fig 8 similarly wang et al 2016a reported that the higher soil water content and wfps under pfm can increase soil n2o emissions therefore critical evaluations of the impacts of pfm on soil temperature and soil moisture are needed to predict changes in soil n2o emissions which may contribute to the development of sustainable management strategies for n2o mitigation berger et al 2013 sintim et al 2019 the pfm treatment had higher soil co2 emissions than the control treatment fig 3 and s3 across the two growing seasons as zhang et al 2017 reported moreover significant correlations occurred between pfm induced changes in soil temperature and soil water content and the corresponding changes in soil co2 emissions fig 8 this is consistent with other field studies where pfm induced changes in soil hydrothermal conditions affected soil properties such as the soil microbial population and activities and mineralization processes eventually affecting the production and transfer of soil co2 emissions singh 2013 zhang et al 2012 the pfm induced increase in soil co2 emissions is probably due to its positive effects on soil c assimilation gong et al 2015 for example chen et al 2017 reported that pfm increased soil co2 emissions in two consecutive wheat maize rotation cycles due to enhanced c inputs in contrast li et al 2012 and okuda et al 2007 reported that pfm decreased co2 emissions the effects of pfm on soil co2 emissions could be due to 1 pfm physically hindering soil co2 diffusion chen et al 2017 2 pfm retaining soil co2 facilitating crop photosynthesis and decreasing soil co2 emissions an et al 2015 3 increased soil temperatures under pfm stimulating crop root growth and soil microbial activities by accelerating organic matter decomposition and thus increasing co2 emissions cuello et al 2015 li et al 2022c the pfm treatment had significantly higher cumulative ch4 uptake than the control treatment in both growing seasons fig 3 chen et al 2017 which could be because pfm provides an optimal soil temperature increasing the absorption and oxidation by methanotrophic microorganisms dalal et al 2008 nan et al 2016 stewart et al 2013 several factors can influence ch4 uptake including soil properties e g texture water content and substrate availability weather conditions precipitation and air temperature and management practices fertilizer rate and cropping system benanti et al 2014 deshmukh et al 2020 hiltbrunner et al 2012 our results are consistent with earlier findings that dryland soils could be the sinks for atmospheric ch4 due to methanotrophs in agricultural soils oxidizing ch4 under relatively dry conditions cuello et al 2015 chen et al 2017 4 2 changes in soil properties with pfm soil enzyme activity is a critical indicator for assessing various management practices in agriculture revealing the synergistic impacts of multiple complex soil microbial activities and associated chemical processes ananbeh et al 2019 chen et al 2018 chen and sinsabaugh 2020 kooch et al 2020 xia et al 2020 in this study the pfm treatment improved soil alkaline phosphatase catalase invertase and urease activities fig 4 and table s3 consistent with subrahmaniyan et al 2008 similarly chen et al 2021 reported that pfm significantly increased average enzymatic activities of catalase sucrase and urease by 1 3 2 6 and 25 1 respectively compared to no film mulching one reason might be that pfm can extend the crop growing season increase soil water content and improve root activities relative to no mulching an et al 2015 an explanation supported by kooch et al 2020 and song et al 2020 who reported that pfm changed the soil micro environment e g moisture temperature and n content potentially stimulating soil enzyme activities besides a recent meta analysis found that film mulching application affected soil microbial parameters increasing soil microbial abundance and soil enzyme activities compared to no film mulching li et al 2022c averaged across both growing seasons the pfm treatment significantly increased soil mbc and mbn fig 5 as reported by yang et al 2018 possible reasons why pfm stimulated a shift in soil microbial biomass include 1 pfm can support microbial metabolic activities and microbial growth increasing mbc and mbn massaccesi et al 2020 2 pfm provides a stable soil hydrothermal environment stimulating crop root activities and root exudation release and thus increasing soil microbial biomass ding et al 2021 pérez guzmán et al 2020 song et al 2020 subrahmaniyan et al 2008 in addition our results showed no significant effect of pfm on doc or don contents fig 6 suggesting that doc and don are controlled by microbial metabolites and or soil microorganisms across various cropping systems montaño et al 2007 neff and asner 2001 yu et al 2021 therefore more research on pfm induced changes in soil microorganisms should be undertaken 4 3 pfm induced changes in grain yield and ghgi due to significant increases in soil temperature and soil moisture pfm can substantially promote crop growth and increase crop production anikwe et al 2007 cuello et al 2015 gan et al 2013 ren et al 2021 as observed in this study where pfm significantly increased aboveground biomass and yield of winter wheat fig 7 p 05 and elsewhere ding et al 2019 he et al 2018 kim et al 2017 one explanation might be that pfm stores more soil water to sustain or increase crop production ren et al 2021 yu et al 2021 moreover the 2018 19 growing season produced higher grain yields in control and pfm treatments than the 2019 20 growing season fig 7 possibly due to the different precipitation in each growing season peng et al 2020 this is supported by li et al 2013 and xie et al 2005 who reported that pfm significantly increased precipitation use efficiency and reduced evaporation during the growing season due to water conservation while grain yield in control and pfm treatments decreased in the 2019 20 growing season the pfm treatment significantly increased grain yield across both growing seasons highlighting the advantage of pfm in improving soil hydrothermal conditions and thus increasing crop production in semi arid areas ghgi can be used to assess ghg emissions from farmland based on grain yield rather than cropland area grassini and cassman 2012 van groenigen et al 2010 ipcc 2014 reported that ghgi is a potential indicator of global warming caused by farmland management for crop production averaged across both growing seasons the pfm treatment significantly decreased ghgi relative to the control treatment mainly due to the substantially higher winter wheat yield fig 7 table 4 our results suggest that increased winter wheat yield could counteract pfm induced increases in gwp berger et al 2013 he et al 2018 liu et al 2014b indeed increases in winter wheat yield after two growing seasons under pfm correlated with changes in gwp and ghgi fig s4 in line with several recent studies on optimizing crop yield while mitigating ghg emissions liu et al 2014b steinmetz et al 2016 wang et al 2016a yuan et al 2019 that is increasing crop yield could be one approach for offsetting increased ghg emissions he et al 2018 sharma et al 2011 5 conclusion our study showed that the pfm treatment significantly increased aboveground biomass grain yield and gwp compared to the control treatment during the 2018 19 and 2019 20 winter wheat growing seasons averaged across both growing seasons the pfm treatment decreased ghgi by 23 2 relative to the control moreover the pfm treatment significantly improved soil enzyme activities i e alkaline phosphatase catalase invertase and urease mbc and mbn from grain filling to maturity in both growing seasons linear mixed effects models showed significant interactive effects of treatment and growth stages on cumulative n2o emissions ch4 uptake and co2 emissions across the two growing seasons these results suggest the potential for meeting food demands and mitigating climate impacts in this ecologically sensitive area by applying pfm our results indicate that it is feasible to increase winter wheat production for sustainable agriculture by reducing soil ghg emissions and improving soil fertility through pfm in the short term to apply this new knowledge in broad areas long term continuous observations are warranted particularly on the biotic and abiotic underlying mechanisms associated with changes in grain yield and ghg emissions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
