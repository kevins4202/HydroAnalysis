12695,membrane technology plays an important role in water purification but there are some significant challenges such as membrane fouling and deep purification efficiency the work proposes a carbon nanotube adsorptive dynamic membrane cnt adm including carbon nanotube cnt and membrane module to solve these problems with low operating cost and high removal efficiency above all on the basis of physical adsorption and membrane separation a cnt adm was prepared by applying forward filtration of a cnt solution on an ultrafiltration membrane surface then the effects of preparation time cnt loading amount transmembrane pressure tmp and shear stress on the morphology and permeability were analyzed to evaluate the preparation performance pore blocking models were utilized to explain the influence of cnt loading amount on membrane fouling mechanism the best optimized condition for cnt adm preparation was agitation speed of 50 rpm tmp of 1 bar cnt loading amount of 55 g m2 and preparation time of 10 min furthermore the optimized cnt adm was employed to treat the micro polluted water the effects of treatment condition on the micropollutant removal rate and flux were investigated with various shear stresses tmps the amounts of micropollutant and cnt compared with the new membrane below 10 cnt adm displayed a significant improvement for the micropollutant removal above 95 for three cycles due to the synergy of membrane separation sustaining cnt layer separating micropollutant and increasing adsorption time and adsorption removal forming cnt layer and adsorbing micropollutant on the other hand the adsorption behavior also could effectively reduce the direct contact between membrane and micropollutant then decreasing membrane fouling afterwards the backwash cleaning was also successfully applied to alter the adsorption saturated cnt and generate the new cnt layer in final the implications for cnt adm application were discussed overall cnt adm exhibits the desirable micropollutant removal and strong anti fouling capacity and has a great potential application in the sustainable water purification graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords carbon nanotube adsorptive dynamic membrane cnt adm water purification double filtration micro pollutants adsorption removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the micro pollutant in the discharge of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater has become a significant challenge to environmental ecological protection 1 2 the main micropollutants include dyes steroid hormones pesticides food additives veterinary products pharmaceuticals and personal care products and endocrine disrupting chemicals which are non biodegradable anthropogenic compounds and exhibit the long lasting adverse effects on ecological safety and human health 3 as a barrier to reduce the pollutants inflow into the ecosystem the traditional water treatment plants are usually inefficient to remove the micro pollutants and numerous studies have focused on developing the new strategies for micro pollutant removal 1 4 in the last decade many advanced water purification methods including advanced oxidation 5 membrane filtration 6 7 adsorption 8 and biological process 3 have been employed to purify the micro polluted water these methods exhibit the great treatment efficiency but they still display some inevitable shortcomings the production of toxic by products 9 adsorption saturation 10 and high operating cost 11 for the membrane filtration the membrane fouling and inefficient rejection capacity hinder the purification efficiency of micro polluted water besides the higher operating cost and stronger toxicity of some intermediate products have limited the widespread application of advanced oxidation as for the biodegradation most antibiotic drugs are recalcitrant to biological degradation on account of the presence of the stable naphthol ring in their structures 12 in term of the adsorption the adsorption saturation always reduces the removal efficiency of micro pollutants which makes it difficult for the adsorption method to play a long term role in water purification the limitations of these water treatment techniques have necessitated the development of novel water purification technologies for micro pollutant wastewater 13 14 in order to overcome these inevitable problems the coupling technology was developed to excavate the synergistic effect for micropollutant removal adsorptive dynamic membrane adm is made up of adsorbents and membrane in adm the adsorbents are immobilized on membrane surface by physical adsorption and membrane supports them 15 in principle the adsorption capacity of adsorbents and efficiency of membrane separation determine the removal capacity of micro pollutant 15 therefore adm differs from mechanical filtration that depends on size exclusion or sieving and the selection of adsorbents is crucial for micro pollutant removal carbon nanotube cnt as a promising adsorption material has been widely adopted for micro pollutant adsorption on account of their special structure and desirable adsorptive property 16 static adsorption behavior for micro pollutants by cnt has been clarified in the previous studies 17 18 this sheds light on the deep purification of micro polluted water 19 but the uncertainty concerning human toxicity of ingested cnt attracts the attention on the cnt dosing into the micro polluted water 20 21 thus cnt should be coupled with other methods for preventing cnt excessive leakage in this work cnt and membrane were integrated to preparate cnt adm for improving the micropollutant removal efficiency and avoid cnt leakage above all the effectiveness and mechanism for micro pollutant removal by cnt adm process were clarified then the effect of preparation conditions tmp cnt loading amount shear stress and time on the morphology and permeability was investigated moreover the methylene blue crystal violet neutral red and methyl orange were chosen as the representative micro pollutants and filtered through the cnt adm with the given conditions similarly the effect of operating conditions on removal rate was revealed after that the synergistic removal mechanism for membrane separation and adsorption was analyzed at last the backwash was utilized to remove the adsorption saturated cnt layer in addition the implantation of cnt application was discussed the cnt adm demonstrated the excellent potential to serve as effective filter media for micro pollutants removal from water and wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials methylene blue crystal violet neutral red and methyl orange were purchased from aladdin shanghai china multi wall cnt were purchased from chengdu organic chemicals co ltd chinese academy of sciences all the chemical reagents used in experiments were of analytical grade and utilized directly without any further purification the commercial polymeric membranes table 1 were used in this work 2 1 1 membrane module a filtration cell see text s1 of the supplementary information si that allows flexible operation i e adjustment of membrane type tmp and shear stress and accurate measurement of various filtration resistances was used to simulate the cnt adm filtration process in this study 2 2 cnt adm preparation prior to preparation membrane was cleaned by filtering with ultrapure water powdered cnt was weighed using a balance and then suspended in 100 ml of ultrapure water the suspension was then dispersed by sonication for 3 min using a water bath sonicator aquasonic 250ht and immediately loaded onto a cleaned membrane by filtering the dispersion through the membrane thus immobilizing a cnt layer onto the membrane surface this prepared membrane was then cleaned as before by filtering ultrapure water through until the permeate thus cnt can be stably loaded and adsorbed on membrane then cnt adm is prepared in order to evaluate the effect of cnt loading amount on the morphology and permeability of cnt adm the higher amount of cnt was loaded onto a new membrane ultrapure water was filtered through the cnt adm at each loading amount and the flux was recorded under the certain pressure using a digital electronic balance connecting to a computer then the permeability can be calculated 2 3 filtration experiment all experiments were conducted at 20 c a new membrane was employed for each experiment unless the permeability of the used membrane could be fully recovered to ensure the same initial membrane conditions for the entire study the pure water flux of membranes was measured at 1 6 bar to calculate water permeability lp in order to estimate the membrane performance rapidly at various membrane types agitation speeds and tmps these experiments were performed with permeate and retentate recycling to limit the variation of feed volume to 10 the detailed operation method was described in text s2 of si 2 3 1 backwash cleaning after each series of experiments the cnt adm was conversely flushed to simulate the backwash process by deionized water for 2 min at 50 rpm and lp was measured to determine the permeability recovery 2 4 analytical items and membrane characterization micro polluted concentration methylene blue crystal violet neutral red and methyl orange in permeate was determined by high performance liquid chromatography series 1500 american ssi company usa for the membranes before and after experiment their morphology was inspected via scanning electron microscope sem sn 3400 hitachi ltd japan 2 5 calculated parameters the rejection r was calculated according to the following equation 1 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf represented the water quality indexes in permeate and feed average value during filtration process respectively permeability recovery was defined by a comparison of the average water permeability for cleaned and new membranes 2 permeability recovery l pc l pi 100 where lpc and lpi are water permeability l m 2 h 1 of the cleaned fouled and new membranes respectively 2 6 membrane pore blocking modes in this investigation the fouling type of cnt adm process was determined by hermia blocking model 22 fig 1 the evaluation of pore blocking coefficient k value could be identified by nonlinear regression of the experimental data pore blocking model includes complete pore blocking internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation 23 for complete pore blocking all particles only block the membrane surface pores and no particles situate on other particles internal pore blocking is produced by the narrow of membrane pores and small particles attach into pore walls in intermediate pore blocking each particle on membrane causes the pore blocking and attaches on other particles as for cake formation particles forms cake layer outside the external membrane and increases the hydraulic resistance 2 7 data analysis all full recycling experiments were repeated at least three times and concentration experiments were repeated at least two times the errors were controlled below 5 mean values were calculated and presented on the figures and tables 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics and preparation performance for cnt adm the adhesion properties of the cnt to the membrane is an important issue of the cnt loading on membrane the principal membrane cleaning strategy of low pressure membrane is periodic backwashing of the membrane for cnt adm the ideal situation is that the cnt displays a stable adhesion to the membrane surface during the filtration period then after adsorption saturation they can be removed by backwashing and are replaced by new cnt to investigate this issue qualitatively the characteristics and preparation performance for cnt adm were firstly studied sem images were adopted to observe the micromorphology at different cnt loading amounts the surface structures of cnt adm depend on the cnt loading 18 the new membrane exhibited a rough and heterogeneous surface structure after adsorbing cnt layer as shown in fig 2 the surface of cnt adm become homogeneous and smooth after the formation of cnt porous layer regardless of the loading amount and thickness layer but the nanomaterial including cnt has the uncertain hazard for human and ecological environment theoretically lower cnt loading amount produced the smaller risk thus the cnt amount should be optimized with low cnt loading amount high permeability and desirable micromorphology the membrane pore size also changed with the addition of cnt layer the average pore size of cnt adm was clearly less than that of the new membrane because of the small average pore size of this cnt layer besides the cnt layer narrowed the pore size distribution thus cnt adm presented an obviously lower narrow range of pore size distribution than the new membrane this also demonstrated the formation of homogeneous layer on membrane with the increment of cnt loading amount the average pore size reduced and pore size distribution lessened this homogeneous porous layer with small pore dimension 410 nm could better reject or adsorb foulants 24 then reinforcing the antifouling ability and micro pollutant removal rate in general via physical adsorption strategy a more homogeneous porous cnt layer could form on membrane and was expected to facilitate the micro pollutant removal and membrane fouling control the permeability of cnt adm was used to reveal the filtration performance for estimating the preparation performance besides fig 3 depicts that the permeability of cnt adm 144 147 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was just slightly lower than that of the new membrane as illustrated in table 1 permeability 150 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 thus the cnt layer on membrane owned a very small impact on the fouling increment and was a permeable structure on the ground that the membrane structure inside the cnt layers was relatively uniform and homogeneous regardless of the thickness 25 and the accumulation of cnt layer on membrane enhanced the filtration resistance slightly 26 even some cnt entered and blocked membrane pores in this process moreover the permeate flux of cnt adm also varied with different preparation time for preparation time of from 0 to 10 min the permeability of cnt adm obviously raised after 10 min it decreased slowly this implied that preparation time exerted a clearly effect on the formation of homogeneous porous layer and permeable structure as a suitable time for preparation and compression could form an excellent permeable structure layer on membrane thus 10 min was chosen for the following cnt adm preparation time as illustrated in fig 1 four blocking models complete pore blocking internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake layer were applied to analyze the effect of cnt loading amount on membrane fouling the membrane blocking types varied with the cnt loading amount in cnt adm the cnt could form a dynamic layer but causing different types of membrane fouling table 2 shows that at low cnt loading amounts 5 40 g cm2 the complete pore blocking possesses the greatest r2 and is the main membrane fouling after cnt accumulation for high cnt loading amounts 55 85 g cm2 the r2 of the internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation are clearly higher than that of the complete pore blocking thus the internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation are mixed main fouling mechanism indeed as for the low cnt loading amount cnt directly deposited on membrane while some of them blocked membrane surface pores so the complete pore blocking occurred at greater cnt loading amount some cnt entered membrane pores and blocked them while cnt layer formed and became thicker and thicker therefore the internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation co existed besides compare with the complete pore blocking the internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation exhibited a higher fouling resistance which corresponded to smaller porosity in fig 2 and lower permeability in fig 3 in comparison with the cnt loading amount the preparation tmp and agitation speed have a less impact on permeability as displayed in fig 3 b and c they had the similar change trends in fig 3 b the preparation tmp is able to affect the permeable structure of cnt layer and preparation tmp above 2 bar leads to a lower permeable capacity likewise for the fig 3 c higher shear stress caused by greater agitation speed also reduces the permeability except for 50 rpm cnt was difficult to form a homogeneous porous layer with a desirable permeable structure under the strong hydraulic shearing environment the suitable shear stress is vital for the uniform distribution of cnt and physical adsorption effect herein 1 bar and 50 rpm were selected for the following cnt adm preparation condition 3 2 the effect of operational conditions on filtration performance for cnt adm in order to appropriately scale cnt adm to a full scale membrane plant level the effect of operation conditions cnt loading amount micro pollutant types and concentration shear stress and tmp needs to be studied for optimizing the operating conditions 3 2 1 the effect of cnt loading amount the effect of cnt loading amount on flux and removal rate was depicted at fig 4 there were three points for each cnt loading amount on behalf of the average fluxes and removal rates for filtration volume 50 100 and 150 ml respectively overall all fluxes exhibited the fine removal rate while these fluxes were just slightly lower than permeability 150 l m 2 h 1 because cnt layer effectively adsorbed some micropollutant and avoided the direct contact between micropollutant and membrane which prevented micropollutant deposition on membrane and fouling layer formation moreover a decreasing relationship between cnt loading amount and flux was found the higher loading amount enhanced the filtration resistance by the thicker cnt layer 27 however the flux decline was highly small indicating that relatively uniform pore structure existed inside the cnt layers regardless of the thickness of cnt layer besides with the filtration continuation the flux gradually decreased due to the pore blocking caused by micropollutant entering cnt pores fig 4 depicts that the removal rates for methylene blue and active red exceed 85 and improve with cnt loading amount on account of the desirable adsorption capacity of cnt especially at the high loading amount 25 in the study of huang et al 17 for nom with low aromaticity the main rejection mechanism was the depth filtration of dynamic adsorption layer on the membrane surface not via through the cnt adsorption in this work the primary mechanism for the micropollutant removal with high aromatic was the adsorption not depth filtration because of the greater adsorption capacity of cnt for high aromaticity 28 moreover during the filtration process the micropollutant entered the pores of cnt layer then blocked them afterwards indirectly reducing the pore size of cnt adm thus the micropollutant rejection improved this is double filtration effect of cnt adm besides for cnt loading amount of 25 70 g m2 the removal rate clearly reduced with the filtration volume 50 100 and 150 ml since the adsorption potential space hydrogen bonding and adsorption efficiency decreased when more micropollutant exited into cnt layer and trended to adsorption saturation but for cnt loading amount of 85 g m2 the removal rate kept steady as its high cnt loading amount greatly strengthened adsorption capacity in addition the lower flux at higher cnt loading amount possessed the better removal rate demonstrating that the longer contact time between cnt and micropollutant provided the sufficient time for adsorption reaction and membrane separation for the purpose of ensuring the high removal rate above 90 for three cycles and avoiding the uncertain ecological environment risk of nanomaterials 55 g m2 was the optimized cnt loading amount 3 2 2 the effect of micro pollutant types and concentration the effect of cnt loading amount on flux and removal rate was presented at fig 5 a four kinds of micropollutants methylene blue crystal violet neutral red and methyl orange were utilized to investigate the adsorption removal efficiency for different micropollutant the active red and methyl blue had similar removal rates which were clearly higher than those of other micropollutants the removal rates at the first cycle of active red methylene blue and crystal violet exceeded 90 indicating that cnt adm owned the satisfactory efficiency for water purification for different micro polluted waters nevertheless for methyl orange its removal efficiencies for three cycles were not ideal which may be due to the side effect of its sodium benzoate group for adsorption interaction besides the hydrogen bonding effect and aromaticity of active red methylene blue and crystal violet were clearly higher than that of methyl orange so they were even easier adsorbed by cnt 19 on the other hand the removal rates gradually decreased with the number of cycles at the third cycle all removal rates were below 80 and the adsorption efficiency significantly diminished because more micropollutant entered cnt pore and led to their pore blocking reducing the effective adsorption positions of cnt thus methyl blue and crystal violet with moderate performance were selected to study the effect of micropollutant concentration fig 5 b illustrates that the flux slightly reduces 144 to 142 2 l m 2 h 1 with the micropollutant concentration when cnt adm is utilized to purify the mixed micro polluted wastewater this because the pores of cnt layer on membrane were block with adsorption of micropollutant onto membrane then the cnt adm pore narrowed thus the filtration resistance enhanced generally all these fluxes remained at the high level and were just slightly lower than permeability 150 l m 2 h 1 implying that the micropollutant inside cnt layer didn t cause the clear formation of fouling layer and the micropollutant concentration didn t produce an obvious fouling resistance for the micropollutant removal at the greater micropollutant concentration the removal rate reduced greatly as more micropollutant was absorbed into cnt the effective adsorption positions on cnt gradually saturated and hydrogen bonding weakened hence some micropollutants couldn t be adsorbed and passed cnt adm although the pore size of cnt adm diminished with micropollutant concentration which boosted the sieve effect some micropollutants with smaller size could still pass cnt layer and uf pores for the micropollutant of 25 mg l the removal rates were only 82 3 and 71 5 for active red and methylene blue respectively which was too low efficiency for engineering application therefore cnt adm is suitable for low strength micro polluted water purification micropollutant concentration 20 mg l this potential will be determined in our future studies adopting industrial tests 3 2 3 the effect of tmp fig 6 presents the effect of tmp on flux and removal rate flux increased as tmp linearly from 0 05 to 4 5 bar then the increment of flux reduced and flux curve tended to deviate from linear relationship this phenomenon fitted with the theory of critical flux 29 30 in the critical flux theory under critical flux the fouling rate is low and flux increases with tmp linearly above the critical flux the fouling rate gets higher due to more foulant accumulation on membrane and the increasing rate of flux decreases 31 in this work the critical flux is 574 l m 2 h 1 at 4 bar exceeding it the high flux caused more micropollutant accumulating on cnt adm surface producing the serious concentration polarization then more pore blocking and cake layer formed with tmp finally the flux raising rate reduced in addition the longer contact time between cnt and micropollutant produced by smaller flux and lower tmp could also reinforced the adsorptive filtration of cnt adm and promoted the removal rate fig 6 shows that the removal rate of micropollutant reduced with tmp in fact the effect of flux on micropollutant removal had two mechanisms 11 26 1 for low permeate flux increasing flux led to more water in permeate which exerted an effect on dilute effect for permeate and reduced the micropollutant concentration in permeate 2 for high permeate flux the greater flux at higher tmp brought about the high micropollutant concentration near cnt adm surface improving the concentration gradient between feed micropollutant wastewater and permeate thus more micropollutant passed cnt adm for this work the mechanism for the effect of flux on the micropollutant removal belonged to the latter in final as mentioned above under high tmp environment the porous structure of cnt layer became compact thus the permeability diminished 3 2 4 the effect of shear stress shear stress on membrane can significantly control the membrane fouling 32 increasing agitation speed of stirring rod strengthened the shear stress 33 as showed in fig 7 the agitation speed increases from 0 to 300 rpm while the shear stress also raises from to 0 01 to 0 16 pa then the concentration polarization diminishes and micropollutant deposition on membrane reduces thus cake layer pore blocking and fouling resistance decrease thus the flux elevated obviously with agitation speed from 0 to 250 rpm but for 300 rpm the flux declined because cnt layered on membrane returned and dispersed to bulk solution by high shear stress then enhancing the concentration polarization indicating that cnt adm was not suitable for high shear stress operation the optimized agitation speed and shear stress were 250 rpm and 0 16 pa respectively shear stress also affects the removal rate of micro pollutants by two facts 13 1 the high stress reduces the micro pollutant concentration on membrane and its concentration gradient thus micro pollutants penetrating membrane enhance 2 under high shear stress membrane surface keeps at a clean state and fouling layer does not form hence the secondly filtration role of fouling layer doesn t come into play for micro pollutant rejection as illustrated in fig 7 the micropollutant removal rate improves with the agitation speed which was reasonable firstly high stress caused by high agitation speed controlled the concentration gradient and reduced the micropollutant penetration secondly with the increase of shear stress some cnt from adsorption layer returned to the bulk solution which greatly reinforced the contact between cnt and micropollutant then importantly raising the adsorption efficiency thirdly the great shear stress formed hydraulic conditions of high turbulence which strengthened the diffusion of micropollutant into cnt layer so the hydrogen bond formed rapidly and micropollutant could be adsorbed easily different from the previous studies high flux did not bring about lower removal rate as high shear stress just occurred on cnt adm surface and did not press the homogenous porous structure of cnt layer thus the permeability had not almost been affected finally the agitation speed of 250 rpm and shear stress of 0 16 pa are suitable for cnt adm operation 3 3 micropollutant removal mechanism adsorption removal and membrane separation are two main mechanisms for micropollutant removal in cnt adm their detailed mechanism during the operating process were analyzed via the removal rate fig 8 shows the removal rate and flux of cnt adm at optimized condition all removal rates were above 89 and flux kept 144 l m 2 h 1 demonstrating that at the optimized condition cnt adm could remove the micropollutant quickly and stably the micropollutant removal increased with time the removal rate by membrane separation was relatively stable but the removal rate by adsorption got greater with time as the adsorption equilibrium had not yet reached at the beginning of experiment membrane separation mainly contributed to the removal rate however with experiment continuation the adsorption removal played a greater role with these phenomena the mechanism of micro pollutants removal for cnt adm could be clearly revealed into three stages at the first stage of cnt adm purifying the micro polluted water the micropollutant was rejected by cnt layer and membrane then most of them deposit on the top of cnt layer so only some micropollutant was adsorbed by cnt and the primary mechanism of micropollutant removal was double filtration cnt layer and membrane in fig 8 at 1 min the removal rate contribution of membrane separation was 66 8 59 7 89 4 during the second stage with micro polluted water purification continuation more micropollutant accumulated on the surface of cnt layer and part of them flowed into the interior of the cnt layer with homogenous porous structure then were adsorbed by cnt in this stage the double filtration cnt layer and membrane and adsorption removal had almost the same contributions on the micropollutant removal for example their removal rates were 49 6 and 49 5 at 5 min respectively after that for the third stage more and more micropollutant was adsorbed by cnt layer thus as showed in figs 8 and 9 the contribution of adsorption removal improved with time greatly and adsorption removal became the main mechanism for the micropollutant removal at 15 min the removal rate of adsorption removal 76 5 was much higher than that of membrane separation 23 3 as well at 40 min the removal rate of adsorption removal reached 93 2 3 4 the backwash cleaning backwash cleaning aiming at removing foulants on membrane surface uses high speed water flow to flush the reversed membrane surface when the water passes membrane pores creating shear stress on foulants then the foulants in membrane fall off and membrane permeability recoveries compared with other membrane cleaning methods the structure and equipment of backwash cleaning are simple while its operation is convenient in the design of cnt adm after the adsorption saturation of cnt layer the back cleaning is employed to reversely flush membrane and cnt layer is removed then the new cnt are used to form a cnt layer on membrane in order to evaluate the backwash performance cnt adm membrane fouled by micropollutant was turned over in amicon cell for reverse filtration fig 10 showed the new a fouled membrane b and fouled membrane after backwash c it was clearly observed that the cnt on membrane were a tight black layer however this cnt layer disappeared and some blue micropollutant retained on membrane which was reasonable for the preparation of cnt adm as showed in fig 10 b cnt was evenly distributed on the membrane surface and the layer was tight after micro polluted water filtration and backwash most cnt was removed fig 10 c indicating that cnt and membrane could be rapidly separated even by 0 1 bar therefore the design and operation of cnt adm are feasible besides there still was some micropollutant remaining on membrane after backwash implying that part of micropollutant could not be adsorbed and were rejected by membrane so the not strong adhesion ability of cnt on membrane helps to conduct the replacement of cnt after adsorption saturation and integrate cnt adm into a water purification system 3 5 implications for cnt adm application the micropollutant was a noticeable kind of micro pollutants in industrial effluent guangdong province is one of the most advanced regions of china at present guangdong province has begun to implement more stringent emission standards for printing and dyeing enterprises with the present technologies many enterprises could not reach the emission standards these enterprises are in danger of stopping production therefore developing an effective advanced water purification technology could save these enterprises cnt adm with the homogeneous porous structure is able to absorb and separate the micro pollutants usually cnt needs surfactant activation to stop forming aggregates which greatly limits the adsorption efficiency of cnt adm and its application 19 34 but for the cnt adm preparation this step is not necessary this finding is in favor of the practical application of cnt reduction of manufacturing costs and potential environmental pollution in this work the low pressure filtration with cnt adm could effectively remove the micropollutant in fig 4 cnt adm can effectively remove the various micropollutants and shows a noticeable stability as displayed in fig 5 cnt adm keeps removal rate exceeding 70 when the micropollutant concentration varies from 5 to 20 mg l thus cnt adm can cope with the change of water quality in the printing and dyeing plants and ensure the effluent lower than the emission standard tmp and shear stress are two key influence factors for cnt adm operation fig 6 illustrates the low pressure operation is beneficial to sustain the high flux and great removal rate which can reduce the equipment requirement and operating cost low shear stress also improves the removal rate and flux behavior indicating that suitable hydraulic condition on membrane should be designed furthermore the backwash is useful for removing the cnt after adsorption saturation and regenerating the new cnt layer practically because of the desirable removal for low size particle pollutants cnt adm is expected to replace ro nf in micro polluted water advanced treatment to reduce energy consumption in fact cnt adm is not able to offer the same rejection capacity as ro since the treatment efficiency of cnt adm are limited by the adsorption processes while some micropollutant with small affinity to cnt adm cannot be availably removed however cnt adm exhibits a clear cost advantage mwcnt used in this work is 300 400 kg and flat membrane is 150 m2 thus the cost of cnt adm is only 170 m2 which possess a much lower investment cost than the commercial nf and ro besides due to the small shear stress and low operating pressure decreasing the frequency of backwash cleaning and prolonging membrane life the operating cost of cnt adm is much lower than that of nf and ro too importantly the full scale water purification practice requires the sustainable micropollutant removal and stable flux as a result the duration time of cnt effective adsorption is crucial after adsorption saturation how to replace cnt layer or regenerate it efficiently is another key issue in figs 4 5 6 and 7 the removal rates are adopted to estimate sorption capacity of cnt except for the adsorption removal the double filtration is another main method to remove the micropollutant however more complicated factors need to be studied such as the homogeneous and permeable structure of cnt layer which is especially critical for improving the permeability and separation fig 4 in fact the higher cnt loading amount could greatly increase the filtration cycles but might raise the treatment costs and uncertain ecosystem risk in any case during the long term filtration process the cnt adsorption is always saturated and the micropollutant concentration in permeate exceeds the targeted level regeneration of adsorbed cnt needs to be furtherly studied as it is a slow process and may cause secondly pollution in this work the backwash is applied to rapidly replace the adsorption saturated cnt layer with new cnt in summary the adsorption efficiency and saturated adsorption amount are the key of cnt adm thus development of high effective adsorbents will become a focus of future studies 4 conclusions this work proposes a cnt adm for improving water purification to reveal the preparation strategy and to explain the micropollutant removal mechanism the following notable observations were made on the basis of physical adsorption and membrane separation a cnt adm was prepared by applying forward filtration of a cnt solution on an uf membrane the best optimized condition for cnt adm preparation was agitation speed of 50 rpm tmp of 1 bar cnt loading amount of 55 g m2 and preparation time of 10 min complete pore blocking was the main fouling mechanism of cnt adm at low cnt loading amount while the internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation became the primary fouling mechanisms for high cnt loading amount cnt adm exhibited a significant improvement for the micropollutant removal above 95 for three cycles due to the synergy of membrane separation sustaining cnt layer separating micropollutant and increasing adsorption time and adsorption removal forming cnt layer and adsorbing micropollutant the membrane separation was the main contribution for the micropollutant removal at the first stage and adsorption removal became more and more important for the long term operation afterwards the backwash cleaning was also successfully utilized to remove the adsorption saturated cnt and create new cnt layer with just 0 5 bar and 1 min thereby the cnt adm process provides a possible alternative to face up to the challenges of membrane fouling and improve the micropollutant removal in the end the current work indicates the feasibility and significance of using adsorptive membrane for promoting water purification declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

12695,membrane technology plays an important role in water purification but there are some significant challenges such as membrane fouling and deep purification efficiency the work proposes a carbon nanotube adsorptive dynamic membrane cnt adm including carbon nanotube cnt and membrane module to solve these problems with low operating cost and high removal efficiency above all on the basis of physical adsorption and membrane separation a cnt adm was prepared by applying forward filtration of a cnt solution on an ultrafiltration membrane surface then the effects of preparation time cnt loading amount transmembrane pressure tmp and shear stress on the morphology and permeability were analyzed to evaluate the preparation performance pore blocking models were utilized to explain the influence of cnt loading amount on membrane fouling mechanism the best optimized condition for cnt adm preparation was agitation speed of 50 rpm tmp of 1 bar cnt loading amount of 55 g m2 and preparation time of 10 min furthermore the optimized cnt adm was employed to treat the micro polluted water the effects of treatment condition on the micropollutant removal rate and flux were investigated with various shear stresses tmps the amounts of micropollutant and cnt compared with the new membrane below 10 cnt adm displayed a significant improvement for the micropollutant removal above 95 for three cycles due to the synergy of membrane separation sustaining cnt layer separating micropollutant and increasing adsorption time and adsorption removal forming cnt layer and adsorbing micropollutant on the other hand the adsorption behavior also could effectively reduce the direct contact between membrane and micropollutant then decreasing membrane fouling afterwards the backwash cleaning was also successfully applied to alter the adsorption saturated cnt and generate the new cnt layer in final the implications for cnt adm application were discussed overall cnt adm exhibits the desirable micropollutant removal and strong anti fouling capacity and has a great potential application in the sustainable water purification graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords carbon nanotube adsorptive dynamic membrane cnt adm water purification double filtration micro pollutants adsorption removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the micro pollutant in the discharge of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater has become a significant challenge to environmental ecological protection 1 2 the main micropollutants include dyes steroid hormones pesticides food additives veterinary products pharmaceuticals and personal care products and endocrine disrupting chemicals which are non biodegradable anthropogenic compounds and exhibit the long lasting adverse effects on ecological safety and human health 3 as a barrier to reduce the pollutants inflow into the ecosystem the traditional water treatment plants are usually inefficient to remove the micro pollutants and numerous studies have focused on developing the new strategies for micro pollutant removal 1 4 in the last decade many advanced water purification methods including advanced oxidation 5 membrane filtration 6 7 adsorption 8 and biological process 3 have been employed to purify the micro polluted water these methods exhibit the great treatment efficiency but they still display some inevitable shortcomings the production of toxic by products 9 adsorption saturation 10 and high operating cost 11 for the membrane filtration the membrane fouling and inefficient rejection capacity hinder the purification efficiency of micro polluted water besides the higher operating cost and stronger toxicity of some intermediate products have limited the widespread application of advanced oxidation as for the biodegradation most antibiotic drugs are recalcitrant to biological degradation on account of the presence of the stable naphthol ring in their structures 12 in term of the adsorption the adsorption saturation always reduces the removal efficiency of micro pollutants which makes it difficult for the adsorption method to play a long term role in water purification the limitations of these water treatment techniques have necessitated the development of novel water purification technologies for micro pollutant wastewater 13 14 in order to overcome these inevitable problems the coupling technology was developed to excavate the synergistic effect for micropollutant removal adsorptive dynamic membrane adm is made up of adsorbents and membrane in adm the adsorbents are immobilized on membrane surface by physical adsorption and membrane supports them 15 in principle the adsorption capacity of adsorbents and efficiency of membrane separation determine the removal capacity of micro pollutant 15 therefore adm differs from mechanical filtration that depends on size exclusion or sieving and the selection of adsorbents is crucial for micro pollutant removal carbon nanotube cnt as a promising adsorption material has been widely adopted for micro pollutant adsorption on account of their special structure and desirable adsorptive property 16 static adsorption behavior for micro pollutants by cnt has been clarified in the previous studies 17 18 this sheds light on the deep purification of micro polluted water 19 but the uncertainty concerning human toxicity of ingested cnt attracts the attention on the cnt dosing into the micro polluted water 20 21 thus cnt should be coupled with other methods for preventing cnt excessive leakage in this work cnt and membrane were integrated to preparate cnt adm for improving the micropollutant removal efficiency and avoid cnt leakage above all the effectiveness and mechanism for micro pollutant removal by cnt adm process were clarified then the effect of preparation conditions tmp cnt loading amount shear stress and time on the morphology and permeability was investigated moreover the methylene blue crystal violet neutral red and methyl orange were chosen as the representative micro pollutants and filtered through the cnt adm with the given conditions similarly the effect of operating conditions on removal rate was revealed after that the synergistic removal mechanism for membrane separation and adsorption was analyzed at last the backwash was utilized to remove the adsorption saturated cnt layer in addition the implantation of cnt application was discussed the cnt adm demonstrated the excellent potential to serve as effective filter media for micro pollutants removal from water and wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials methylene blue crystal violet neutral red and methyl orange were purchased from aladdin shanghai china multi wall cnt were purchased from chengdu organic chemicals co ltd chinese academy of sciences all the chemical reagents used in experiments were of analytical grade and utilized directly without any further purification the commercial polymeric membranes table 1 were used in this work 2 1 1 membrane module a filtration cell see text s1 of the supplementary information si that allows flexible operation i e adjustment of membrane type tmp and shear stress and accurate measurement of various filtration resistances was used to simulate the cnt adm filtration process in this study 2 2 cnt adm preparation prior to preparation membrane was cleaned by filtering with ultrapure water powdered cnt was weighed using a balance and then suspended in 100 ml of ultrapure water the suspension was then dispersed by sonication for 3 min using a water bath sonicator aquasonic 250ht and immediately loaded onto a cleaned membrane by filtering the dispersion through the membrane thus immobilizing a cnt layer onto the membrane surface this prepared membrane was then cleaned as before by filtering ultrapure water through until the permeate thus cnt can be stably loaded and adsorbed on membrane then cnt adm is prepared in order to evaluate the effect of cnt loading amount on the morphology and permeability of cnt adm the higher amount of cnt was loaded onto a new membrane ultrapure water was filtered through the cnt adm at each loading amount and the flux was recorded under the certain pressure using a digital electronic balance connecting to a computer then the permeability can be calculated 2 3 filtration experiment all experiments were conducted at 20 c a new membrane was employed for each experiment unless the permeability of the used membrane could be fully recovered to ensure the same initial membrane conditions for the entire study the pure water flux of membranes was measured at 1 6 bar to calculate water permeability lp in order to estimate the membrane performance rapidly at various membrane types agitation speeds and tmps these experiments were performed with permeate and retentate recycling to limit the variation of feed volume to 10 the detailed operation method was described in text s2 of si 2 3 1 backwash cleaning after each series of experiments the cnt adm was conversely flushed to simulate the backwash process by deionized water for 2 min at 50 rpm and lp was measured to determine the permeability recovery 2 4 analytical items and membrane characterization micro polluted concentration methylene blue crystal violet neutral red and methyl orange in permeate was determined by high performance liquid chromatography series 1500 american ssi company usa for the membranes before and after experiment their morphology was inspected via scanning electron microscope sem sn 3400 hitachi ltd japan 2 5 calculated parameters the rejection r was calculated according to the following equation 1 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf represented the water quality indexes in permeate and feed average value during filtration process respectively permeability recovery was defined by a comparison of the average water permeability for cleaned and new membranes 2 permeability recovery l pc l pi 100 where lpc and lpi are water permeability l m 2 h 1 of the cleaned fouled and new membranes respectively 2 6 membrane pore blocking modes in this investigation the fouling type of cnt adm process was determined by hermia blocking model 22 fig 1 the evaluation of pore blocking coefficient k value could be identified by nonlinear regression of the experimental data pore blocking model includes complete pore blocking internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation 23 for complete pore blocking all particles only block the membrane surface pores and no particles situate on other particles internal pore blocking is produced by the narrow of membrane pores and small particles attach into pore walls in intermediate pore blocking each particle on membrane causes the pore blocking and attaches on other particles as for cake formation particles forms cake layer outside the external membrane and increases the hydraulic resistance 2 7 data analysis all full recycling experiments were repeated at least three times and concentration experiments were repeated at least two times the errors were controlled below 5 mean values were calculated and presented on the figures and tables 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics and preparation performance for cnt adm the adhesion properties of the cnt to the membrane is an important issue of the cnt loading on membrane the principal membrane cleaning strategy of low pressure membrane is periodic backwashing of the membrane for cnt adm the ideal situation is that the cnt displays a stable adhesion to the membrane surface during the filtration period then after adsorption saturation they can be removed by backwashing and are replaced by new cnt to investigate this issue qualitatively the characteristics and preparation performance for cnt adm were firstly studied sem images were adopted to observe the micromorphology at different cnt loading amounts the surface structures of cnt adm depend on the cnt loading 18 the new membrane exhibited a rough and heterogeneous surface structure after adsorbing cnt layer as shown in fig 2 the surface of cnt adm become homogeneous and smooth after the formation of cnt porous layer regardless of the loading amount and thickness layer but the nanomaterial including cnt has the uncertain hazard for human and ecological environment theoretically lower cnt loading amount produced the smaller risk thus the cnt amount should be optimized with low cnt loading amount high permeability and desirable micromorphology the membrane pore size also changed with the addition of cnt layer the average pore size of cnt adm was clearly less than that of the new membrane because of the small average pore size of this cnt layer besides the cnt layer narrowed the pore size distribution thus cnt adm presented an obviously lower narrow range of pore size distribution than the new membrane this also demonstrated the formation of homogeneous layer on membrane with the increment of cnt loading amount the average pore size reduced and pore size distribution lessened this homogeneous porous layer with small pore dimension 410 nm could better reject or adsorb foulants 24 then reinforcing the antifouling ability and micro pollutant removal rate in general via physical adsorption strategy a more homogeneous porous cnt layer could form on membrane and was expected to facilitate the micro pollutant removal and membrane fouling control the permeability of cnt adm was used to reveal the filtration performance for estimating the preparation performance besides fig 3 depicts that the permeability of cnt adm 144 147 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was just slightly lower than that of the new membrane as illustrated in table 1 permeability 150 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 thus the cnt layer on membrane owned a very small impact on the fouling increment and was a permeable structure on the ground that the membrane structure inside the cnt layers was relatively uniform and homogeneous regardless of the thickness 25 and the accumulation of cnt layer on membrane enhanced the filtration resistance slightly 26 even some cnt entered and blocked membrane pores in this process moreover the permeate flux of cnt adm also varied with different preparation time for preparation time of from 0 to 10 min the permeability of cnt adm obviously raised after 10 min it decreased slowly this implied that preparation time exerted a clearly effect on the formation of homogeneous porous layer and permeable structure as a suitable time for preparation and compression could form an excellent permeable structure layer on membrane thus 10 min was chosen for the following cnt adm preparation time as illustrated in fig 1 four blocking models complete pore blocking internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake layer were applied to analyze the effect of cnt loading amount on membrane fouling the membrane blocking types varied with the cnt loading amount in cnt adm the cnt could form a dynamic layer but causing different types of membrane fouling table 2 shows that at low cnt loading amounts 5 40 g cm2 the complete pore blocking possesses the greatest r2 and is the main membrane fouling after cnt accumulation for high cnt loading amounts 55 85 g cm2 the r2 of the internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation are clearly higher than that of the complete pore blocking thus the internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation are mixed main fouling mechanism indeed as for the low cnt loading amount cnt directly deposited on membrane while some of them blocked membrane surface pores so the complete pore blocking occurred at greater cnt loading amount some cnt entered membrane pores and blocked them while cnt layer formed and became thicker and thicker therefore the internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation co existed besides compare with the complete pore blocking the internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation exhibited a higher fouling resistance which corresponded to smaller porosity in fig 2 and lower permeability in fig 3 in comparison with the cnt loading amount the preparation tmp and agitation speed have a less impact on permeability as displayed in fig 3 b and c they had the similar change trends in fig 3 b the preparation tmp is able to affect the permeable structure of cnt layer and preparation tmp above 2 bar leads to a lower permeable capacity likewise for the fig 3 c higher shear stress caused by greater agitation speed also reduces the permeability except for 50 rpm cnt was difficult to form a homogeneous porous layer with a desirable permeable structure under the strong hydraulic shearing environment the suitable shear stress is vital for the uniform distribution of cnt and physical adsorption effect herein 1 bar and 50 rpm were selected for the following cnt adm preparation condition 3 2 the effect of operational conditions on filtration performance for cnt adm in order to appropriately scale cnt adm to a full scale membrane plant level the effect of operation conditions cnt loading amount micro pollutant types and concentration shear stress and tmp needs to be studied for optimizing the operating conditions 3 2 1 the effect of cnt loading amount the effect of cnt loading amount on flux and removal rate was depicted at fig 4 there were three points for each cnt loading amount on behalf of the average fluxes and removal rates for filtration volume 50 100 and 150 ml respectively overall all fluxes exhibited the fine removal rate while these fluxes were just slightly lower than permeability 150 l m 2 h 1 because cnt layer effectively adsorbed some micropollutant and avoided the direct contact between micropollutant and membrane which prevented micropollutant deposition on membrane and fouling layer formation moreover a decreasing relationship between cnt loading amount and flux was found the higher loading amount enhanced the filtration resistance by the thicker cnt layer 27 however the flux decline was highly small indicating that relatively uniform pore structure existed inside the cnt layers regardless of the thickness of cnt layer besides with the filtration continuation the flux gradually decreased due to the pore blocking caused by micropollutant entering cnt pores fig 4 depicts that the removal rates for methylene blue and active red exceed 85 and improve with cnt loading amount on account of the desirable adsorption capacity of cnt especially at the high loading amount 25 in the study of huang et al 17 for nom with low aromaticity the main rejection mechanism was the depth filtration of dynamic adsorption layer on the membrane surface not via through the cnt adsorption in this work the primary mechanism for the micropollutant removal with high aromatic was the adsorption not depth filtration because of the greater adsorption capacity of cnt for high aromaticity 28 moreover during the filtration process the micropollutant entered the pores of cnt layer then blocked them afterwards indirectly reducing the pore size of cnt adm thus the micropollutant rejection improved this is double filtration effect of cnt adm besides for cnt loading amount of 25 70 g m2 the removal rate clearly reduced with the filtration volume 50 100 and 150 ml since the adsorption potential space hydrogen bonding and adsorption efficiency decreased when more micropollutant exited into cnt layer and trended to adsorption saturation but for cnt loading amount of 85 g m2 the removal rate kept steady as its high cnt loading amount greatly strengthened adsorption capacity in addition the lower flux at higher cnt loading amount possessed the better removal rate demonstrating that the longer contact time between cnt and micropollutant provided the sufficient time for adsorption reaction and membrane separation for the purpose of ensuring the high removal rate above 90 for three cycles and avoiding the uncertain ecological environment risk of nanomaterials 55 g m2 was the optimized cnt loading amount 3 2 2 the effect of micro pollutant types and concentration the effect of cnt loading amount on flux and removal rate was presented at fig 5 a four kinds of micropollutants methylene blue crystal violet neutral red and methyl orange were utilized to investigate the adsorption removal efficiency for different micropollutant the active red and methyl blue had similar removal rates which were clearly higher than those of other micropollutants the removal rates at the first cycle of active red methylene blue and crystal violet exceeded 90 indicating that cnt adm owned the satisfactory efficiency for water purification for different micro polluted waters nevertheless for methyl orange its removal efficiencies for three cycles were not ideal which may be due to the side effect of its sodium benzoate group for adsorption interaction besides the hydrogen bonding effect and aromaticity of active red methylene blue and crystal violet were clearly higher than that of methyl orange so they were even easier adsorbed by cnt 19 on the other hand the removal rates gradually decreased with the number of cycles at the third cycle all removal rates were below 80 and the adsorption efficiency significantly diminished because more micropollutant entered cnt pore and led to their pore blocking reducing the effective adsorption positions of cnt thus methyl blue and crystal violet with moderate performance were selected to study the effect of micropollutant concentration fig 5 b illustrates that the flux slightly reduces 144 to 142 2 l m 2 h 1 with the micropollutant concentration when cnt adm is utilized to purify the mixed micro polluted wastewater this because the pores of cnt layer on membrane were block with adsorption of micropollutant onto membrane then the cnt adm pore narrowed thus the filtration resistance enhanced generally all these fluxes remained at the high level and were just slightly lower than permeability 150 l m 2 h 1 implying that the micropollutant inside cnt layer didn t cause the clear formation of fouling layer and the micropollutant concentration didn t produce an obvious fouling resistance for the micropollutant removal at the greater micropollutant concentration the removal rate reduced greatly as more micropollutant was absorbed into cnt the effective adsorption positions on cnt gradually saturated and hydrogen bonding weakened hence some micropollutants couldn t be adsorbed and passed cnt adm although the pore size of cnt adm diminished with micropollutant concentration which boosted the sieve effect some micropollutants with smaller size could still pass cnt layer and uf pores for the micropollutant of 25 mg l the removal rates were only 82 3 and 71 5 for active red and methylene blue respectively which was too low efficiency for engineering application therefore cnt adm is suitable for low strength micro polluted water purification micropollutant concentration 20 mg l this potential will be determined in our future studies adopting industrial tests 3 2 3 the effect of tmp fig 6 presents the effect of tmp on flux and removal rate flux increased as tmp linearly from 0 05 to 4 5 bar then the increment of flux reduced and flux curve tended to deviate from linear relationship this phenomenon fitted with the theory of critical flux 29 30 in the critical flux theory under critical flux the fouling rate is low and flux increases with tmp linearly above the critical flux the fouling rate gets higher due to more foulant accumulation on membrane and the increasing rate of flux decreases 31 in this work the critical flux is 574 l m 2 h 1 at 4 bar exceeding it the high flux caused more micropollutant accumulating on cnt adm surface producing the serious concentration polarization then more pore blocking and cake layer formed with tmp finally the flux raising rate reduced in addition the longer contact time between cnt and micropollutant produced by smaller flux and lower tmp could also reinforced the adsorptive filtration of cnt adm and promoted the removal rate fig 6 shows that the removal rate of micropollutant reduced with tmp in fact the effect of flux on micropollutant removal had two mechanisms 11 26 1 for low permeate flux increasing flux led to more water in permeate which exerted an effect on dilute effect for permeate and reduced the micropollutant concentration in permeate 2 for high permeate flux the greater flux at higher tmp brought about the high micropollutant concentration near cnt adm surface improving the concentration gradient between feed micropollutant wastewater and permeate thus more micropollutant passed cnt adm for this work the mechanism for the effect of flux on the micropollutant removal belonged to the latter in final as mentioned above under high tmp environment the porous structure of cnt layer became compact thus the permeability diminished 3 2 4 the effect of shear stress shear stress on membrane can significantly control the membrane fouling 32 increasing agitation speed of stirring rod strengthened the shear stress 33 as showed in fig 7 the agitation speed increases from 0 to 300 rpm while the shear stress also raises from to 0 01 to 0 16 pa then the concentration polarization diminishes and micropollutant deposition on membrane reduces thus cake layer pore blocking and fouling resistance decrease thus the flux elevated obviously with agitation speed from 0 to 250 rpm but for 300 rpm the flux declined because cnt layered on membrane returned and dispersed to bulk solution by high shear stress then enhancing the concentration polarization indicating that cnt adm was not suitable for high shear stress operation the optimized agitation speed and shear stress were 250 rpm and 0 16 pa respectively shear stress also affects the removal rate of micro pollutants by two facts 13 1 the high stress reduces the micro pollutant concentration on membrane and its concentration gradient thus micro pollutants penetrating membrane enhance 2 under high shear stress membrane surface keeps at a clean state and fouling layer does not form hence the secondly filtration role of fouling layer doesn t come into play for micro pollutant rejection as illustrated in fig 7 the micropollutant removal rate improves with the agitation speed which was reasonable firstly high stress caused by high agitation speed controlled the concentration gradient and reduced the micropollutant penetration secondly with the increase of shear stress some cnt from adsorption layer returned to the bulk solution which greatly reinforced the contact between cnt and micropollutant then importantly raising the adsorption efficiency thirdly the great shear stress formed hydraulic conditions of high turbulence which strengthened the diffusion of micropollutant into cnt layer so the hydrogen bond formed rapidly and micropollutant could be adsorbed easily different from the previous studies high flux did not bring about lower removal rate as high shear stress just occurred on cnt adm surface and did not press the homogenous porous structure of cnt layer thus the permeability had not almost been affected finally the agitation speed of 250 rpm and shear stress of 0 16 pa are suitable for cnt adm operation 3 3 micropollutant removal mechanism adsorption removal and membrane separation are two main mechanisms for micropollutant removal in cnt adm their detailed mechanism during the operating process were analyzed via the removal rate fig 8 shows the removal rate and flux of cnt adm at optimized condition all removal rates were above 89 and flux kept 144 l m 2 h 1 demonstrating that at the optimized condition cnt adm could remove the micropollutant quickly and stably the micropollutant removal increased with time the removal rate by membrane separation was relatively stable but the removal rate by adsorption got greater with time as the adsorption equilibrium had not yet reached at the beginning of experiment membrane separation mainly contributed to the removal rate however with experiment continuation the adsorption removal played a greater role with these phenomena the mechanism of micro pollutants removal for cnt adm could be clearly revealed into three stages at the first stage of cnt adm purifying the micro polluted water the micropollutant was rejected by cnt layer and membrane then most of them deposit on the top of cnt layer so only some micropollutant was adsorbed by cnt and the primary mechanism of micropollutant removal was double filtration cnt layer and membrane in fig 8 at 1 min the removal rate contribution of membrane separation was 66 8 59 7 89 4 during the second stage with micro polluted water purification continuation more micropollutant accumulated on the surface of cnt layer and part of them flowed into the interior of the cnt layer with homogenous porous structure then were adsorbed by cnt in this stage the double filtration cnt layer and membrane and adsorption removal had almost the same contributions on the micropollutant removal for example their removal rates were 49 6 and 49 5 at 5 min respectively after that for the third stage more and more micropollutant was adsorbed by cnt layer thus as showed in figs 8 and 9 the contribution of adsorption removal improved with time greatly and adsorption removal became the main mechanism for the micropollutant removal at 15 min the removal rate of adsorption removal 76 5 was much higher than that of membrane separation 23 3 as well at 40 min the removal rate of adsorption removal reached 93 2 3 4 the backwash cleaning backwash cleaning aiming at removing foulants on membrane surface uses high speed water flow to flush the reversed membrane surface when the water passes membrane pores creating shear stress on foulants then the foulants in membrane fall off and membrane permeability recoveries compared with other membrane cleaning methods the structure and equipment of backwash cleaning are simple while its operation is convenient in the design of cnt adm after the adsorption saturation of cnt layer the back cleaning is employed to reversely flush membrane and cnt layer is removed then the new cnt are used to form a cnt layer on membrane in order to evaluate the backwash performance cnt adm membrane fouled by micropollutant was turned over in amicon cell for reverse filtration fig 10 showed the new a fouled membrane b and fouled membrane after backwash c it was clearly observed that the cnt on membrane were a tight black layer however this cnt layer disappeared and some blue micropollutant retained on membrane which was reasonable for the preparation of cnt adm as showed in fig 10 b cnt was evenly distributed on the membrane surface and the layer was tight after micro polluted water filtration and backwash most cnt was removed fig 10 c indicating that cnt and membrane could be rapidly separated even by 0 1 bar therefore the design and operation of cnt adm are feasible besides there still was some micropollutant remaining on membrane after backwash implying that part of micropollutant could not be adsorbed and were rejected by membrane so the not strong adhesion ability of cnt on membrane helps to conduct the replacement of cnt after adsorption saturation and integrate cnt adm into a water purification system 3 5 implications for cnt adm application the micropollutant was a noticeable kind of micro pollutants in industrial effluent guangdong province is one of the most advanced regions of china at present guangdong province has begun to implement more stringent emission standards for printing and dyeing enterprises with the present technologies many enterprises could not reach the emission standards these enterprises are in danger of stopping production therefore developing an effective advanced water purification technology could save these enterprises cnt adm with the homogeneous porous structure is able to absorb and separate the micro pollutants usually cnt needs surfactant activation to stop forming aggregates which greatly limits the adsorption efficiency of cnt adm and its application 19 34 but for the cnt adm preparation this step is not necessary this finding is in favor of the practical application of cnt reduction of manufacturing costs and potential environmental pollution in this work the low pressure filtration with cnt adm could effectively remove the micropollutant in fig 4 cnt adm can effectively remove the various micropollutants and shows a noticeable stability as displayed in fig 5 cnt adm keeps removal rate exceeding 70 when the micropollutant concentration varies from 5 to 20 mg l thus cnt adm can cope with the change of water quality in the printing and dyeing plants and ensure the effluent lower than the emission standard tmp and shear stress are two key influence factors for cnt adm operation fig 6 illustrates the low pressure operation is beneficial to sustain the high flux and great removal rate which can reduce the equipment requirement and operating cost low shear stress also improves the removal rate and flux behavior indicating that suitable hydraulic condition on membrane should be designed furthermore the backwash is useful for removing the cnt after adsorption saturation and regenerating the new cnt layer practically because of the desirable removal for low size particle pollutants cnt adm is expected to replace ro nf in micro polluted water advanced treatment to reduce energy consumption in fact cnt adm is not able to offer the same rejection capacity as ro since the treatment efficiency of cnt adm are limited by the adsorption processes while some micropollutant with small affinity to cnt adm cannot be availably removed however cnt adm exhibits a clear cost advantage mwcnt used in this work is 300 400 kg and flat membrane is 150 m2 thus the cost of cnt adm is only 170 m2 which possess a much lower investment cost than the commercial nf and ro besides due to the small shear stress and low operating pressure decreasing the frequency of backwash cleaning and prolonging membrane life the operating cost of cnt adm is much lower than that of nf and ro too importantly the full scale water purification practice requires the sustainable micropollutant removal and stable flux as a result the duration time of cnt effective adsorption is crucial after adsorption saturation how to replace cnt layer or regenerate it efficiently is another key issue in figs 4 5 6 and 7 the removal rates are adopted to estimate sorption capacity of cnt except for the adsorption removal the double filtration is another main method to remove the micropollutant however more complicated factors need to be studied such as the homogeneous and permeable structure of cnt layer which is especially critical for improving the permeability and separation fig 4 in fact the higher cnt loading amount could greatly increase the filtration cycles but might raise the treatment costs and uncertain ecosystem risk in any case during the long term filtration process the cnt adsorption is always saturated and the micropollutant concentration in permeate exceeds the targeted level regeneration of adsorbed cnt needs to be furtherly studied as it is a slow process and may cause secondly pollution in this work the backwash is applied to rapidly replace the adsorption saturated cnt layer with new cnt in summary the adsorption efficiency and saturated adsorption amount are the key of cnt adm thus development of high effective adsorbents will become a focus of future studies 4 conclusions this work proposes a cnt adm for improving water purification to reveal the preparation strategy and to explain the micropollutant removal mechanism the following notable observations were made on the basis of physical adsorption and membrane separation a cnt adm was prepared by applying forward filtration of a cnt solution on an uf membrane the best optimized condition for cnt adm preparation was agitation speed of 50 rpm tmp of 1 bar cnt loading amount of 55 g m2 and preparation time of 10 min complete pore blocking was the main fouling mechanism of cnt adm at low cnt loading amount while the internal pore blocking intermediate pore blocking and cake formation became the primary fouling mechanisms for high cnt loading amount cnt adm exhibited a significant improvement for the micropollutant removal above 95 for three cycles due to the synergy of membrane separation sustaining cnt layer separating micropollutant and increasing adsorption time and adsorption removal forming cnt layer and adsorbing micropollutant the membrane separation was the main contribution for the micropollutant removal at the first stage and adsorption removal became more and more important for the long term operation afterwards the backwash cleaning was also successfully utilized to remove the adsorption saturated cnt and create new cnt layer with just 0 5 bar and 1 min thereby the cnt adm process provides a possible alternative to face up to the challenges of membrane fouling and improve the micropollutant removal in the end the current work indicates the feasibility and significance of using adsorptive membrane for promoting water purification declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

12696,in order to make full use and resourcefulness of the products produced in the coking wastewater treatment process solve the residual problem of wastewater and achieve clean production a sludge derived metal catalyst was prepared in this paper using metal doped coking sludge the catalyst has a regulated lattice surface ordering surface exposure of metal oxides pore size exposure and functional chemical bonding which enhances the catalytic activity of ozone o3 the catalytic performance of the catalyst was tested in refractory wastewater where the catalyst modified its biodegradability chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency and humic acid structure compared to the catalytic treatment with biochar alone the removal efficiency of total organic carbon toc cod and ultraviolet absorption uv254 were significantly increased by 35 67 57 23 and 45 44 various energy conversions and valence transitions of fe and co metals within the catalyst catalyzed the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 from o3 in this study high value added functional catalysts were synthesized from biochar with fe co and organic skeleton structure which was prepared from coking sludge the degradation of pollution in biological treatment of coking wastewater btcw was performed and the mechanism was elucidated the environmental risk in wastewater treatment process was controlled by disposal wase with waste approach which has important practical application value graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sludge derived biochar fe co biochar resource utilization catalytic ozonation bio treated coking wastewater data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction in the wastewater treatment process the comprehensive use and safe disposal of sludge is as important as water quality indicators typically sludge contains a variety of toxic and harmful contaminants microbial pathogens and a small number of heavy metals 1 coking sludge is high environmental risk because of its high yield and disposal costs 2 landfill and incineration are typical sludge disposal methods but them not suitable for all sludge types and environmental requirements firstly land resources limit the application of landfill technology secondly the internal substances of the sludge polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs s2 scn cn and men to soil and groundwater risks cannot be ignored 3 thirdly the incineration of coking sludge consumes large amounts of energy which leaving heavy metals such as fe cu zn and mn inorganic substances and vocs 4 in this regard pyrolysis technology has the property of preserving and fixing organic matters in sludge 5 converting toxic organic matter such as pahs in coking sludge into reduced carbon to realize carbon enrichment and storage and fixing trace heavy metals to drastically reduce the toxicity of sludge 2 therefore coking sludge can be used as a functional material with product value which shows the significance of environmental sustainability recently sludge as raw material for biochar catalyst l has been widely studied 6 biochar from municipal sludge pyrolysis could be used to degrade ciprofloxacin in the fenton system 7 municipal anaerobic digestion sludge ads derived biochar could be used as a carrier of metal oxides fe2o3 which accelerates the decomposition of sulfamethazine 8 raw materials are mainly from biomass or municipal sludge but very little literature reports on coking sludge as a raw material there are more species with aromatic structure of organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are easily enriched in the sludge 9 pyridine and quinoline organic pollutants form complexes or chelates which provide transfer platform with the multi free energy electron 10 biochar surfaces can provide more stable metal centers due to surface electronegativity dispersion and functional groups 11 it was found that coking sludge contains high concentrations of characteristic pollutants such as phenolic compounds and pahs which are usually precursors of graphite produced during sludge pyrolysis 12 doping transition metals fe group mn group co group etc was conducive to the formation of metal oxides with different valence states and valence bond coupling 13 the multifunctional structure of metal active sites can be achieved by using bimetallic support carriers inorganic cofactors usually combine various metals by adjusting the charge distribution of the carbon structure of the carrier to generate new active sites 14 among them fe and co are good candidates for the valence electrons with very rich electron orbitals and high ksp 43 8 which contribute to the formation of stable deposits on the surface of biochar magnetic spinel metal oxides are known to have easy separation and recovery high catalytic activity and chemical stability therefore the catalysts prepared by using transition metal fe co doped sludge based biochar can not only effectively utilize the waste to reduce the catalyst cost but also the fe and co interaction enhances the intrinsic reduction activity of the catalyst as a typical representative of industrial wastewater coking wastewater the raw water of coking wastewater contains a large amount of refractory organic matter and the concentration of refractory organic matter is still high after biological treatment 4 in china the hydraulic residence time hrt of biological treatment process of coking wastewater is 150 300 h and the concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod in biological effluent is 200 500 mg l accounting for 2 5 of the cod of the raw water 15 after the coking wastewater is treated by biological process the btcw still contains most of the refractory dissolved organic matter causing the cod of the btcw to exceed the standard which is difficult to be completely removed by the existing biological method therefore many researchers have turned their attention to abiotic processes such as ozone catalysis and fenton oxidation 6 the novel catalyst co ni mofs cs was prepared by hydrothermal method to effectively degrade the inert organic matter in the btcw in the presence of ozone 16 for the oxidation treatment of btcw toc removal rate by mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalyst reached 40 6 17 in recent years heterogeneous ozone catalytic oxidation depth technology has been increasingly applied to the treatment of refractory wastewater and its core technology is the preparation of efficient stable and inexpensive catalysts 9 based on the inspiration of waste treatment and resource recycling the pyrolysis and conversion method of coking sludge is used to treat the trace residual and doped heavy metals in coking sludge as the active composition of the catalyst and the toxic inorganic and organic pollutants as the skeleton structure of the catalyst to achieve the synergy of reducing the activity of heavy metals and immobilized carbon sources and at the same time to form high value added ozone catalyst products in this study the background material of coking sludge fe co synergistic biochar was developed by introducing fe co ions to achieve carbonization and immobilization mechanism and the degradation mechanism and the key factors influencing its catalytic ozonation of inert component cod were discovered the surface structure metal catalytic site pore structure and functional chemical bond of the catalyst were studied the catalytic degradation performance of fe co biochar on btcw was systematically investigated by cod toc and ultraviolet absorption uv254 assessment under the condition of changing material ratio and reaction conditions and the degradation kinetics was analyzed the degradation mechanism of btcw in fe co biochar catalytic ozone system was investigated the stability and application cost of the catalyst were evaluated this work combined coking sludge with the idea of disposal wase with waste which is help to the environmental risk control in wastewater treatment engineering 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and reagents coking sludge with about 30 water content and btcw were taken from the oxic hydrolysis denitrification oxic o h o process in baowu iron and steel co ltd which is located in shaoguan city guangdong province china the chemical composition of coking sludge and btcw were detailed shown in table s1 the quality indices of biological effluent were shown in table s2 reagents materials and analytical methods were described in text s2 2 2 preparation of catalysts 2 2 1 preparation of biochar the sludge based biochar was prepared by pyrolysis an appropriate amount of coking sludge was placed in a crucible dried in an oven at 65 c for 8 h cooled to room temperature and collection the milled pre dried sludge based was maintained for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 c min at 650 c then the resulting biochar was crushed into fine powder by agate mortar and stored in a desiccator before usage 2 2 2 fabrication of fe co biochar based on the previous research of our group the dissolution amount of toc of biochar at 650 c was 2 65 mg l in order to reduce the release of background organic carbon it is suggested that catalysts on sludge based biochar built from iron chloride and cobalt chloride loaded on koh porogenic agent were prepared by a modified impregnation method using analytical reagents briefly 1 00 g of activated sludge biochar was immersed in ultrapure water containing fecl3 6h2o 2 70 g and cocl2 6h2o 4 76 g mixed well in a 1 2 molar ratio the mixture was placed in ultrasound for 30 min and then dried in a vacuum freeze dryer for 8 h the dried catalyst was subsequently placed in a tube furnace and calcined at 700 c for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 c min to obtain fe co biochar this mass fraction was close to the theoretically calculated mass fraction in the final catalyst as measured by the energy dispersive spectrometer eds method 2 3 catalytic ozonation experiments in the catalytic ozonation experiments fe co biochar catalysts and 100 ml btcw were placed in a 250 ml three neck flask o3 was bubbled into the reactor through a cylindrical microporous glass plate flow rate of 1 0 l min which was supplied by an o3 generator ch ztw guangzhou chuanghuan ozone electric appliance co ltd china samples were taken at regular intervals and filtered through a 0 45 μm microporous membrane for safety reasons the o3 exhaust gas is absorbed by a 20 ki solution and the outlet ozone concentration is calculated using the iodometric method after each cycle of the experiment the catalysts were separated by centrifugation washed several times with ultrapure water and ethanol to remove organic compounds of the catalysts surface and dried at 75 c overnight the generation of free radicals was quantified using uv spectrophotometry and fluorescence spectrophotometry and the detection method is described in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fe co biochar the sem image of biochar and fe co biochar are shown in fig 1 and images of fe biochar and co biochar are shown in fig s2 the biochar has a rough surface with many pores of different sizes on the surface fig 1a b these rough surface structure may be attributed to the carbonization of small organic and biological macromolecules during pyrolysis 3 many crystalline particles were formed in fe biochar while more nanofibrous structures were formed in co biochar and it was observed that both structures were present on the surface of fe co biochar fig 1c d in addition the surface element composition and its distribution of fe co biochar as shown in fig s3 fe co and c were evenly distributed on the surface of fe co biochar indicating that there might be some carbide in fe co biochar according to fig s1b the mass fractions of fe and co in fe co biochar were 19 07 and 34 16 which were close to the theoretical value 1 2 it was further verified that fe and co in the liquid phase were almost all deposited on the biochar during the synthesis of fe co biochar composites xrd was used to explore the crystal structures of different biochar catalysts fig 2a biochar contains trace amounts of iron and the diffraction peak of biochar was very similar to that of fe biochar the results showed that catalysts displayed a well resolved sharp diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 30 2 35 5 43 2 and 55 1 which corresponded to the four index planes 220 311 400 and 422 of maghemite 18 the addition of co element had a great effect on the phase composition of biochar samples and fe was combined with co metal to form fe co alloy the main crystalline mineral of fe co biochar was fe co alloy with diffraction 2θ peaks at 25 3 57 3 and 63 9 corresponding to 006 511 and 440 19 meanwhile for fe co biochar and co biochar the characteristic peaks at 51 5 and 76 8 could be ascribed to the 200 and 211 crystalline facets of co2o3 however no clear characteristic peak corresponding to co was observed the carbon structure and crystallinity of metallic co can be easily adjusted due to the temperature dependence 20 in summary it could be seen that the xrd pattern of fe co biochar contained common features of the xrd patterns of fe biochar and co biochar indicating that the crystal structure of fe biochar and co biochar were partially preserved in fe co biochar ft ir spectrums indicated that the four catalysts obtained similar ft ir adsorption bands fig 2b the frequency ranges from 3400 to 3600 cm 1 mainly corresponding to stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups oh the characteristic bands at 1600 cm 1 were attribute to the aromatic stretching vibration of cc co 21 compared with biochar the absorption band peaks of the other three catalysts were red shifted which could be attributed to the formation of coordination bonds between fe co and biochar organic ligands at the same time the broad band peaks between 700 cm 1 and 610 cm 1 on the three catalysts were associated with feo feoh stretching vibrations which indicated that the presence of amorphous feo or fe oh 3 18 notably fe co biochar obtained higher intensity adsorption bands compared to other biochar catalysts that indicating the increase of metal hydroxyl groups and surface groups 22 meanwhile those results also indicated that the fe and co were combined with biochar primarily through coordination with both carboxyl and hydroxyl ligands at the biochar surface obviously the bet isotherm of biochar and fe co biochar catalysts displayed a reversible type iv mesoporous capillary condensation type isotherm with h3 type prominent hysteresis loop fig s5a the pore size distribution is mainly in the range of 2 10 nm fig s5b which is one of the primary features of mesoporous materials indicating the existence of narrow slit shaped pores 14 according to the multipoint bet model it is known that the smaller specific surface area of the other catalysts compared to biochar was due to the deposition of fe and co it is further explained that the pore volume obtained for fe co biochar 0 082 cm3 g was lower than that of biochar 0 170 cm3 g table s3 based on the above results it was speculated that there may be some fe and co metals embedded in the pores of biochar the surface composition and valence band states of fresh fe co biochar were investigated by xps peaks of co 2p fe 2p o 1s and c 1s could be detected in the survey spectrum fig s6 corresponding to the bonding energy at 804 ev 711 ev 532 ev and 285 ev respectively the characteristic peaks of 288 9 ev 286 6 ev and 284 6 ev for co co and cc cc respectively are the main components of the catalyst surface fig 3a this was due to the structure of the biochar was not significantly changed in the catalysts 1 the o1s spectrum of fe co biochar contained coh 536 1 ev oco 533 3 ev feo 530 3 ev and coo 531 5 ev the abundant oxygen functional groups on the surface of biochar make it easy to bond with metals in the fe 2p co 2p spectrum fig 3c d two valence states of iron were observed fe iii or co iii had the binging energy of 716 5 ev and 727 6 ev 788 4 ev and 804 1 ev and fe ii or co ii had the binding energy of 712 9 ev and 724 6 ev 782 6 ev and 797 0 ev the spin orbit component of the shaking satellite demonstrated the coexistence of co ii and co iii fe ii and fe iii which indicated the formation of co3o4 and fe3o4 on the surface of biochar the metals in fe co biochar catalyst contained various valence states which led to its good oxidation reduction ability 3 2 exploring the catalytic ozonation process to evaluate the catalytic activity of the catalyst for o3 batch experiments were conducted to test the degradation of pollutants by btcw under different modes through different operations figs 4a b s7 catalytic oxidation degradation stage the removal efficiency of toc by o3 reaction alone was 7 40 the removal efficiency of toc by biochar was 9 18 which showed that the unmodified biochar did not have high catalytic activity for ozonation of btcw by adding fe biochar co biochar and fe co biochar respectively in the o3 reactor as synthetic materials the degradation efficiency was increased to 28 72 34 10 and 44 85 fig 4a the fe co ratio in the fe co biochar catalyst was 1 2 and the sum of the degradation efficiency of fe biochar and co biochar was 32 3 according to the ratio which was lower than that of fe co biochar 44 85 indicating that fe and co in fe co biochar had a good synergistic effect among these systems the fe co biochar o3 system has the highest cod removal rate in btcw which was 71 80 while the removal rate of uv254 could reach 64 40 fig 4b therefore a considerable synergy between fe co biochar and o3 was achieved in the degradation of pollutants in btcw which implied that fe co biochar presented high activity in the catalytic ozonation providing more active sites for o3 decomposition and catalyzing the production of more free radicals that preferentially attack organic pollutants bound to it the adsorption and removal efficiencies of btcw for toc in the biochar fe biochar co biochar and fe co biochar systems were 4 21 3 52 2 58 and 1 53 respectively which were attributed to the adsorption capacity of the catalysts fig s7 fig s8 showed that the prepared catalysts were able to adsorb toc rapidly and reached the adsorption equilibrium within the 10 min however the amount of adsorption varied slightly from one catalyst to another depending on the specific surface area and pore structure of the catalysts which was in good agreement with the results of the n2 adsorption solution isotherm combining the two operations in different modes for catalytic ozone removal from btcw wastewater it could be found that adsorption played a small role in the catalytic degradation process and therefore adsorption is not discussed separately in the subsequent part of this paper in order to further analyze the variations in the catalytic oxidation degradation process of toc in different modes first and second order kinetic models were fitted table s4 could be obtained by the following eqs 1 and 2 1 pseudo first order ln toc toc 0 k obs 1 t 2 pseudo second order 1 toc 1 toc 0 k obs 2 t where k obs 1 min 1 and k obs 2 min 1 were the reaction rate constants of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models respectively according to fig 4c d the fitting results of the two models showed that the degradation reaction was divided into two parts with different rate constants k obs for the correlation coefficient r2 comparison the r2 of the second order kinetics was slightly higher the first order kinetic model which showing a better correlation with the performed experiments it was evident that the high value of k obs in the first 5 min in the different models was owing to the degradation of simple organic matter in the btcw regarding the second order model the parameter k obs for the first linear part of the reaction increased from 4 983 10 5 min 1 by o3 alone to 1 450 10 3 min 1 by the fe co biochar o3 system indicating that the fe co biochar o3 system degraded the colored and simple compounds however the difference was that the parameter k obs of the second linear part of the reaction was lower compared to the first part indicating that was the process of degradation of recalcitrant compounds the fe co biochar o3 system was confirmed to have a great potential in terms of degradation of recalcitrant compounds in wastewater as the k obs increased from 2 108 10 5 min 1 by o3 alone to 9 877 10 5 min 1 by the fe co biochar o3 system the first order kinetic parameters also showed similar results the dominant mechanism for the degradation damage of organic matter during catalytic process was attributed to the generation of free radicals during the decomposition of o3 on the surface of fe co biochar solids 3 3 effect of operational condition on the fe co biochar catalytic ozonation the catalytic activity of fe co biochar during ozonation strongly depended on the ratio of fe and co figs 5a s9a when the fe co loading ratio was increased from 1 1 to 1 2 the degradation of btcw was significantly improved with 44 85 removal of toc 71 80 removal of cod and 64 40 removal of uv254 this may be due to cobalt dopants activating adjacent fe co active sites thereby reducing the energy barrier the doping of co leads to higher energy transfer from the d band center of the fe active point while the d band center of co was transferred to a lower energy transfer which becomes the activator of the fe site and the synergistic activity of fe co biochar was enhanced by co and fe and the co site synergistically enhances the catalytic activity of fe co biochar 3 when the component ratio was increased to 1 2 5 the removal efficiency of toc cod and uv254 in the btcw catalytic ozonation process was not significant this may be due to excessive metal coverage which blocked the active catalytic sites of biochar and reduced the mass transfer phenomenon 1 in order to improve the economy of the material itself secondary contamination caused by excessive metal leaching should be prevented fe co biochar composite with fe co loading ratio of 1 2 was chosen for subsequent experiments different catalyst concentrations 0 00 0 50 mg l could also have effect on catalytic ozonation figs 5b s9b with the concentration of fe co biochar increased the removal rate of contaminants trended to increase which owing to the increase of adsorption sites resulting in enhanced adsorption properties meanwhile the increase of catalytic sites in the system such as hydroxyl and lewis s acid sites on the surface of fe and co produced more active species 23 the degradation of pollutants in btcw was not obvious when the concentration of fe co biochar was further increased to 1 00 mg l which could be explained by the limited ozonolysis capacity of btcw and the competition between excess fe ii co ii in the system and btcw for the available oxidant the effect of ph change on the degradation of btcw was investigated since the ph of the system affects the o3 oxidation mechanism figs 5c s9c the removal rate of toc increased from 7 30 to 50 11 fig 5c cod increased from 13 80 to 75 00 and uv254 from 14 99 to 69 99 when the ph was increased from 3 0 to 9 0 fig s9c the above results might be attributed to the fact that under acidic conditions the ionization of carboxyl groups such as carboxyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups on the surface of the activated carbon was inhibited and the neutral state was maintained 24 alkaline conditions promoted ionization of activated carbon surface groups and phenolic compounds in the btcw 25 moreover indicating that the abundance of oh could enhance the generation of oh and degradation of organic pollutants at high ph 26 in addition in the degradation process of btcw the ph value of all solutions in the process of o3 oxidation was greatly reduced resulting in the accumulation of organic acids and the unstable existence of some catalyzed free radicals and slowing down the degradation efficiency 27 since the initial ph value of raw btcw ranged from 7 3 to 8 8 the removal rate of toc cod and uv254 from btcw was not significantly increased during catalytic ozonation when the initial ph was adjusted to 9 0 considering the acid base pollution and water treatment cost no extra additional ph adjustment was required in the experiment o3 concentration played a crucial role in the fe co biochar o3 system therefore the effect of o3 concentration on the degradation of btcw was investigated fig 5d the removal efficiency of toc increased with increasing o3 concentration which might be due to the generation of more derived radicals with increasing o3 concentration according to eqs 3 5 28 the toc removal efficiency only increased by 1 90 when the o3 concentration increased from 10 mg l to 15 mg l showing that higher o3 concentration was not always conducive to the improvement of toc removal there was no significant trend of increase in cod and uv254 removal fig s9d since o3 molecule could also react with oh to produce o2 and h2o whereas excess o3 would compete with pollutants and react with free radicals resulting in the consumption of oxidants 29 the o3 concentration of 10 mg l was used as the optimal condition o3 utilization efficiency is calculated by the formula r o 3 0 o 3 i o 3 0 100 where o3 0 and o3 i represent the total amount of the initial o3 mg and the total dose of end o3 mg respectively the o3 utilization efficiency in the reaction process is shown in fig s10 the decreasing trend of ozone utilization is due to the difficulty of o3 degradation for some recalcitrant organics in the subsequent reaction process however the o3 utilization in the o3 alone system decreases faster than that in the fe co biochar system due to the addition of catalysts that catalyze the o3 decomposition to produce more reactive oxide species 3 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 4 ho 2 o 2 h 5 o 3 h 2 o oh oh o 2 in the catalytic ozonation degradation of btcw fe co biochar was compared with other catalysts and their removal capability was shown in table 1 which revealed that the fe co biochar o3 system has excellent degradation performance for btcw 3 4 catalyst magnetic reusability and stability from the perspective of the application the key characteristics of a catalyst are its magnetic reusability and stability to study magnetism the hysteresis regression line of fe co biochar was recorded at room temperature fig s11 the saturation magnetization of fe co biochar is ms 14 25 emu g due to the formation of some fe and co oxides the sample shows magnetism but the magnetism is not high because fe co metal elements combine with each other to form fe co alloy or part of the iron cobalt oxide is reduced by carbon to metal elements or synthetic metal carbides 18 the stability of the catalyst was studied and the toc leaching amount of fe co biochar in ultrapure water was tested the leaching amount of toc reached equilibrium in about 30 min which was 1 38 mg l fig s8 and the leached iron and cobalt concentrations in solution ranged from 0 143 to 0 441 mg l and 0 220 0 545 mg l respectively fig 6b the removal efficiency of toc decreased from 44 85 to 38 46 after four cycles under the selected conditions fig 6a and the results indicated that the fe co biochar still maintained good catalytic activity in the reuse tests in addition the removal rate of toc decreased slightly probably due to the decrease in the number of active sites on the catalyst surface which reduced the o3 decomposition rate and resulted in a lower mineralization rate since the coordination bonds between metal atoms and ligands were easily broken during catalytic ozonation by the catalyst the crystalline structure and functional group structure of the fe co biochar catalysts before and after the reaction was also analyzed by means of xrd and ft ir characterization fig s12 the xrd results showed that the fe co biochar retained most of the characteristic diffraction peaks after recovery but the disappearance of weak peaks indicated that the oxidation system slightly broke the structure of the catalyst at the same time most of the functional groups on ft ir were not destroyed only some of the strength was weakened these results further proved that the fe co biochar catalyst possessed some stability and regeneration 3 5 degradation mechanism of fe co biochar catalytic ozonation combined with the above analysis the advanced oxidation treatment of btcw by fe co biochar catalytic ozonation was proved to be effectively the degradation mechanism of fe co biochar catalytic ozonation for refractory organic matter was revealed based on the analysis of intermediates and free radicals generated during the catalytic ozonation process it was well known that oh o2 and 1o2 were the possible free radicals generated by catalytic ozonation 5 5 dimethyl 2 oxopyrroline 1 oxyl dmpox and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone tempo were used as free radical capturing agents to generate dmpo oh dmpo o2 and tempo 1o2 which were detected by epr in fe co biochar o3 system the signal of dmpox was detected which was the product of further oxidation of dmpo oh fig 7a it was indicated that fe co biochar could catalyze o3 to generate oh meanwhile the typical tempo 1o2 triplet peak could be detected in fe co biochar o3 system and the characteristic signal of dmpo and o2 reaction products could also be detected in fe co biochar o3 system indicating that fe co biochar could catalyst o3 to produce o2 in general epr test results showed that fe co biochar catalyzed o3 to produce o2 and oh and greatly promoted the formation of 1o2 to further explore the fe co biochar catalytic oxidation the concentration of reactive oxygen species in the fe co biochar o3 system was identified in which the oh can almost react with solvent the rate constant is generally 108 1010 leading to the concentration of oh in water is generally small with 10 6 μmol l the concentration of hydroxyl radicals by adding fe co biochar oh concentration starts to reach 0 129 μmol l due to the burst of radicals as well as consumption finally the concentration decreases to 2 85 10 3 μmol l and maintains this concentration level at 40 min after the reaction the concentration of o2 was stabilized at the level of 106 3 μmol l fig 7b the results indicate that o2 are the main active species in the fe co biochar o3 system according to previous studies in the process of ozone catalysis by typical biochar the electron rich carbonyl group has a certain catalytic active site on the surface of biochar which can accelerate the decomposition of ozone to produce a certain o2 and the carbonyl group is oxidized to oh 33 but it is found that in heterogeneous o3 catalyzed reactions variable valence metal ions and oxygen containing groups on the surface were the active sites of catalysts and electron transfer was a key step in the catalytic process as shown in eqs 6 8 fe co biochar could efficiently catalyze the decomposition of o3 to produce oh o2 and 1o2 the adsorption sites in the surface of the catalyst facilitated the generation of free radicals by o3 oxidation decomposition which promoted to adsorb enrich and degrade the pollutants in the wastewater considering the standard reduction potentials e0 co iii co ii 1 81 v e0 fe iii fe ii 0 77 v and e0 o3 o2 2 07 v o3 could oxidize the catalyst surface fe ii co ii to fe iii co iii however the catalyst surface fe ii could reduce the co iii to co ii thus forming fe iii or co ii 34 the valence state cycle of the metal ions formed by fe ii co ii and fe iii co iii promoted the decomposition of o3 and organic matter 6 fe ii co ii 2o 3 2h 2 o fe iii co iii oh 3 oh 2 o 2 7 o 3 fe iii co iii oh fe iii co iii o 2 ho 2 8 fe iii co iii 2 ho 2 fe ii co ii 2o 2 2h organic compounds usually had characteristic absorption bands in the uv response region and uv254 could reflect the important indexes of humus organics and aromatic compounds in water 35 as shown in fig 8 the uv visible absorption of o3 and fe co biochar o3 system was getting weaker and weaker compared with non catalyst within the absorption wavelength 225 400 nm and uv254 was significantly decreased indicating that the response of monocyclic aromatic compounds heterocyclic aromatic compounds polycyclic aromatic compounds chromogenic groups auxiliary color groups and unsaturated organic substances of btcw were significantly degraded the absorption peaks of fe co biochar o3 treatment system were all significantly reduced which demonstrated that these high risk pollutants were effectively removed the addition of fe co biochar could destroy unsaturated functional groups more efficiently and the uv254 removal rate increased from 14 60 in o3 degradation alone to 64 40 with an efficiency gain of 49 80 in the catalytic system the generation of reactive oxidizing substances was more favorable for the ring opening reaction and thus the corresponding reduction in uv absorption intensity was more pronounced 36 3d eems spectra can provide detailed information on fluorophores in btcw including the location movement and intensity of the fluorescence peaks without destroying the structure of the organics the 3d eems spectra before and after being treated by fe co biochar catalytic ozonation were shown in fig 9 two distinct peaks were detected before being treated by the catalytic ozonation fig 9a region a ex em 300 375 nm 400 500 nm was the fluorescence peak region of land source humic acid 27 and region b ex em 237 250 nm 450 500 nm was the fluorescence peak region of fulvic acid moreover the fluorescence intensity of land source humic acid was greater indicating a higher concentration after 40 min of catalytic reaction fig 9b the fluorescence peak a and b disappeared humic acid like organic compounds or functional groups generated in btcw were destroyed by o3 catalytic reaction in fluorescence response which was attributed to the fact that most of the above mentioned fluorescence characteristic substances contained benzene rings connected to electron donating functional groups such as amine groups hydroxyl groups etc 36 this resulted in the high reactive activity of reactive oxidizing substances and o3 3 6 economic analysis as we all know a large amount of sludge is generated during industrial wastewater treatment and the cost of sludge treatment is higher for the current conventional sludge treatment process the cost of sludge incineration is about 400 500 cny t 4 to explore the potential of this catalyst for industrial application we calculated the electricity and chemical consumption required in the preparation of this catalyst and compared it with the catalyst cost in the literature tables s5 s6 the price of catalyst preparation in the statistical literature was 0 9 2 5 cny t waste water and the price considering the cod degradation effect was 7 7 11 7 cny kg cod see table s6 for the prices of different catalysts it is much higher than the catalyst prices in this study 0 9 cny t waste water 7 7 cny kg cod some catalysts despite their low preparation cost have poor catalytic effect i e low cod degradation per unit cost the catalysts in this study have more potential for industrial application current statistics show that biochar prepared from sludge sells in the market for about 1120 1499 cny t and the ozone catalysts prepared in this study can generate some positive benefits when sold in the market economic analysis shows that biochar doped with metal catalyzed o3 can degrade btcw in water at a lower cost and has the potential for large scale use 4 conclusions in this work the mineral elements and pahs in coking sludge were to generate biochar with high ion exchange capacity and abundant functional groups then fe and co were doped to prepare functionalized biochar cleaner production was achieved while btcw pollution residue problems were solved the catalytic function of transition metal ions depends on interfacial unsaturated valence bonds and the multi elemental mixed crystals e field effect providing a cyclic mechanism for redox reactions of cyclic compounds within the adsorption pore channel o3 was activated by fe ii fe iii and co ii co iii cycles and then oh o2 and 1o2 were generated which effectively destroyed the pollution in btcw including pahs and humic substances the catalyst has excellent performance and lower than market cost which is competitive for engineering applications this study provides a reference for btcw and sludge

12696,in order to make full use and resourcefulness of the products produced in the coking wastewater treatment process solve the residual problem of wastewater and achieve clean production a sludge derived metal catalyst was prepared in this paper using metal doped coking sludge the catalyst has a regulated lattice surface ordering surface exposure of metal oxides pore size exposure and functional chemical bonding which enhances the catalytic activity of ozone o3 the catalytic performance of the catalyst was tested in refractory wastewater where the catalyst modified its biodegradability chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency and humic acid structure compared to the catalytic treatment with biochar alone the removal efficiency of total organic carbon toc cod and ultraviolet absorption uv254 were significantly increased by 35 67 57 23 and 45 44 various energy conversions and valence transitions of fe and co metals within the catalyst catalyzed the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 from o3 in this study high value added functional catalysts were synthesized from biochar with fe co and organic skeleton structure which was prepared from coking sludge the degradation of pollution in biological treatment of coking wastewater btcw was performed and the mechanism was elucidated the environmental risk in wastewater treatment process was controlled by disposal wase with waste approach which has important practical application value graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sludge derived biochar fe co biochar resource utilization catalytic ozonation bio treated coking wastewater data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction in the wastewater treatment process the comprehensive use and safe disposal of sludge is as important as water quality indicators typically sludge contains a variety of toxic and harmful contaminants microbial pathogens and a small number of heavy metals 1 coking sludge is high environmental risk because of its high yield and disposal costs 2 landfill and incineration are typical sludge disposal methods but them not suitable for all sludge types and environmental requirements firstly land resources limit the application of landfill technology secondly the internal substances of the sludge polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs s2 scn cn and men to soil and groundwater risks cannot be ignored 3 thirdly the incineration of coking sludge consumes large amounts of energy which leaving heavy metals such as fe cu zn and mn inorganic substances and vocs 4 in this regard pyrolysis technology has the property of preserving and fixing organic matters in sludge 5 converting toxic organic matter such as pahs in coking sludge into reduced carbon to realize carbon enrichment and storage and fixing trace heavy metals to drastically reduce the toxicity of sludge 2 therefore coking sludge can be used as a functional material with product value which shows the significance of environmental sustainability recently sludge as raw material for biochar catalyst l has been widely studied 6 biochar from municipal sludge pyrolysis could be used to degrade ciprofloxacin in the fenton system 7 municipal anaerobic digestion sludge ads derived biochar could be used as a carrier of metal oxides fe2o3 which accelerates the decomposition of sulfamethazine 8 raw materials are mainly from biomass or municipal sludge but very little literature reports on coking sludge as a raw material there are more species with aromatic structure of organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are easily enriched in the sludge 9 pyridine and quinoline organic pollutants form complexes or chelates which provide transfer platform with the multi free energy electron 10 biochar surfaces can provide more stable metal centers due to surface electronegativity dispersion and functional groups 11 it was found that coking sludge contains high concentrations of characteristic pollutants such as phenolic compounds and pahs which are usually precursors of graphite produced during sludge pyrolysis 12 doping transition metals fe group mn group co group etc was conducive to the formation of metal oxides with different valence states and valence bond coupling 13 the multifunctional structure of metal active sites can be achieved by using bimetallic support carriers inorganic cofactors usually combine various metals by adjusting the charge distribution of the carbon structure of the carrier to generate new active sites 14 among them fe and co are good candidates for the valence electrons with very rich electron orbitals and high ksp 43 8 which contribute to the formation of stable deposits on the surface of biochar magnetic spinel metal oxides are known to have easy separation and recovery high catalytic activity and chemical stability therefore the catalysts prepared by using transition metal fe co doped sludge based biochar can not only effectively utilize the waste to reduce the catalyst cost but also the fe and co interaction enhances the intrinsic reduction activity of the catalyst as a typical representative of industrial wastewater coking wastewater the raw water of coking wastewater contains a large amount of refractory organic matter and the concentration of refractory organic matter is still high after biological treatment 4 in china the hydraulic residence time hrt of biological treatment process of coking wastewater is 150 300 h and the concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod in biological effluent is 200 500 mg l accounting for 2 5 of the cod of the raw water 15 after the coking wastewater is treated by biological process the btcw still contains most of the refractory dissolved organic matter causing the cod of the btcw to exceed the standard which is difficult to be completely removed by the existing biological method therefore many researchers have turned their attention to abiotic processes such as ozone catalysis and fenton oxidation 6 the novel catalyst co ni mofs cs was prepared by hydrothermal method to effectively degrade the inert organic matter in the btcw in the presence of ozone 16 for the oxidation treatment of btcw toc removal rate by mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalyst reached 40 6 17 in recent years heterogeneous ozone catalytic oxidation depth technology has been increasingly applied to the treatment of refractory wastewater and its core technology is the preparation of efficient stable and inexpensive catalysts 9 based on the inspiration of waste treatment and resource recycling the pyrolysis and conversion method of coking sludge is used to treat the trace residual and doped heavy metals in coking sludge as the active composition of the catalyst and the toxic inorganic and organic pollutants as the skeleton structure of the catalyst to achieve the synergy of reducing the activity of heavy metals and immobilized carbon sources and at the same time to form high value added ozone catalyst products in this study the background material of coking sludge fe co synergistic biochar was developed by introducing fe co ions to achieve carbonization and immobilization mechanism and the degradation mechanism and the key factors influencing its catalytic ozonation of inert component cod were discovered the surface structure metal catalytic site pore structure and functional chemical bond of the catalyst were studied the catalytic degradation performance of fe co biochar on btcw was systematically investigated by cod toc and ultraviolet absorption uv254 assessment under the condition of changing material ratio and reaction conditions and the degradation kinetics was analyzed the degradation mechanism of btcw in fe co biochar catalytic ozone system was investigated the stability and application cost of the catalyst were evaluated this work combined coking sludge with the idea of disposal wase with waste which is help to the environmental risk control in wastewater treatment engineering 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and reagents coking sludge with about 30 water content and btcw were taken from the oxic hydrolysis denitrification oxic o h o process in baowu iron and steel co ltd which is located in shaoguan city guangdong province china the chemical composition of coking sludge and btcw were detailed shown in table s1 the quality indices of biological effluent were shown in table s2 reagents materials and analytical methods were described in text s2 2 2 preparation of catalysts 2 2 1 preparation of biochar the sludge based biochar was prepared by pyrolysis an appropriate amount of coking sludge was placed in a crucible dried in an oven at 65 c for 8 h cooled to room temperature and collection the milled pre dried sludge based was maintained for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 c min at 650 c then the resulting biochar was crushed into fine powder by agate mortar and stored in a desiccator before usage 2 2 2 fabrication of fe co biochar based on the previous research of our group the dissolution amount of toc of biochar at 650 c was 2 65 mg l in order to reduce the release of background organic carbon it is suggested that catalysts on sludge based biochar built from iron chloride and cobalt chloride loaded on koh porogenic agent were prepared by a modified impregnation method using analytical reagents briefly 1 00 g of activated sludge biochar was immersed in ultrapure water containing fecl3 6h2o 2 70 g and cocl2 6h2o 4 76 g mixed well in a 1 2 molar ratio the mixture was placed in ultrasound for 30 min and then dried in a vacuum freeze dryer for 8 h the dried catalyst was subsequently placed in a tube furnace and calcined at 700 c for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 c min to obtain fe co biochar this mass fraction was close to the theoretically calculated mass fraction in the final catalyst as measured by the energy dispersive spectrometer eds method 2 3 catalytic ozonation experiments in the catalytic ozonation experiments fe co biochar catalysts and 100 ml btcw were placed in a 250 ml three neck flask o3 was bubbled into the reactor through a cylindrical microporous glass plate flow rate of 1 0 l min which was supplied by an o3 generator ch ztw guangzhou chuanghuan ozone electric appliance co ltd china samples were taken at regular intervals and filtered through a 0 45 μm microporous membrane for safety reasons the o3 exhaust gas is absorbed by a 20 ki solution and the outlet ozone concentration is calculated using the iodometric method after each cycle of the experiment the catalysts were separated by centrifugation washed several times with ultrapure water and ethanol to remove organic compounds of the catalysts surface and dried at 75 c overnight the generation of free radicals was quantified using uv spectrophotometry and fluorescence spectrophotometry and the detection method is described in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fe co biochar the sem image of biochar and fe co biochar are shown in fig 1 and images of fe biochar and co biochar are shown in fig s2 the biochar has a rough surface with many pores of different sizes on the surface fig 1a b these rough surface structure may be attributed to the carbonization of small organic and biological macromolecules during pyrolysis 3 many crystalline particles were formed in fe biochar while more nanofibrous structures were formed in co biochar and it was observed that both structures were present on the surface of fe co biochar fig 1c d in addition the surface element composition and its distribution of fe co biochar as shown in fig s3 fe co and c were evenly distributed on the surface of fe co biochar indicating that there might be some carbide in fe co biochar according to fig s1b the mass fractions of fe and co in fe co biochar were 19 07 and 34 16 which were close to the theoretical value 1 2 it was further verified that fe and co in the liquid phase were almost all deposited on the biochar during the synthesis of fe co biochar composites xrd was used to explore the crystal structures of different biochar catalysts fig 2a biochar contains trace amounts of iron and the diffraction peak of biochar was very similar to that of fe biochar the results showed that catalysts displayed a well resolved sharp diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 30 2 35 5 43 2 and 55 1 which corresponded to the four index planes 220 311 400 and 422 of maghemite 18 the addition of co element had a great effect on the phase composition of biochar samples and fe was combined with co metal to form fe co alloy the main crystalline mineral of fe co biochar was fe co alloy with diffraction 2θ peaks at 25 3 57 3 and 63 9 corresponding to 006 511 and 440 19 meanwhile for fe co biochar and co biochar the characteristic peaks at 51 5 and 76 8 could be ascribed to the 200 and 211 crystalline facets of co2o3 however no clear characteristic peak corresponding to co was observed the carbon structure and crystallinity of metallic co can be easily adjusted due to the temperature dependence 20 in summary it could be seen that the xrd pattern of fe co biochar contained common features of the xrd patterns of fe biochar and co biochar indicating that the crystal structure of fe biochar and co biochar were partially preserved in fe co biochar ft ir spectrums indicated that the four catalysts obtained similar ft ir adsorption bands fig 2b the frequency ranges from 3400 to 3600 cm 1 mainly corresponding to stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups oh the characteristic bands at 1600 cm 1 were attribute to the aromatic stretching vibration of cc co 21 compared with biochar the absorption band peaks of the other three catalysts were red shifted which could be attributed to the formation of coordination bonds between fe co and biochar organic ligands at the same time the broad band peaks between 700 cm 1 and 610 cm 1 on the three catalysts were associated with feo feoh stretching vibrations which indicated that the presence of amorphous feo or fe oh 3 18 notably fe co biochar obtained higher intensity adsorption bands compared to other biochar catalysts that indicating the increase of metal hydroxyl groups and surface groups 22 meanwhile those results also indicated that the fe and co were combined with biochar primarily through coordination with both carboxyl and hydroxyl ligands at the biochar surface obviously the bet isotherm of biochar and fe co biochar catalysts displayed a reversible type iv mesoporous capillary condensation type isotherm with h3 type prominent hysteresis loop fig s5a the pore size distribution is mainly in the range of 2 10 nm fig s5b which is one of the primary features of mesoporous materials indicating the existence of narrow slit shaped pores 14 according to the multipoint bet model it is known that the smaller specific surface area of the other catalysts compared to biochar was due to the deposition of fe and co it is further explained that the pore volume obtained for fe co biochar 0 082 cm3 g was lower than that of biochar 0 170 cm3 g table s3 based on the above results it was speculated that there may be some fe and co metals embedded in the pores of biochar the surface composition and valence band states of fresh fe co biochar were investigated by xps peaks of co 2p fe 2p o 1s and c 1s could be detected in the survey spectrum fig s6 corresponding to the bonding energy at 804 ev 711 ev 532 ev and 285 ev respectively the characteristic peaks of 288 9 ev 286 6 ev and 284 6 ev for co co and cc cc respectively are the main components of the catalyst surface fig 3a this was due to the structure of the biochar was not significantly changed in the catalysts 1 the o1s spectrum of fe co biochar contained coh 536 1 ev oco 533 3 ev feo 530 3 ev and coo 531 5 ev the abundant oxygen functional groups on the surface of biochar make it easy to bond with metals in the fe 2p co 2p spectrum fig 3c d two valence states of iron were observed fe iii or co iii had the binging energy of 716 5 ev and 727 6 ev 788 4 ev and 804 1 ev and fe ii or co ii had the binding energy of 712 9 ev and 724 6 ev 782 6 ev and 797 0 ev the spin orbit component of the shaking satellite demonstrated the coexistence of co ii and co iii fe ii and fe iii which indicated the formation of co3o4 and fe3o4 on the surface of biochar the metals in fe co biochar catalyst contained various valence states which led to its good oxidation reduction ability 3 2 exploring the catalytic ozonation process to evaluate the catalytic activity of the catalyst for o3 batch experiments were conducted to test the degradation of pollutants by btcw under different modes through different operations figs 4a b s7 catalytic oxidation degradation stage the removal efficiency of toc by o3 reaction alone was 7 40 the removal efficiency of toc by biochar was 9 18 which showed that the unmodified biochar did not have high catalytic activity for ozonation of btcw by adding fe biochar co biochar and fe co biochar respectively in the o3 reactor as synthetic materials the degradation efficiency was increased to 28 72 34 10 and 44 85 fig 4a the fe co ratio in the fe co biochar catalyst was 1 2 and the sum of the degradation efficiency of fe biochar and co biochar was 32 3 according to the ratio which was lower than that of fe co biochar 44 85 indicating that fe and co in fe co biochar had a good synergistic effect among these systems the fe co biochar o3 system has the highest cod removal rate in btcw which was 71 80 while the removal rate of uv254 could reach 64 40 fig 4b therefore a considerable synergy between fe co biochar and o3 was achieved in the degradation of pollutants in btcw which implied that fe co biochar presented high activity in the catalytic ozonation providing more active sites for o3 decomposition and catalyzing the production of more free radicals that preferentially attack organic pollutants bound to it the adsorption and removal efficiencies of btcw for toc in the biochar fe biochar co biochar and fe co biochar systems were 4 21 3 52 2 58 and 1 53 respectively which were attributed to the adsorption capacity of the catalysts fig s7 fig s8 showed that the prepared catalysts were able to adsorb toc rapidly and reached the adsorption equilibrium within the 10 min however the amount of adsorption varied slightly from one catalyst to another depending on the specific surface area and pore structure of the catalysts which was in good agreement with the results of the n2 adsorption solution isotherm combining the two operations in different modes for catalytic ozone removal from btcw wastewater it could be found that adsorption played a small role in the catalytic degradation process and therefore adsorption is not discussed separately in the subsequent part of this paper in order to further analyze the variations in the catalytic oxidation degradation process of toc in different modes first and second order kinetic models were fitted table s4 could be obtained by the following eqs 1 and 2 1 pseudo first order ln toc toc 0 k obs 1 t 2 pseudo second order 1 toc 1 toc 0 k obs 2 t where k obs 1 min 1 and k obs 2 min 1 were the reaction rate constants of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models respectively according to fig 4c d the fitting results of the two models showed that the degradation reaction was divided into two parts with different rate constants k obs for the correlation coefficient r2 comparison the r2 of the second order kinetics was slightly higher the first order kinetic model which showing a better correlation with the performed experiments it was evident that the high value of k obs in the first 5 min in the different models was owing to the degradation of simple organic matter in the btcw regarding the second order model the parameter k obs for the first linear part of the reaction increased from 4 983 10 5 min 1 by o3 alone to 1 450 10 3 min 1 by the fe co biochar o3 system indicating that the fe co biochar o3 system degraded the colored and simple compounds however the difference was that the parameter k obs of the second linear part of the reaction was lower compared to the first part indicating that was the process of degradation of recalcitrant compounds the fe co biochar o3 system was confirmed to have a great potential in terms of degradation of recalcitrant compounds in wastewater as the k obs increased from 2 108 10 5 min 1 by o3 alone to 9 877 10 5 min 1 by the fe co biochar o3 system the first order kinetic parameters also showed similar results the dominant mechanism for the degradation damage of organic matter during catalytic process was attributed to the generation of free radicals during the decomposition of o3 on the surface of fe co biochar solids 3 3 effect of operational condition on the fe co biochar catalytic ozonation the catalytic activity of fe co biochar during ozonation strongly depended on the ratio of fe and co figs 5a s9a when the fe co loading ratio was increased from 1 1 to 1 2 the degradation of btcw was significantly improved with 44 85 removal of toc 71 80 removal of cod and 64 40 removal of uv254 this may be due to cobalt dopants activating adjacent fe co active sites thereby reducing the energy barrier the doping of co leads to higher energy transfer from the d band center of the fe active point while the d band center of co was transferred to a lower energy transfer which becomes the activator of the fe site and the synergistic activity of fe co biochar was enhanced by co and fe and the co site synergistically enhances the catalytic activity of fe co biochar 3 when the component ratio was increased to 1 2 5 the removal efficiency of toc cod and uv254 in the btcw catalytic ozonation process was not significant this may be due to excessive metal coverage which blocked the active catalytic sites of biochar and reduced the mass transfer phenomenon 1 in order to improve the economy of the material itself secondary contamination caused by excessive metal leaching should be prevented fe co biochar composite with fe co loading ratio of 1 2 was chosen for subsequent experiments different catalyst concentrations 0 00 0 50 mg l could also have effect on catalytic ozonation figs 5b s9b with the concentration of fe co biochar increased the removal rate of contaminants trended to increase which owing to the increase of adsorption sites resulting in enhanced adsorption properties meanwhile the increase of catalytic sites in the system such as hydroxyl and lewis s acid sites on the surface of fe and co produced more active species 23 the degradation of pollutants in btcw was not obvious when the concentration of fe co biochar was further increased to 1 00 mg l which could be explained by the limited ozonolysis capacity of btcw and the competition between excess fe ii co ii in the system and btcw for the available oxidant the effect of ph change on the degradation of btcw was investigated since the ph of the system affects the o3 oxidation mechanism figs 5c s9c the removal rate of toc increased from 7 30 to 50 11 fig 5c cod increased from 13 80 to 75 00 and uv254 from 14 99 to 69 99 when the ph was increased from 3 0 to 9 0 fig s9c the above results might be attributed to the fact that under acidic conditions the ionization of carboxyl groups such as carboxyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups on the surface of the activated carbon was inhibited and the neutral state was maintained 24 alkaline conditions promoted ionization of activated carbon surface groups and phenolic compounds in the btcw 25 moreover indicating that the abundance of oh could enhance the generation of oh and degradation of organic pollutants at high ph 26 in addition in the degradation process of btcw the ph value of all solutions in the process of o3 oxidation was greatly reduced resulting in the accumulation of organic acids and the unstable existence of some catalyzed free radicals and slowing down the degradation efficiency 27 since the initial ph value of raw btcw ranged from 7 3 to 8 8 the removal rate of toc cod and uv254 from btcw was not significantly increased during catalytic ozonation when the initial ph was adjusted to 9 0 considering the acid base pollution and water treatment cost no extra additional ph adjustment was required in the experiment o3 concentration played a crucial role in the fe co biochar o3 system therefore the effect of o3 concentration on the degradation of btcw was investigated fig 5d the removal efficiency of toc increased with increasing o3 concentration which might be due to the generation of more derived radicals with increasing o3 concentration according to eqs 3 5 28 the toc removal efficiency only increased by 1 90 when the o3 concentration increased from 10 mg l to 15 mg l showing that higher o3 concentration was not always conducive to the improvement of toc removal there was no significant trend of increase in cod and uv254 removal fig s9d since o3 molecule could also react with oh to produce o2 and h2o whereas excess o3 would compete with pollutants and react with free radicals resulting in the consumption of oxidants 29 the o3 concentration of 10 mg l was used as the optimal condition o3 utilization efficiency is calculated by the formula r o 3 0 o 3 i o 3 0 100 where o3 0 and o3 i represent the total amount of the initial o3 mg and the total dose of end o3 mg respectively the o3 utilization efficiency in the reaction process is shown in fig s10 the decreasing trend of ozone utilization is due to the difficulty of o3 degradation for some recalcitrant organics in the subsequent reaction process however the o3 utilization in the o3 alone system decreases faster than that in the fe co biochar system due to the addition of catalysts that catalyze the o3 decomposition to produce more reactive oxide species 3 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 4 ho 2 o 2 h 5 o 3 h 2 o oh oh o 2 in the catalytic ozonation degradation of btcw fe co biochar was compared with other catalysts and their removal capability was shown in table 1 which revealed that the fe co biochar o3 system has excellent degradation performance for btcw 3 4 catalyst magnetic reusability and stability from the perspective of the application the key characteristics of a catalyst are its magnetic reusability and stability to study magnetism the hysteresis regression line of fe co biochar was recorded at room temperature fig s11 the saturation magnetization of fe co biochar is ms 14 25 emu g due to the formation of some fe and co oxides the sample shows magnetism but the magnetism is not high because fe co metal elements combine with each other to form fe co alloy or part of the iron cobalt oxide is reduced by carbon to metal elements or synthetic metal carbides 18 the stability of the catalyst was studied and the toc leaching amount of fe co biochar in ultrapure water was tested the leaching amount of toc reached equilibrium in about 30 min which was 1 38 mg l fig s8 and the leached iron and cobalt concentrations in solution ranged from 0 143 to 0 441 mg l and 0 220 0 545 mg l respectively fig 6b the removal efficiency of toc decreased from 44 85 to 38 46 after four cycles under the selected conditions fig 6a and the results indicated that the fe co biochar still maintained good catalytic activity in the reuse tests in addition the removal rate of toc decreased slightly probably due to the decrease in the number of active sites on the catalyst surface which reduced the o3 decomposition rate and resulted in a lower mineralization rate since the coordination bonds between metal atoms and ligands were easily broken during catalytic ozonation by the catalyst the crystalline structure and functional group structure of the fe co biochar catalysts before and after the reaction was also analyzed by means of xrd and ft ir characterization fig s12 the xrd results showed that the fe co biochar retained most of the characteristic diffraction peaks after recovery but the disappearance of weak peaks indicated that the oxidation system slightly broke the structure of the catalyst at the same time most of the functional groups on ft ir were not destroyed only some of the strength was weakened these results further proved that the fe co biochar catalyst possessed some stability and regeneration 3 5 degradation mechanism of fe co biochar catalytic ozonation combined with the above analysis the advanced oxidation treatment of btcw by fe co biochar catalytic ozonation was proved to be effectively the degradation mechanism of fe co biochar catalytic ozonation for refractory organic matter was revealed based on the analysis of intermediates and free radicals generated during the catalytic ozonation process it was well known that oh o2 and 1o2 were the possible free radicals generated by catalytic ozonation 5 5 dimethyl 2 oxopyrroline 1 oxyl dmpox and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone tempo were used as free radical capturing agents to generate dmpo oh dmpo o2 and tempo 1o2 which were detected by epr in fe co biochar o3 system the signal of dmpox was detected which was the product of further oxidation of dmpo oh fig 7a it was indicated that fe co biochar could catalyze o3 to generate oh meanwhile the typical tempo 1o2 triplet peak could be detected in fe co biochar o3 system and the characteristic signal of dmpo and o2 reaction products could also be detected in fe co biochar o3 system indicating that fe co biochar could catalyst o3 to produce o2 in general epr test results showed that fe co biochar catalyzed o3 to produce o2 and oh and greatly promoted the formation of 1o2 to further explore the fe co biochar catalytic oxidation the concentration of reactive oxygen species in the fe co biochar o3 system was identified in which the oh can almost react with solvent the rate constant is generally 108 1010 leading to the concentration of oh in water is generally small with 10 6 μmol l the concentration of hydroxyl radicals by adding fe co biochar oh concentration starts to reach 0 129 μmol l due to the burst of radicals as well as consumption finally the concentration decreases to 2 85 10 3 μmol l and maintains this concentration level at 40 min after the reaction the concentration of o2 was stabilized at the level of 106 3 μmol l fig 7b the results indicate that o2 are the main active species in the fe co biochar o3 system according to previous studies in the process of ozone catalysis by typical biochar the electron rich carbonyl group has a certain catalytic active site on the surface of biochar which can accelerate the decomposition of ozone to produce a certain o2 and the carbonyl group is oxidized to oh 33 but it is found that in heterogeneous o3 catalyzed reactions variable valence metal ions and oxygen containing groups on the surface were the active sites of catalysts and electron transfer was a key step in the catalytic process as shown in eqs 6 8 fe co biochar could efficiently catalyze the decomposition of o3 to produce oh o2 and 1o2 the adsorption sites in the surface of the catalyst facilitated the generation of free radicals by o3 oxidation decomposition which promoted to adsorb enrich and degrade the pollutants in the wastewater considering the standard reduction potentials e0 co iii co ii 1 81 v e0 fe iii fe ii 0 77 v and e0 o3 o2 2 07 v o3 could oxidize the catalyst surface fe ii co ii to fe iii co iii however the catalyst surface fe ii could reduce the co iii to co ii thus forming fe iii or co ii 34 the valence state cycle of the metal ions formed by fe ii co ii and fe iii co iii promoted the decomposition of o3 and organic matter 6 fe ii co ii 2o 3 2h 2 o fe iii co iii oh 3 oh 2 o 2 7 o 3 fe iii co iii oh fe iii co iii o 2 ho 2 8 fe iii co iii 2 ho 2 fe ii co ii 2o 2 2h organic compounds usually had characteristic absorption bands in the uv response region and uv254 could reflect the important indexes of humus organics and aromatic compounds in water 35 as shown in fig 8 the uv visible absorption of o3 and fe co biochar o3 system was getting weaker and weaker compared with non catalyst within the absorption wavelength 225 400 nm and uv254 was significantly decreased indicating that the response of monocyclic aromatic compounds heterocyclic aromatic compounds polycyclic aromatic compounds chromogenic groups auxiliary color groups and unsaturated organic substances of btcw were significantly degraded the absorption peaks of fe co biochar o3 treatment system were all significantly reduced which demonstrated that these high risk pollutants were effectively removed the addition of fe co biochar could destroy unsaturated functional groups more efficiently and the uv254 removal rate increased from 14 60 in o3 degradation alone to 64 40 with an efficiency gain of 49 80 in the catalytic system the generation of reactive oxidizing substances was more favorable for the ring opening reaction and thus the corresponding reduction in uv absorption intensity was more pronounced 36 3d eems spectra can provide detailed information on fluorophores in btcw including the location movement and intensity of the fluorescence peaks without destroying the structure of the organics the 3d eems spectra before and after being treated by fe co biochar catalytic ozonation were shown in fig 9 two distinct peaks were detected before being treated by the catalytic ozonation fig 9a region a ex em 300 375 nm 400 500 nm was the fluorescence peak region of land source humic acid 27 and region b ex em 237 250 nm 450 500 nm was the fluorescence peak region of fulvic acid moreover the fluorescence intensity of land source humic acid was greater indicating a higher concentration after 40 min of catalytic reaction fig 9b the fluorescence peak a and b disappeared humic acid like organic compounds or functional groups generated in btcw were destroyed by o3 catalytic reaction in fluorescence response which was attributed to the fact that most of the above mentioned fluorescence characteristic substances contained benzene rings connected to electron donating functional groups such as amine groups hydroxyl groups etc 36 this resulted in the high reactive activity of reactive oxidizing substances and o3 3 6 economic analysis as we all know a large amount of sludge is generated during industrial wastewater treatment and the cost of sludge treatment is higher for the current conventional sludge treatment process the cost of sludge incineration is about 400 500 cny t 4 to explore the potential of this catalyst for industrial application we calculated the electricity and chemical consumption required in the preparation of this catalyst and compared it with the catalyst cost in the literature tables s5 s6 the price of catalyst preparation in the statistical literature was 0 9 2 5 cny t waste water and the price considering the cod degradation effect was 7 7 11 7 cny kg cod see table s6 for the prices of different catalysts it is much higher than the catalyst prices in this study 0 9 cny t waste water 7 7 cny kg cod some catalysts despite their low preparation cost have poor catalytic effect i e low cod degradation per unit cost the catalysts in this study have more potential for industrial application current statistics show that biochar prepared from sludge sells in the market for about 1120 1499 cny t and the ozone catalysts prepared in this study can generate some positive benefits when sold in the market economic analysis shows that biochar doped with metal catalyzed o3 can degrade btcw in water at a lower cost and has the potential for large scale use 4 conclusions in this work the mineral elements and pahs in coking sludge were to generate biochar with high ion exchange capacity and abundant functional groups then fe and co were doped to prepare functionalized biochar cleaner production was achieved while btcw pollution residue problems were solved the catalytic function of transition metal ions depends on interfacial unsaturated valence bonds and the multi elemental mixed crystals e field effect providing a cyclic mechanism for redox reactions of cyclic compounds within the adsorption pore channel o3 was activated by fe ii fe iii and co ii co iii cycles and then oh o2 and 1o2 were generated which effectively destroyed the pollution in btcw including pahs and humic substances the catalyst has excellent performance and lower than market cost which is competitive for engineering applications this study provides a reference for btcw and sludge

12697,powdered activated carbon pac was frequently used for removing musty and septic odor causing compounds in water matrix however it is not known if pac is effective on removing various aldehyde odorants in this study the treatability of fourteen aldehyde odorants by pac adsorption was evaluated comprehensively the results indicated that most aldehyde odorants removal rates could reach 90 after 0 5 h exposure while adsorption kinetic was better fitted for pseudo second order model and adsorption capacity was better fitted with freundlich model however adsorption predictions from these models which neglected olfactory threshold concentration otc were unsuitable for evaluating that odor caused by aldehyde odorant could be controlled effectively or not therefore treatability value which considered residual concentration and otc was calculated the result of 0 3 0 67 suggested they could be removed below otc effectively by pac adsorption furthermore the effect of aldehyde odorant s property on adsorption and treatability was studied through pearson and spearman correlation analysis the results indicated that there were not significant correlations between adsorption capacity and aldehyde odorants properties comparatively speaking treatability had significant and positive correlations with aldehyde odorants properties including molar refractivity mr octanal and water logkw parachar polarizability and volume r 0 860 0 942 p 0 000 suggesting that odorant with larger volume more hydrophobic higher mr and polarizability would be adsorbed by pac easily this is the first study for evaluating adsorption of multiple aldehyde odorants onto pac completely which would supply more understanding for controlling aldehyde odorants in drinking water treatment plant dwtp graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aldehyde odorant powdered activated carbon adsorption treatability evaluation odorant property data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction odors and corresponding odor causing compounds in drinking water have become one of primary problems concerned by consumers and were unacceptable for drinking water treatment plant dwtp which even cause public panic in emergency odor accidents in recent years 1 5 among taste and odor investigations of drinking water sources among thirty one cities across china 6 10 musty odor was detected with intensity range of 2 6 and mainly caused by 2 methylisoborneol and geosmin detected concentration 10 60 ng l septic odor was detected with intensity of 2 6 and mainly caused by thiorther compounds detected concentration 10 120 ng l chemical odor was detected with intensity of 2 6 and mainly caused by benzenes phenols etc detected concentration 80 960 ng l fishy and grassy odors were detected with intensity of 2 8 and mainly associated with aldehyde compounds detected concentration 50 890 ng l 6 10 there are complex odors and odorants in drinking water which lead to severe challenge for purifying water in dwtp among detected odors in drinking water fishy odor grassy odor and relating aldehyde odorants have been further focused in recent years 11 13 musty and septic odors usually occurred in eutrophic waters at warm seasons just as summer and autumn 14 however fishy and grassy odors caused by aldehyde odorants were more detected in meso oligotrophic water matrix systems in spring and winter with low water temperature 15 it is well known that most odorants were hardly removed through conventional water treatment processes including coagulation sedimentation sand filtration and disinfection usually advanced treatment technologies including advanced oxidation adsorption biodegradation membrane separation were effective on controlling odors 16 18 however aldehyde odorants including 2 butenal 3 methylbutanal 2 4 decadienal etc could be generated through oxidation process and certain biological treatment process 9 19 which brings more challenge for removing fishy and grassy odors in dwtp powdered activated carbon pac adsorption was frequently used for removing musty septic odors and corresponding odorants 20 21 however thioether compound responsible for septic odor could not be removed below its olfactory threshold concentration otc in the range of 10 30 ng l by pac adsorption effectively 20 while otc means threshold concentration that humans can detect olfactory odor in water matrix this suggested effluent of drinking water including thioether compound after pac adsorption was still appearing residual septic odor this also indicated that odors control effectively not only depended on odorant s adsorption capacity but also involved with odorant s otc therefore otc of corresponding odorant should be considered for measuring whether removal technology is effective or not on removing odors when residual concentration of corresponding odorant after removal technology is lower than its otc suggesting odorant is removed effectively and no residual odor exists in effluent after removal technology while residual concentration of corresponding odorant after removal technology is higher than its otc suggesting this removal technology could not control odor effectively 20 21 in view of big differences among various odorants otcs treatability method which considered adsorption capacity and distinct otc had been used for evaluating whether odor problem could be controlled effectively through pac adsorption the results indicated 2 methylisoborneol and geosmin could be removed below otc by pac adsorption while dimethyl disulfide and diethyl disulfide could not be treated below otc through pac adsorption 20 for improving adsorption characteristic adsorption of musty septic odorants and effect of pac properties on adsorption characteristic were mainly focused in previous studies usually higher odorants adsorption could be obtained from pac with high surface area 828 1158 m2 g and micropore volumes 0 32 0 45 cm3 g in most cases 22 26 however there were few studies focused on the effect of odorant s property on adsorption characteristic some study indicated hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of chemical compounds were relating with pac adsorption characteristic and compound with higher hydrophobicity could obtain higher adsorption capacity 18 20 in addition related influence properties of aldehyde odorants on pac adsoption were rarely studied compared with those of musty septic odorants adsorption while previous studies were mainly focused on the effect of pac properties on adsorption capacity of musty septic odorants 24 28 therefore it is necessary to clarify adsorption characteristics of aldehyde odorants by pac which could be helpful for aldehyde odorants removal in dwtp in this paper pac adsorption characteristics of fourteen aldehyde odorants which were frequently detected in drinking water source and responsible for grassy and fishy odors were studied comprehensively these fourteen aldehyde odorants included pentanal hexanal heptanal octanal nonanal decanal undecanal 2 octenal 2 4 heptadienal benzaldehyde 2 6 nonadienal β cyclocitral 2 4 octadienal and 2 4 decadienal usually pseudo first order and pseudo second order were the optimal models used for fitting pac adsorption kinetic while freundlich and langmuir were the optimal models used for fitting pac adsorption capacity in previous studies 18 20 22 considering that pac adsorption of aldehyde odorants in this study pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were conducted for analyzing adsorption kinetic of aldehyde odorants freundlich and langmuir models were fitted for clarifying adsorption capacity additionally treatability of these fourteen aldehyde odorants which considered otc marginal effect and adsorption performance were evaluated meanwhile key odorants influence properties on adsorption characteristics were explored through pearson and spearman correlation analysis this study would be helpful for mitigation of odors caused by aldehyde odorants in dwtps and providing more insights into pac adsorption of aldehyde odorants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents as shown in table s1 aldehyde compounds including pentanal hexanal heptanal octanal nonanal decanal undecanal 2 octenal 2 4 heptadienal benzaldehyde 2 6 nonadienal β cyclocitral 2 4 octadienal and 2 4 decadienal were purchased from sigma aldrich co usa at chromatographically purity methanol acetone and dichloromethane at chromatographically purity were purchased from anpel inc china anhydrous na2so4 and nacl were purchased from sinopharm chemicals ltd china at guaranteed reagent purity grade and heated at 450 c for 2 h before use for removing potential micropollutants completely 6 11 stock solutions of 1000 mg l and 100 mg l are conducted by diluting odorants standards using methanol ultrapure deionized water 18 mω cm was produced through a milli q purification system the coal based pac with low cost which was bought from tianjin beichen company china and commonly used in dwtp was adopted for adsorption experiments the point of zero charge of pac was 10 06 fig s1 which was analyzed through indirect titration method 29 the surface areas and pore size distributions of pac samples were characterized by nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms fig 1 its specific surface area total pore volume micro pore volume mesopore volume iodine value and methylene blue number were 981 m2 g 0 613 cm3 g 0 407 cm3 g 0 196 cm3 g 950 mg g 280 mg g respectively the stock solution was prepared by dispersing 1 g pac in 1 l ultrapure deionized water 2 2 adsorption experiments adsorption experiments were conducted with pac dosages from 0 to 100 mg l in 250 ml conical flasks since there are wide differences among otcs of aldehyde odorants just as the otc of 2 4 octadienal 10 μg l is two orders of magnitude higher than that of 2 6 nonadienal 0 08 μg l it is irrational for evaluating and comparing odorants adsorption and removal characteristics at same initial concentrations therefore the initial concentration was approximately 20 50 times of corresponding otc rather than a unified concentration which could avoid the phenomenon that odorant with high otc might decrease below otc more easily aldehyde odorants spiked in ultrapure deionized water were used for adsorption kinetic and capacity experiments to avoid interference of water matrix and making this study more focused on aldehyde odorants themselves pac was usually used for emergency odor treatment for drinking water source and added in water intake of water source for adsorbing odorants completely in the process of transporting water to dwtp 16 22 therefore adsorption time was 5 h in this study considering most unfavorable water treatment conditions in the adsorption isotherm study the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe μg mg was adopted for fitting model the qe was calculated as follows 1 q e c 0 c e d where c0 μg l was initial concentration of aldehyde odorant ce μg l was the equilibrium concentration corresponding to specific pac dosage and d mg l was the dosage of pac the experimental data were fitted by kinetic models including pseudo first order and pseudo second order and equilibrium models including langmuir and freundlich the pseudo first order model was written as 2 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where qe μg mg was the equilibrium adsorption capacity t was adsorption time qt μg mg was adsorption capacity when time was t k1 was the pseudo first order rate constant 30 31 the pseudo second order model was written as 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qe μg mg was the equilibrium adsorption capacity t was adsorption time qt μg mg was adsorption capacity when time was t k2 was the pseudo second order rate constant 30 31 the langmuir model was written as 4 q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e where qe μg mg was the equilibrium adsorption capacity kl l mg was langmuir isotherm constant related to free energy of adsorption qm μg mg was the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity ce μg l was the equilibrium concentration corresponding to specific pac dosage 30 31 the freundlich model was written as 5 q e k f c e 1 n where qe μg mg was the equilibrium adsorption capacity ce μg l was the equilibrium concentration corresponding to specific pac dosage kf μg1 1 n l1 n mg and n were freundlich isotherm constants suggesting relative adsorption capacity and intensity respectively 30 31 2 3 odorant analysis the aldehyde odorants concentrations were determined by combining headspace solid phase microextraction spme with gas chromatography with mass spectrometry gc ms 12 15 at the end of adsorption experiment suspension was withdrawn by an injection syringe and filtered through a glass fiber membrane 1 2 μm whatman gf c uk before analyzing odorants and 10 ml water sample added 3 g nacl was adopted for analyzing odorants the spme procedure was as follows the fiber car pdms supelco was placed in headspace of water sample bottle which was extracted 30 min with water temperature of 60 c then extracted spme fiber was injected into the injector port of gc ms while odorants adsorbed on spme fiber could be desorbed thermally at 250 c the desorbed time was 2 5 min the gc ms parameters were as follows the inlet temperature was 250 c the temperature programming of column oven 40 c with 3 min then increased to 240 c at a rate of 8 c min 240 c was holding 5 min ionization voltage was 70 ev ion source temperature was 230 c and selective ion mode sim was adopted in this study other detailed parameters and conditions could be found in supporting information table s2 and fig s2 and previous studies 12 15 parallel water samples were analyzed in each batch and aldehyde odorants concentrations were averaged in the duplicate analyses 2 4 treatability evaluation for evaluating adsorption effect of aldehyde odorants by pac the treatability parameter t dimensionless was adopted it was obtained as follows 6 t otc c ip otc where cip is the residual odorant s concentration at the inflection point μg l 20 if t value of aldehyde odorant was between zero and one indicating that corresponding odorant could be removed effectively by pac adsorption and t value was close to one suggesting aldehyde odorant could be removed by pac more completely if t value was below zero indicating corresponding odorant could not be removed below otc by pac adsorption the more negative values implied the worse removal performance 20 2 5 correlation analysis between treatability adsorption capacity and aldehyde odorant property for clarifying effect of odorants properties on adsorption performance pearson and spearman correlation analyses were conducted between aldehydes odorants properties octanal and water logkw volume solubility dipole molar refractivity mr parachor surface tension polarizability and adsorption characteristics t and adsorption capacity logqe the pearson and spearman correlation analyses were achieved by ibm spss statistics 26 0 the pearson correlation was written as 7 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where r was person correlation coefficient n was the number of variables x and y were average value of x and y respectively 20 the spearman correlation was written as 8 r 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where r was spearman correlation coefficient n was the total number of variables di was the rank difference of two column pairs of variables 20 3 results and discussion pore size distribution of pac was shown in fig 1a micro pore volume mesopore volume total pore volume were 0 407 cm3 g 0 196 cm3 g 0 613 cm3 g respectively usually iodine value and methylene blue number were used for evaluating pac adsorption effect however these two parameters were not sufficient for analyzing adsorption equilibrium and mechanism comprehensively more parameters including micro pore volume mesopore volume total pore volume specific surface area should be taken into account in practical engineering application particularly micro pore volume had been considered to be the more important reference parameter measuring adsorption characteristics in practical applications 24 28 fig 1b indicated adsorption desorption isotherms obtained by nitrogen adsorbing capacity increased drastically at the beginning and adsorption rate was fast adsorbing capacity increased slowly following relative pressure keeping growing the final adsorption isotherms were not leveled off because of macropore and mesopore existing in pac as shown in fig 2 residual concentrations of fourteen aldehyde odorants decreased gradually accompanying with pac dosage increase there were big differences among otcs of aldehyde odorants therefore comparing adsorption performance of these odorants with same initial concentration was unreasonable although initial concentrations of some odorants were almost same the pac dosages for inflection points of aldehyde odorants were quite different suggesting some odorants might be adsorbed more easily than other odorants just like adsorption processes of heptanal and 2 octenal the initial concentrations were both 90 μg l however the pac dosage for decreasing odorant s concentration below otc inflection point were 25 mg l heptanal and 10 mg l 2 octenal respectively this indicated that 2 octenal should be adsorbed and removed more easily than heptanal which was consistent with treatability evaluation result while t value of 2 octenal 0 5 was higher than that of heptanal 0 33 as shown in table 1 adsorption kinetic capacity and treatability will be elaborated in the following sections 3 1 adsorption kinetic of aldehyde odorants the ph of water sample used for adsorption experiment varied from 6 80 to 7 20 the final ph of water sample after adsorption varied from 8 21 to 8 70 as shown in fig 3 the equilibrium time of adsorbing fourteen aldehyde odorants by pac was relatively fast while removal rates of most odorants could be reached to 90 after exposure time of 0 5 h theoretically there were three steps in the kinetics process first external mass transfer means the adsorbate transferred between bulk fluid and adsorbent s surface second intraparticle diffusion means the access of adsorbate into adsorbent s pores then diffusion among pores third adsorption reaction means mass action at phase boundaries 23 32 in physical adsorption the last step is very fast and the adsorption process is depending on external mass transfer or intraparticle diffusion 18 based on these steps pseudo first order model and the pseudo second order model have been used for describing or predicting adsorption kinetics the measured and modeled adsorption kinetic parameters are summarized in table s3 the correlation coefficients r of pseudo first order models for aldehyde odorants except heptanal nonanal undecanal 2 4 decadienal were higher than 0 8 and r of pseudo second order models for all aldehyde odorants were higher than 0 8 comparing r of pseudo first order and pseudo second order models table s3 the r of pseudo second order models for most aldehyde odorants were higher than those of pseudo first order models indicating adsorption kinetics of most aldehyde odorants were better fitted for pseudo second order models except 2 6 nonadienal was suitable for pseudo first order model with r of 0 989 the adsorption driving force of pseudo first order and pseudo second order model derived from difference between the average concentration of compound adsorbed onto pac at certain time and the equilibrium concentration qe in water matrix 18 the adsorption rate was proportional to the driving force in the pseudo first order model and square of the driving force in the pseudo second order model as a whole pseudo first order model primarily simulated fast adsorption because of lack of reactions between adsorbent and adsorbate 33 while pseudo second order model was usually the complicated multi steps action and adsorption process 18 as shown in fig 3 and table s3 the adsorptions of most aldehyde odorants were complicated multi steps action and adsorption process hence most adsorption cases in this study were better suitable for pseudo second order models 3 2 adsorption capacity of aldehyde odorants to further explore the essence of adsorption equilibrium the isotherm curves were fitted with two adsorption models including freundlich and langmuir as shown in fig 4 the calculated parameters and correlation coefficient r2 for these models were listed in table s4 all adsorption isotherms were well fitted with freundlich and langmuir models for all aldehyde odorants while r2 for all odorants were above 0 956 as table s4 showed the maximum adsorption capacity qm for each aldehyde odorant was predicted through langmuir model it should be noted that the qm of undecanal and 2 4 octadienal predicted from langmuir model were 35 23 μg mg and 156 18 μg mg respectively which were much higher than those of 2 6 nonadienal 7 14 μg mg and 2 4 decadienal 9 86 μg mg nevertheless the residual concentrations of 2 6 nonadienal 0 05 μg l and 2 4 decadienal 0 1 μg l were much lower than those of undecanal 3 6 μg l and 2 4 octadienal 4 5 μg l even pac dosages reached 30 mg l while pac dosages for 2 6 nonadienal and 2 4 decadienal were 10 mg l and 20 mg l respectively to reduce their concentrations below corresponding otcs these results indicated that qm of aldehyde odorants did not match the visual data as shown in fig 2 and fig 4 suggesting qm from langmuir model was not reliable for predicting the actual adsorption capacity and treatability of various aldehyde odorants by pac 20 the freundlich model was also conducted to explore adsorption characteristics of aldehyde odorants it should be noted that adsorption isotherm curves were perfectly fitted with freundlich model r2 0 967 which seemed a good predictability of freundlich model generally speaking kf value of freundlich model indicates the adsorption capacity while 1 n value indicates adsorption intensity and favorability 18 nevertheless there were contradictions among results judging from kf and 1 n values as shown in table s4 2 4 octadienal undecanal and benzaldehyde had high kf values and low 1 n values higher kf values mean larger adsorption capacity and lower 1 n value means odorant is not easy to be adsorbed 18 20 suggesting adsorption capacity and favorability of aldehyde odorants by pac were not consistent and this was not consistent with results shown in fig 2 as well therefore freundlich model was also not suitable for evaluating aldehyde odorants treatability in conclusion only adsorption capacities predicted by langmuir and freundlich models were not enough to evaluate aldehyde odorants treatability the langmuir model supposed a monolayer adsorption onto a surface of uniform energy and no transfer of adsorbate on adsorbent surface 21 34 the freundlich model assumed that the stronger binding sites are occupied first then the binding strength decreases with increasing site occupation degree which are based on the hypothesis of heterogeneous adsorbent surface energy or heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces 20 34 the overall results indicated that most adsorption processes for aldehyde odorants were fitted with langmuir and freundlich model however some langmuir and freundlich isotherm curves of aldehyde odorants were not leveling off therefore langmuir model may only predict the qm of each odorant through an empirical formula suggesting the predicted qm values might not be reliable additionally there were contradictions among the judgements from kf and 1 n values in freundlich model thus langmuir and freundlich models might not be the best choices to assess the treatability of aldehyde odorants 20 for evaluating odorants treatability effectively the otc of aldehyde odorant should be also considered besides adsorption capacity the comprehensive method which assess odorants treatability by comparing residual concentration at inflection point and otc was further studied in the following section 3 3 the treatability evaluation for aldehyde odorants as shown in fig 2 the residual concentrations of fourteen aldehyde odorants gradually decreased and then leveled off as pac dosage increased there are inflection points in these curves at which the decreasing trend starts to flatten generally speaking the inflection point of a differentiable function for the variable was the point in the chart where the second derivative of corresponding function was zero thus the inflection point of residual concentration curve was acquired by getting second derivative of corresponding curve table 1 indicated the treatability parameters of aldehyde odorants as a whole the concentrations of fourteen aldehyde odorants could be reduced below their corresponding otcs through pac adsorption in this study the order of aldehyde odorants on the basis of their treatability was listed as follows 2 4 decadienal 0 67 β cyclocitral 0 65 decanal 0 6 undecanal 0 6 nonanal 0 58 2 4 octadienal 0 55 2 6 nonadienal 0 55 2 octenal 0 5 octanal 0 4 heptanal 0 33 benzaldehyde 0 32 pentanal 0 31 2 4 heptadienal 0 31 hexanal 0 3 however the pac dosages corresponding to inflection point concentration of aldehyde odorants were significantly different as shown in fig 2 and table 1 the maximum pac dosage was 30 mg l which was corresponding to pentanal nonanal decanal undecanal benzaldehyde 2 4 heptadienal and 2 4 octadienal respectively the minimum pac dosages with 2 6 nonadienal 2 octenal were both 10 mg l suggesting that pac dosages should be carefully considered and confirmed while dealing with various odor problems caused by different aldehyde odorants 20 24 for adsorption processes of heptanal and 2 octenal although their initial concentrations and otcs were same as 90 μg l and 3 μg l respectively the pac dosage of heptanal 25 mg l at inflection point of residual concentration curve was much higher than that of 2 octenal 10 mg l suggesting that 2 octenal could be adsorbed and removed more easily by pac and only a small dosage of pac was needed to reduce 2 octenal s concentration below its otc although initial concentrations and otcs of pentanal nonanal decanal undecanal benzaldehyde 2 4 heptadienal and 2 4 octadienal were quite different the pac dosages for these odorants were same as 30 mg l the same cases happened on hexanal heptanal and octanal the results indicated that pac dosages could be different for aldehyde odorants with same concentrations and different concentrations of aldehyde odorants may be corresponding to same pac dosages for evaluating odorants treatability more reasonable various otcs and adsorption characteristics of aldehyde odorants by pac should be considered simultaneously if residual odorant s concentration at inflection point was lower than its otc the odorant was suitable for adsorption and removal by pac if not the odorant was not suitable for adsorption and removal through pac 20 moreover the odorant with relatively low adsorption capacity but high otc may be controlled by pac however the odorant with high adsorption capacity and low otc might not be able to reduce below otc level through pac adsorption therefore whether pac is suitable for adsorbing and removing odorants it is affected by the adsorption performance of pac and the inflection point of residual concentration curves 20 if residual concentration was reduced below otc after inflection point then a small concentration decrease would consume a mass of activated carbon which is not cost effective however more concentration removal of residual odorant could be achieved before the inflection point of residual aldehydes odorants concentration curved at the same pac dosage condition and the adoption of pac would be much more cost effective if odorant s residual concentration was reduced below otc before inflection point which was in the sharp decline part of residual concentration curves suggesting the odorant was perfectly fitted for removal through pac adsorption on the contrary pac adsorption might not be an economical way if odorant could not decrease below otc before inflection point while other removal techniques could be selected and applied fortunately the residual concentrations of aldehyde odorants could be reduced lower than their corresponding otcs before inflection points in this study furthermore the removal efficiency of each odor causing compound was calculated and analyzed as shown in table 1 the results indicated that all aldehyde odorants removal efficiencies were above 97 6 suggesting aldehyde odorants could be removed effectively through pac adsorption this was in accordance with treatability evaluation 3 4 correlation between adsorption performance and aldehyde odorants properties as shown in fig 2 and table 1 although initial concentrations and otcs of heptanal and 2 octenal were same as 90 μg l and 3 μg l respectively the pac dosages of heptanal 25 mg l and 2 octenal 10 mg l at inflection point of residual concentration curve which decrease their concentrations below corresponding otcs were quite different suggesting that 2 octenal could be adsorbed and removed more easily by pac and only a small dosage of pac was needed to reduce 2 octenal s concentration below its otc for clarifying the key properties of aldehyde odorants impacting adsorption capacity of pac the relationship between aldehyde odorants properties table 2 including logkw volume solubility dipole molar refractivity mr parachor surface tension polarizability and adsorption characteristics including t and logqe were studied through pearson correlation and spearman correlation respectively as shown in table 3 and table 4 all p values of pearson and spearman correlation between aldehyde odorants properties and logqe were 0 05 suggesting no significant correlation existed between odorants properties and logqe which indicated that qe was not proper for characterizing aldehyde odorants adsorption comparatively speaking most p values of pearson and spearman correlation between odorants properties and t were below 0 05 as shown in table 3 and table 4 while solubility dipole surface tension in pearson analysis and dipole in spearman analysis were exceptions it should be noted that there existed significant correlations between t and mr logkw parachar polarizability and volume the solubility in pearson analysis and dipole in spearman analysis with t value have a certain extent correlation however there were no significant correlations among these properties while p values were higher than 0 05 moreover t had a positive correlation with mr logkw parachar polarizability and volume the higher t value indicated higher treatability of aldehyde odorants as a result aldehyde odorants with higher mr logkw parachar polarizability and volume would be adsorbed and removed by pac more easily the compounds with larger logkw values were usually more hydrophobic which was consistent with previous researches indicating hydrophobic compounds in water matrix were adsorbed more easily than hydrophilic compounds 29 35 36 this was further verified through significantly negative correlation between t and solubility as shown in table 4 the volume of aldehyde odorants varied from 101 to 224 6 å3 while the corresponding spherical diameters were about 2 8 to 3 7 å as shown in fig 1 a pore size of pac 1 9 48 nm was much larger than aldehyde odorants diameters suggesting aldehyde odorants might be adsorbed onto micropores of pac and odorants with larger volume might be adsorbed more strongly by pac because of relatively larger van der waals force 29 36 37 it is worth noting that the size exclusion should be weak because of much larger pore size than odorants diameters while size exclusion could occur when pore width is smaller than approximately 1 7 times of the largest dimension of adsorbates in water matrix 36 in addition parachar was usually used for measuring molar volume of chemical compounds since volume had a positive correlation with t value the same case was suitable for parachar it should be noted that mr and polarizability had the most positive correlation with t value among these five properties while r for mr and polarizability were 0 912 0 900 in pearson analysis and 0 942 0 924 in spearman analysis respectively it is well known that mr was the measurement for total polarizability of chemical compound furthermore mr was associated with overall electron cloud size and connectivity index which increased as molecule extended and get more larger 37 38 the effect of mr on absorbability and volatility of odorants had been investigated in previous studies indicating mr could affect odorants volatility then affect odorants otc 38 as a result the mr which better reflect properties of aldehyde odorants had the more distinct correlation with aldehyde odorants t values 4 conclusions the kinetics capacity and treatability of fourteen aldehyde odorants by pac adsorption were studied in this paper the results indicated that equilibrium time of adsorbing fourteen aldehyde odorants on pac was relatively fast and removal rates of most odorants could be reached to 90 after exposure time of 0 5 h except 2 6 nonadienal adsorption kinetics of most aldehyde odorants were better fitted for pseudo second order models based on r adsorption capacity of aldehyde odorants was better fitted with freundlich model based on r2 of adsorption isotherms curves however qm from langmuir model was not reliable for predicting the actual adsorption capacity and there was contradiction judgment among kf and 1 n values suggesting langmuir and freundlich models were not suitable for evaluating treatability of aldehyde odorants therefore treatability parameter method considering residual concentrations at inflection point and otc of aldehyde odorant simultaneously was adopted results indicated fourteen aldehyde odorants could be removed below otc by pac adsorption in addition treatability performance and pac dosage corresponding to the inflection point of each compound were significantly different for fourteen odorants the treatability order of aldehyde odorant was as follows 2 4 decadienal 0 67 β cyclocitral 0 65 decanal 0 6 undecanal 0 6 nonanal 0 58 2 4 octadienal 0 55 2 6 nonadienal 0 55 2 octenal 0 5 octanal 0 4 heptanal 0 33 benzaldehyde 0 32 pentanal 0 31 2 4 heptadienal 0 31 hexanal 0 3 and minimum pac dosage was 10 mg l while maximum pac dosage was 30 mg l this suggested that pac dosages should be carefully considered for controlling odor problems caused by different odorants in addition the effect of aldehyde odorants properties on adsorption and treatability was studied through pearson and spearman correlation analysis results indicated odorants properties including mr logkw parachar polarizability and volume had significant and positive correlations with treatability suggesting that aldehyde odorants with larger volume more hydrophobic higher mr and polarizability values would be removed by pac adsorption more easily this study would be helpful for mitigation of odors caused by aldehyde odorants in dwtps and providing more insights into pac adsorption of aldehyde odorants credit authorship contribution

12697,powdered activated carbon pac was frequently used for removing musty and septic odor causing compounds in water matrix however it is not known if pac is effective on removing various aldehyde odorants in this study the treatability of fourteen aldehyde odorants by pac adsorption was evaluated comprehensively the results indicated that most aldehyde odorants removal rates could reach 90 after 0 5 h exposure while adsorption kinetic was better fitted for pseudo second order model and adsorption capacity was better fitted with freundlich model however adsorption predictions from these models which neglected olfactory threshold concentration otc were unsuitable for evaluating that odor caused by aldehyde odorant could be controlled effectively or not therefore treatability value which considered residual concentration and otc was calculated the result of 0 3 0 67 suggested they could be removed below otc effectively by pac adsorption furthermore the effect of aldehyde odorant s property on adsorption and treatability was studied through pearson and spearman correlation analysis the results indicated that there were not significant correlations between adsorption capacity and aldehyde odorants properties comparatively speaking treatability had significant and positive correlations with aldehyde odorants properties including molar refractivity mr octanal and water logkw parachar polarizability and volume r 0 860 0 942 p 0 000 suggesting that odorant with larger volume more hydrophobic higher mr and polarizability would be adsorbed by pac easily this is the first study for evaluating adsorption of multiple aldehyde odorants onto pac completely which would supply more understanding for controlling aldehyde odorants in drinking water treatment plant dwtp graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aldehyde odorant powdered activated carbon adsorption treatability evaluation odorant property data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction odors and corresponding odor causing compounds in drinking water have become one of primary problems concerned by consumers and were unacceptable for drinking water treatment plant dwtp which even cause public panic in emergency odor accidents in recent years 1 5 among taste and odor investigations of drinking water sources among thirty one cities across china 6 10 musty odor was detected with intensity range of 2 6 and mainly caused by 2 methylisoborneol and geosmin detected concentration 10 60 ng l septic odor was detected with intensity of 2 6 and mainly caused by thiorther compounds detected concentration 10 120 ng l chemical odor was detected with intensity of 2 6 and mainly caused by benzenes phenols etc detected concentration 80 960 ng l fishy and grassy odors were detected with intensity of 2 8 and mainly associated with aldehyde compounds detected concentration 50 890 ng l 6 10 there are complex odors and odorants in drinking water which lead to severe challenge for purifying water in dwtp among detected odors in drinking water fishy odor grassy odor and relating aldehyde odorants have been further focused in recent years 11 13 musty and septic odors usually occurred in eutrophic waters at warm seasons just as summer and autumn 14 however fishy and grassy odors caused by aldehyde odorants were more detected in meso oligotrophic water matrix systems in spring and winter with low water temperature 15 it is well known that most odorants were hardly removed through conventional water treatment processes including coagulation sedimentation sand filtration and disinfection usually advanced treatment technologies including advanced oxidation adsorption biodegradation membrane separation were effective on controlling odors 16 18 however aldehyde odorants including 2 butenal 3 methylbutanal 2 4 decadienal etc could be generated through oxidation process and certain biological treatment process 9 19 which brings more challenge for removing fishy and grassy odors in dwtp powdered activated carbon pac adsorption was frequently used for removing musty septic odors and corresponding odorants 20 21 however thioether compound responsible for septic odor could not be removed below its olfactory threshold concentration otc in the range of 10 30 ng l by pac adsorption effectively 20 while otc means threshold concentration that humans can detect olfactory odor in water matrix this suggested effluent of drinking water including thioether compound after pac adsorption was still appearing residual septic odor this also indicated that odors control effectively not only depended on odorant s adsorption capacity but also involved with odorant s otc therefore otc of corresponding odorant should be considered for measuring whether removal technology is effective or not on removing odors when residual concentration of corresponding odorant after removal technology is lower than its otc suggesting odorant is removed effectively and no residual odor exists in effluent after removal technology while residual concentration of corresponding odorant after removal technology is higher than its otc suggesting this removal technology could not control odor effectively 20 21 in view of big differences among various odorants otcs treatability method which considered adsorption capacity and distinct otc had been used for evaluating whether odor problem could be controlled effectively through pac adsorption the results indicated 2 methylisoborneol and geosmin could be removed below otc by pac adsorption while dimethyl disulfide and diethyl disulfide could not be treated below otc through pac adsorption 20 for improving adsorption characteristic adsorption of musty septic odorants and effect of pac properties on adsorption characteristic were mainly focused in previous studies usually higher odorants adsorption could be obtained from pac with high surface area 828 1158 m2 g and micropore volumes 0 32 0 45 cm3 g in most cases 22 26 however there were few studies focused on the effect of odorant s property on adsorption characteristic some study indicated hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of chemical compounds were relating with pac adsorption characteristic and compound with higher hydrophobicity could obtain higher adsorption capacity 18 20 in addition related influence properties of aldehyde odorants on pac adsoption were rarely studied compared with those of musty septic odorants adsorption while previous studies were mainly focused on the effect of pac properties on adsorption capacity of musty septic odorants 24 28 therefore it is necessary to clarify adsorption characteristics of aldehyde odorants by pac which could be helpful for aldehyde odorants removal in dwtp in this paper pac adsorption characteristics of fourteen aldehyde odorants which were frequently detected in drinking water source and responsible for grassy and fishy odors were studied comprehensively these fourteen aldehyde odorants included pentanal hexanal heptanal octanal nonanal decanal undecanal 2 octenal 2 4 heptadienal benzaldehyde 2 6 nonadienal β cyclocitral 2 4 octadienal and 2 4 decadienal usually pseudo first order and pseudo second order were the optimal models used for fitting pac adsorption kinetic while freundlich and langmuir were the optimal models used for fitting pac adsorption capacity in previous studies 18 20 22 considering that pac adsorption of aldehyde odorants in this study pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were conducted for analyzing adsorption kinetic of aldehyde odorants freundlich and langmuir models were fitted for clarifying adsorption capacity additionally treatability of these fourteen aldehyde odorants which considered otc marginal effect and adsorption performance were evaluated meanwhile key odorants influence properties on adsorption characteristics were explored through pearson and spearman correlation analysis this study would be helpful for mitigation of odors caused by aldehyde odorants in dwtps and providing more insights into pac adsorption of aldehyde odorants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents as shown in table s1 aldehyde compounds including pentanal hexanal heptanal octanal nonanal decanal undecanal 2 octenal 2 4 heptadienal benzaldehyde 2 6 nonadienal β cyclocitral 2 4 octadienal and 2 4 decadienal were purchased from sigma aldrich co usa at chromatographically purity methanol acetone and dichloromethane at chromatographically purity were purchased from anpel inc china anhydrous na2so4 and nacl were purchased from sinopharm chemicals ltd china at guaranteed reagent purity grade and heated at 450 c for 2 h before use for removing potential micropollutants completely 6 11 stock solutions of 1000 mg l and 100 mg l are conducted by diluting odorants standards using methanol ultrapure deionized water 18 mω cm was produced through a milli q purification system the coal based pac with low cost which was bought from tianjin beichen company china and commonly used in dwtp was adopted for adsorption experiments the point of zero charge of pac was 10 06 fig s1 which was analyzed through indirect titration method 29 the surface areas and pore size distributions of pac samples were characterized by nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms fig 1 its specific surface area total pore volume micro pore volume mesopore volume iodine value and methylene blue number were 981 m2 g 0 613 cm3 g 0 407 cm3 g 0 196 cm3 g 950 mg g 280 mg g respectively the stock solution was prepared by dispersing 1 g pac in 1 l ultrapure deionized water 2 2 adsorption experiments adsorption experiments were conducted with pac dosages from 0 to 100 mg l in 250 ml conical flasks since there are wide differences among otcs of aldehyde odorants just as the otc of 2 4 octadienal 10 μg l is two orders of magnitude higher than that of 2 6 nonadienal 0 08 μg l it is irrational for evaluating and comparing odorants adsorption and removal characteristics at same initial concentrations therefore the initial concentration was approximately 20 50 times of corresponding otc rather than a unified concentration which could avoid the phenomenon that odorant with high otc might decrease below otc more easily aldehyde odorants spiked in ultrapure deionized water were used for adsorption kinetic and capacity experiments to avoid interference of water matrix and making this study more focused on aldehyde odorants themselves pac was usually used for emergency odor treatment for drinking water source and added in water intake of water source for adsorbing odorants completely in the process of transporting water to dwtp 16 22 therefore adsorption time was 5 h in this study considering most unfavorable water treatment conditions in the adsorption isotherm study the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe μg mg was adopted for fitting model the qe was calculated as follows 1 q e c 0 c e d where c0 μg l was initial concentration of aldehyde odorant ce μg l was the equilibrium concentration corresponding to specific pac dosage and d mg l was the dosage of pac the experimental data were fitted by kinetic models including pseudo first order and pseudo second order and equilibrium models including langmuir and freundlich the pseudo first order model was written as 2 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where qe μg mg was the equilibrium adsorption capacity t was adsorption time qt μg mg was adsorption capacity when time was t k1 was the pseudo first order rate constant 30 31 the pseudo second order model was written as 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qe μg mg was the equilibrium adsorption capacity t was adsorption time qt μg mg was adsorption capacity when time was t k2 was the pseudo second order rate constant 30 31 the langmuir model was written as 4 q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e where qe μg mg was the equilibrium adsorption capacity kl l mg was langmuir isotherm constant related to free energy of adsorption qm μg mg was the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity ce μg l was the equilibrium concentration corresponding to specific pac dosage 30 31 the freundlich model was written as 5 q e k f c e 1 n where qe μg mg was the equilibrium adsorption capacity ce μg l was the equilibrium concentration corresponding to specific pac dosage kf μg1 1 n l1 n mg and n were freundlich isotherm constants suggesting relative adsorption capacity and intensity respectively 30 31 2 3 odorant analysis the aldehyde odorants concentrations were determined by combining headspace solid phase microextraction spme with gas chromatography with mass spectrometry gc ms 12 15 at the end of adsorption experiment suspension was withdrawn by an injection syringe and filtered through a glass fiber membrane 1 2 μm whatman gf c uk before analyzing odorants and 10 ml water sample added 3 g nacl was adopted for analyzing odorants the spme procedure was as follows the fiber car pdms supelco was placed in headspace of water sample bottle which was extracted 30 min with water temperature of 60 c then extracted spme fiber was injected into the injector port of gc ms while odorants adsorbed on spme fiber could be desorbed thermally at 250 c the desorbed time was 2 5 min the gc ms parameters were as follows the inlet temperature was 250 c the temperature programming of column oven 40 c with 3 min then increased to 240 c at a rate of 8 c min 240 c was holding 5 min ionization voltage was 70 ev ion source temperature was 230 c and selective ion mode sim was adopted in this study other detailed parameters and conditions could be found in supporting information table s2 and fig s2 and previous studies 12 15 parallel water samples were analyzed in each batch and aldehyde odorants concentrations were averaged in the duplicate analyses 2 4 treatability evaluation for evaluating adsorption effect of aldehyde odorants by pac the treatability parameter t dimensionless was adopted it was obtained as follows 6 t otc c ip otc where cip is the residual odorant s concentration at the inflection point μg l 20 if t value of aldehyde odorant was between zero and one indicating that corresponding odorant could be removed effectively by pac adsorption and t value was close to one suggesting aldehyde odorant could be removed by pac more completely if t value was below zero indicating corresponding odorant could not be removed below otc by pac adsorption the more negative values implied the worse removal performance 20 2 5 correlation analysis between treatability adsorption capacity and aldehyde odorant property for clarifying effect of odorants properties on adsorption performance pearson and spearman correlation analyses were conducted between aldehydes odorants properties octanal and water logkw volume solubility dipole molar refractivity mr parachor surface tension polarizability and adsorption characteristics t and adsorption capacity logqe the pearson and spearman correlation analyses were achieved by ibm spss statistics 26 0 the pearson correlation was written as 7 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where r was person correlation coefficient n was the number of variables x and y were average value of x and y respectively 20 the spearman correlation was written as 8 r 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where r was spearman correlation coefficient n was the total number of variables di was the rank difference of two column pairs of variables 20 3 results and discussion pore size distribution of pac was shown in fig 1a micro pore volume mesopore volume total pore volume were 0 407 cm3 g 0 196 cm3 g 0 613 cm3 g respectively usually iodine value and methylene blue number were used for evaluating pac adsorption effect however these two parameters were not sufficient for analyzing adsorption equilibrium and mechanism comprehensively more parameters including micro pore volume mesopore volume total pore volume specific surface area should be taken into account in practical engineering application particularly micro pore volume had been considered to be the more important reference parameter measuring adsorption characteristics in practical applications 24 28 fig 1b indicated adsorption desorption isotherms obtained by nitrogen adsorbing capacity increased drastically at the beginning and adsorption rate was fast adsorbing capacity increased slowly following relative pressure keeping growing the final adsorption isotherms were not leveled off because of macropore and mesopore existing in pac as shown in fig 2 residual concentrations of fourteen aldehyde odorants decreased gradually accompanying with pac dosage increase there were big differences among otcs of aldehyde odorants therefore comparing adsorption performance of these odorants with same initial concentration was unreasonable although initial concentrations of some odorants were almost same the pac dosages for inflection points of aldehyde odorants were quite different suggesting some odorants might be adsorbed more easily than other odorants just like adsorption processes of heptanal and 2 octenal the initial concentrations were both 90 μg l however the pac dosage for decreasing odorant s concentration below otc inflection point were 25 mg l heptanal and 10 mg l 2 octenal respectively this indicated that 2 octenal should be adsorbed and removed more easily than heptanal which was consistent with treatability evaluation result while t value of 2 octenal 0 5 was higher than that of heptanal 0 33 as shown in table 1 adsorption kinetic capacity and treatability will be elaborated in the following sections 3 1 adsorption kinetic of aldehyde odorants the ph of water sample used for adsorption experiment varied from 6 80 to 7 20 the final ph of water sample after adsorption varied from 8 21 to 8 70 as shown in fig 3 the equilibrium time of adsorbing fourteen aldehyde odorants by pac was relatively fast while removal rates of most odorants could be reached to 90 after exposure time of 0 5 h theoretically there were three steps in the kinetics process first external mass transfer means the adsorbate transferred between bulk fluid and adsorbent s surface second intraparticle diffusion means the access of adsorbate into adsorbent s pores then diffusion among pores third adsorption reaction means mass action at phase boundaries 23 32 in physical adsorption the last step is very fast and the adsorption process is depending on external mass transfer or intraparticle diffusion 18 based on these steps pseudo first order model and the pseudo second order model have been used for describing or predicting adsorption kinetics the measured and modeled adsorption kinetic parameters are summarized in table s3 the correlation coefficients r of pseudo first order models for aldehyde odorants except heptanal nonanal undecanal 2 4 decadienal were higher than 0 8 and r of pseudo second order models for all aldehyde odorants were higher than 0 8 comparing r of pseudo first order and pseudo second order models table s3 the r of pseudo second order models for most aldehyde odorants were higher than those of pseudo first order models indicating adsorption kinetics of most aldehyde odorants were better fitted for pseudo second order models except 2 6 nonadienal was suitable for pseudo first order model with r of 0 989 the adsorption driving force of pseudo first order and pseudo second order model derived from difference between the average concentration of compound adsorbed onto pac at certain time and the equilibrium concentration qe in water matrix 18 the adsorption rate was proportional to the driving force in the pseudo first order model and square of the driving force in the pseudo second order model as a whole pseudo first order model primarily simulated fast adsorption because of lack of reactions between adsorbent and adsorbate 33 while pseudo second order model was usually the complicated multi steps action and adsorption process 18 as shown in fig 3 and table s3 the adsorptions of most aldehyde odorants were complicated multi steps action and adsorption process hence most adsorption cases in this study were better suitable for pseudo second order models 3 2 adsorption capacity of aldehyde odorants to further explore the essence of adsorption equilibrium the isotherm curves were fitted with two adsorption models including freundlich and langmuir as shown in fig 4 the calculated parameters and correlation coefficient r2 for these models were listed in table s4 all adsorption isotherms were well fitted with freundlich and langmuir models for all aldehyde odorants while r2 for all odorants were above 0 956 as table s4 showed the maximum adsorption capacity qm for each aldehyde odorant was predicted through langmuir model it should be noted that the qm of undecanal and 2 4 octadienal predicted from langmuir model were 35 23 μg mg and 156 18 μg mg respectively which were much higher than those of 2 6 nonadienal 7 14 μg mg and 2 4 decadienal 9 86 μg mg nevertheless the residual concentrations of 2 6 nonadienal 0 05 μg l and 2 4 decadienal 0 1 μg l were much lower than those of undecanal 3 6 μg l and 2 4 octadienal 4 5 μg l even pac dosages reached 30 mg l while pac dosages for 2 6 nonadienal and 2 4 decadienal were 10 mg l and 20 mg l respectively to reduce their concentrations below corresponding otcs these results indicated that qm of aldehyde odorants did not match the visual data as shown in fig 2 and fig 4 suggesting qm from langmuir model was not reliable for predicting the actual adsorption capacity and treatability of various aldehyde odorants by pac 20 the freundlich model was also conducted to explore adsorption characteristics of aldehyde odorants it should be noted that adsorption isotherm curves were perfectly fitted with freundlich model r2 0 967 which seemed a good predictability of freundlich model generally speaking kf value of freundlich model indicates the adsorption capacity while 1 n value indicates adsorption intensity and favorability 18 nevertheless there were contradictions among results judging from kf and 1 n values as shown in table s4 2 4 octadienal undecanal and benzaldehyde had high kf values and low 1 n values higher kf values mean larger adsorption capacity and lower 1 n value means odorant is not easy to be adsorbed 18 20 suggesting adsorption capacity and favorability of aldehyde odorants by pac were not consistent and this was not consistent with results shown in fig 2 as well therefore freundlich model was also not suitable for evaluating aldehyde odorants treatability in conclusion only adsorption capacities predicted by langmuir and freundlich models were not enough to evaluate aldehyde odorants treatability the langmuir model supposed a monolayer adsorption onto a surface of uniform energy and no transfer of adsorbate on adsorbent surface 21 34 the freundlich model assumed that the stronger binding sites are occupied first then the binding strength decreases with increasing site occupation degree which are based on the hypothesis of heterogeneous adsorbent surface energy or heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces 20 34 the overall results indicated that most adsorption processes for aldehyde odorants were fitted with langmuir and freundlich model however some langmuir and freundlich isotherm curves of aldehyde odorants were not leveling off therefore langmuir model may only predict the qm of each odorant through an empirical formula suggesting the predicted qm values might not be reliable additionally there were contradictions among the judgements from kf and 1 n values in freundlich model thus langmuir and freundlich models might not be the best choices to assess the treatability of aldehyde odorants 20 for evaluating odorants treatability effectively the otc of aldehyde odorant should be also considered besides adsorption capacity the comprehensive method which assess odorants treatability by comparing residual concentration at inflection point and otc was further studied in the following section 3 3 the treatability evaluation for aldehyde odorants as shown in fig 2 the residual concentrations of fourteen aldehyde odorants gradually decreased and then leveled off as pac dosage increased there are inflection points in these curves at which the decreasing trend starts to flatten generally speaking the inflection point of a differentiable function for the variable was the point in the chart where the second derivative of corresponding function was zero thus the inflection point of residual concentration curve was acquired by getting second derivative of corresponding curve table 1 indicated the treatability parameters of aldehyde odorants as a whole the concentrations of fourteen aldehyde odorants could be reduced below their corresponding otcs through pac adsorption in this study the order of aldehyde odorants on the basis of their treatability was listed as follows 2 4 decadienal 0 67 β cyclocitral 0 65 decanal 0 6 undecanal 0 6 nonanal 0 58 2 4 octadienal 0 55 2 6 nonadienal 0 55 2 octenal 0 5 octanal 0 4 heptanal 0 33 benzaldehyde 0 32 pentanal 0 31 2 4 heptadienal 0 31 hexanal 0 3 however the pac dosages corresponding to inflection point concentration of aldehyde odorants were significantly different as shown in fig 2 and table 1 the maximum pac dosage was 30 mg l which was corresponding to pentanal nonanal decanal undecanal benzaldehyde 2 4 heptadienal and 2 4 octadienal respectively the minimum pac dosages with 2 6 nonadienal 2 octenal were both 10 mg l suggesting that pac dosages should be carefully considered and confirmed while dealing with various odor problems caused by different aldehyde odorants 20 24 for adsorption processes of heptanal and 2 octenal although their initial concentrations and otcs were same as 90 μg l and 3 μg l respectively the pac dosage of heptanal 25 mg l at inflection point of residual concentration curve was much higher than that of 2 octenal 10 mg l suggesting that 2 octenal could be adsorbed and removed more easily by pac and only a small dosage of pac was needed to reduce 2 octenal s concentration below its otc although initial concentrations and otcs of pentanal nonanal decanal undecanal benzaldehyde 2 4 heptadienal and 2 4 octadienal were quite different the pac dosages for these odorants were same as 30 mg l the same cases happened on hexanal heptanal and octanal the results indicated that pac dosages could be different for aldehyde odorants with same concentrations and different concentrations of aldehyde odorants may be corresponding to same pac dosages for evaluating odorants treatability more reasonable various otcs and adsorption characteristics of aldehyde odorants by pac should be considered simultaneously if residual odorant s concentration at inflection point was lower than its otc the odorant was suitable for adsorption and removal by pac if not the odorant was not suitable for adsorption and removal through pac 20 moreover the odorant with relatively low adsorption capacity but high otc may be controlled by pac however the odorant with high adsorption capacity and low otc might not be able to reduce below otc level through pac adsorption therefore whether pac is suitable for adsorbing and removing odorants it is affected by the adsorption performance of pac and the inflection point of residual concentration curves 20 if residual concentration was reduced below otc after inflection point then a small concentration decrease would consume a mass of activated carbon which is not cost effective however more concentration removal of residual odorant could be achieved before the inflection point of residual aldehydes odorants concentration curved at the same pac dosage condition and the adoption of pac would be much more cost effective if odorant s residual concentration was reduced below otc before inflection point which was in the sharp decline part of residual concentration curves suggesting the odorant was perfectly fitted for removal through pac adsorption on the contrary pac adsorption might not be an economical way if odorant could not decrease below otc before inflection point while other removal techniques could be selected and applied fortunately the residual concentrations of aldehyde odorants could be reduced lower than their corresponding otcs before inflection points in this study furthermore the removal efficiency of each odor causing compound was calculated and analyzed as shown in table 1 the results indicated that all aldehyde odorants removal efficiencies were above 97 6 suggesting aldehyde odorants could be removed effectively through pac adsorption this was in accordance with treatability evaluation 3 4 correlation between adsorption performance and aldehyde odorants properties as shown in fig 2 and table 1 although initial concentrations and otcs of heptanal and 2 octenal were same as 90 μg l and 3 μg l respectively the pac dosages of heptanal 25 mg l and 2 octenal 10 mg l at inflection point of residual concentration curve which decrease their concentrations below corresponding otcs were quite different suggesting that 2 octenal could be adsorbed and removed more easily by pac and only a small dosage of pac was needed to reduce 2 octenal s concentration below its otc for clarifying the key properties of aldehyde odorants impacting adsorption capacity of pac the relationship between aldehyde odorants properties table 2 including logkw volume solubility dipole molar refractivity mr parachor surface tension polarizability and adsorption characteristics including t and logqe were studied through pearson correlation and spearman correlation respectively as shown in table 3 and table 4 all p values of pearson and spearman correlation between aldehyde odorants properties and logqe were 0 05 suggesting no significant correlation existed between odorants properties and logqe which indicated that qe was not proper for characterizing aldehyde odorants adsorption comparatively speaking most p values of pearson and spearman correlation between odorants properties and t were below 0 05 as shown in table 3 and table 4 while solubility dipole surface tension in pearson analysis and dipole in spearman analysis were exceptions it should be noted that there existed significant correlations between t and mr logkw parachar polarizability and volume the solubility in pearson analysis and dipole in spearman analysis with t value have a certain extent correlation however there were no significant correlations among these properties while p values were higher than 0 05 moreover t had a positive correlation with mr logkw parachar polarizability and volume the higher t value indicated higher treatability of aldehyde odorants as a result aldehyde odorants with higher mr logkw parachar polarizability and volume would be adsorbed and removed by pac more easily the compounds with larger logkw values were usually more hydrophobic which was consistent with previous researches indicating hydrophobic compounds in water matrix were adsorbed more easily than hydrophilic compounds 29 35 36 this was further verified through significantly negative correlation between t and solubility as shown in table 4 the volume of aldehyde odorants varied from 101 to 224 6 å3 while the corresponding spherical diameters were about 2 8 to 3 7 å as shown in fig 1 a pore size of pac 1 9 48 nm was much larger than aldehyde odorants diameters suggesting aldehyde odorants might be adsorbed onto micropores of pac and odorants with larger volume might be adsorbed more strongly by pac because of relatively larger van der waals force 29 36 37 it is worth noting that the size exclusion should be weak because of much larger pore size than odorants diameters while size exclusion could occur when pore width is smaller than approximately 1 7 times of the largest dimension of adsorbates in water matrix 36 in addition parachar was usually used for measuring molar volume of chemical compounds since volume had a positive correlation with t value the same case was suitable for parachar it should be noted that mr and polarizability had the most positive correlation with t value among these five properties while r for mr and polarizability were 0 912 0 900 in pearson analysis and 0 942 0 924 in spearman analysis respectively it is well known that mr was the measurement for total polarizability of chemical compound furthermore mr was associated with overall electron cloud size and connectivity index which increased as molecule extended and get more larger 37 38 the effect of mr on absorbability and volatility of odorants had been investigated in previous studies indicating mr could affect odorants volatility then affect odorants otc 38 as a result the mr which better reflect properties of aldehyde odorants had the more distinct correlation with aldehyde odorants t values 4 conclusions the kinetics capacity and treatability of fourteen aldehyde odorants by pac adsorption were studied in this paper the results indicated that equilibrium time of adsorbing fourteen aldehyde odorants on pac was relatively fast and removal rates of most odorants could be reached to 90 after exposure time of 0 5 h except 2 6 nonadienal adsorption kinetics of most aldehyde odorants were better fitted for pseudo second order models based on r adsorption capacity of aldehyde odorants was better fitted with freundlich model based on r2 of adsorption isotherms curves however qm from langmuir model was not reliable for predicting the actual adsorption capacity and there was contradiction judgment among kf and 1 n values suggesting langmuir and freundlich models were not suitable for evaluating treatability of aldehyde odorants therefore treatability parameter method considering residual concentrations at inflection point and otc of aldehyde odorant simultaneously was adopted results indicated fourteen aldehyde odorants could be removed below otc by pac adsorption in addition treatability performance and pac dosage corresponding to the inflection point of each compound were significantly different for fourteen odorants the treatability order of aldehyde odorant was as follows 2 4 decadienal 0 67 β cyclocitral 0 65 decanal 0 6 undecanal 0 6 nonanal 0 58 2 4 octadienal 0 55 2 6 nonadienal 0 55 2 octenal 0 5 octanal 0 4 heptanal 0 33 benzaldehyde 0 32 pentanal 0 31 2 4 heptadienal 0 31 hexanal 0 3 and minimum pac dosage was 10 mg l while maximum pac dosage was 30 mg l this suggested that pac dosages should be carefully considered for controlling odor problems caused by different odorants in addition the effect of aldehyde odorants properties on adsorption and treatability was studied through pearson and spearman correlation analysis results indicated odorants properties including mr logkw parachar polarizability and volume had significant and positive correlations with treatability suggesting that aldehyde odorants with larger volume more hydrophobic higher mr and polarizability values would be removed by pac adsorption more easily this study would be helpful for mitigation of odors caused by aldehyde odorants in dwtps and providing more insights into pac adsorption of aldehyde odorants credit authorship contribution

graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene graphene synthesis graphene based nanomaterials biomedical waste waste treatment adsorption photocatalysis mechanism data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction with the innovative development of advanced biomedical technology new challenges such as biomedical waste management are being created 1 2 biomedical wastes bmw are mostly generated by pharmaceutical industries healthcare facilities medical and educational research institutions nursing homes and hospitals during medical treatment of human and veterinary populations as presented in fig 1 they include expired vaccines and drugs blood products tissues organic fluids radioactive waste and chemical and pharmaceutical residues bmw may also contain chemical surgical pharmaceutical cytotoxic and other biological waste materials which are potentially hazardous to living organisms including humans and the environment 3 4 inadequate bmw management can have consequences such as increasing infectious diseases resulting from groundwater contamination 5 it has been established that even trace amounts of various drug residues can exist in surface ground and even drinking water 6 the remainder of drugs that undergo partial metabolism in the human body is discharged as effluent into receiving water bodies a large majority of such drugs is antibiotics of which about 80 90 return to the environment via excretion in their parent form due to their robust molecular structure making them to degrade naturally 7 several conventional and advanced techniques such as electrochemical treatments filtration precipitation membrane separation photocatalysis ion exchange reverse osmosis and adsorption have been used for treatment of antibiotics in wastewater 8 10 however they still face challenges of cost effectiveness environmental friendliness and process efficiency from material preparation to process optimization 11 graphene and its derivatives have impacted wastewater treatment and have been utilized in photocatalysis adsorption or as an effective electrode in various treatment technologies and applications 12 16 adsorption have numerous advantages such as its high efficacy low cost and ecological viability to remove organic contaminants from water 17 19 graphene is a planar single atom layer thick sheet and two dimensionally structured material composed of tightly packed sp2 bonded carbon atoms in a honeycomb crystal lattice with a distinct charge mobility carrier a broad electrochemical spectrum and physicochemical properties 20 22 as a result of its outstanding optical thermal electrical and mechanical properties as well as its high specific surface area graphene has emerged a revolutionary material with wide range of applications including its use as innovative adsorbents for water treatment 23 24 it s an excellent adsorbent for removing a wide range of inorganic and organic pollutants because of its high surface area abundance of active sites and excellent delocalized electron systems 25 despite significant progress made in the development and application of grapheme based adsorbents some inherent disadvantages remain the hydrophobic nature of its surface and ease of aggregation in hydrous solution are disadvantages of graphene both of which significantly reduce its adsorption capacity in practical applications 26 27 during liquid processing graphene even rolls to form graphite aggregation can limit its adsorptive application by blocking active sorption sites decreasing theoretical surface area and impeding rapid mass transport 28 functionalized graphene can be designed to address some of these limitations it is essential to understand the adsorption efficiency of graphene based materials and how it correlates to the mechanisms of interaction between adsorbents and contaminants in order to advance the development of its functionalized composites and their applications in waste treatment 29 as a result of their high surface area and abundance of active sites there has been considerable interest in graphene based materials as potential adsorptive pollutants removal from water the underlying adsorption mechanisms are used for creating graphene based adsorbents for target pollutants reports on composite go and semiconductor photocatalytic materials have increased in recent years and go as a good carrier for photocatalysts has improved the properties of materials developed 30 31 go ag3po4 composite material and the go

photocatalytic treatment isotherm and kinetic study reusability and mechanisms of graphene based materials in biomedical waste treatment this review is expected to provide relevant existing knowledge and stimulate fresh ideas for the development of safe and efficient graphene nanomaterials based biomedical devices with the development of graphene nanoparticles numerous other cutting edge materials will also surely be found and numerous futuristic technologies will also become feasible 2 synthesis of graphene nanostructures the extraordinary electronic surface mechanical and optoelectronic attributes properties of 2 dimensional graphene a crystal lattice of carbon atoms are intriguing making it possible to develop various innovations across a broad spectrum of industries 32 33 the term graphene synthesis refers to any process whether chemical or mechanical that is used to produce graphene with the desired level of purity and dimensions of the finished product 34 currently graphene synthesis processes can be classified into two types namely top down and bottom up 21 35 the graphical illustration of the top down and bottom down synthesis approach is presented in fig 2 2 1 top down approach 2 1 1 mechanical exfoliation a well known and scientific way to mono layered graphene flakes extraction on preferred substrates is mechanical exfoliation it is formed when layered materials are subjected to transverse or longitudinal stress 32 36 mechanical exfoliation is also regarded as a low cost method of synthesizing graphene graphene can be fabricated by stacking single graphene carbon atoms using van der waals forces with bonding energy and inter spatial values of 2 ev nm2 and 3 34 å respectively 37 mechanical cleaving on the other hand involves an external force of about 3 μn mm2 for the separation of mono atomic layer from graphite sheet stacking is caused by a partially filled p orbitals overlapping perpendicularly on the sheet s plane with van der waals forces inclusive 38 exfoliation is the inverse of stacking and results in weak bond strength as well as wide vertical lattice spacing it does however results in bond improvement and tiny lattice spacing in the hexagonal lattice plane 39 several materials made from such as natural gr 40 highly ordered pyrolytic gr 41 graphene sheets synthesis with different thicknesses alongside mono crystal gr have been observed as a result of mechanical exfoliation 42 the exfoliation method used scotch tape 43 ultra sonication 44 transfer printing technique 45 and electric field 46 mechanical exfoliation has the disadvantage of producing a low yield of graphene 2 1 2 chemical reduction another top down technique for producing graphene is chemical reduction of graphite oxide graphite oxide is always produced by oxidizing graphite oxidants like kmno4 h2so4 and nitric acid can be used to perform oxidation 33 go reduction and sonication are also alternatives to graphene synthesis 47 alkaline solution ascorbic hydrazine glucose hydroquinone pyrrole hydroxylamine and phenyl hydrazine are some other reducing agents that can be used 48 51 the hydrophilic nature of go makes it a potentially useful material in other to fabricate a mono layered or double layered go go is first suspended in h2o using sonication followed by surfaces deposition by filtering or spin coating 23 as a result graphene films can be synthesized by thermally or chemically reducing go furthermore to create reduced go dispersions in the non polar solvents a straightforward method like solvo thermal reduction is advantageous although this process allows for mass production it is difficult to produce a high quality product due to the presence of some accompanying defects at the edges and deformation 52 environmentally friendly approaches to limiting the utilization of hazardous chemicals have grown in popularity in recent years 53 for instance reducing agents such as ascorbic acid have been used to create a benign synthesis process 54 electrochemical reduction is another method that can be utilized for large scale graphene synthesis this procedure removes a huge number of oxygen functional groups while also improving functional and electrical properties 55 thermal reduction of go in addition to chemical and electrochemical reduction is regarded as an efficient method for producing high performance rgo powders 56 the process reduction takes place in an unreactive environment at a high heating rate go undergoes reduction by evaporating and burning water molecules and oxygen functional groups at high temperatures above or near 1000 c the pressure generated by the heating process determines the effectiveness of thermal reduction 57 2 1 3 chemical exfoliation 2 1 3 1 chemical exfoliation another efficient top down method of graphene synthesis is chemical exfoliation chemical exfoliation is divided into two steps first van der waals forces reduction between the inter layers thereby increasing the gr interlayer spacing second a rapid heating process for gr exfoliation into single layers and few layers 33 the brodie 58 staudenmaier 59 and hummers 60 techniques have been used to create gos the hummers method evolved giving rise to modified and improved hummer s method 61 table 1 compares the differences types of oxidants used toxicity and potential benefits of the different methods the main benefit of hummer s method is scalable and low economic cost the method is useful in producing large scale graphene sheets making it suitable for industrial applications hummer s method is also a fast synthetic process which makes it ideal for mass production the improved hummers technique is preferred to make graphene because it has low free toxicity and can make more organized graphene structures 13 2 1 4 liquid phase exfoliation liquid phase exfoliation is a method widely used for graphene synthesis this synthesis process is broken down into three main phases first the graphene derivatives to be produced are dispersed in a suitable solvent next the graphene is exfoliated and finally the derivatives of exfoliated graphene are separated from their parent material during purification step 62 the appropriateness of the solvent can be evaluated based on its surface tension surface energy and hildebrand and hansen solubility among other characteristics as a result graphene dispersion can be achieved by making use of a wide range of aqueous and non aqueous liquids 63 typically for graphene exfoliation the ideal surface tension is 0 4 0 5 j m2 and surface energy is 0 70 0 8 j m2 for the solvent because they have surface energies similar to that of graphite they have lower mixing enthalpy and thus a simpler process exfoliation 36 brodie began graphite production using solvent made from potassium chlorate kclo3 and nitric acid hno3 and oxidized graphite to produce go staudenmaier successfully extracted oxidized go using the same solvent 64 their method however has become unpopular because of lengthy processing time and the use of potassium chlorate which is hazardous hummers created go in concentrated sulphuric acid h2so4 potassium permanganate kmno4 and sodium nitrate nano3 solvents 60 however the go produced through this method is more oxidized than previous methods and the presence of non oxidized graphite core in the go necessitates a pre treatment for the improvement of the oxidation process 65 also hernandez et al 66 investigated solvent s effect on graphene production using over 40 different solvents an extremely efficient method for producing graphene with minimal solvent was developed by the researchers although liquid phase exfoliation is a common method of producing graphene sonication can cause some defects on the edge and basal planes 23 67 sonication time is important because it affects graphene concentration it was previously found that the more prolong the duration of sonication the greater the graphene concentration 66 in graphene exfoliation centrifugal force is also important high centrifugal force produces thinner graphene flakes 68 the liquid exfoliation process results in defects on graphene that can be reduced by adjusting the sonication time temperature and intensity 2 1 5 electrochemical exfoliation chemical or mechanical graphene synthesis has several processing limitations including a time consuming and labor intensive procedure the use of hazardous and environmentally harsh solvents reagents and their regularity in quality as well though the processes for producing high quality graphene have been proposed such as thermal decomposition of silicon carbide sic micromechanical cleavage and cvd relatively low production rates and high costs make them they impractical for commercial applications electrochemical exfoliation proves to be a suitable method for bulk synthesis of graphene in less time and at minimal cost it is safer because no harsh chemicals are used in this process it is a method of using an electrical current to exfoliate a graphite electrode in a liquid electrolyte in this process the working electrode is usually a graphite film rod highly oriented pyrolytic graphite sample another counter electrode made of the same graphite nickel iron platinum alloy could be used migration of ions ve charged from the electrolyte to the working electrodes is caused by a potential difference created between two electrodes and become interposed among the graphene layers of graphite this process known as intercalation produces the impetus to disband the van der waals forces resulting in the expansion of graphite structurally the graphite electrodes properties such as particulate size layer arrangements defects thickness and appropriate pre treatment is also expected to influence ion intercalations 69 70 2 2 bottom up approach 2 2 1 epitaxial growth on silicon epitaxial growth is known as the growth layer of a substance on a substrate that continues the crystal structure of the substrate there is tendency for silicon carbide wafer to sublime when subjected to specific conditions high temperatures at 800 to 1150 c and vacuum conditions at 109 to 1010 mbar or at 1500 c under noble argon gas hence leaving the carbon remaining on the substrate to form graphitic layers on the wafer s carbon or silicon faces 71 as one might expect silicon carbide to have a lattice structure similar to graphene unlike chemical vapour deposition cvd epitaxial growth enables the production of large surface area graphene sheets this is a transfer free process that is dependent on the substrate s crystallographic orientation meaning that transferring the graphene requires no peculiar technique the mechanism of graphene epitaxial growth consists of two steps nucleation and layer by layer growth 72 based on the substrate there are types of epitaxial growth processes homo epitaxial growth and hetero epitaxial growth homo epitaxial growth process normally involves film deposition on same material as the substrate when the film and substrate are made of different materials a hetero epitaxial structure is formed silicon carbide was first applied for measuring electrically on patterned epitaxial layers 32 edward goodrich acheson invented this process in 1893 when he devised a technique for synthesizing silicon carbide sic by heating various carbonaceous sources at temperature 4000 c the author discovered that pure crystalline graphite was formed 23 73 as far as large scale production is concerned this method looks promising the epitaxial growth method on the other hand has a very high production cost due to its intensive energy features and the prohibitively high cost of single crystal commercially available silicon carbide substrates 74 another significant limitation of this method is non uniformity furthermore si face graphene is preferred over c face graphene because it has better graphene growth uniformity until now this method has been underutilized due to a lack of knowledge about the growth and interaction mechanisms of graphene and the sic substrate 75 2 2 2 chemical vapour deposition on metal catalyst cvd is a straightforward method which utilizes carbon precursors in its gaseous state e g methane to produce graphene high surface area single layered and few layered graphene can be grown on copper substrates 33 this method can produce high surface areas of monolayer graphene a few cm2 cvd has the potential to develop into a technology that is viable for commercial use the solubility of carbon in metals is the fundamental premise behind the cvd process hydrocarbons and other gaseous carbon precursors are introduced into a reactor that is able to withstand high temperatures once inside the hydrocarbons and other gaseous carbon precursors break down and dissolve into metal substrates 76 the difference in carbon solubility at different temperatures causes carbon to precipitate out of solid carbon metal solutions the growth substrate in the cvd process is the most significant aspect in the formation of graphene which starts from hydrocarbon decomposition and succeeded by evolution of metal substrate with carbon atom deposit 71 it is difficult to transfer graphene to a substrate of interest from the growth substrate because graphene has a low chemical response as a result the fabric begins to show flaws and wrinkles 35 in addition the procedure is complicated and energy intensive which restricts the task at times the cvd process however remains the most auspicious high surface area graphene production technique in the cvd process graphene is deposited on different of metal plates substrates including cu ni ir pd and ru 77 80 copper and nickel are the most commonly used substrates for cvd growth of graphene 2 2 3 organic synthesis polycyclic hydrocarbons pahs can be used to create graphene specifically graphene nanoribbons gnrs unlike the cvd method which produces gnrs with widths of 30 200 nm gnrs with widths of 10 nm can be produced by organic synthesis making it easier to engineer their band gaps nevertheless gr synthesis from polycyclic hydrocarbons is tough because cc bonds formation is required in a single step as well as the activation of inert ch bonds in polycyclic hydrocarbons enabling those bonds to participate in the reaction this makes the process time consuming and complicated notwithstanding there have been developments in chemical processes that are both quick and efficient 81 with many of them predicated on oxidative cyclodehydrogenation scholl reaction 82 diels alder polymerization cyclotrimerization and photocyclization are other methods for organic graphene synthesis 50 83 these techniques are not only necessitated there is limitation in the number of products produced 3 biomedical waste treatment using graphene as the world s population expands so is medicines and healthcare products demand to treat diseases thus there is a need to channel resources and technology towards improving and promoting the manufacturing of various pharmaceutical and medical products however the lack of proper techniques and the use of sub optimal approaches to waste minimization during production post production and or treatment stages by pharmaceutical industries or health care facilities generate effluents that are released into the environment untreated 84 sustainable and safe management of biomedical waste is a global challenge because of its potential hazard to human the environment and health the increased generation of biomedical wastes from various health care facilities including hospitals clinics and nursing homes has also become a matter of concern in many countries removal of toxic metal ions recalcitrant organic pollutants and pharmaceuticals by various emerging technologies has been the primary focus of research over the course of the past decade treatment of biomedical waste can be accomplished in various ways including through the application of physical chemical and biological processes it is important to consider the type and quantity of waste to be treated when deciding about which of these technologies to employ nevertheless the majority of these techniques including advanced oxidation processes electrochemical purification membranes processes and many more are not eco friendly and may pose health risks to both employees and the general public as well nonetheless adsorption and photocatalytic methods seems to overcome these challenges which make it more preferred as it outperforms other techniques due to its ease of operation cost effectiveness flexibility technological feasibility absence of byproducts and the ability to be easily recycled the various methods for treatment of biomedical waste using graphene and its derivatives is presented in fig 3 3 1 infectious biowaste treatment generally biomedical waste tends to be cytotoxic injurious chemical or infectious infectious biomedical waste contains substances which have deleterious effects on biological organisms biomedical waste is hazardous since it has the potential to spread infections once the waste becomes contaminated with biohazardous agents they pose the risk of disease transmission they include waste from lab cultures isolation wards equipment that have come in contact with infected patients infected clinical specimens tissue from experimental animals cotton swabs and excreta as well as soiled mattresses and beddings from blood or body fluids hospital wastewater is a major breeding ground for antibiotic resistant bacteria making it a potential vector for human and environmental infection 85 86 the importance of managing biomedical waste is critical particularly in medical facilities this is due to the fact that improper segregation biomedical wastes disposal and inclusion of biomedical waste in municipal waste making healthcare workers and the general public vulnerable hence infectious biomedical waste management should be a top priority for hospitals and other medical facilities although it is common knowledge that efficient wastewater treatment technologies are required to harness the control of infectious waterborne pathogens it is unfortunate that the present options available for managing biomedical waste do not address the current danger that is posed by liquid effluent discharges which is a significant issue for healthcare facilities go a function form of graphene with excellent electrochemical properties and functional groups e g coh oh and r o r can be applied in wastewater treatment although no studies have been reported in literature on the utilization of graphene as an adsorbent for the treatment of infectious biowaste and therefore we proposed that this area of research will be viable and require attention in environmental fields attention has been drawn to the use of nanoparticles due to the rapid development of nanotechnology effective microbial decontamination and pathogen disinfection is critical to controlling transmission and thereby reducing risk of infection reduced go possesses antimicrobial properties which hinders bacterial growth and therefore the biofilm formation on the filter surfaces physical and chemical properties such as stability reactivity and large surface area makes nanoparticles outstanding and also preferred catalysts and adsorbents 3 2 hazardous biowaste treatment hazardous wastes are generated from industries hospitals some household wastes hazardous waste is defined by the united state resource conservation and recovery act rcra as a of solid liquid wastes combination that may give rise to or contribute substantially to an increase in morbidity due to their concentration quantity or physical chemical or infectious characteristics according to the epa hazardous wastes possess properties which make them dangerous or capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment large amounts of hazardous substance containing effluent are discharged into the environment resulting from industrialization and urban development processes they can increase the risk of motility because they are corrosive flammable or have a high affinity and readily react when exposed to other substances 87 toxicity is the most concerning of these characteristics due to its impact on human beings and other living organisms hazardous pollutants sources include hormones pesticides antimicrobial agents illicit drugs pharmaceuticals and personal care products the waste generated during the production of pharmaceuticals varies greatly in amount and type and is relatively more than the actual finished product the term pharmaceutical wastewater primarily refers to effluents and wastes generated during pharmaceutical manufacturing there can be anywhere from 200 to 30 000 kg of waste produced for each kilogram of active ingredient produced 88 the amount of wastewater produced by pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities grows as the industry expands the current rate of improper disposal of unused medicines from hospitals and households is concerning 89 91 pharmaceutical waste is broadly classified as a waste generated by pharmaceutical companies and effluents from treatment and recycling plants handling such wastes and medical waste from hospitals and households which significantly contaminates sewage systems the latter is to blame for the presence of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs in public sewers and as a result municipal wastewater treatment plants 92 93 analgesics broncho spasmolytics antibiotics cosmetics contraceptives anti depressive agents non steroid anti inflammatory drugs nsaids lipid regulators antiseptics anti rheumatic beta blockers and diuretics have been discovered in the feed of municipal wastewater treatment plants as well as in the effluents of sewage treatment plants to a scale of g ml 93 94 various treatment options are available for treating pharmaceutical wastewater but due to the complex nature of the effluents treatment can be challenging gadipelly et al 95 and zaied et al 96 in their studies gave a comprehensive list of composition of the wastewater generated in pharmaceutical industries and active ingredients various treatment technologies exist and have been adopted for treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater as presented in table 2 as a result of the complexities of industrial effluents there is no one size fits all method and currently no single method capable of adequate treatment is available for example despite the success of anaerobic digestion technologies in treating high strength antibiotic wastewater with benefits such as biogas production and reduced waste sludge production 97 issues such as long start up times slow anaerobic microorganism growth rates and poor biomass retention persist 98 the investigation of the adsorption efficiency by gao et al 99 of tetracycline by go reveals that the removal of tetracycline is achieved majorly through a π π and cation π interactions with a maximum monolayer adsorption capability is 313 mg g and it decreases with increase in the solution s ph or the sodium ions concentration moreira et al 100 demonstrated the simultaneous adsorption and degradation of norfloxacin nor in an aqueous matrix by go the authors reported that the 8 layers go was created through oxidation or exfoliation of the enlarged graphite using a modified hummer s method the removal capacity of the go adsorbent was 374 9 29 8 mg g with higher input from the no r in the zwitterionic form and removes about 94 8 the intra particle diffusion process as measured by boyd s model and fick s law contributed more to the removal process and reaches equilibrium half hour after it began finally the process underwent scale up in a single stage batch adsorber with a 95 efficiency of nor removal rajabi et al 101 also reported the treatment of hazardous chemical and strong mutagen ethidium monoazide bromide ema from aqueous solution using a go adsorbent surface the authors also reported on the investigation of variables such as solution temperature contact time ethidium monoazide bromide initial concentration and ph affecting the process ema adsorption result on go the optimum time and ph respectively were 17 min and ph 10 the authors reported its maximum adsorptive efficiency of 76 92 mg g at 303 k 3 3 radioactive biowaste treatment radionuclide application in medicine is a well established field when utilized appropriately in a variety of medical applications for diagnostic therapeutic and research purposes radioactive materials have been found to be extremely effective 106 their usefulness market availability and reasonable price also make radioactive substances desirable handling these materials has invariably led to the generation of biomedical radioactive waste in form of residues and by products the amount and type of waste produced differ according to the size of the medical application and the radionuclides used classification of radioactive waste can be made depending on various attributes as shown in fig 4 with the exception of some medium level waste the majority of hospital radioactive waste is low level waste low energy and emitters with short half lives the nuclear industry and nuclear reactors are typically associated with high level waste 107 different types of radionuclides are utilized in hospitals and medical centers for in vivo and in vitro applications they have been implemented for diagnostics research and therapeutic uses radioactive waste could be generated as solid or liquid wastes from radionuclide medical applications 108 the major sources of liquid radioactive waste can be seen in fig 5 the radioactive waste management plan must be exhaustive and take into account all facets from radionuclide procurement to the final release of waste packages from the facility for disposal discharge a good management plan should consider both original and secondary waste sources the latter being from subsequent treatment and conditioning of the original in any case that waste generation can be avoided or at least minimized it should be implemented as the most preferable option when waste prevention cannot be implemented other approaches have been adopted for instance in some countries diluting the overall radionuclide content of waste is permitted under certain conditions non radioactive wastes are used to dilute low level radioactive waste in order to meet the regulatory specifications 106 in order to ensure safe discharge into the environment liquid radioactive waste must meet extremely stringent requirements concerning radioactive substance limits and other impurities the treatment of liquid radioactive waste frequently involves the application of several steps such as filtration precipitation sorption chemical precipitation sedimentation flocculation ion exchange 109 evaporation and or membrane separation to meet the requirements for both the release of decontaminated effluents into the environment and the conditioning of waste concentrates for disposal 110 111 dulama et al 112 used membrane technology combined with inorganic sorbents for the treatment of radioactive liquid waste containing cesium 137cs the study found that using natural zeolite in the pre treatment stage resulted in greater 137cs removal efficiencies which were credited to the affinity of the materials for 137cs subsequently various materials including inorganic adsorbents have been successfully employed to mitigate radioactive waste as an alternative treatment technology they possess high exchange capacity possible selectivity and specificity and are resistant to radioactive radiation emerging processes bearing higher efficiency in recent times have been used in radioactive decontamination membrane technologies particularly pressure driven ones such as reverse osmosis microfiltration and ultrafiltration play a large role in these processes membrane technologies outperform traditional processes in several ways including lower energy consumption no chemical addition operation at low temperatures and ease of scaling up furthermore a suitable combination of different processes can simultaneously remove radioactive organic and biological substances these processes have been used successfully in the treatment of a variety radioactive effluents fouling on the other hand is a major issue in membrane processes and can be caused by inorganic organic or even biological substances membrane fouling reduces the flux that passes through the membrane degrades permeate quality reduces membrane life and raises operating costs membrane fouling can be reduced by using appropriate pretreatment operating parameters including composite membranes matrices by the inclusion of tio2 zno and graphene oxide nanomaterials with benefits such as thermal physical and chemical stability other alternatives such as graphene oxide and mixed matrix membranes provide higher biofouling resistance long term stability and possible regeneration of membrane material 4 graphene based nanocomposites the performance of graphene adsorbents is mostly determined by their uniform dispersion in solution as well as their high sorption capacity to a variety of contaminants graphene often has a high affinity to aggregate or even roll to form graphite during liquid processing 113 aggregation can limit its adsorptive applicability by obstructing active sorption sites limiting theoretical surface area and impeding rapid mass transfer due to the electrostatic repulsion between them go has a low binding affinity to anionic dyes furthermore due to its high solubility go cannot be regenerated easily from wastewater treatment resulting in secondary pollution to the environment hence its application in pollutant treatment is limited 114 all of these aforementioned drawbacks can be overcome by functionalizing go with various covalent or non covalent dissimilar molecules polymers and nanoparticles resulting in the development of composites a class of multicomponent materials 115 the composite that results is more than just the sum of the separate components it is a new substance with new functionalities and qualities 116 the synthesis method and surface area of various graphene based nanocomposites reported from recent works is presented in table 3 summarizes the recent works in the development of graphene composites materials as a result of their enormous surface area enhanced stability avoiding π π stacking between and numerous active sites for adsorption graphene based materials have attracted a lot of interest as appealing candidate for adsorptive removal of contaminants from water 117 the underlying adsorption principles are used to design graphene based adsorbents for target pollutants better understanding of graphene based adsorption performance and how it relates to the interactions between pollutants and adsorbents is crucial for the future development of graphene based functional materials and their practical applications 118 nagarajan et al 116 reported the fabrication of magnesium nanocomposites decorated with multilayer graphene mg and its application in pollutant treatment in a recent study the bet surface area of the developed graphene based nanocomposite was found to be 1480 m2 g the synthesis of polypyrrole functionalized cobalt oxide graphene copygo nanocomposite via hydrothermal method was explored by anuma et al 119 the authors reported the bet surface area of 133 m2 g verma et al 120 functionalized graphene oxide chitosan with edta for inorganic and organic pollutants treatment the bet surface area of 1 326 m2 g was reported by the authors the fabrication of graphene hydrogel decorated on nickel with bet surface area of 67 84 m2 g was explored by ebratkhahan et al 121 chen et al 114 also reported the bet surface area 41 54 m2 g for the fabrication of carbon layer encapsulated fe3o4 graphene oxide nanocomposites rich in amino and thiol groups fe3o4 c go 5 biomedical treatment using graphene based nanocomposites graphene is fundamentally a monatomic graphite layer a mineral rich allotrope of carbon made up of tightly bonded carbon atoms organized in a hexagonal lattice as a result of its sp2 hybridization and extremely thin atomic thickness of 0 345 nm graphene is a very distinct material 76 however its hydrophobic nature which makes it insoluble in hydrophilic solvents like water limits its application in water purification in order to overcome this limitation the hydrophobic nature must be compromised to improve its affinity to aqueous solution graphene s have been modified by adding functional groups on its surface through chemical modification covalent or noncovalent functionalization giving rise to the graphene based nanomaterials owing to their attractive properties which include water solubility low toxicity very good water dispersibility antibacterial activity high adsorption rate graphene based nanomaterials have more advantages over other materials such as high adsorption rate high dispersion rate and antibacterial activity which makes them a better choice for biomedical wastewater treatment 123 recently graphene based materials have received a lot of attention as potential adsorbents for wastewater treatment in wastewater treatment graphene is an intriguing carbon material having distinct advantages over other adsorbents such as activated carbon carbon nanotubes chitosan clay and zeolite graphene is an appealing material for use in wastewater treatment considering its increased surface area for adsorption of biomedical contaminant species as well as the possible chemical modifications and composite fabrication 124 125 as earlier stated the modifiable chemical properties of graphene alongside its large surface area highly delocalized π electrons positions them as very captivating and auspicious for usage to adsorb pollutants in wastewater and address environmental sustainability concerns however vehement inter planar interactions make graphene nano layers jointly incline and also recombine to produce graphite as a result of tough electrostatic repulsion between graphene oxide and negatively charged compounds the binding affinity between them is weak notwithstanding the possibility of graphene alongside graphene oxide not composing and coming off decontaminated effluents leads to serious re contamination overcoming these disadvantages is possible by functionalizing covalently or non covalently using different molecules and other nanoparticles through which nanocomposites multi component material groups are produced where one phase is dispersed into another in the nanometric range 126 several researchers have shown the high adsorption capacity of graphene based materials and most studies consider solution ph ionic strength and temperature as essential parameters in biomedical pollutants treatment in addition to the adsorbent s intrinsic properties 127 adsorption interactions are non covalent interactions that occur between pollutants and graphene based materials as presented in fig 6 however the true nature of such interactions such as electrostatic hydrogen bonds hydrophobic and van der waals interactions as well as their relative contributions are hotly debated 100 their surface chemistry heavily influences the adsorption and photocatalytic properties of graphene based materials oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of go have two opposing effects on adsorption capacity adsorption can be boosted by increasing the water solubility on the surface of a surface charge however there is a reduction in adsorption sites by the water clusters produced on the surface the oxygen concentration of graphene oxide on the other hand increases the adsorption of contaminants such as amino acids and hydroxyl groups via strong hydrogen or lewis interactions 128 gao et al 99 developed the go as a potential adsorbent for the removal of significant concerns tetracycline antibiotics from aqueous environment the authors observed that the tetracycline was deposited strongly via π π interaction and cation π bonding on the surface go the adsorption equilibrium data was found to fits well the langmuir and temkin isotherm model with theoretical maximum of adsorption capacity 313 mg g the adsorption kinetics was well described by pseudo second order model komal et al 6 conducted an extensive study to evaluate the effect of percentage load of functionalized graphene oxide on the development of various forms of modified go supported with functionalized cellulose nanofibers cnf obtained from excess biomass for the treatment of toxic drug species from aqueous environments the authors assessed the adsorptive performance of the developed nanohybrids for the treatment of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and optimized their performance varying adsorbent loading ph and initial drug concentration furthermore different kinetic and isotherm adsorption models were studied to investigate adsorbent properties and the adsorption process the adsorptive capability of functionalized cnf was significantly improved by its easy aggregation with functionalized graphene oxide the results of the experiments revealed that a 20 wt loading of carboxylated go within the perforated surface of esterified cnfs showed excellent adsorption efficiency with peak at 45 04 mg g for ciprofloxacin and 85 30 mg g for ofloxacin uptake the interaction of electronegative functional groups and deficient structure found on cip with aromatic structure found within go basal planes and functionalized go edges can explain the underlying chemisorption mechanism hydrogen bonding is also an influential feature whereby cip molecules adhere to the nanocomposite surface because both the adsorbent and adsorbate moieties contain a lot of oxygen and hydrogen rich functional groups the possibility of regeneration and reusability of nanocomposites opens up enormous possibilities for low cost long term sorbent material development for pharmaceutical pollution management januário et al 17 recently reported on the use of go functionalized activated carbon gac go for the efficient uptake of pharmaceuticals for covid 19 treatment from water this study aimed to remove water contaminated with chloroquine and dipyrone using batch adsorption processes in this study the authors discovered that the equilibrium time for chloroquine and dipyrone adsorption was 18 and 12 h respectively the adsorption of chloroquine and dipyrone onto gac go fits the langmuir model best and follows pseudo second order thermodynamic studies revealed that the process is endothermic with adsorption capacity of 37 65 and 62 43 mg g at its peak at 318 k respectively the main mechanism of the underlying adsorption process was attributed to hydrogen bonds and π interactions between chloroquine and gac go mortazavi et al 129 reported that go was simultaneously subjected to thermal reduction and chemical bonding on the surface of amino functionalized sand particles afsps and was employed to adsorb naphthalene and acenaphthene from aquatic environments the experimental data were fitted to the langmuir redlich peterson and dubinin radushkevich models for naphthalene adsorption and the redlich peterson and freundlich models for acenaphthene adsorption according to the equilibrium results analysis the kinetic studies reveal both adsorbate s adsorption process proceeds the pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models naphthalene and acenaphthene had maximum adsorption capacities of 7 473 and 18 152 mg g respectively adsorption mechanisms in this study includes π π stacking and hydrophobic interactions during thermal reduction go lose most of its functional groups and amino functionalized sand particles were coated with rgo as a hydrophobic layer which promotes hydrophobic interaction between rgo and the adsorbates naphthalene and acenaphthene the stacking mechanism is another adsorption mechanism that could be responsible for adsorption capabilities zhang et al 130 outstanding polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf pb graphene oxide go adjusted membrane was synthesized through phase inversion for a small amount radio nuclide cesium 137cs adsorption from wastewater the authors reported that integration of go increased pb diffusivity and the pvdf pb go membrane displayed the largest cs uptake effectiveness of 99 6 moreover the membrane displayed conspicuous selectivity and reusability towards small quantity of radioactive cesium even in the presence of extreme co existing ions and in real water which showed convincingly that the membrane has potential for usage two pathways were suggested to account for cs adsorption behavior unto modified pvdf pb go membrane firstly the xps survey revealed that the nfe binding of pb was replaced by c n cs with the elimination of fe 2p3 after adsorption suggesting that fe cn 6 4 defect sites could as well be active adsorption sites furthermore the adsorption of cs can also be attributed to oxygen containing surface functional groups oh group and c o stretch on the surface of go as evidenced by ft ir spectra analysis ma et al 131 investigated the utilization of go membrane in the adsorption of cs i and sr ii from wastewater the authors observed that cs i and sr ii ions diffused quickly through graphene oxide membranes but the lanthanide ions and actinide ions are slower making them to separate based on the variation in hydrated ionic radii furthermore the initial metallic ion concentrations and acidity in the solution of the feed affected ion transport through the graphene oxide membranes larger concentrations of initial metallic ions and acidity of the feed solution favored cs i and sr ii adsorption in another recent study by yang et al 132 the sorption of radioactive waste u vi onto a synthesized novel magnetic composite graphene oxide fe3o4 glucose cooh go fe3o4 gc was investigated at optimum adsorption conditions an initial concentration of 10 mgl 1 5 0 ph value and sorbent dosage of 0 15 g l the maximum adsorption capacity was observed to be 390 70 mg g at 30 mins of contact time the observable higher u vi uptake and faster adsorption rate when compared to previously reported studies was credited to abundant presence of go showing its effectiveness as an absorbent and potential for industrial use adsorption behavior could be explained by the dubinin radushkevich d r model which fitted well with the equilibrium data and showed a physical adsorption process taking place e 8 kjmol 1 while the best fit for the adsorption kinetic parameter is pseudo second order indicating a high level of complexation between u vi ions and organic functional groups observed on the as manufactured nanocomposite alothman et al 133 fabricated γ cyclodextrin graphene oxide nanocomposite for the treatment of tetracycline and chlortetracycline antibiotics removal from aqueous environment the authors reported that the adsorption optimum conditions under studied were concentration of 400 mg l 30 min adsorbent time ph 8 0 adsorbent dose 1 0 g l and temperature of 278 k the adsorption of tetracycline and chlortetracycline was described best by the freundlich model suggesting a multilayer adsorption the maximum percentage treatment of tetracycline and chlortetracycline were found to be 91 25 and 93 75 respectively the adsorption process was revealed to follow pseudo second kinetic order reaction and liquid film diffusion kinetic model the thermodynamics study revealed degree of freedom increase exothermic and spontaneous in nature the hydrogen bonding and π π interactions were adsorption mechanism of adsorption the fabrication of copper nanoparticles immobilized β cyclodextrin modified reduced graphene oxide cu β cd rgo were developed successfully as an effective extractor of tetracycline tc oxytetracycline otc and doxycycline dc antibiotics from various aqueous environment was explored by yakout et al 134 the authors revealed that tcs are deposited strongly cu β cd rgo nanocomposite matrix via surface complexation with the cu nanoparticles besides the formation of inclusion complexes with β cyclodextrin and π π interaction of reduced graphene oxide the maximum adsorption capacity of cu β cd rgo evaluated from the langmuir isotherm model was found 403 2 mg g 476 2 mg g and 434 8 mg g for tc otc and dc respectively it was concluded that the prepared novel nanocomposite demonstrated a quick and highly effective treatment performance for the antibiotic pollutant treatment yang et al 15 reported the synthesis of graphene oxide modified κ carrageenan sodium alginate go κ car sa gel for the removal of ciprofloxacin cip and ofloxacin ofl it was revealed by the authors that go nanosheets addition improves the mechanical strength and anti swelling property of the double network hydrogel making it possible for the application in the fixed bed column system the maximum adsorption capacity calculated for cip and ofl adsorption onto go κ car sa gel were 272 18 and 197 39 mg g the authors also reported that the go κ car sa gel was observed always to be negatively charged suggesting that adsorption capacity of the gel is better in an acidic environment recently andrade et al 135 reported the preparation of graphene oxide go anchored on iron oxide nanoparticles αγ fe2o3 and cobalt oxide co3o4 for the removal of caffeine in a batch adsorption the go αγ fe2o3co3o4 adsorbent was reported to have demonstrated about 80v removal coupled maximum adsorption capacity of 28 94 mg g the adsorption kinetics as well as the adsorption go αγ fe2o3co3o4 was reported to follow a pseudo second order kinetics and better fitted to the langmuir and temkin models isotherms adsorption data the thermodynamic variables studied revealed that the adsorption process was exothermic spontaneous and favorable 6 adsorption isotherm and kinetic studies studies of isotherm and kinetics of adsorption experiment is a way of understanding probable mechanisms as well as pathways associated with the process generally the adsorption isotherms refer to the quantity of pollutant adsorbed with the pollutant s concentration in the substrate at equilibrium it is also needed to evaluate the adsorbent s efficiency for removing contaminants and investigate the surface properties 136 an earlier study of adsorption isotherms shows the most frequently used isotherms are freundlich and langmuir isotherms as shown in table 4 137 the availability of several proved isotherms established on various assumptions and instances the closest to the real case is fitted to the experimental data consequently the study of the isotherms statistically is done to detect the models that depict and best fits the process of contaminants removal from effluents after analysis by several categories of nanoadsorbents 138 graphene and its derivatives have risen as a novel material for usage as efficacious material to be applied in wastewater treatment due to their exceptional properties such as large number of functional groups high surface area and exceptional charge carrier mobility gr based materials are exploited as sorbents for effluent decontamination wu et al 142 reported the removal of doxorubicin hydrochloride from an aqueous solution using go the authors found that the maximum adsorption capacity was 1428 57 mg and concluded that the langmuir model fit better experimental data than the freundlich model sulfamethoxazole smx uptake by graphene oxide was studied by nam et al 143 it was discovered that freundlich model had a better fit for the adsorption isotherm data than langmuir model based on the correlation coefficients in the study of tc uptake using fe3o4 sio2 chitosan go mscg the isotherms of adsorption were simulated with both freundlich and langmuir equations the authors revealed the appropriateness of freundlich model more than langmuir for tetracycline removal the removal of oxytetracycline otc and tc by fe3o4 g was investigated by zhang et al 144 the result obtained showed higher correlation coefficient with the langmuir model than freundlich model langmuir r2 0 990 and 0 924 freundlich 0 986 and 0 921 for tc and otc respectively suggesting a monolayer adsorption and uniform distribution of adsorption site wang et al 145 investigated the effective adsorption of tc hydrochloride antibiotics with synthesized zr based mof composite uio 66 cooh 2 go the result obtained for r2 when compared showed that the experimental data best fits the langmuir model 0 9935 r2 0 9967 than freundlich model 0 9401 r2 0 9872 revealing mono layer mechanism of interaction and uniform tc uptake on the mof go and go cmc carboxymethylcellulose nanomaterials were synthesized in films by juengchareonpoon et al 146 it was also restructured with citric acid crosslinks for adsorption of antibiotics the obtained results revealed maximum adsorption capability of 370 93 256 68 and 102 05 mg g for trimethoprim oxolinic acid and oxytetracycline respectively at 30 c suksompong et al 147 studied the possibility of adsorbing iodine 131 from a hydrous solution using go chitosan sponges the adsorption efficiency was studied making use of stable isotopes and further studied using iodine 131 radioisotopes for confirmation of results the experimental data fitted well with the langmuir model the value of rl separated factor obtained was between 0 and 1 substantiating the favourability of the adsorption of iodide using go chitosan sponges with maximum adsorptive capability of 0 263 mbq mg alothman et al 133 also synthesized γ cyclodextrin go nanocomposite for the uptake of tc and chloro tc antibiotics from water the authors revealed that the sorption followed langmuir model the highest percentage removal of tc and chloro tc were 91 25 and 93 75 respectively at different ph values feng et al 148 developed novel go cof 300 ppy sorbent via hydrothermal method to adsorb indomethacin idm and diclofenac dcf from water the results reveal the adsorption capability and uptake efficacy of indomethacin and diclofenac by go 2cof 300 4ppy is high at 99 for indomethacin and 97 for diclofenac 115 mg g and 138 mg g respectively the authors also revealed that adsorption of indomethacin and diclofenac onto go 2cof 300 4ppy conformed to the langmuir isothermal model yang et al 16 studied the removal of enrofloxacin enf onto go the authors concluded that the langmuir freundlich model gave the best fit of adsorption process with an adsorption capacity of 45 035 mg g adsorption kinetic models are highly crucial for predicting optimal conditions especially for batch adsorption processes 149 kinetic modeling gives robust interpretation concerning adsorption forces interactions which reveals the entire adsorption mechanism and potential rate controlling steps like mass transport or processes involving chemical reaction some widely explored models include pseudo first and pseudo second order elovich equation and intraparticle diffusion 150 but recently the pseudo first and the pseudo second order are the most explored kinetic model equations the linear form equation of the models mentioned above is depicted in table 5 the pseudo first order kinetic model physisorption as the basis of adsorption process occurring without any chemical bonding and only through weak van der waals forces the adsorption process is easily reversible which allows for a near effortless regeneration according to the pseudo second order two reactions occur either simultaneously or sequentially given that the initial reaction is quick it reaches equilibrium quickly meanwhile the second reaction proceeds steadily and takes longer to arrive at equilibrium 150 adsorption occurs via chemisorption as indicated by the pseudo second order it is concluded that bonding occurs as a result of electronic sharing and that the transfer between adsorbents and adsorbate is relatively stronger than the physisorption pathway from pseudo first order kinetics 138 understanding the kinetics of antibiotic adsorption on graphene graphene based nanomaterials is essential to the adsorption mechanism and spent graphene graphene based nanomaterials which is closely related to the diffusive state of graphene materials adsorption of antibiotics by graphene oxide with good diffusivity is fast go with good dispersibility can adsorb antibiotics quickly but gr and reduced graphene oxide rgo with low diffusive need more time to reach equilibrium 27 zhu et al 153 reported that gr exhibited swift adsorption capability and attained equilibrium in 3 min and the removal process fitted well into the pseudo second order kinetic model compared to the pseudo first order model song et al 154 discovered that the pseudo second order kinetic model better fitted the kinetics of tc and sulfamethazine removal by reducing graphene oxides than the pseudo first order model wang et al 155 reported a similar result using mcgo to remove cip these facts suggest antibiotics removal by graphene gbnps is mainly controlled by chemical adsorption through the exchange or pairing of electrons between adsorbates hiew et al 156 investigated removal of diclofenac using graphene oxide go the authors reported pso model as the optimal representation of the kinetic of diclofenac adsorption in another study ninwiwek et al 157 prepared mesoporous silica magnetic graphene oxide nanocomposite material mgosi for the uptake of sulfamethoxazole smx the results shows the mgo si removed the sulfamethoxazole molecules more efficiently than the pristine magnetic go with the kinetic data exhibiting good correlation based on the pso model radmehr et al 158 displayed the production and efficient deployment of renewable sorbents based on go i e nizral layered double hydroxide graphene oxide chitosan nizral ldh go cs nc for nalidixic acid uptake the kinetics of the nalidixic acid being adsorbed on ldh go cs was examined by the authors using pfo kinetic model the pseudo pso ipd and elovich mechanism and discovered the r2 values are positioned between 0 9884 and 0 9966 giving a well fitted nalidixic acid removal by ldh go cs nc as shown by the pseudo second order model zou et al 159 reported the one pot fabrication of fe2o3 nanoparticles growth on rgo for the adsorptive uptake of chlortetracycline tetracycline and oxytetracycline the authors reported that the adsorption of chlortetracycline tetracycline and oxytetracycline onto fe2o3 rgo nanocomposites take 20 min and is highly ph dependent because of the enhanced repulsive interaction at high and low ph and that the adsorptions fit well the pso equations jaswal et al 160 also reported the utilization of rgo mos2heterostructure for the treatment of ofloxacin from the aqueous phase it was found from the result that the adsorption of ofloxacin onto rgo mos2 followed pseudo second order kinetics 7 photocatalytic degradation of biomedical waste several chemical treatment methods such as ozonation chlorination and fenton s oxidation have undergone developments for removing antibiotic remains from wastewater however difficult or extensively prolonged process in obtaining total decomposition and possible destruction of desirable organisms because of their low selectivity leading to undesirable losses are major drawbacks to these methods 161 in addition to the above the process incurs high economic capital and operational cost although integration of physical processes substantially reduces the noxiousness of water containing antibiotics after treatment it is a rather knotty and expensive process 162 sequel to adsorption active groups such as oh o2 present in sunlight visible light or uv light released by photocatalysts are used to disintegrate antibiotics into unharmful quantities efficiently therefore photocatalytic decomposition is one of the high ranking processes for removing antibiotic contaminants from the environment due to its high efficiency and sustainability 161 as a result of its exceptional advantages such as its powerful redox potential no adsorption engorgement the possibility of totally degrading organic contaminant into unharmful inorganic matter e g co2 and h2o inexpensiveness mild reaction conditions close to room temperature and atmospheric pressure extraction of oxygen in air for the production of highly potent oxidants and solar radiation energy photocatalysis possesses extensive prospect of application in environmental reclamation 163 therefore photocatalysis has progressively attracted global interest and broad application in novel energy extraction and techniques for environmental control the fundamental principle of photodegradation is the excitement and movement of electrons from their valance band into the conduction band after exposure to radiation with energy higher than its optical band gap which produces equal quantity of positively charged holes in the valance band 164 when the potential of the valence band vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe exhibits higher positivity than h2o oh 272 v vs nhe or oh oh 189 v vs nhe and the potential of conduction band vs nhe is more negative than o2 o2 0 33 v vs nhe the semiconductor will be able to generate oh and o2 thereafter separation and migration to the semiconductors surface of the photoinduced electrons and holes occurs and redox reactions will take place at the reactive site on the semiconductor surface the mechanism of semiconductor photocatalysis reaction fig 7 is given by the equations 161 165 1 semiconductor light energy λ e g semiconductor e cb h vb 2 h vb h 2 o h oh h 2 o oh 2 72 v vs nhe 3 h vb oh oh oh oh 1 89 v vs nhe 4 e

electroconductivity in reposition and swift electron transport and minimal expenditure for large scale production makes graphene a prospective photocatalyst and has been extensively used for photocatalytic decomposition of antibiotic pollutant in water 26 27 nonetheless catalytic activities are easily lost by graphene planes during its self accumulation process 167 and research reveals the inability of go a significant component of graphene based nanomaterials to function under visible light as a result of low 1 79 ev band gap 168 this necessitates the combination of graphene with different photocatalysts to produce new graphene based photocatalysts to overcome these disadvantages and enhance the catalytic operation of antibiotics recently several steps have been taken to manufacture and produce graphene based photocatalyst to enhance their capability to decompose antibiotic pollutants examples are single semiconductor coupled semiconductor metal coated single semiconductor and metal coated coupled semiconductor single semiconductors include metallic compounds and organometallic model such as titanium oxide bi based oxides zinc oxide silver tetraoxophosphate and many more they have been used to photocatalytically decompose organic contaminants the metal based hybrid nanocomposites material is redox capable and has a high charge separation efficiency all of these factors are critical for the efficient photocatalytic breakdown of organic contaminants fig 4 depicts the photocatalytic mechanism of a metal metal oxide decorated graphene sheet for organic pollutant degradation mohamed et al 169 found that the multifunctional effects of ag ca and go on the structural characteristics of the graphene based composite increased the photocatalytic activity of ag cdse go ca nanocomposites according to the authors go acts as an electron acceptor increasing the effectiveness of removing photo generated carriers as well as the combined composite carrier perera et al 170 created tio2 nanotube reduced graphene oxide composites using an alkaline hydrothermal technique the photocatalytic activity of the composites was shown to be highly influenced by the rgo tio2 ratio due to its high surface area and excellent electron hole separation the composite with 10 rgo had the highest photocatalytic activity with a threefold improvement in photocatalytic efficiency over pure tio2 nanotubes under uv and visible light pan et al 171 employed the application of hydrothermal method to fabricate go tio2 nanowires and nanoparticles tio2 nanowires disperse more uniformly on graphene with less agglomeration than tio2 nanoparticles resulting in more direct contact between tio2 and graphene and thus enhanced electron hole pair separation and transportation as a result go tio2 nanowires outperform go tio2 nanoparticles pure tio2 nanowires and tio2 nanoparticles in terms of relative photocatalytic activity the combination of graphene materials with coupled semiconductors have become a research area of focus because it usually possesses extensive benefits of improving the disintegration of electron hole pairs and retaining oxidation and reduction at two separate sites for reaction 172 composite photocatalysts nezno cds go was produced via a simplified hydrothermal process by huo et al 173 the composite showed significant photocatalytic activities preparation of hetero junction photocatalyst ag3po4 bivo4 rgo was a success through a simplified in situ deposition process tayel et al 174 discovered that coating tio2 with graphene oxide increased the tio2 catalytic activity by a factor of 1 2 the primary photocatalytic activity of tio2 resulted from the electron acceptance and go transport 31 the electrons accepted by go were produced on the tio2 surface in the presence of light which reduces electron hole recombination and increases the production of active holes 175 another reason for the increased titanium oxide photocatalytic activity was the reduction in the width of the tio2 band gap caused by the go addition this band gap narrowing allows the photocatalyst to produce radicals at elongated wavelengths several researchers have recently considered integrating two or more metallic oxides with go as a potential method for increasing catalytically enhanced activity when organic pollutant begin to degrade xu et al 2020 investigated the photocatalytic degradation activities of ciprofloxacin cip norfloxacin nor and tetracycline tc over a series of rgo bi4o5br2 the authors revealed from the results obtained that photodegradation of these target antibiotics almost never be possible without adding any photocatalysts the photodegradation of these antibiotics was successfully commenced by using bi4o5br2 nanosheets and rgo bi4o5br2 nanocomposites as photocatalysts as expected the degradation efficiency of each target antibiotic at any rgo bi4o5br2 nanocomposites is greater than that of bi4o5br2 nanosheet bi4o5br2 on the surface of the rgo bi4o5br2 nanocomposites can be excited to produce electrons e and holes h when illuminated by simulated sunlight the photogenerated holes can react efficiently with the target antibiotics pollutant to degrade them and to remove the photogenerated electron hole pairs effectively as a result of their excellent electron reservoir capability of rgo and conductivity photogenerated electrons can be transferred quickly to the rgo bi4o5br2 nanocomposite surface to reacted with o2 thus generating o2 radicals meanwhile the instantaneous formation of oh by the reaction of o2 radicals and h is also possible following that o2 and oh radicals can oxidize the target antibiotics adsorbed on the surface of the rgo bi4o5br2 nanocomposite to complete the photodegradation process fakhri and bagheri 176 reported the fabrication of uio 66 wg for the photocatalytic degradation tetracycline tc and malathion ma it was clearly reported by the authors that after photocatalytic efficiency of 84 and 100 was achieved for tc and ma respectively by uio 66 35wg as an optimum photocatalyst after 70 min of irradiation the uio 66 35wg showed enhanced response to visible light better separation of charge carriers good contacting between energy levels of components and more availability of active site that are responsible for its superior photodegradation efficiency in compared with pristine uio 66 the photocatalytic mechanism verified that o2 is main radical species involved in this process finally the authors concluded that precise positioning of energy levels belonging to components and the formation of an electrical field results in effective charge transfer and enhanced separation of electron hole pairs which is advantageous in a photocatalytic system wang et al 177 explored the fabrication of magnetic cobalt ferrite reduced graphene oxide cf rgo porous balls for effective photocatalytic degradation of oxytetracycline it was revealed that enhanced adsorption makes it easier for the photocatalyst to have strong interaction with otc thereby improving the degradation efficiency under visible light irradiation λ 420nm the light excited cf rgo 0 2 to produce electron hole pairs h exhibits strong oxidation capacity and can directly oxidize otc at the same time electrons are captured by rgo which effectively reduces the charge carrier recombination in addition the unique porous balls increase the light absorption capacity and provided more catalytic centers therefore cf rgo showed good photocatalytic activity in photocatalytic redox reaction with 84 7 degradation efficiency the trapping experiments revealed that holes h and superoxide radicals o2 played a crucial role in the degradation of otc implying a possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline tc under visible light using by reduced graphene oxide decorated moo3 tio2 nanocomposite was investigated by ali et al 178 according to the authors rgo decreases electron hole pair recombination by functioning as an acceptor of photo generated electrons from tio2 moo3 nanoparticles as a result it generates even more photo generated holes promoting the formation of reactive oxygen species and pollutant degradation surface imperfections on the tio2 moo3 surface of the rgo can retain electrons in this case and the intermediate product can then replicate surface defects via interfacial charge transfer the presence of defects that act as trapping centres can extend the lifetime of electrons or holes in metal oxide coupling and photocatalytic activity rises as rgo concentration increases the authors also reported that the excellent photo degradation impact of tc via the gr moo3 tio2 was due to the synergetic interfacial interaction of the graphene sheets and the moo3 tio2 furthermore the moo3 tio2 was utilized as a migration vehicle for the visible light carrier while the decreased graphene sheet s large surface area and number of active sites increased photocatalytic activity with almost 94 tc photodegraded during 80 min under visible light irradiation zhang et al 179 studied the photodegradation performance tetracycline tc onto pg tio2 under uv and visible light the authors observed that tio2 photocatalytic activity was discovered to be closely linked to its surface phase and the creation of a surface phase junction between anatase and rutile may facilitate spatial charge separation it was also observed that the pg might shift the light absorption edge from uv to visible light resulting in additional photogenerated electron holes furthermore there was a dual effect resulting from tio2 and pg combination which involves the enhancing adsorption of visible light while also improving the separation ability of e and h to significantly inhibit e and h recombination the authors proposed adsorption and photocatalytic mechanism is that first as an effective absorbent during dark conditions the pg and tio2 reactive interface would adsorb a large amount of tc molecules to the material s surface and into the confined area second under visible and uv light tio2 was bombarded with energy higher than the band gap while electrons e in the valence band could absorb the photon energy causing them to migrate to the conduction band and form electropositive holes h in the valence band thirdly to prevent charge recombination h and e moved from the interior to the surface of pg and the interface functioned as the activity sites by interacting with h2o h produced oh and electrons on the surface of pg tio2 produce o2 by absorbing o2 lastly the photocatalytic process involving active species o2 h and oh were involved in redox reactions which were responsible for the removal of tc via degradation of its molecules to form smaller organic molecules co2 and h2o ghorbanih and salem 180 reported the performance of hybridized materials containing graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes cnts to photocatalytically treat sewage released out of an industrial estate their findings revealed the capability of hybridized nanocomposites to treat the accumulated sewages at various steps of the industrial recovery process between the anaerobic system and the sand filter the suitable distribution ratio of graphene and cnts were calculated to be 3 33 the end result of parameters such as initial cod period of irradiation sewage collection position as well as ph on treatment performance were investigated the maximum photo activity was reached in 20 min by keeping the ph of the sewage at 8 the authors consider larger surface area of 60 m2 g and lower band gap energy of 2 1 ev as responsible ag3po4 graphene and ag3po4 graphene ag was synthesized by zhou et al 41 via chemical precipitation for the decomposition of sulfamethoxazole under synthetic solar radiation 1 ppm of sulfamethoxazole was almost totally degraded in 30 min using the two photocatalysts the integration of ag on ag3po4 graphene did not show any reasonable upgrade in its photocatalytic functionality for sulfamethoxazole decomposition as compared to its pure form the contribution of the ag load is therefore unclear and subject to further research hetero junction composites cao et al 181 found that photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline using magnetic go ce tio2 degraded 82 9 of the tetracycline priya et al 182 also accounted that ampicillin and oxytetracycline were photocatalytically degraded by bi2o3 biocl reinforced on chitosan and graphene sand composite with 95 ampicillin removal attained in 1 h solar light 175 the photocatalyst revealed 90 tc adsorption under visible light radiation 183 this is higher than those obtained from bivo4 ag3po4 bivo4 and rgo bivo4 which showed 56 82 and 78 adsorption respectively wang et al 137 successfully developed a c3n4 mnfe2o4 graphene composite for antibiotic degradation the four antibiotics studied were metronidazole amoxicillin tetracycline and ciprofloxacin and c3n4 mnfe2o4 grephene composites removed 94 5 of metronidazole which was approximately 3 5 times greater than pure g c3n4 guan et al 184 successfully fabricated z scheme photocatalyst for tc hydrochloride decomposition using bi2wo6 nanosheets graphene oxide and silver bromide nanomaterials the modified z scheme composite 15 agbr 5go bi2wo6 15a 5g bw showed increased intersurface charge separation and transmission because of go s exceptional electrical conductivity consequently 15a 5g bw showed the best tc hydrochloride photocatalytic activities under visible light radiation the peak decomposition effectiveness of 84 and the kinetic constant was found to be greater at 0 0515 min approximately 4 60 and 3 16 times than that of agbr and bi2wo6 respectively biobr mos2 graphene oxide bismuth oxybromide molybdenum disulfide go fabrication was reported used by li et al 185 to modify the capability of photocatalytic decomposition and adsorption of oxytetracycline otc the composites exhibited an excellent photocatalytic functionality for oxytetracycline decomposition in the presence of visible light radiation oxytetracycline doxycycline chloro tc were spontaneously adsorbed with over 98 decomposition rate in 40 min further studies can be undertaken taking into consideration the benefits of ion doping and coupled semiconductors towards improving photocatalytic activity and graphene composite synthesis alamgholiloo et al 186 fabricated a novel and effective go cubdc fe3o4 ternary nanocomposite for ciprofloxacin cip degradation according to the authors the ternary nanocomposite demonstrated the highest cip degradation rate 98 5 in 24 min with a rate constant of 0 191 min 1 the results showed that cu fe species and co groups in ternary nanocomposite catalyzed pms to the generation of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals for cip decomposition moreover the ternary nanocomposite demonstrated a high possibility of regeneration allowing the catalyst to be easily separated from reaction mixtures with an external magnet however radical quenching tests and electron paramagnetic resonance epr showed that hydroxyl and sulphate ions play an important part in the decomposition process according to hsieh et al 187 recent advances have been made in the treatment of wastewater from industrial and medical sector untreated antibiotics which are easily seen in effluents released by hospitals and manufacturers alike have drawn the attention of environmentalists the authors developed graphene quantum dot zno composites that were used as a photocatalyst for metronidazole degradation the results revealed an ultra high removal efficiency 100 and a substantially increased reaction rate constant that was 1 74 times above the pristine sample in summary n gqds improve visible light absorption and increase photo induced charge carriers this is due to the n functionalized gqds having a smaller optical band gap 3 0 to 3 5 ev thereby propelling charge transfer in the heterostructure improving photocurrent generation and restricting electron hole recombination from pristine zno crystals exposed to uv light 8 recyclability of graphene based nanomaterials due to its low economic cost and environmental sustainability graphene has been widely applied in industrial applications high quality product yield at minimal cost implication is a major consideration in any industrial process however as compared to lab scale conditions the industrial application is tougher and more complex the stability and reusability of graphene must therefore be high for it to be considered for continuous process development for industrial application 188 a major advantage of graphene based nanomaterials is their stableness recyclability and ability to regenerate from a solution high adsorption capability should not be the only criteria for an excellent adsorbent but also outstanding desorption capacity which will significantly increase the effectiveness and reduce operational cost therefore reusability and desorption are pertinent for graphene based nanomaterials to be applied commercially 189 graphene based adsorbents must be subjected to separation from the medium regeneration and recycling after utilization in effluent decontamination the small particle size of these sorbents makes it difficult and strenuous to separate 190 although rgo is derived from go it differs significantly from go in terms of thermophysical properties as a result of the oxygen containing functional groups present in go phonon scattering occurs resulting in extremely low thermal conductivity of go however oxygen containing functional groups can be removed to some extent and thermal conductivity will be increased following the reduction process 191 several methods have been deployed to efficiently separate graphene based sorbents from wastewater among which the most handing is centrifugation crossflow filtration field flow fractionation and electric field 192 mu et al 193 also described the development of 3 dimensional nanostructured composite sorbents of rgo and wo3 rgo wo3 for the removal of strontium ion sr2 from aqueous solutions adsorption isotherms reveal the experimental data well fitted the langmuir isotherm r 0 99 and the peak adsorption capability of 149 56 mg g was attained which is m greater than that of go wo3 and other close related sorbents treatment of sr2 by rgo wo3 attained equilibrium in 3 h 20 min the abundant treatment sites made available by the diffused wo3 nanoparticles on the reduced graphene oxide surface made treatment rate faster and higher for rgo wo3 moreso the presence of sodium ions has no discernible impact on the adsorption of sr2 ions on rgo wo3 and the adsorption desorption experiment with rgo wo3 sorbent is recyclable at least 5 times without substantial adsorption capability loss xiao et al 194 investigated desorption of antibiotics from prepared molybdenum di sulfide graphene oxide supported magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 go mos2 using acetonitrile can as eluent desorption was obtained as 90 2 87 8 and 85 6 for pazcofloxacin lecofloxacin and gatifloxacin respectively they also carried out reusability tests under ideal conditions the study s findings revealed that the fe3o4 go mos2 material could be reused 10 times without significant loss qiao et al 195 synthesized mgo zno nanocomposites mz which was used in the removal of tetracycline tc the maximum adsorption capability of 1590 28 mg g observed in their study recyclability studies showed that mz could be recycled up to four times with no apparent decrease in photocatalytic activity resulting from incomplete desorption of tc alamgholiloo et al 186 used a green solvothermal technique to fabricate a novel ternary nanocomposite go cubdc fe3o4 which was employed in degrading ciprofloxacin cip antibiotic a 98 5 removal rate was observed for cip and still showed good degradation capability after four cycles signifying the stability of the catalyst the synergistic effect of magnetic particle coupling with graphene or go can be the panacea to resolving the challenges that graphene separation poses according to bulin et al 196 magnetization enables the practical use of go in the production of adsorbents this is because very little energy is required which can be achieved by the use of an external magnetic field to provide excellent separation 29 197 the high chemical stability of magnetic graphene oxide mgo and its nanocomposites make it desirable and gradually position itself as an emergent and efficient treatment technology the efficacy of mgo has been studied and can be used extensively in treating aqueous biomedical effluents including radionuclides and antibiotics a contaminant of emerging concern moreover mgo has good hydrophilic and magnetic properties and has been observed to be more stably dispersed in aqueous solution in addition it reduces the chances of severe agglomeration and nanosheet restacking allowing for easy solid liquid separation process mgo is created by modifying magnetic materials such as ferric oxide to go 197 mgo can be made reusable by treatment mineral acids and bases at low concentration such as hcl hno3 naoh and sodium carbonate the capacity for adsorption and regeneration is equal or even greater than other sorbents when compared ullah et al 198 synthesized reduced mgo polyaniline rmgo pani as a sorbent for the adsorption of moxifloxacin mox and ofloxacin ofl from the aqueous samples they achieved adsorption efficacy of 99 for mox and 96 for ofl the adsorbent was reused repeatedly 10 times maintaining an excellent removal capacity shi et al 2020 synthesized cds reduced graphene rgo znfe2o4 zfo nanocomposite system to attain efficacious photo fenton decomposition of tetracycline tc in the presence of visible light radiation the authors found out that cds rgo zfo composite material adsorbed 80 of tc mineralized at a 59 2 in 1 h attributable to the photo fenton synergistic effect in cds rgo zfo with the capacity of producing and degrading h2o2 meanwhile the cds rgo zfo photocatalyst s prominent magnetic recovery property ensured economic benefits the cds rgo zfo adsorbent was reused after 4 cycles the recyclability of graphene based nanomaterials based on cycle of used with various biomedical pollutants is presented in table 6 9 future perspectives the potential of graphene and its composites in wastewater treatment application towards the removal of biomedical pollutants and toxic compounds is significant novel treatment methods were developed years ago and their performance can be improved by incorporating novel functional materials like go and graphene based nanoparticles simultaneous adsorption and photodegradation is now seen as a new strategy in biomedical wastewater treatment beyond phase transfer offering degradation and possible mineralization of pollutants studying the influential factors and underlying mechanism that accompany the treatment process will also go a long way to improve the understanding and subsequent applicability of these materials researchers are also beginning to introduce graphene and its derivatives into traditional photocatalyst like zno and tio2 the success of this hybrid nanoparticle has been validated by recent research which positions it as one of the most promising technologies in wastewater decontamination and treatment 208 209 however the treatment efficacy for real biomedical waste considering the presence of multiple contaminants is yet unknown and should be further looked into little work relating to process optimization methods such as taguchi and response surface methodology have been carried out research on optimal conditions that ensure maximum treatment efficiency is encouraged if full scale deployment and industrial application is going to be achieved life cycle assessment studies that map out raw material acquisition synthesis use and disposal are encouraged to reduce its environmental impact and ensure sustainability 10 conclusion the benefits of medicine and medical healthcare are undisputed however production and extensive use has resulted in waste generation and biomedical pollution with current innovation development and advanced medical technology there are new challenges such as biomedical waste management for instance the amount of waste generated during production of pharmaceuticals varies greatly in amount and type 200 to 30 000 kg of wastes per kg of active ingredients can be generated relatively higher than the actual finished product existing treatment methods cannot meet quality threshold values regulations while government authorities impose stricter measures medical facilities are thus faced with challenges associated with adequate treatment of the waste and effluents they generate more advanced technologies have been sought as conventional methods can no longer handle emerging contaminants vis à vis the stricter regulatory guidelines high surface area improved chemical properties lower cost and high regeneration capacity for reuse make nanomaterials advantageous for treatment processes in wastewater management and decontamination graphene and graphene oxide go are a unique nanomaterial for water and wastewater treatment they possess inherent chemical and physicochemical properties such as good biocompatibility high surface area optical thermal and electrical conductivities making them unique and very suitable for decontaminating wastewater nevertheless little has been extensive research for possibility of its application in

12698,untreated biomedical wastes discharged into water bodies primarily by hospitals and health care facilities release a wide range of contaminants that poses danger to human health and environmental sustainability therefore developing sustainable and dependable treatment methods for biomedical waste is a top priority nano sized graphene is known to have excellent unique properties including high current density optical mechanical thermal conductivity high chemical stability high surface area and chemical stability graphene based nanomaterials and derivatives as a result of their excellent properties have received increased attention in wastewater treatment in recent years despite significant progress in the production of graphene at laboratory scale there is a need to focus on green large scale graphene synthesis to pave the way for adopting graphene based technology on an industrial scale in wastewater treatment advanced development of pure graphene on various significant functionalization exhibits excellent adsorption efficiency when functionalized when compared to other alternatives top down as well as bottom up approaches such as chemical vapour deposition and chemical exfoliation among other approaches can be used for graphene synthesis and functionalization as a result the benefits of graphene oxide based nanomaterials have been unraveled in the treatment of biomedical wastewater adsorption and photocatalysis techniques have sparked widespread interest because they allow for the environmentally friendly treatment of biomedical wastewater and significant progress has been made in recent years this study examined the graphene synthesis method and the use of graphene oxide based nanomaterials as adsorbents and photocatalysts

graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene graphene synthesis graphene based nanomaterials biomedical waste waste treatment adsorption photocatalysis mechanism data availability no data was

biomedical wastes bmw are mostly generated by pharmaceutical industries healthcare facilities medical and educational research institutions nursing homes and hospitals during medical treatment of human and veterinary populations as presented in fig 1 they include expired vaccines and drugs blood products tissues organic fluids radioactive waste and chemical and pharmaceutical residues bmw may also contain chemical surgical pharmaceutical cytotoxic and other biological waste materials which are potentially hazardous to living organisms including humans and the environment 3 4 inadequate bmw management can have consequences such as increasing infectious diseases resulting from groundwater contamination 5 it has been established that even trace amounts of various drug residues can exist in surface ground and even drinking water 6 the remainder of drugs that undergo partial metabolism in the human body is discharged as effluent into receiving water bodies a large majority of such drugs is antibiotics of which about 80 90 return to the environment via excretion in their parent form due to their robust molecular structure making them to degrade naturally 7 several conventional and advanced techniques such as electrochemical treatments filtration precipitation membrane separation photocatalysis ion exchange reverse osmosis and adsorption have been used for treatment of antibiotics in wastewater 8 10 however they still face challenges of cost effectiveness environmental friendliness and process efficiency from material preparation to process optimization 11 graphene and its derivatives have impacted wastewater treatment and have been utilized in photocatalysis adsorption or as an effective electrode in various treatment technologies and applications 12 16 adsorption have numerous advantages such as its high efficacy low cost and ecological viability to remove organic contaminants from water 17 19 graphene is a planar single atom layer thick sheet and two dimensionally structured material composed of tightly packed sp2 bonded carbon atoms in a honeycomb crystal lattice with a distinct charge mobility carrier a broad electrochemical spectrum and physicochemical properties 20 22 as a result of its outstanding optical thermal electrical and mechanical properties as well as its high specific surface area graphene has emerged a revolutionary material with wide range of applications including its use as innovative adsorbents for water treatment 23 24 it s an excellent adsorbent for removing a wide range of inorganic and organic pollutants because of its high surface area abundance of active sites and excellent delocalized electron systems 25 despite significant progress made in the development and application of grapheme based adsorbents some inherent disadvantages remain the hydrophobic nature of its surface and ease of aggregation in hydrous solution are disadvantages of graphene both of which significantly reduce its adsorption capacity in practical applications 26 27 during liquid processing graphene even rolls to form graphite aggregation can limit its adsorptive application by blocking active sorption sites decreasing theoretical surface area and impeding rapid mass transport 28 functionalized graphene can be designed to address some of these limitations it is essential to understand the adsorption efficiency of graphene based materials and how it correlates to the mechanisms of interaction between adsorbents and contaminants in order to advance the development of its functionalized composites and their applications in waste treatment 29 as a result of their high surface area and abundance of active sites there has been considerable interest in graphene based materials as potential adsorptive pollutants removal from water the underlying adsorption mechanisms are used for creating graphene based adsorbents for target pollutants reports on composite go and semiconductor

will also surely be found and numerous futuristic technologies will also become feasible 2 synthesis of graphene nanostructures the extraordinary electronic surface mechanical and optoelectronic attributes properties of 2 dimensional graphene a crystal lattice of carbon atoms are intriguing making it possible to develop various innovations across a broad spectrum of industries 32 33 the term graphene synthesis refers to any process whether chemical or mechanical that is used to produce graphene with the desired level of purity and dimensions of the finished product 34 currently graphene synthesis processes can be classified into two types namely top down and bottom up 21 35 the graphical illustration of the top down and bottom down synthesis approach is presented in fig 2 2 1 top down approach 2 1 1 mechanical exfoliation a well known and scientific way to mono layered graphene flakes extraction on preferred substrates is mechanical exfoliation it is formed when layered materials are subjected to transverse or longitudinal stress 32 36 mechanical exfoliation is also regarded as a low cost method of synthesizing graphene graphene can be fabricated by stacking single graphene carbon atoms using van der waals forces with bonding energy and inter spatial values of 2 ev nm2 and 3 34 å respectively 37 mechanical cleaving on the other hand involves an external force of about 3 μn mm2 for the separation of mono atomic layer from graphite sheet stacking is caused by a partially filled p orbitals overlapping perpendicularly on the sheet s plane with van der waals forces inclusive 38 exfoliation is the inverse of stacking and results in weak bond strength as well as wide vertical lattice spacing it does however results in bond improvement and tiny lattice spacing in the hexagonal lattice plane 39 several materials made from such as natural gr 40 highly ordered pyrolytic gr 41 graphene sheets synthesis with different thicknesses alongside mono crystal gr have been observed as a result of mechanical exfoliation 42 the exfoliation method used scotch tape 43 ultra sonication 44 transfer printing technique 45 and electric field 46 mechanical exfoliation has the disadvantage of producing a low yield of graphene 2 1 2 chemical reduction another top down technique for producing graphene is chemical reduction of graphite oxide graphite oxide is always produced by oxidizing graphite oxidants like kmno4 h2so4 and nitric acid can be used to perform oxidation 33 go reduction and sonication are also alternatives to graphene synthesis 47 alkaline solution ascorbic hydrazine glucose hydroquinone pyrrole hydroxylamine and phenyl hydrazine are some other reducing agents that can be used 48 51 the hydrophilic nature of go makes it a potentially useful material in other to fabricate a mono layered or double layered go go is first suspended in h2o using sonication followed by surfaces deposition by filtering or spin coating 23 as a result graphene films can be synthesized by thermally or chemically reducing go furthermore to create reduced go dispersions in the non polar solvents a straightforward method like solvo thermal reduction is advantageous although this process allows for mass production it is difficult to produce a high quality product due to the presence of some accompanying defects at the edges and deformation 52 environmentally friendly approaches to limiting the utilization of hazardous chemicals have grown in popularity in recent years 53 for instance reducing agents such as ascorbic acid have been used to create a benign synthesis process 54 electrochemical reduction is another method that can be utilized for large scale graphene synthesis this procedure removes a huge number of oxygen functional groups while also improving functional and electrical properties 55 thermal reduction of go in addition to chemical and electrochemical reduction is regarded as an efficient method for producing high performance rgo powders 56 the process reduction takes place in an unreactive environment at a high heating rate go undergoes reduction by evaporating and burning water molecules and oxygen functional groups at high temperatures above or near 1000 c the pressure generated by the heating process determines the effectiveness of thermal reduction 57 2 1 3 chemical exfoliation 2 1 3 1 chemical exfoliation another efficient top down method of graphene synthesis is chemical exfoliation chemical exfoliation is divided into two steps first van der waals forces reduction between the inter layers thereby increasing the gr interlayer spacing second a rapid heating process for gr exfoliation into single layers and few layers 33 the brodie 58 staudenmaier 59 and hummers 60 techniques have been used to create gos the hummers method evolved giving rise to modified and improved hummer s method 61 table 1 compares the differences types of oxidants used toxicity and potential benefits of the different methods the main benefit of hummer s method is scalable and low economic cost the method is useful in producing large scale graphene sheets making it suitable for industrial applications hummer s method is also a fast synthetic process which makes it ideal for mass production the improved hummers technique is preferred to make graphene because it has low free toxicity and can make more organized graphene structures 13 2 1 4 liquid phase exfoliation liquid phase exfoliation is a method widely used for graphene synthesis this synthesis process is broken down into three main phases first the graphene derivatives to be produced are dispersed in a suitable solvent next the graphene is exfoliated and finally the derivatives of exfoliated graphene are separated from their parent material during purification step 62 the appropriateness of the solvent can be evaluated based on its surface tension surface energy and hildebrand and hansen solubility among other characteristics as a result graphene dispersion can be achieved by making use of a wide range of aqueous and non aqueous liquids 63 typically for graphene exfoliation the ideal surface tension is 0 4 0 5 j m2 and surface energy is 0 70 0 8 j m2 for the solvent because they have surface energies similar to that of graphite they have lower mixing enthalpy and thus a simpler process exfoliation 36 brodie began graphite production using solvent made from potassium chlorate kclo3 and nitric acid hno3 and oxidized graphite to produce go staudenmaier successfully extracted oxidized go using the same solvent 64 their method however has become unpopular because of lengthy processing time and the use of potassium chlorate which is hazardous hummers created go in concentrated sulphuric acid h2so4 potassium permanganate kmno4 and sodium nitrate nano3 solvents 60 however the go produced through this method is more oxidized than previous methods and the presence of non oxidized graphite core in the go necessitates a pre treatment for the improvement of the oxidation process 65 also hernandez et al 66 investigated solvent s effect on graphene production using over 40 different solvents an extremely efficient method for producing graphene with minimal solvent was developed by the researchers although liquid phase exfoliation is a common method of producing graphene sonication can cause some defects on the edge and basal planes 23 67 sonication time is important because it affects graphene concentration it was previously found that the more prolong the duration of sonication the greater the graphene concentration 66 in graphene exfoliation centrifugal force is also important high centrifugal force produces thinner graphene flakes 68 the liquid exfoliation process results in defects on graphene that can be reduced by adjusting the sonication time temperature and intensity 2 1 5 electrochemical exfoliation chemical or mechanical graphene synthesis has several processing limitations including a time consuming and labor intensive procedure the use of hazardous and environmentally harsh solvents reagents and their regularity in quality as well though the processes for producing high quality graphene have been proposed such as thermal decomposition of silicon carbide sic micromechanical cleavage and cvd relatively low production rates and high costs make them they impractical for commercial applications electrochemical exfoliation proves to be a suitable method for bulk synthesis of graphene in less time and at minimal cost it is safer because no harsh chemicals are used in this process it is a method of using an electrical current to exfoliate a graphite electrode in a liquid electrolyte in this process the working electrode is usually a graphite film rod highly oriented pyrolytic graphite sample another counter electrode made of the same graphite nickel iron platinum alloy could be used migration of ions ve charged from the electrolyte to the working electrodes is caused by a potential difference created between two electrodes and become interposed among the graphene layers of graphite this process known as intercalation produces the impetus to disband the van der waals forces resulting in the expansion of graphite structurally the graphite electrodes properties such as particulate size layer arrangements defects thickness and appropriate pre treatment is also expected to influence ion intercalations 69 70 2 2 bottom up approach 2 2 1 epitaxial growth on silicon epitaxial growth is known as the growth layer of a substance on a substrate that continues the crystal structure of the substrate there is tendency for silicon carbide wafer to sublime when subjected to specific conditions high temperatures at 800 to 1150 c and vacuum conditions at 109 to 1010 mbar or at 1500 c under noble argon gas hence leaving the carbon remaining on the substrate to form graphitic layers on the wafer s carbon or silicon faces 71 as one might expect silicon carbide to have a lattice structure similar to graphene unlike chemical vapour deposition cvd epitaxial growth enables the production of large surface area graphene sheets this is a transfer free process that is dependent on the substrate s crystallographic orientation meaning that transferring the graphene requires no peculiar technique the mechanism of graphene epitaxial growth consists of two steps nucleation and layer by layer growth 72 based on the substrate there are types of epitaxial growth processes homo epitaxial growth and hetero epitaxial growth homo epitaxial growth process normally involves film deposition on same material as the substrate when the film and substrate are made of different materials a hetero epitaxial structure is formed silicon carbide was first applied for measuring electrically on patterned epitaxial layers 32 edward goodrich acheson invented this process in 1893 when he devised a technique for synthesizing silicon carbide sic by heating various carbonaceous sources at temperature 4000 c the author discovered that pure crystalline graphite was formed 23 73 as far as large scale production is concerned this method looks promising the epitaxial growth method on the other hand has a very high production cost due to its intensive energy features and the prohibitively high cost of single crystal commercially available silicon carbide substrates 74 another significant limitation of this method is non uniformity furthermore si face graphene is preferred over c face graphene because it has better graphene growth uniformity until now this method has been underutilized due to a lack of knowledge about the growth and interaction mechanisms of graphene and the sic substrate 75 2 2 2 chemical vapour deposition on metal catalyst cvd is a straightforward method which utilizes carbon precursors in its gaseous state e g methane to produce graphene high surface area single layered and few layered graphene can be grown on copper substrates 33 this method can produce high surface areas of monolayer graphene a few cm2 cvd has the potential to develop into a technology that is viable for commercial use the solubility of carbon in metals is the fundamental premise behind the cvd process hydrocarbons and other gaseous carbon precursors are introduced into a reactor that is able to withstand high temperatures once inside the hydrocarbons and other gaseous carbon precursors break down and dissolve into metal substrates 76 the difference in carbon solubility at different temperatures causes carbon to precipitate out of solid carbon metal solutions the growth substrate in the cvd process is the most significant aspect in the formation of graphene which starts from hydrocarbon decomposition and succeeded by evolution of metal substrate with carbon atom deposit 71 it is difficult to transfer graphene to a substrate of interest from the growth substrate because graphene has a low chemical response as a result the fabric begins to show flaws and wrinkles 35 in addition the procedure is complicated and energy intensive which restricts the task at times the cvd process however remains the most auspicious high surface area graphene production technique in the cvd process graphene is deposited on different of metal plates substrates including cu ni ir pd and ru 77 80 copper and nickel are the most commonly used substrates for cvd growth of graphene 2 2 3 organic synthesis polycyclic hydrocarbons pahs can be used to create graphene specifically graphene nanoribbons gnrs unlike the cvd method which produces gnrs with widths of 30 200 nm gnrs with widths of 10 nm can be produced by organic synthesis making it easier to engineer their band gaps nevertheless gr synthesis from polycyclic hydrocarbons is tough because cc bonds formation is required in a single step as well as the activation of inert ch bonds in polycyclic hydrocarbons enabling those bonds to participate in the reaction this makes the process time consuming and complicated notwithstanding there have been developments in chemical processes that are both quick and efficient 81 with many of them predicated on oxidative cyclodehydrogenation scholl reaction 82 diels alder polymerization cyclotrimerization and photocyclization are other methods for organic graphene synthesis 50 83 these techniques are not only necessitated there is limitation in the number of products produced 3 biomedical waste treatment using graphene as the world s population expands so is medicines and healthcare products demand to treat diseases thus there is a need to channel resources and technology towards improving and promoting the manufacturing of various pharmaceutical and medical products however the lack of proper techniques and the use of sub optimal approaches to waste minimization during production post production and or treatment stages by pharmaceutical industries or health care facilities generate effluents that are released into the environment untreated 84 sustainable and safe management of biomedical waste is a global challenge because of its potential hazard to human the environment and health the increased generation of biomedical wastes from various health care facilities including hospitals clinics and nursing homes has also become a matter of concern in many countries removal of toxic metal ions recalcitrant organic pollutants and pharmaceuticals by various emerging technologies has been the primary focus of research over the course of the past decade treatment of biomedical waste can be accomplished in various ways including through the application of physical chemical and biological processes it is important to consider the type and quantity of waste to be treated when deciding about which of these technologies to employ nevertheless the majority of these techniques including advanced oxidation processes electrochemical purification membranes processes and many more are not eco friendly and may pose health risks to both employees and the general public as well nonetheless adsorption and photocatalytic methods seems to overcome these challenges which make it more preferred as it outperforms other techniques due to its ease of operation cost effectiveness flexibility technological feasibility absence of byproducts and the ability to be easily recycled the various methods for treatment of biomedical waste using graphene and its derivatives is presented in fig 3 3 1 infectious biowaste treatment generally biomedical waste tends to be cytotoxic injurious chemical or infectious infectious biomedical waste contains substances which have deleterious effects on biological organisms biomedical waste is hazardous since it has the potential to spread infections once the waste becomes contaminated with biohazardous agents they pose the risk of disease transmission they include waste from lab cultures isolation wards equipment that have come in contact with infected patients infected clinical specimens tissue from experimental animals cotton swabs and excreta as well as soiled mattresses and beddings from blood or body fluids hospital wastewater is a major breeding ground for antibiotic resistant bacteria making it a potential vector for human and environmental infection 85 86 the importance of managing biomedical waste is critical particularly in medical facilities this is due to the fact that improper segregation biomedical wastes disposal and inclusion of biomedical waste in municipal waste making healthcare workers and the general public vulnerable hence infectious biomedical waste management should be a top priority for hospitals and other medical facilities although it is common knowledge that efficient wastewater treatment technologies are required to harness the control of infectious waterborne pathogens it is unfortunate that the present options available for managing biomedical waste do not address the current danger that is posed by liquid effluent discharges which is a significant issue for healthcare facilities go a function form of graphene with excellent electrochemical properties and functional groups e g coh oh and r o r can be applied in wastewater treatment although no studies have been reported in literature on the utilization of graphene as an adsorbent for the treatment of infectious biowaste and therefore we proposed that this area of research will be viable and require attention in environmental fields attention has been drawn to the use of nanoparticles due to the rapid development of nanotechnology effective microbial decontamination and pathogen disinfection is critical to controlling transmission and thereby reducing risk of infection reduced go possesses antimicrobial properties which hinders bacterial growth and therefore the biofilm formation on the filter surfaces physical and chemical properties such as stability reactivity and large surface area makes nanoparticles outstanding and also preferred catalysts and adsorbents 3 2 hazardous biowaste treatment hazardous wastes are generated from industries hospitals some household wastes hazardous waste is defined by the united state resource conservation and recovery act rcra as a of solid liquid wastes combination that may give rise to or contribute substantially to an increase in morbidity due to their concentration quantity or physical chemical or infectious characteristics according to the epa hazardous wastes possess properties which make them dangerous or capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment large amounts of hazardous substance containing effluent are discharged into the environment resulting from industrialization and urban development processes they can increase the risk of motility because they are corrosive flammable or have a high affinity and readily react when exposed to other substances 87 toxicity is the most concerning of these characteristics due to its impact on human beings and other living organisms hazardous pollutants sources include hormones pesticides antimicrobial agents illicit drugs pharmaceuticals and personal care products the waste generated during the production of pharmaceuticals varies greatly in amount and type and is relatively more than the actual finished product the term pharmaceutical wastewater primarily refers to effluents and wastes generated during pharmaceutical manufacturing there can be anywhere from 200 to 30 000 kg of waste produced for each kilogram of active ingredient produced 88 the amount of wastewater produced by pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities grows as the industry expands the current rate of improper disposal of unused medicines from hospitals and households is concerning 89 91 pharmaceutical waste is broadly classified as a waste generated by pharmaceutical companies and effluents from treatment and recycling plants handling such wastes and medical waste from hospitals and households which significantly contaminates sewage systems the latter is to blame for the presence of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs in public sewers and as a result municipal wastewater treatment plants 92 93 analgesics broncho spasmolytics antibiotics cosmetics contraceptives anti depressive agents non steroid anti inflammatory drugs nsaids lipid regulators antiseptics anti rheumatic beta blockers and diuretics have been discovered in the feed of municipal wastewater treatment plants as well as in the effluents of sewage treatment plants to a scale of g ml 93 94 various treatment options are available for treating pharmaceutical wastewater but due to the complex nature of the effluents treatment can be challenging gadipelly et al 95 and zaied et al 96 in their studies gave a comprehensive list of composition of the wastewater generated in pharmaceutical industries and active ingredients various treatment technologies exist and have been adopted for treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater as presented in table 2 as a result of the complexities of industrial effluents there is no one size fits all method and currently no single method capable of adequate treatment is available for example despite the success of anaerobic digestion technologies in treating high strength antibiotic wastewater with benefits such as biogas production and reduced waste sludge production 97 issues such as long start up times slow anaerobic microorganism growth rates and poor biomass retention persist 98 the investigation of the adsorption efficiency by gao et al 99 of tetracycline by go reveals that the removal of tetracycline is achieved majorly through a π π and cation π interactions with a maximum monolayer adsorption capability is 313 mg g and it decreases with increase in the solution s ph or the sodium ions concentration moreira et al 100 demonstrated the simultaneous adsorption and degradation of norfloxacin nor in an aqueous matrix by go the authors reported that the 8 layers go was created through oxidation or exfoliation of the enlarged graphite using a modified hummer s method the removal capacity of the go adsorbent was 374 9 29 8 mg g with higher input from the no r in the zwitterionic form and removes about 94 8 the intra particle diffusion process as measured by boyd s model and fick s law contributed more to the removal process and reaches equilibrium half hour after it began finally the process underwent scale up in a single stage batch adsorber with a 95 efficiency of nor removal rajabi et al 101 also reported the treatment of hazardous chemical and strong mutagen ethidium monoazide bromide ema from aqueous solution using a go adsorbent surface the authors also reported on the investigation of variables such as solution temperature contact time ethidium monoazide bromide initial concentration and ph affecting the process ema adsorption result on go the optimum time and ph respectively were 17 min and ph 10 the authors reported its maximum adsorptive efficiency of 76 92 mg g at 303 k 3 3 radioactive biowaste treatment radionuclide application in medicine is a well established field when utilized appropriately in a variety of medical applications for diagnostic therapeutic and research purposes radioactive materials have been found to be extremely effective 106 their usefulness market availability and reasonable price also make radioactive substances desirable handling these materials has invariably led to the generation of biomedical radioactive waste in form of residues and by products the amount and type of waste produced differ according to the size of the medical application and the radionuclides used classification of radioactive waste can be made depending on various attributes as shown in fig 4 with the exception of some medium level waste the majority of hospital radioactive waste is low level waste low energy and emitters with short half lives the nuclear industry and nuclear reactors are typically associated with high level waste 107 different types of radionuclides are utilized in hospitals and medical centers for in vivo and in vitro applications they have been implemented for diagnostics research and therapeutic uses radioactive waste could be generated as solid or liquid wastes from radionuclide medical applications 108 the major sources of liquid radioactive waste can be seen in fig 5 the radioactive waste management plan must be exhaustive and take into account all facets from radionuclide procurement to the final release of waste packages from the facility for disposal discharge a good management plan should consider both original and secondary waste sources the latter being from subsequent treatment and conditioning of the original in any case that waste generation can be avoided or at least minimized it should be implemented as the most preferable option when waste prevention cannot be implemented other approaches have been adopted for instance in some countries diluting the overall radionuclide content of waste is permitted under certain conditions non radioactive wastes are used to dilute low level radioactive waste in order to meet the regulatory specifications 106 in order to ensure safe discharge into the environment liquid radioactive waste must meet extremely stringent requirements concerning radioactive substance limits and other impurities the treatment of liquid radioactive waste frequently involves the application of several steps such as filtration precipitation sorption chemical precipitation sedimentation flocculation ion exchange 109 evaporation and or membrane separation to meet the requirements for both the release of decontaminated effluents into the environment and the conditioning of waste concentrates for disposal 110 111 dulama et al 112 used membrane technology combined with inorganic sorbents for the treatment of radioactive liquid waste containing cesium 137cs the study found that using natural zeolite in the pre treatment stage resulted in greater 137cs removal efficiencies which were credited to the affinity of the materials for 137cs subsequently various materials including inorganic adsorbents have been successfully employed to mitigate radioactive waste as an alternative treatment technology they possess high exchange capacity possible selectivity and specificity and are resistant to radioactive radiation emerging processes bearing higher efficiency in recent times have been used in radioactive decontamination membrane technologies particularly pressure driven ones such as reverse osmosis microfiltration and ultrafiltration play a large role in these processes membrane technologies outperform traditional processes in several ways including lower energy consumption no chemical addition operation at low temperatures and ease of scaling up furthermore a suitable combination of different processes can simultaneously remove radioactive organic and biological substances these processes have been used successfully in the treatment of a variety radioactive effluents fouling on the other hand is a major issue in membrane processes and can be caused by inorganic organic or even biological substances membrane fouling reduces the flux that passes through the membrane degrades permeate quality reduces membrane life and raises operating costs membrane fouling can be reduced by using appropriate pretreatment operating parameters including composite membranes matrices by the inclusion of tio2 zno and graphene oxide nanomaterials with benefits such as thermal physical and chemical stability other alternatives such as graphene oxide and mixed matrix membranes provide higher biofouling resistance long term stability and possible regeneration of membrane material 4 graphene based nanocomposites the performance of graphene adsorbents is mostly determined by their uniform dispersion in solution as well as their high sorption capacity to a variety of contaminants graphene often has a high affinity to aggregate or even roll to form graphite during liquid processing 113 aggregation can limit its adsorptive applicability by obstructing active sorption sites limiting theoretical surface area and impeding rapid mass transfer due to the electrostatic repulsion between them go has a low binding affinity to anionic dyes furthermore due to its high solubility go cannot be regenerated easily from wastewater treatment resulting in secondary pollution to the environment hence its application in pollutant treatment is limited 114 all of these aforementioned drawbacks can be overcome by functionalizing go with various covalent or non covalent dissimilar molecules polymers and nanoparticles resulting in the development of composites a class of multicomponent materials 115 the composite that results is more than just the sum of the separate components it is a new substance with new functionalities and qualities 116 the synthesis method and surface area of various graphene based nanocomposites reported from recent works is presented in table 3 summarizes the recent works in the development of graphene composites materials as a result of their enormous surface area enhanced stability avoiding π π stacking between and numerous active sites for adsorption graphene based materials have attracted a lot of interest as appealing candidate for adsorptive removal of contaminants from water 117 the underlying adsorption principles are used to design graphene based adsorbents for target pollutants better understanding of graphene based adsorption performance and how it relates to the interactions between pollutants and adsorbents is crucial for the future development of graphene based functional materials and their practical applications 118 nagarajan et al 116 reported the fabrication of magnesium nanocomposites decorated with multilayer graphene mg and its application in pollutant treatment in a recent study the bet surface area of the developed graphene based nanocomposite was found to be 1480 m2 g the synthesis of polypyrrole functionalized cobalt oxide graphene copygo nanocomposite via hydrothermal method was explored by anuma et al 119 the authors reported the bet surface area of 133 m2 g verma et al 120 functionalized graphene oxide chitosan with edta for inorganic and organic pollutants treatment the bet surface area of 1 326 m2 g was reported by the authors the fabrication of graphene hydrogel decorated on nickel with bet surface area of 67 84 m2 g was explored by ebratkhahan et al 121 chen et al 114 also reported the bet surface area 41 54 m2 g for the fabrication of carbon layer encapsulated fe3o4 graphene oxide nanocomposites rich in amino and thiol groups fe3o4 c go 5 biomedical treatment using graphene based nanocomposites graphene is fundamentally a monatomic graphite layer a mineral rich allotrope of carbon made up of tightly bonded carbon atoms organized in a hexagonal lattice as a result of its sp2 hybridization and extremely thin atomic thickness of 0 345 nm graphene is a very distinct material 76 however its hydrophobic nature which makes it insoluble in hydrophilic solvents like water limits its application in water purification in order to overcome this limitation the hydrophobic nature must be compromised to improve its affinity to aqueous solution graphene s have been modified by adding functional groups on its surface through chemical modification covalent or noncovalent functionalization giving rise to the graphene based nanomaterials owing to their attractive properties which include water solubility low toxicity very good water dispersibility antibacterial activity high adsorption rate graphene based nanomaterials have more advantages over other materials such as high adsorption rate high dispersion rate and antibacterial activity which makes them a better choice for biomedical wastewater treatment 123 recently graphene based materials have received a lot of attention as potential adsorbents for wastewater treatment in wastewater treatment graphene is an intriguing carbon material having distinct advantages over other adsorbents such as activated carbon carbon nanotubes chitosan clay and zeolite graphene is an appealing material for use in wastewater treatment considering its increased surface area for adsorption of biomedical contaminant species as well as the possible chemical modifications and composite fabrication 124 125 as earlier stated the modifiable chemical properties of graphene alongside its large surface area highly delocalized π electrons positions them as very captivating and auspicious for usage to adsorb pollutants in wastewater and address environmental sustainability concerns however vehement inter planar interactions make graphene nano layers jointly incline and also recombine to produce graphite as a result of tough electrostatic repulsion between graphene oxide and negatively charged compounds the binding affinity between them is weak notwithstanding the possibility of graphene alongside graphene oxide not composing and coming off decontaminated effluents leads to serious re contamination overcoming these disadvantages is possible by functionalizing covalently or non covalently using different molecules and other nanoparticles through which nanocomposites multi component material groups are produced where one phase is dispersed into another in the nanometric range 126 several researchers have shown the high adsorption capacity of graphene based materials and most studies consider solution ph ionic strength and temperature as essential parameters in biomedical pollutants treatment in addition to the adsorbent s intrinsic properties 127 adsorption interactions are non covalent interactions that occur between pollutants and graphene based materials as presented in fig 6 however the true nature of such interactions such as electrostatic hydrogen bonds hydrophobic and van der waals interactions as well as their relative contributions are hotly debated 100 their surface chemistry heavily influences the adsorption and photocatalytic properties of graphene based materials oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of go have two opposing effects on adsorption capacity adsorption can be boosted by increasing the water solubility on the surface of a surface charge however there is a reduction in adsorption sites by the water clusters produced on the surface the oxygen concentration of graphene oxide on the other hand increases the adsorption of contaminants such as amino acids and hydroxyl groups via strong hydrogen or lewis interactions 128 gao et al 99 developed the go as a potential adsorbent for the removal of significant concerns tetracycline antibiotics from aqueous environment the authors observed that the tetracycline was deposited strongly via π π interaction and cation π bonding on the surface go the adsorption equilibrium data was found to fits well the langmuir and temkin isotherm model with theoretical maximum of adsorption capacity 313 mg g the adsorption kinetics was well described by pseudo second order model komal et al 6 conducted an extensive study to evaluate the effect of percentage load of functionalized graphene oxide on the development of various forms of modified go supported with functionalized cellulose nanofibers cnf obtained from excess biomass for the treatment of toxic drug species from aqueous environments the authors assessed the adsorptive performance of the developed nanohybrids for the treatment of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and optimized their performance varying adsorbent loading ph and initial drug concentration furthermore different kinetic and isotherm adsorption models were studied to investigate adsorbent properties and the adsorption process the adsorptive capability of functionalized cnf was significantly improved by its easy aggregation with functionalized graphene oxide the results of the experiments revealed that a 20 wt loading of carboxylated go within the perforated surface of esterified cnfs showed excellent adsorption efficiency with peak at 45 04 mg g for ciprofloxacin and 85 30 mg g for ofloxacin uptake the interaction of electronegative functional groups and deficient structure found on cip with aromatic structure found within go basal planes and functionalized go edges can explain the underlying chemisorption mechanism hydrogen bonding is also an influential feature whereby cip molecules adhere to the nanocomposite surface because both the adsorbent and adsorbate moieties contain a lot of oxygen and hydrogen rich functional groups the possibility of regeneration and reusability of nanocomposites opens up enormous possibilities for low cost long term sorbent material development for pharmaceutical pollution management januário et al 17 recently reported on the use of go functionalized activated carbon gac go for the efficient uptake of pharmaceuticals for covid 19 treatment from water this study aimed to remove water contaminated with chloroquine and dipyrone using batch adsorption processes in this study the authors discovered that the equilibrium time for chloroquine and dipyrone adsorption was 18 and 12 h respectively the adsorption of chloroquine and dipyrone onto gac go fits the langmuir model best and follows pseudo second order thermodynamic studies revealed that the process is endothermic with adsorption capacity of 37 65 and 62 43 mg g at its peak at 318 k respectively the main mechanism of the underlying adsorption process was attributed to hydrogen bonds and π interactions between chloroquine and gac go mortazavi et al 129 reported that go was simultaneously subjected to thermal reduction and chemical bonding on the surface of amino functionalized sand particles afsps and was employed to adsorb naphthalene and acenaphthene from aquatic environments the experimental data were fitted to the langmuir redlich peterson and dubinin radushkevich models for naphthalene adsorption and the redlich peterson and freundlich models for acenaphthene adsorption according to the equilibrium results analysis the kinetic studies reveal both adsorbate s adsorption process proceeds the pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models naphthalene and acenaphthene had maximum adsorption capacities of 7 473 and 18 152 mg g respectively adsorption mechanisms in this study includes π π stacking and hydrophobic interactions during thermal reduction go lose most of its functional groups and amino functionalized sand particles were coated with rgo as a hydrophobic layer which promotes hydrophobic interaction between rgo and the adsorbates naphthalene and acenaphthene the stacking mechanism is another adsorption mechanism that could be responsible for adsorption capabilities zhang et al 130 outstanding polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf pb graphene oxide go adjusted membrane was synthesized through phase inversion for a small amount radio nuclide cesium 137cs adsorption from wastewater the authors reported that integration of go increased pb diffusivity and the pvdf pb go membrane displayed the largest cs uptake effectiveness of 99 6 moreover the membrane displayed conspicuous selectivity and reusability towards small quantity of radioactive cesium even in the presence of extreme co existing ions and in real water which showed convincingly that the membrane has potential for usage two pathways were suggested to account for cs adsorption behavior unto modified pvdf pb go membrane firstly the xps survey revealed that the nfe binding of pb was replaced by c n cs with the elimination of fe 2p3 after adsorption suggesting that fe cn 6 4 defect sites could as well be active adsorption sites furthermore the adsorption of cs can also be attributed to oxygen containing surface functional groups oh group and c o stretch on the surface of go as evidenced by ft ir spectra analysis ma et al 131 investigated the utilization of go membrane in the adsorption of cs i and sr ii from wastewater the authors observed that cs i and sr ii ions diffused quickly through graphene oxide membranes but the lanthanide ions and actinide ions are slower making them to separate based on the variation in hydrated ionic radii furthermore the initial metallic ion concentrations and acidity in the solution of the feed affected ion transport through the graphene oxide membranes larger concentrations of initial metallic ions and acidity of the feed solution favored cs i and sr ii adsorption in another recent study by yang et al 132 the sorption of radioactive waste u vi onto a synthesized novel magnetic composite graphene oxide fe3o4 glucose cooh go fe3o4 gc was investigated at optimum adsorption conditions an initial concentration of 10 mgl 1 5 0 ph value and sorbent dosage of 0 15 g l the maximum adsorption capacity was observed to be 390 70 mg g at 30 mins of contact time the observable higher u vi uptake and faster adsorption rate when compared to previously reported studies was credited to abundant presence of go showing its effectiveness as an absorbent and potential for industrial use adsorption behavior could be explained by the dubinin radushkevich d r model which fitted well with the equilibrium data and showed a physical adsorption process taking place e 8 kjmol 1 while the best fit for the adsorption kinetic parameter is pseudo second order indicating a high level of complexation between u vi ions and organic functional groups observed on the as manufactured nanocomposite alothman et al 133 fabricated γ cyclodextrin graphene oxide nanocomposite for the treatment of tetracycline and chlortetracycline antibiotics removal from aqueous environment the authors reported that the adsorption optimum conditions under studied were concentration of 400 mg l 30 min adsorbent time ph 8 0 adsorbent dose 1 0 g l and temperature of 278 k the adsorption of tetracycline and chlortetracycline was described best by the freundlich model suggesting a multilayer adsorption the maximum percentage treatment of tetracycline and chlortetracycline were found to be 91 25 and 93 75 respectively the adsorption process was revealed to follow pseudo second kinetic order reaction and liquid film diffusion kinetic model the thermodynamics study revealed degree of freedom increase exothermic and spontaneous in nature the hydrogen bonding and π π interactions were adsorption mechanism of adsorption the fabrication of copper nanoparticles immobilized β cyclodextrin modified reduced graphene oxide cu β cd rgo were developed successfully as an effective extractor of tetracycline tc oxytetracycline otc and doxycycline dc antibiotics from various aqueous environment was explored by yakout et al 134 the authors revealed that tcs are deposited strongly cu β cd rgo nanocomposite matrix via surface complexation with the cu nanoparticles besides the formation of inclusion complexes with β cyclodextrin and π π interaction of reduced graphene oxide the maximum adsorption capacity of cu β cd rgo evaluated from the langmuir isotherm model was found 403 2 mg g 476 2 mg g and 434 8 mg g for tc otc and dc respectively it was concluded that the prepared novel nanocomposite demonstrated a quick and highly effective treatment performance for the antibiotic pollutant treatment yang et al 15 reported the synthesis of graphene oxide modified κ carrageenan sodium alginate go κ car sa gel for the removal of ciprofloxacin cip and ofloxacin ofl it was revealed by the authors that go nanosheets addition improves the mechanical strength and anti swelling property of the double network hydrogel making it possible for the application in the fixed bed column system the maximum adsorption capacity calculated for cip and ofl adsorption onto go κ car sa gel were 272 18 and 197 39 mg g the authors also reported that the go κ car sa gel was observed always to be negatively charged suggesting that adsorption capacity of the gel is better in an acidic environment recently andrade et al 135 reported the preparation of graphene oxide go anchored on iron oxide nanoparticles αγ fe2o3 and cobalt oxide co3o4 for the removal of caffeine in a batch adsorption the go αγ fe2o3co3o4 adsorbent was reported to have demonstrated about 80v removal coupled maximum adsorption capacity of 28 94 mg g the adsorption kinetics as well as the adsorption go αγ fe2o3co3o4 was reported to follow a pseudo second order kinetics and better fitted to the langmuir and temkin models isotherms adsorption data the thermodynamic variables studied revealed that the adsorption process was exothermic spontaneous and favorable 6 adsorption isotherm and kinetic studies studies of isotherm and kinetics of adsorption experiment is a way of understanding probable mechanisms as well as pathways associated with the process generally the adsorption isotherms refer to the quantity of pollutant adsorbed with the pollutant s concentration in the substrate at equilibrium it is also needed to evaluate the adsorbent s efficiency for removing contaminants and investigate the surface properties 136 an earlier study of adsorption isotherms shows the most frequently used isotherms are freundlich and langmuir isotherms as shown in table 4 137 the availability of several proved isotherms established on various assumptions and instances the closest to the real case is fitted to the experimental data consequently the study of the isotherms statistically is done to detect the models that depict and best fits the process of contaminants removal from effluents after analysis by several categories of nanoadsorbents 138 graphene and its derivatives have risen as a novel material for usage as efficacious material to be applied in wastewater treatment due to their exceptional properties such as large number of functional groups high surface area and exceptional charge carrier mobility gr based materials are exploited as sorbents for effluent decontamination wu et al 142 reported the removal of doxorubicin hydrochloride from an aqueous solution using go the authors found that the maximum adsorption capacity was 1428 57 mg and concluded that the langmuir model fit better experimental data than the freundlich model sulfamethoxazole smx uptake by graphene oxide was studied by nam et al 143 it was discovered that freundlich model had a better fit for the adsorption isotherm data than langmuir model based on the correlation coefficients in the study of tc uptake using fe3o4 sio2 chitosan go mscg the isotherms of adsorption were simulated with both freundlich and langmuir equations the authors revealed the appropriateness of freundlich model more than langmuir for tetracycline removal the removal of oxytetracycline otc and tc by fe3o4 g was investigated by zhang et al 144 the result obtained showed higher correlation coefficient with the langmuir model than freundlich model langmuir r2 0 990 and 0 924 freundlich 0 986 and 0 921 for tc and otc respectively suggesting a monolayer adsorption and uniform distribution of adsorption site wang et al 145 investigated the effective adsorption of tc hydrochloride antibiotics with synthesized zr based mof composite uio 66 cooh 2 go the result obtained for r2 when compared showed that the experimental data best fits the langmuir model 0 9935 r2 0 9967 than freundlich model 0 9401 r2 0 9872 revealing mono layer mechanism of interaction and uniform tc uptake on the mof go and go cmc carboxymethylcellulose nanomaterials were synthesized in films by juengchareonpoon et al 146 it was also restructured with citric acid crosslinks for adsorption of antibiotics the obtained results revealed maximum adsorption capability of 370 93 256 68 and 102 05 mg g for trimethoprim oxolinic acid and oxytetracycline respectively at 30 c suksompong et al 147 studied the possibility of adsorbing iodine 131 from a hydrous solution using go chitosan sponges the adsorption efficiency was studied making use of stable isotopes and further studied using iodine 131 radioisotopes for confirmation of results the experimental data fitted well with the langmuir model the value of rl separated factor obtained was between 0 and 1 substantiating the favourability of the adsorption of iodide using go chitosan sponges with maximum adsorptive capability of 0 263 mbq mg alothman et al 133 also synthesized γ cyclodextrin go nanocomposite for the uptake of tc and chloro tc antibiotics from water the authors revealed that the sorption followed langmuir model the highest percentage removal of tc and chloro tc were 91 25 and 93 75 respectively at different ph values feng et al 148 developed novel go cof 300 ppy sorbent via hydrothermal method to adsorb indomethacin idm and diclofenac dcf from water the results reveal the adsorption capability and uptake efficacy of indomethacin and diclofenac by go 2cof 300 4ppy is high at 99 for indomethacin and 97 for diclofenac 115 mg g and 138 mg g respectively the authors also revealed that adsorption of indomethacin and diclofenac onto go 2cof 300 4ppy conformed to the langmuir isothermal model yang et al 16 studied the removal of enrofloxacin enf onto go the authors concluded that the langmuir freundlich model gave the best fit of adsorption process with an adsorption capacity of 45 035 mg g adsorption kinetic models are highly crucial for predicting optimal conditions especially for batch adsorption processes 149 kinetic modeling gives robust interpretation concerning adsorption forces interactions which reveals the entire adsorption mechanism and potential rate controlling steps like mass transport or processes involving chemical reaction some widely explored models include pseudo first and pseudo second order elovich equation and intraparticle diffusion 150 but recently the pseudo first and the pseudo second order are the most explored kinetic model equations the linear form equation of the models mentioned above is depicted in table 5 the pseudo first order kinetic model physisorption as the basis of adsorption process occurring without any chemical bonding and only through weak van der waals forces the adsorption process is easily reversible which allows for a near effortless regeneration according to the pseudo second order two reactions occur either simultaneously or sequentially given that the initial reaction is quick it reaches equilibrium quickly meanwhile the second reaction proceeds steadily and takes longer to arrive at equilibrium 150 adsorption occurs via chemisorption as indicated by the pseudo second order it is concluded that bonding occurs as a result of electronic sharing and that the transfer between adsorbents and adsorbate is relatively stronger than the physisorption pathway from pseudo first order kinetics 138 understanding the kinetics of antibiotic adsorption on graphene graphene based nanomaterials is essential to the adsorption mechanism and spent graphene graphene based nanomaterials which is closely related to the diffusive state of graphene materials adsorption of antibiotics by graphene oxide with good diffusivity is fast go with good dispersibility can adsorb antibiotics quickly but gr and reduced graphene oxide rgo with low diffusive need more time to reach equilibrium 27 zhu et al 153 reported that gr exhibited swift adsorption capability and attained equilibrium in 3 min and the removal process fitted well into the pseudo second order kinetic model compared to the pseudo first order model song et al 154 discovered that the pseudo second order kinetic model better fitted the kinetics of tc and sulfamethazine removal by reducing graphene oxides than the pseudo first order model wang et al 155 reported a similar result using mcgo to remove cip these facts suggest antibiotics removal by graphene gbnps is mainly controlled by chemical adsorption through the exchange or pairing of electrons between adsorbates hiew et al 156 investigated removal of diclofenac using graphene oxide go the authors reported pso model as the optimal representation of the kinetic of diclofenac adsorption in another study ninwiwek et al 157 prepared mesoporous silica magnetic graphene oxide nanocomposite material mgosi for the uptake of sulfamethoxazole smx the results shows the mgo si removed the sulfamethoxazole molecules more efficiently than the pristine magnetic go with the kinetic data exhibiting good correlation based on the pso model radmehr et al 158 displayed the production and efficient deployment of renewable sorbents based on go i e nizral layered double hydroxide graphene oxide chitosan nizral ldh go cs nc for nalidixic acid uptake the kinetics of the nalidixic acid being adsorbed on ldh go cs was examined by the authors using pfo kinetic model the pseudo pso ipd and elovich mechanism and discovered the r2 values are positioned between 0 9884 and 0 9966 giving a well fitted nalidixic acid removal by ldh go cs nc as shown by the pseudo second order model zou et al 159 reported the one pot fabrication of fe2o3 nanoparticles growth on rgo for the adsorptive uptake of chlortetracycline tetracycline and oxytetracycline the authors reported that the adsorption of chlortetracycline tetracycline and oxytetracycline onto fe2o3 rgo nanocomposites take 20 min and is highly ph dependent because of the enhanced repulsive interaction at high and low ph and that the adsorptions fit well the pso equations jaswal et al 160 also reported the utilization of rgo mos2heterostructure for the treatment of ofloxacin from the aqueous phase it was found from the result that the adsorption of ofloxacin onto rgo mos2 followed pseudo second order kinetics 7 photocatalytic degradation of biomedical waste several chemical treatment methods such as ozonation chlorination and fenton s oxidation have undergone developments for removing antibiotic remains from wastewater however difficult or extensively prolonged process in obtaining total decomposition and possible destruction of desirable organisms because of their low selectivity leading to undesirable losses are major drawbacks to these methods 161 in addition to the above the process incurs high economic capital and operational cost although integration of physical processes substantially reduces the noxiousness of water containing antibiotics after treatment it is a rather knotty and expensive process 162 sequel to adsorption active groups such as oh o2 present in sunlight visible light or uv light released by photocatalysts are used to disintegrate antibiotics into unharmful quantities efficiently therefore photocatalytic decomposition is one of the high ranking processes for removing antibiotic contaminants from the environment due to its high efficiency and sustainability 161 as a result of its exceptional advantages such as its powerful redox potential no adsorption engorgement the possibility of totally degrading organic contaminant into unharmful inorganic matter e g co2 and h2o inexpensiveness mild reaction conditions close to room temperature and atmospheric pressure extraction of oxygen in air for the production of highly potent oxidants and solar radiation energy photocatalysis possesses extensive prospect of application in environmental reclamation 163 therefore photocatalysis has progressively attracted global interest and broad application in novel energy extraction and techniques for environmental control the fundamental principle of photodegradation is the excitement and movement of electrons from their valance band into the conduction band after exposure to radiation with energy higher than its optical band gap which produces equal quantity of positively charged holes in the valance band 164 when the potential of the valence band vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe exhibits higher positivity than h2o oh 272 v vs nhe or oh oh 189 v vs nhe and the potential of conduction band vs nhe is more negative than o2 o2 0 33 v vs nhe the semiconductor will be able to generate oh and o2 thereafter separation and migration to the semiconductors surface of the photoinduced electrons and holes occurs and redox reactions will take place at the reactive site on the semiconductor surface the mechanism of semiconductor photocatalysis reaction fig 7 is given by the equations 161 165 1 semiconductor light energy λ e g semiconductor e cb h vb 2 h vb h 2 o h oh h 2 o oh 2 72 v vs nhe 3 h vb oh oh oh oh 1 89 v vs nhe 4 e

electroconductivity in reposition and swift electron transport and minimal expenditure for large scale production makes graphene a prospective photocatalyst and has been extensively used for photocatalytic decomposition of antibiotic pollutant in water 26 27 nonetheless catalytic activities are easily lost by graphene planes during its self accumulation process 167 and research reveals the inability of go a significant component of graphene based nanomaterials to function under visible light as a result of low 1 79 ev band gap 168 this necessitates the combination of graphene with different photocatalysts to produce new graphene based photocatalysts to overcome these disadvantages and enhance the catalytic operation of antibiotics recently several steps have been taken to manufacture and produce graphene based photocatalyst to enhance their capability to decompose antibiotic pollutants examples are single semiconductor coupled semiconductor metal coated single semiconductor and metal coated coupled semiconductor single semiconductors include metallic compounds and organometallic model such as titanium oxide bi based oxides zinc oxide silver tetraoxophosphate and many more they have been used to photocatalytically decompose organic contaminants the metal based hybrid nanocomposites material is redox capable and has a high charge separation efficiency all of these factors are critical for the efficient photocatalytic breakdown of organic contaminants fig 4 depicts the photocatalytic mechanism of a metal metal oxide decorated graphene sheet for organic pollutant degradation mohamed et al 169 found that the multifunctional effects of ag ca and go on the structural characteristics of the graphene based composite increased the photocatalytic activity of ag cdse go ca nanocomposites according to the authors go acts as an electron acceptor increasing the effectiveness of removing photo generated carriers as well as the combined composite carrier perera et al 170 created tio2 nanotube reduced graphene oxide composites using an alkaline hydrothermal technique the photocatalytic activity of the composites was shown to be highly influenced by the rgo tio2 ratio due to its high surface area and excellent electron hole separation the composite with 10 rgo had the highest photocatalytic activity with a threefold improvement in photocatalytic efficiency over pure tio2 nanotubes under uv and visible light pan et al 171 employed the application of hydrothermal method to fabricate go tio2 nanowires and nanoparticles tio2 nanowires disperse more uniformly on graphene with less agglomeration than tio2 nanoparticles resulting in more direct contact between tio2 and graphene and thus enhanced electron hole pair separation and transportation as a result go tio2 nanowires outperform go tio2 nanoparticles pure tio2 nanowires and tio2 nanoparticles in terms of relative photocatalytic activity the combination of graphene materials with coupled semiconductors have become a research area of focus because it usually possesses extensive benefits of improving the disintegration of electron hole pairs and retaining oxidation and reduction at two separate sites for reaction 172 composite photocatalysts nezno cds go was produced via a simplified hydrothermal process by huo et al 173 the composite showed significant photocatalytic activities preparation of hetero junction photocatalyst ag3po4 bivo4 rgo was a success through a simplified in situ deposition process tayel et al 174 discovered that coating tio2 with graphene oxide increased the tio2 catalytic activity by a factor of 1 2 the primary photocatalytic activity of tio2 resulted from the electron acceptance and go transport 31 the electrons accepted by go were produced on the tio2 surface in the presence of light which reduces electron hole recombination and increases the production of active holes 175 another reason for the increased titanium oxide photocatalytic activity was the reduction in the width of the tio2 band gap caused by the go addition this band gap narrowing allows the photocatalyst to produce radicals at elongated wavelengths several researchers have recently considered integrating two or more metallic oxides with go as a potential method for increasing catalytically enhanced activity when organic pollutant begin to degrade xu et al 2020 investigated the photocatalytic degradation activities of ciprofloxacin cip norfloxacin nor and tetracycline tc over a series of rgo bi4o5br2 the authors revealed from the results obtained that photodegradation of these target antibiotics almost never be possible without adding any photocatalysts the photodegradation of these antibiotics was successfully commenced by using bi4o5br2 nanosheets and rgo bi4o5br2 nanocomposites as photocatalysts as expected the degradation efficiency of each target antibiotic at any rgo bi4o5br2 nanocomposites is greater than that of bi4o5br2 nanosheet bi4o5br2 on the surface of the rgo bi4o5br2 nanocomposites can be excited to produce electrons e and holes h when illuminated by simulated sunlight the photogenerated holes can react efficiently with the target antibiotics pollutant to degrade them and to remove the photogenerated electron hole pairs effectively as a result of their excellent electron reservoir capability of rgo and conductivity photogenerated electrons can be transferred quickly to the rgo bi4o5br2 nanocomposite surface to reacted with o2 thus generating o2 radicals meanwhile the instantaneous formation of oh by the reaction of o2 radicals and h is also possible following that o2 and oh radicals can oxidize the target antibiotics adsorbed on the surface of the rgo bi4o5br2 nanocomposite to complete the photodegradation process fakhri and bagheri 176 reported the fabrication of uio 66 wg for the photocatalytic degradation tetracycline tc and malathion ma it was clearly reported by the authors that after photocatalytic efficiency of 84 and 100 was achieved for tc and ma respectively by uio 66 35wg as an optimum photocatalyst after 70 min of irradiation the uio 66 35wg showed enhanced response to visible light better separation of charge carriers good contacting between energy levels of components and more availability of active site that are responsible for its superior photodegradation efficiency in compared with pristine uio 66 the photocatalytic mechanism verified that o2 is main radical species involved in this process finally the authors concluded that precise positioning of energy levels belonging to components and the formation of an electrical field results in effective charge transfer and enhanced separation of electron hole pairs which is advantageous in a photocatalytic system wang et al 177 explored the fabrication of magnetic cobalt ferrite reduced graphene oxide cf rgo porous balls for effective photocatalytic degradation of oxytetracycline it was revealed that enhanced adsorption makes it easier for the photocatalyst to have strong interaction with otc thereby improving the degradation efficiency under visible light irradiation λ 420nm the light excited cf rgo 0 2 to produce electron hole pairs h exhibits strong oxidation capacity and can directly oxidize otc at the same time electrons are captured by rgo which effectively reduces the charge carrier recombination in addition the unique porous balls increase the light absorption capacity and provided more catalytic centers therefore cf rgo showed good photocatalytic activity in photocatalytic redox reaction with 84 7 degradation efficiency the trapping experiments revealed that holes h and superoxide radicals o2 played a crucial role in the degradation of otc implying a possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline tc under visible light using by reduced graphene oxide decorated moo3 tio2 nanocomposite was investigated by ali et al 178 according to the authors rgo decreases electron hole pair recombination by functioning as an acceptor of photo generated electrons from tio2 moo3 nanoparticles as a result it generates even more photo generated holes promoting the formation of reactive oxygen species and pollutant degradation surface imperfections on the tio2 moo3 surface of the rgo can retain electrons in this case and the intermediate product can then replicate surface defects via interfacial charge transfer the presence of defects that act as trapping centres can extend the lifetime of electrons or holes in metal oxide coupling and photocatalytic activity rises as rgo concentration increases the authors also reported that the excellent photo degradation impact of tc via the gr moo3 tio2 was due to the synergetic interfacial interaction of the graphene sheets and the moo3 tio2 furthermore the moo3 tio2 was utilized as a migration vehicle for the visible light carrier while the decreased graphene sheet s large surface area and number of active sites increased photocatalytic activity with almost 94 tc photodegraded during 80 min under visible light irradiation zhang et al 179 studied the photodegradation performance tetracycline tc onto pg tio2 under uv and visible light the authors observed that tio2 photocatalytic activity was discovered to be closely linked to its surface phase and the creation of a surface phase junction between anatase and rutile may facilitate spatial charge separation it was also observed that the pg might shift the light absorption edge from uv to visible light resulting in additional photogenerated electron holes furthermore there was a dual effect resulting from tio2 and pg combination which involves the enhancing adsorption of visible light while also improving the separation ability of e and h to significantly inhibit e and h recombination the authors proposed adsorption and photocatalytic mechanism is that first as an effective absorbent during dark conditions the pg and tio2 reactive interface would adsorb a large amount of tc molecules to the material s surface and into the confined area second under visible and uv light tio2 was bombarded with energy higher than the band gap while electrons e in the valence band could absorb the photon energy causing them to migrate to the conduction band and form electropositive holes h in the valence band thirdly to prevent charge recombination h and e moved from the interior to the surface of pg and the interface functioned as the activity sites by interacting with h2o h produced oh and electrons on the surface of pg tio2 produce o2 by absorbing o2 lastly the photocatalytic process involving active species o2 h and oh were involved in redox reactions which were responsible for the removal of tc via degradation of its molecules to form smaller organic molecules co2 and h2o ghorbanih and salem 180 reported the performance of hybridized materials containing graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes cnts to photocatalytically treat sewage released out of an industrial estate their findings revealed the capability of hybridized nanocomposites to treat the accumulated sewages at various steps of the industrial recovery process between the anaerobic system and the sand filter the suitable distribution ratio of graphene and cnts were calculated to be 3 33 the end result of parameters such as initial cod period of irradiation sewage collection position as well as ph on treatment performance were investigated the maximum photo activity was reached in 20 min by keeping the ph of the sewage at 8 the authors consider larger surface area of 60 m2 g and lower band gap energy of 2 1 ev as responsible ag3po4 graphene and ag3po4 graphene ag was synthesized by zhou et al 41 via chemical precipitation for the decomposition of sulfamethoxazole under synthetic solar radiation 1 ppm of sulfamethoxazole was almost totally degraded in 30 min using the two photocatalysts the integration of ag on ag3po4 graphene did not show any reasonable upgrade in its photocatalytic functionality for sulfamethoxazole decomposition as compared to its pure form the contribution of the ag load is therefore unclear and subject to further research hetero junction composites cao et al 181 found that photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline using magnetic go ce tio2 degraded 82 9 of the tetracycline priya et al 182 also accounted that ampicillin and oxytetracycline were photocatalytically degraded by bi2o3 biocl reinforced on chitosan and graphene sand composite with 95 ampicillin removal attained in 1 h solar light 175 the photocatalyst revealed 90 tc adsorption under visible light radiation 183 this is higher than those obtained from bivo4 ag3po4 bivo4 and rgo bivo4 which showed 56 82 and 78 adsorption respectively wang et al 137 successfully developed a c3n4 mnfe2o4 graphene composite for antibiotic degradation the four antibiotics studied were metronidazole amoxicillin tetracycline and ciprofloxacin and c3n4 mnfe2o4 grephene composites removed 94 5 of metronidazole which was approximately 3 5 times greater than pure g c3n4 guan et al 184 successfully fabricated z scheme photocatalyst for tc hydrochloride decomposition using bi2wo6 nanosheets graphene oxide and silver bromide nanomaterials the modified z scheme composite 15 agbr 5go bi2wo6 15a 5g bw showed increased intersurface charge separation and transmission because of go s exceptional electrical conductivity consequently 15a 5g bw showed the best tc hydrochloride photocatalytic activities under visible light radiation the peak decomposition effectiveness of 84 and the kinetic constant was found to be greater at 0 0515 min approximately 4 60 and 3 16 times than that of agbr and bi2wo6 respectively biobr mos2 graphene oxide bismuth oxybromide molybdenum disulfide go fabrication was reported used by li et al 185 to modify the capability of photocatalytic decomposition and adsorption of oxytetracycline otc the composites exhibited an excellent photocatalytic functionality for oxytetracycline decomposition in the presence of visible light radiation oxytetracycline doxycycline chloro tc were spontaneously adsorbed with over 98 decomposition rate in 40 min further studies can be undertaken taking into consideration the benefits of ion doping and coupled semiconductors towards improving photocatalytic activity and graphene composite synthesis alamgholiloo et al 186 fabricated a novel and effective go cubdc fe3o4 ternary nanocomposite for ciprofloxacin cip degradation according to the authors the ternary nanocomposite demonstrated the highest cip degradation rate 98 5 in 24 min with a rate constant of 0 191 min 1 the results showed that cu fe species and co groups in ternary nanocomposite catalyzed pms to the generation of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals for cip decomposition moreover the ternary nanocomposite demonstrated a high possibility of regeneration allowing the catalyst to be easily separated from reaction mixtures with an external magnet however radical quenching tests and electron paramagnetic resonance epr showed that hydroxyl and sulphate ions play an important part in the decomposition process according to hsieh et al 187 recent advances have been made in the treatment of wastewater from industrial and medical sector untreated antibiotics which are easily seen in effluents released by hospitals and manufacturers alike have drawn the attention of environmentalists the authors developed graphene quantum dot zno composites that were used as a photocatalyst for metronidazole degradation the results revealed an ultra high removal efficiency 100 and a substantially increased reaction rate constant that was 1 74 times above the pristine sample in summary n gqds improve visible light absorption and increase photo induced charge carriers this is due to the n functionalized gqds having a smaller optical band gap 3 0 to 3 5 ev thereby propelling charge transfer in the heterostructure improving photocurrent generation and restricting electron hole recombination from pristine zno crystals exposed to uv light 8 recyclability of graphene based nanomaterials due to its low economic cost and environmental sustainability graphene has been widely applied in industrial applications high quality product yield at minimal cost implication is a major consideration in any industrial process however as compared to lab scale conditions the industrial application is tougher and more complex the stability and reusability of graphene must therefore be high for it to be considered for continuous process development for industrial application 188 a major advantage of graphene based nanomaterials is their stableness recyclability and ability to regenerate from a solution high adsorption capability should not be the only criteria for an excellent adsorbent but also outstanding desorption capacity which will significantly increase the effectiveness and reduce operational cost therefore reusability and desorption are pertinent for graphene based nanomaterials to be applied commercially 189 graphene based adsorbents must be subjected to separation from the medium regeneration and recycling after utilization in effluent decontamination the small particle size of these sorbents makes it difficult and strenuous to separate 190 although rgo is derived from go it differs significantly from go in terms of thermophysical properties as a result of the oxygen containing functional groups present in go phonon scattering occurs resulting in extremely low thermal conductivity of go however oxygen containing functional groups can be removed to some extent and thermal conductivity will be increased following the reduction process 191 several methods have been deployed to efficiently separate graphene based sorbents from wastewater among which the most handing is centrifugation crossflow filtration field flow fractionation and electric field 192 mu et al 193 also described the development of 3 dimensional nanostructured composite sorbents of rgo and wo3 rgo wo3 for the removal of strontium ion sr2 from aqueous solutions adsorption isotherms reveal the experimental data well fitted the langmuir isotherm r 0 99 and the peak adsorption capability of 149 56 mg g was attained which is m greater than that of go wo3 and other close related sorbents treatment of sr2 by rgo wo3 attained equilibrium in 3 h 20 min the abundant treatment sites made available by the diffused wo3 nanoparticles on the reduced graphene oxide surface made treatment rate faster and higher for rgo wo3 moreso the presence of sodium ions has no discernible impact on the adsorption of sr2 ions on rgo wo3 and the adsorption desorption experiment with rgo wo3 sorbent is recyclable at least 5 times without substantial adsorption capability loss xiao et al 194 investigated desorption of antibiotics from prepared molybdenum di sulfide graphene oxide supported magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 go mos2 using acetonitrile can as eluent desorption was obtained as 90 2 87 8 and 85 6 for pazcofloxacin lecofloxacin and gatifloxacin respectively they also carried out reusability tests under ideal conditions the study s findings revealed that the fe3o4 go mos2 material could be reused 10 times without significant loss qiao et al 195 synthesized mgo zno nanocomposites mz which was used in the removal of tetracycline tc the maximum adsorption capability of 1590 28 mg g observed in their study recyclability studies showed that mz could be recycled up to four times with no apparent decrease in photocatalytic activity resulting from incomplete desorption of tc alamgholiloo et al 186 used a green solvothermal technique to fabricate a novel ternary nanocomposite go cubdc fe3o4 which was employed in degrading ciprofloxacin cip antibiotic a 98 5 removal rate was observed for cip and still showed good degradation capability after four cycles signifying the stability of the catalyst the synergistic effect of magnetic particle coupling with graphene or go can be the panacea to resolving the challenges that graphene separation poses according to bulin et al 196 magnetization enables the practical use of go in the production of adsorbents this is because very little energy is required which can be achieved by the use of an external magnetic field to provide excellent separation 29 197 the high chemical stability of magnetic graphene oxide mgo and its nanocomposites make it desirable and gradually position itself as an emergent and efficient treatment technology the efficacy of mgo has been studied and can be used extensively in treating aqueous biomedical effluents including radionuclides and antibiotics a contaminant of emerging concern moreover mgo has good hydrophilic and magnetic properties and has been observed to be more stably dispersed in aqueous solution in addition it reduces the chances of severe agglomeration and nanosheet restacking allowing for easy solid liquid separation process mgo is created by modifying magnetic materials such as ferric oxide to go 197 mgo can be made reusable by treatment mineral acids and bases at low concentration such as hcl hno3 naoh and sodium carbonate the capacity for adsorption and regeneration is equal or even greater than other sorbents when compared ullah et al 198 synthesized reduced mgo polyaniline rmgo pani as a sorbent for the adsorption of moxifloxacin mox and ofloxacin ofl from the aqueous samples they achieved adsorption efficacy of 99 for mox and 96 for ofl the adsorbent was reused repeatedly 10 times maintaining an excellent removal capacity shi et al 2020 synthesized cds reduced graphene rgo znfe2o4 zfo nanocomposite system to attain efficacious photo fenton decomposition of tetracycline tc in the presence of visible light radiation the authors found out that cds rgo zfo composite material adsorbed 80 of tc mineralized at a 59 2 in 1 h attributable to the photo fenton synergistic effect in cds rgo zfo with the capacity of producing and degrading h2o2 meanwhile the cds rgo zfo photocatalyst s prominent magnetic recovery property ensured economic benefits the cds rgo zfo adsorbent was reused after 4 cycles the recyclability of graphene based nanomaterials based on cycle of used with various biomedical pollutants is presented in table 6 9 future perspectives the potential of graphene and its composites in wastewater treatment application towards the removal of biomedical pollutants and toxic compounds is significant novel treatment methods were developed years ago and their performance can be improved by incorporating novel functional materials like go and graphene based nanoparticles simultaneous adsorption and photodegradation is now seen as a new strategy in biomedical wastewater treatment beyond phase transfer offering degradation and possible mineralization of pollutants studying the influential factors and underlying mechanism that accompany the treatment process will also go a long way to improve the understanding and subsequent applicability of these materials researchers are also beginning to introduce graphene and its derivatives into traditional photocatalyst like zno and tio2 the success of this hybrid nanoparticle has been validated by recent research which positions it as one of the most promising technologies in wastewater decontamination and treatment 208 209 however the treatment efficacy for real biomedical waste considering the presence of multiple contaminants is yet unknown and should be further looked into little work relating to process optimization methods such as taguchi and response surface methodology have been carried out research on optimal conditions that ensure maximum treatment efficiency is encouraged if full scale deployment and industrial application is going to be achieved life cycle assessment studies that map out raw material acquisition synthesis use and disposal are encouraged to reduce its environmental impact and ensure sustainability 10 conclusion the benefits of medicine and medical healthcare are undisputed however production and extensive use has resulted in waste generation and biomedical pollution with current innovation development and advanced medical technology there are new challenges such as biomedical waste management for instance the amount of waste generated during production of pharmaceuticals varies greatly in amount and type 200 to 30 000 kg of wastes per kg of active ingredients can be generated relatively higher than the actual finished product existing treatment methods cannot meet quality threshold values regulations while government authorities impose stricter measures medical facilities are thus faced with challenges associated with adequate treatment of the waste and effluents they generate more advanced technologies have been sought as conventional methods can no longer handle emerging contaminants vis à vis the stricter regulatory guidelines high surface area improved chemical properties lower cost and high regeneration capacity for reuse make nanomaterials advantageous for treatment processes in wastewater management and decontamination graphene and graphene oxide go are a unique nanomaterial for water and wastewater treatment they possess inherent chemical and physicochemical properties such as good biocompatibility high surface area optical thermal and electrical conductivities making them unique and very suitable for decontaminating wastewater nevertheless little has been extensive research for possibility of its application in biomedical waste treatment except for antibiotics and related metabolites funding fundamental research grant scheme frgs under project code frgs 1 2019 tk10 curtin 02 2 credit authorship contribution

community composition and nitrogen cycle pathways results show that the increased olr from 0 47 to 3 36 kg m 3 d 1 with different influent organic and nitrogen cod n ratios from 0 25 to 1 0 caused the specific nitrogen removal rate of the granules to decrease by 60 9 which was accompanied by a looser granular structure and poor settling property inorganic feeding was then used to recover the performance of the granules and the removal of total inorganic nitrogen rose to 78 4 at a nitrogen loading rate of 3 36 kg m 3 d 1 based on high throughput sequencing biodegradable organics shaped the bacterial community structure in the granules by enriching symbiotic heterotrophs such as chloroflexi proteobacteria and bacteroidetes and washing out the anammox biomass candidatus kuenenia dominated the anammox biomass while candidatus brocadia was also found which coordinated with aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas in the pn a process metagenomic analysis indicates that biodegradable organic stress and performance recovery significantly changed the composition of nitrogen cycle related genes in the granules in terms of a lower capacity of anammox and higher risk of

carbon of the b stage especially the biodegradable component could significantly influence the pn a process on one hand the low strength organics at cod n ratios of 0 2 1 0 would improve the nitrogen

nitritation anammox and denitrification snad process 15 17 moreover the influent organics also shape the anaob community through the growth of organotrophic members such as candidatus brocadia fulgida and the metabolic diversity of anaob is favorable for the stability of the pn a process 18 19 on the other hand the enriched hb take the advantage when competing with aob for oxygen and living space

carried out over 260 days table 1 in phases i iii the influent cod n ratio was set at 0 25 while the initial nitrogen loading rate nlr of 1 87 kg n m 3 d 1 was increased to 3 36 kg n m 3 d 1 by stepwise decreasing the hydraulic retention time hrt from 0 9 to 0 5 h in phases iv vi the cod n ratio was increased from 0 25 to 1 0 by stepwise increasing the influent cod concentration at a constant nlr of 3 36 kg n m 3 d 1 in phase vii the inorganic influent was introduced into the cstr to recover the performance of the granules after biodegradable organic stress throughout the operational period the do concentration was maintained at 0 6 1 0 mg l 1 by controlling the air flow rate and the water temperature was set at 25 1 c 2 2 analytical methods the concentration of mlvss n species and sludge volume index after 5 min settling svi5 were measured using the procedure described in the standard methods 25 the total inorganic nitrogen tin concentration is equal to the sum of the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations the f value was calculated as the produced no3 n to one unit mass of removed nh4 n which was theoretically estimated at 0 11 for the pn a process according to eq 1 the granule size distribution was determined using the sludge weight percent in four fractions namely 0 5 0 5 1 25 1 25 2 0 2 0 mm and the mean particle size was calculated on the percent of dry weight at intervals after the pretreatment which involved fixation washing dehydration and seasoning the granule morphology was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem fei quanta 250 usa to determine the ex situ activity of the granules during different phases batch testing at 25 c in mg n g 1 vss h 1 was conducted to measure the specific nh4 n removal no2 n and no3 n accumulation and tin removal rates were measured by represented by q nh4 n q no2 n q no3 n and q tin respectively as described in a previous report 24 2 3 microbial characterization 2 3 1 high throughput sequencing analysis variations in the microbial community structure of the granules were analyzed by high throughput sequencing seven groups of granular sludge samples g1 g7 were collected in duplicate on days 1 seed sludge 60 phase i 123 phase iii 172 phase iv 198 phase v 229 phase vi and 260 phase vii the genomic dna was extracted using the e z n a soil dna isolation kit omega bio tek inc usa and the primer pair of 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 was used in the amplification of the bacterial v3 v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene the polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification program followed a previous report 7 and purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar concentrations and then paired end sequenced on the illumina miseq platform illumina usa at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd china the raw data has been deposited in the sequence database of national center for biotechnology information ncbi accession number srp402371 operational taxonomic units otus were clustered using uparse at a 97 similarity cutoff alpha diversity analysis including the chao1 and ace richness indices and the shannon and simpson diversity indices was conducted using mothur software principal component analysis pca was performed to assess the differences in the microbial community of the granules and multivariate association with linear models maaslin analysis was used to investigate the relationship between the functional bacteria and the olr 26 based on the high throughput sequencing data bacterial functional capabilities of the biogeochemical cycles were predicted using the functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax www zoology ubc ca louca faprotax and annotated via the kegg database 27 2 3 2 metagenomic sequencing analysis two groups of granular samples g1 and g7 were collected for metagenomic sequencing during phases i day 1 and vii day 260 of reactor operation purified dna samples were fragmented to an average length of 400 bp for paired end library construction after adapter ligation and amplification paired end sequencing was performed on the illumina hiseq platform the raw data has been deposited to the ncbi database accession number srp srp401923 low quality adapter polluted reads were removed from the raw sequencing data through fastq table s1 after assembly using megahit v1 1 3 with optimized sequences 300 bp contigs were selected as the assembly results for gene prediction analysis metagene was employed to predict the open reading frames orfs for each sample and the ncbi database was used to covert

soapaligner was used to map reads to representative genes with 95 identity to evaluate the gene abundance in the samples functional annotation was completed using blastp with the ncbi and kegg function databases 28 typical nitrogen cycle genes were selected for heat map visualization analysis and the data were processed by ln rpkm the results are displayed as an abundance map of key enzymes related to nitrogen cycle genes 3 results and discussion 3 1 granular reactor performance in phase i days 1 64 the do concentration in the cstr ranged between 0 6 mg l 1 and 0 8 mg l 1 at an hrt of 0 9 h in which the oxygen limited condition within the granules was maintained using residual nh4 n in the effluent 12 29 30 as displayed in fig 1 the granules tended to acclimate to the low cod n ratio of 0 25 and the q tin value showed a dramatic reduction and slow rise during the first 50 days the tin removal was increased from 43 6 on day 50 to 81 8 on day 63 resulting in residual nh4 n and tin concentrations of 2 5 mg l 1 and 12 6 mg l 1 respectively during this period the mlvss concentration increased by 1 36 times compared to the inoculum while the svi5 value was stable at around 25 0 ml g 1 showing a dense granule structure fig s1 during the following two phases a sharp decrease in tin removal and a gradual recovery were observed with the stepwise decrease of the hrt from 0 9 h to 0 5 h at a constant cod n ratio specifically tin removal of the cstr significantly decreased to 43 6 on day 85 but then reached 77 0 on day 100 phase ii during phase iii the lowest tin removal efficiency was 36 5 on day 101 and then increased to 72 5 on day 128 with the effluent nh4 n of 10 3 mg l 1 and no2 n concentrations of 3 6 mg l 1 respectively the f value was estimated at 0 10 which is close to the theoretical value of 0 11 for the pn a process eq 1 indicating that a limited denitrification process was conducted under the aerobic condition in the cstr moreover the hrt of 0 5 h caused biomass washout decreasing the mlvss from 8010 mg l 1 on day 65 to 6370 mg l 1 on day 123 subsequently 0 5 1 25 mm became the dominant granule size range with a mean of 1 39 mm in the end of phase iii the granules exhibited a q nh4 n of 18 40 mg n g 1vss h 1 and a q tin of 14 86 mg n g 1vss h 1 which were only 6 6 and 8 2 respectively lower than those of the seed sludge in phases iv to vi days 129 229 the influent cod n ratio was stepwise increased from 0 25 to 1 0 at an hrt of 0 5 h the biodegradable organics input deteriorated the nitrogen removal activity of the pn a granules while the high olr significantly suppressed the aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing pathways on day 229 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tin in the cstr were decreased to 18 2 and 13 6 respectively and the q tin was only equal to 39 1 that of the seed sludge nevertheless both the mlvss and particle size persistently increased and a high svi5 value of 34 6 mg l 1 was observed at the end of phase vi the poorer sludge settling property was mainly due to the looser structure of the granules and the growth of filamentous microorganisms on the outer layer fig s1 to recover the activity of the pn a granules inorganic feeding was introduced into the cstr on day 230 during which a sufficient nh4 n concentration nh4 n 4 mg l 1 and limited aeration do 1 0 mg l 1 provided a reliable approach to suppress nob growth in the continuous flow model 29 over the following 30 days nh4 n and tin removal dramatically increased to 94 1 and 78 4 respectively the short hrt of 0 5 h was beneficial for washing away heterotrophic biomass from the surface layer of the granules which caused a decrease in the svi5 value and improved the compactness of the granules fig s1 on day 260 the q tin increased to 14 97 mg n g 1vss h 1 which was comparable with that of the seed sludge and 1 39 times higher than that observed at the end of phase vi however the relatively high f value of 0 13 revealed that olr impact changed the microbial community in the pn a granules 20 30 3 2 variation in bacterial community structure as shown in fig 2 high throughput sequencing results coverage rations above 99 7 showed that the biodegradable organic input promoted an increased the bacterial richness ace and chao1 indexes and diversity shannon and simpson indexes in g2 g7 compared to the seed sludge g1 which was related to the development of the more complex metabolic processes in the granules increasing the olr by decreasing hrt in phases i iii and increasing influent cod n ratio in phases iv vi significantly influenced the bacterial community in the pn a granules in terms of pca distance at the otu level fig 2c although both g1 and g7 were harvested from the cstr with inorganic feeding the otu count of g7 was 1 32 higher than that of g1 as corroborated by the sem images of the granule surface layers fig s1 fig 3a illustrates that planctomycetes a typical anaob was the predominant phylum in g1 accounting for a relative abundance of 52 2 followed by chloroflexi 17 6 proteobacteria 15 9 bacteroidetes 5 1 and acidobacteria 3 6 several studies have demonstrated the mutualistic relationships between anaob and omnipresent community members in complex metabolic networks through interspecies cross feedings in which anaob donate small fatty acids b vitamins and extracellular polymeric substances eps to auxotrophic hb such as chloroflexi while anaob obtain secondary metabolites from other microorganisms such as proteobacteria 31 32 in addition the decreased hrt at the cod n ratio of 0 25 resulted in the reduction of planctomycetes by nearly half in g3 while the enrichment of chloroflexi bacteroidetes and proteobacteria affiliated bacteria was observed this trend was also found with the increasing cod n ratio however the granules exhibited a good retention ability of anaob biomass showing the relative abundance of planctomycetes around 23 2 in g6 although the nitrogen removal performance of the granules was significantly recovered in phase vii g7 shared a similar bacterial community structure at the phylum level with g6 fig 3b shows that the genus candidatus kuenenia k strategists k s for no2 n of 0 2 3 0 μm 33 was the predominate anaob member in the inoculum which coordinated with the genus nitrosomonas phylum proteobacteria as an aob driving the pn a process anaerolineaceae phylum chloroflexi another abundant genus in g1 12 5 in total is involved in carbohydrate related metabolism such as fermentation under anaerobic conditions and provides a solid skeleton for the granular sludge 10 34 with the increasing olr in the cstr from 0 47 kg m 3 d 1 phase i to 3 36 kg m 3 d 1 phase vi the percentage of candidatus kuenenia significantly decreased from 47 4 in g1 to 20 0 in g6 while candidatus brocadia r strategists k s for no2 n of 34 350 μm 33 which adapted to the substance rich conditions was detected in the granules this could be explained by candidatus brocadia having the competitive advantage over k strategist anaob due to the higher utilization rates of volatile organic acids 35 36 metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis has shown that candidatus brocadia can oxidize acetate into co2 at a rate of 0 95 0 04 μmol g protein 1 min 1 and then assimilate it via the acetyl coa pathway thereby showing a stronger capability for organotrophic metabolism than candidatus kuenenia which oxidizes acetate at 0 31 0 03 μmol g protein 1 min 1 33 37 as mentioned in section 3 1 the enrichment of hb resulted in a looser granular structure with the increasing olr in the cstr based on the opd theory 9 the larger aerobic layer benefitted the growth of nitrosomonas which showed 3 3 times higher fraction in g6 than that in g1 as shown in fig 3c and table s2 the maaslin analysis indicates that the proteobacteria affiliated woodsholea and ferrovibrio the chloroflexi affiliated norank c ardenticatenia and the bacteroidetes affiliated unclassified o sphingobacteriales had significant positive correlations with the olr while the negative correlations were found for candidatus kuenenia and unclassified f planctomycetaceae p value 0 05 previous reports have demonstrated that excess biodegradable organic input changes the neutralistic relationship between hb and aob into one of amensalism in the granules thereby causing a great negative effect on the anaob growth 21 38 39 it is also noteworthy that nitrospira affiliated nob were not found in the top 40 genera of the granules thus the decreased tin removal in the cstr was mainly due to suppression of the aob and anaob strains instead of nob proliferation similarly liang et al 40 also reported that increasing influent cod n ratios benefitted nob suppression of in terms of the bioactivity and biodiversity with hb outcompeting for oxygen and living space in the following recovery period g6 and g7 showed comparable fractions of candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia however the decreased abundance of acetate degradation members such as unclassified o sphingobacteriales aquimonas lysobacter and woodsholea and the growth of anaob symbiotic denitrifiers such as denitratisoma were in line with variations in the performance and morphology of the granules 22 41 3 3 bacterial nitrogen cycling networks faprotax software was used to predict and screen functional genes related to carbon and nitrogen cycling in different sample groups g1 g3 g6 and g7 as shown in fig 4a and table s3 anammox nitrite respiration and nitrogen respiration were the dominant functional gene categories for nitrogen metabolism in g1 which had relatively lower abundances of aerobic chemoheterotrophy chemoheterotrophy and photohetertrophy than the other sample groups as mentioned above the compact granules effectively protected the anaob biomass from complete washout in the anoxic core and the colony of hb on the surface of the granules exhibited limited denitrification performance at the high olr under aerobic conditions do 0 6 mg l 1 8 35 it is reasonable that the relative abundances of nitrate reduction nitrate respiration and various denitrification genes were significantly lower than anammox related genes in g3 and g6 although inorganic feeding was used for g7 aerobic chemoheterotrophy chemoheterotrophy fermentation nitrification and denitrification related genes were more abundant than in g1 thereby revealing the function shaping caused by biodegradable organic input on the granules metagenomic analysis was then used to compare the abundances of nitrogen cycle related genes encoding key enzymes between g1 and g7 fig 4b for the nitritation process nh4 nh2oh no2 aob nitrosomonas exhibited a higher abundance of genes for alkene monooxygenase amoa amob amoc and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao in g7 than in g1 compared to the low levels of genes for nitrite oxidoreductase nxra and nxrb affiliated with nob nitrospira in the granules anaob dominated by candidatus kuenenia mainly contributed to nxra and nxrb in g1 which oxidizes nitrite to nitrate in inorganic carbon fixation 35 42 and the increased fraction of unclassified p planctomycetes in g7 is in line with the larger f value in the cstr fig 1 the biodegradable organic stress and performance recovery suppressed the anammox for nitrogen removal no2 no nh4 n2h4 n2 by washing out the no forming nitrite reductase nirs hydrazine synthase hzsa hzsb and hzsc and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh genes of candidatus kuenenia and enriching the dissimilatory nitrite reductase nrfa and nrfh of planctomycetes affiliated microorganisms for dnra 17 43 44 unlike nitritation and anammox denitrification is usually conducted by diverse bacterial community members and many heterotrophic denitrifiers cannot encode the complete denitrification pathways from no3 to n2 45 46 although heterophic denitrification was limited by inorganic feeding in two groups of granules g7 had larger potential for no3 n no2 n reduction and nitrous oxide n2o emission than g1 in terms of the higher amount of genes for nitrate reductase napa and napb in unclassified o phycisphaerales nirs and nitric oxide reductase norb in unclassified f xanthomonadaceae and nitric oxide reductase norb and norc in nitrosomonas as well as the lower amount of genes for nitrous oxide reductase nosz in unclassified p chloroflexi unclassified c anaerolineae and unclassified f rhodocyclaceae n2o is a potent greenhouse gas with 130 273 times greater global warming potential higher than that of co2 and some reports have demonstrated that considerable n2o emission can be detected from high rate anammox granular sludge reactors 47 48 thus the nitrogen cycle of pn a granules deserves further investigation by integrating microbial characterization metagenomics and transcriptomics and nitrogen metabolism analysis 4 conclusions the biodegradable organic input showed significant impacts on the nitrogen removal performance sludge morphology and bacterial functions of the pn a granules with an increasing olr from 0 47 to 3 36 kg m 3 d 1 tin removal in the cstr decreased from 81 8 to 13 6 by suppressing the aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing pathways during this period the enrichment of symbiotic hb deteriorated the settling property of the granules while a reduction in anaob dominated by candidatus kuenenia was observed along with candidatus brocadia the q tin value of the granules could be effectively enhanced by implementing inorganic feeding however the bacterial community structure was significantly different from the seed sludge showing a lower capacity for anammox greater dnra potential and higher risk of n2o emission this research offers insight into bacterial self adaption to biodegradable organic stress in pn a granules which could benefit development of a

constant nlr of 3 36 kg n m 3 d 1 in phase vii the inorganic influent was introduced into the cstr to recover the performance of the granules after biodegradable organic stress throughout the operational period the do concentration was maintained at 0 6 1 0 mg l 1 by controlling the air flow rate and the water temperature was set at 25 1 c 2 2 analytical methods the concentration of mlvss n species and sludge volume index after 5 min settling svi5 were measured using the procedure described in the standard methods 25 the total inorganic nitrogen tin concentration is equal to the sum of the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations the f value was calculated as the produced no3 n to one unit mass of removed nh4 n which was theoretically estimated at 0 11 for the pn a process according to eq 1 the granule size distribution was determined using the sludge weight percent in four fractions namely 0 5 0 5 1 25 1 25 2 0 2 0 mm and the mean particle size was calculated on the percent of dry weight at intervals after the pretreatment which involved fixation washing dehydration and seasoning the granule morphology was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem fei quanta 250 usa to determine the ex situ activity of the granules during different phases batch testing at 25 c in mg n g 1 vss h 1 was conducted to measure the specific nh4 n removal no2 n and no3 n accumulation and tin removal rates were measured by represented by q nh4 n q no2 n q no3 n and q tin respectively as described in a previous report 24 2 3 microbial characterization 2 3 1 high throughput sequencing analysis variations in the microbial community structure of the granules were analyzed by high throughput sequencing seven groups of granular sludge samples g1 g7 were collected in duplicate on days 1 seed sludge 60 phase i 123 phase iii 172 phase iv 198 phase v 229 phase vi and 260 phase vii the genomic dna was extracted using the e z n a soil dna isolation kit omega bio tek inc usa and the primer pair of 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 was used in the amplification of the bacterial v3 v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene the polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification program followed a previous report 7 and purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar concentrations and then paired end sequenced on the illumina miseq platform illumina usa at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd china the raw data has been deposited in the sequence database of national center for biotechnology information ncbi accession number srp402371 operational taxonomic units otus were clustered using uparse at a 97 similarity cutoff alpha diversity analysis including the chao1 and ace richness indices and the shannon and simpson diversity indices was conducted using mothur software principal component analysis pca was performed to assess the differences in the microbial community of the granules and multivariate association with linear models maaslin analysis was used to investigate the relationship between the functional bacteria and the olr 26 based on the high throughput sequencing data bacterial functional capabilities of the biogeochemical cycles were predicted using the functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax www zoology ubc ca louca faprotax and annotated via the kegg database 27 2 3 2 metagenomic sequencing analysis two groups of granular samples g1 and g7 were collected for metagenomic sequencing during phases i day 1 and vii day 260 of reactor operation purified dna samples were fragmented to an average length of 400 bp for paired end library construction after adapter ligation and amplification paired end sequencing was performed on the illumina hiseq platform the raw data has been deposited to the ncbi database accession number srp srp401923 low quality adapter polluted reads were removed from the raw sequencing data through fastq table s1 after assembly using megahit v1 1 3 with optimized sequences 300 bp contigs were selected as the assembly results for gene prediction analysis metagene was employed to predict the open reading frames orfs for each sample and the ncbi database was used to covert results 100 bp into amino acid sequences cd hit was used to cluster the gene sequences with 95 sequence identity predicted from all samples and construct a non redundant gene catalog finally soapaligner was used to map reads to representative genes with 95 identity to evaluate the gene abundance in the samples functional annotation was completed using blastp with the ncbi and kegg function databases 28 typical nitrogen cycle genes were selected for heat map visualization analysis and the data were processed by ln rpkm the results are displayed as an abundance map of key enzymes related to nitrogen cycle genes 3 results and discussion 3 1 granular reactor performance in phase i days 1 64 the do concentration in the cstr ranged between 0 6 mg l 1 and 0 8 mg l 1 at an hrt of 0 9 h in which the oxygen limited condition within the granules was maintained using residual nh4 n in the effluent 12 29 30 as displayed in fig 1 the granules tended to acclimate to the low cod n ratio of 0 25 and the q tin value showed a dramatic reduction and slow rise during the first 50 days the tin removal was increased from 43 6 on day 50 to 81 8 on day 63 resulting in residual nh4 n and tin concentrations of 2 5 mg l 1 and 12 6 mg l 1 respectively during this period the mlvss concentration increased by 1 36 times compared to the inoculum while the svi5 value was stable at around 25 0 ml g 1 showing a dense granule structure fig s1 during the following two phases a sharp decrease in tin removal and a gradual recovery were observed with the stepwise decrease of the hrt from 0 9 h to 0 5 h at a constant cod n ratio specifically tin removal of the cstr significantly decreased to 43 6 on day 85 but then reached 77 0 on day 100 phase ii during phase iii the lowest tin removal efficiency was 36 5 on day 101 and then increased to 72 5 on day 128 with the effluent nh4 n of 10 3 mg l 1 and no2 n concentrations of 3 6 mg l 1 respectively the f value was estimated at 0 10 which is close to the theoretical value of 0 11 for the pn a process eq 1 indicating that a limited denitrification process was conducted under the aerobic condition in the cstr moreover the hrt of 0 5 h caused biomass washout decreasing the mlvss from 8010 mg l 1 on day 65 to 6370 mg l 1 on day 123 subsequently 0 5 1 25 mm became the dominant granule size range with a mean of 1 39 mm in the end of phase iii the granules exhibited a q nh4 n of 18 40 mg n g 1vss h 1 and a q tin of 14 86 mg n g 1vss h 1 which were only 6 6 and 8 2 respectively lower than those of the seed sludge in phases iv to vi days 129 229 the influent cod n ratio was stepwise increased from 0 25 to 1 0 at an hrt of 0 5 h the biodegradable organics input deteriorated the nitrogen removal activity of the pn a granules while the high olr significantly suppressed the aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing pathways on day 229 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tin in the cstr were decreased to 18 2 and 13 6 respectively and the q tin was only equal to 39 1 that of the seed sludge nevertheless both the mlvss and particle size persistently increased and a high svi5 value of 34 6 mg l 1 was observed at the end of phase vi the poorer sludge settling property was mainly due to the looser structure of the granules and the growth of filamentous microorganisms on the outer layer fig s1 to recover the activity of the pn a granules inorganic feeding was introduced into the cstr on day 230 during which a sufficient nh4 n concentration nh4 n 4 mg l 1 and limited aeration do 1 0 mg l 1 provided a reliable approach to suppress nob growth in the continuous flow model 29 over the following 30 days nh4 n and tin removal dramatically increased to 94 1 and 78 4 respectively the short hrt of 0 5 h was beneficial for washing away heterotrophic biomass from the surface layer of the granules which caused a decrease in the svi5 value and improved the compactness of the granules fig s1 on day 260 the q tin increased to 14 97 mg n g 1vss h 1 which was comparable with that of the seed sludge and 1 39 times higher than that observed at the end of phase vi however the relatively high f value of 0 13 revealed that olr impact changed the microbial community in the pn a granules 20 30 3 2 variation in bacterial community structure as shown in fig 2 high throughput sequencing results coverage rations above 99 7 showed that the biodegradable organic input promoted an increased the bacterial richness ace and chao1 indexes and diversity shannon and simpson indexes in g2 g7 compared to the seed sludge g1 which was related to the development of the more complex metabolic processes in the granules increasing the olr by decreasing hrt in phases i iii and increasing influent cod n ratio in phases iv vi significantly influenced the bacterial community in the pn a granules in terms of pca distance at the otu level fig 2c although both g1 and g7 were harvested from the cstr with inorganic feeding the otu count of g7 was 1 32 higher than that of g1 as corroborated by the sem images of the granule surface layers fig s1 fig 3a illustrates that planctomycetes a typical anaob was the predominant phylum in g1 accounting for a relative abundance of 52 2 followed by chloroflexi 17 6 proteobacteria 15 9 bacteroidetes 5 1 and acidobacteria 3 6 several studies have demonstrated the mutualistic relationships between anaob and omnipresent community members in complex metabolic networks through interspecies cross feedings in which anaob donate small fatty acids b vitamins and extracellular polymeric substances eps to auxotrophic hb such as chloroflexi while anaob obtain secondary metabolites from other microorganisms such as proteobacteria 31 32 in addition the decreased hrt at the cod n ratio of 0 25 resulted in the reduction of planctomycetes by nearly half in g3 while the enrichment of chloroflexi bacteroidetes and proteobacteria affiliated bacteria was observed this trend was also found with the increasing cod n ratio however the granules exhibited a good retention ability of anaob biomass showing the relative abundance of planctomycetes around 23 2 in g6 although the nitrogen removal performance of the granules was significantly recovered in phase vii g7 shared a similar bacterial community structure at the phylum level with g6 fig 3b shows that the genus candidatus kuenenia k strategists k s for no2 n of 0 2 3 0 μm 33 was the predominate anaob member in the inoculum which coordinated with the genus nitrosomonas phylum proteobacteria as an aob driving the pn a process anaerolineaceae phylum chloroflexi another abundant genus in g1 12 5 in total is involved in carbohydrate related metabolism such as fermentation under anaerobic conditions and provides a solid skeleton for the granular sludge 10 34 with the increasing olr in the cstr from 0 47 kg m 3 d 1 phase i to 3 36 kg m 3 d 1 phase vi the percentage of candidatus kuenenia significantly decreased from 47 4 in g1 to 20 0 in g6 while candidatus brocadia r strategists k s for no2 n of 34 350 μm 33 which adapted to the substance rich conditions was detected in the granules this could be explained by candidatus brocadia having the competitive advantage over k strategist anaob due to the higher utilization rates of volatile organic acids 35 36 metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis has shown that candidatus brocadia can oxidize acetate into co2 at a rate of 0 95 0 04 μmol g protein 1 min 1 and then assimilate it via the acetyl coa pathway thereby showing a stronger capability for organotrophic metabolism than candidatus kuenenia which oxidizes acetate at 0 31 0 03 μmol g protein 1 min 1 33 37 as mentioned in section 3 1 the enrichment of hb resulted in a looser granular structure with the increasing olr in the cstr based on the opd theory 9 the larger aerobic layer benefitted the growth of nitrosomonas which showed 3 3 times higher fraction in g6 than that in g1 as shown in fig 3c and table s2 the maaslin analysis indicates that the proteobacteria affiliated woodsholea and ferrovibrio the chloroflexi affiliated norank c ardenticatenia and the bacteroidetes affiliated unclassified o sphingobacteriales had significant positive correlations with the olr while the negative correlations were found for candidatus kuenenia and unclassified f planctomycetaceae p value 0 05 previous reports have demonstrated that excess biodegradable organic input changes the neutralistic relationship between hb and aob into one of amensalism in the granules thereby causing a great negative effect on the anaob growth 21 38 39 it is also noteworthy that nitrospira affiliated nob were not found in the top 40 genera of the granules thus the decreased tin removal in the cstr was mainly due to suppression of the aob and anaob strains instead of nob proliferation similarly liang et al 40 also reported that increasing influent cod n ratios benefitted nob suppression of in terms of the bioactivity and biodiversity with hb outcompeting for oxygen and living space in the following recovery period g6 and g7 showed comparable fractions of candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia however the decreased abundance of acetate degradation members such as unclassified o sphingobacteriales aquimonas lysobacter and woodsholea and the growth of anaob symbiotic denitrifiers such as denitratisoma were in line with variations in the performance and morphology of the granules 22 41 3 3 bacterial nitrogen cycling networks faprotax software was used to predict and screen functional genes related to carbon and nitrogen cycling in different sample groups g1 g3 g6 and g7 as shown in fig 4a and table s3 anammox nitrite respiration and nitrogen respiration were the dominant functional gene categories for nitrogen metabolism in g1 which had relatively lower abundances of aerobic chemoheterotrophy chemoheterotrophy and photohetertrophy than the other sample groups as mentioned above the compact granules effectively protected the anaob biomass from complete washout in the anoxic core and the colony of hb on the surface of the granules exhibited limited denitrification performance at the high olr under aerobic conditions do 0 6 mg l 1 8 35 it is reasonable that the relative abundances of nitrate reduction nitrate respiration and various denitrification genes were significantly lower than anammox related genes in g3 and g6 although inorganic feeding was used for g7 aerobic chemoheterotrophy chemoheterotrophy fermentation nitrification and denitrification related genes were more abundant than in g1 thereby revealing the function shaping caused by biodegradable organic input on the granules metagenomic analysis was then used to compare the abundances of nitrogen cycle related genes encoding key enzymes between g1 and g7 fig 4b for the nitritation process nh4 nh2oh no2 aob nitrosomonas exhibited a higher abundance of genes for alkene monooxygenase amoa amob amoc and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao in g7 than in g1 compared to the low levels of genes for nitrite oxidoreductase nxra and nxrb affiliated with nob nitrospira in the granules anaob dominated by candidatus kuenenia mainly contributed to nxra and nxrb in g1 which oxidizes nitrite to nitrate in inorganic carbon fixation 35 42 and the increased fraction of unclassified p planctomycetes in g7 is in line with the larger f value in the cstr fig 1 the biodegradable organic stress and performance recovery suppressed the anammox for nitrogen removal no2 no nh4 n2h4 n2 by washing out the no forming nitrite reductase nirs hydrazine synthase hzsa hzsb and hzsc and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh genes of candidatus kuenenia and enriching the dissimilatory nitrite reductase nrfa and nrfh of planctomycetes affiliated microorganisms for dnra 17 43 44 unlike nitritation and anammox denitrification is usually conducted by diverse bacterial community members and many heterotrophic denitrifiers cannot encode the complete denitrification pathways from no3 to n2 45 46 although heterophic denitrification was limited by inorganic feeding in two groups of granules g7 had larger potential for no3 n no2 n reduction and nitrous oxide n2o emission than g1 in terms of the higher amount of genes for nitrate reductase napa and napb in unclassified o phycisphaerales nirs and nitric oxide reductase norb in unclassified f xanthomonadaceae and nitric oxide reductase norb and norc in nitrosomonas as well as the lower amount of genes for nitrous oxide reductase nosz in unclassified p chloroflexi unclassified c anaerolineae and unclassified f rhodocyclaceae n2o is a potent greenhouse gas with 130 273 times greater global warming potential higher than that of co2 and some reports have demonstrated that considerable n2o emission can be detected from high rate anammox granular sludge reactors 47 48 thus the nitrogen cycle of pn a granules deserves further investigation by integrating microbial characterization metagenomics and transcriptomics and nitrogen metabolism analysis 4 conclusions the biodegradable organic input showed significant impacts on the nitrogen removal performance sludge morphology and bacterial functions of the pn a granules with an increasing olr from 0 47 to 3 36 kg m 3 d 1 tin removal in the cstr decreased from 81 8 to 13 6 by suppressing the aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing pathways during this period the enrichment of symbiotic hb deteriorated the settling property of the granules while a reduction in anaob dominated by candidatus kuenenia was observed along with candidatus brocadia the q tin value of the granules could be effectively enhanced by implementing inorganic feeding however the bacterial community structure was significantly different from the seed sludge showing a lower capacity for anammox greater dnra potential and higher risk of n2o emission this research offers insight into bacterial self adaption to biodegradable organic stress in pn a granules which could benefit development of a mature strategy of process control for engineering application credit authorship contribution statement feiyue qian resources conceptualization supervision writing review editing yaru liu writing
