14770,lentic water bodies including lakes reservoirs and wetlands retain excess nutrients in runoff from agricultural and urban activities and protect downstream water bodies from eutrophication to develop effective nutrient mitigation strategies it is important to understand the controls on nutrient retention in lentic systems and what drives variability between different systems and geographical regions efforts to synthesize water body nutrient retention at the global scale are biased toward studies from north america and europe numerous studies published in chinese language journals exist in the extensive china national knowledge infrastructure cnki but are missing from global synthesis due to their absence in english language journal databases we address this gap by synthesizing data from 417 waterbodies in china to assess hydrologic and biogeochemical drivers of nutrient retention in this study we found median retention of 46 and 51 for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively across all water bodies in our national synthesis and on average wetlands retain more nutrients than lakes or reservoirs the analysis of this dataset highlights the influence of water body size on first order nutrient removal rate constants as well as how regional temperature variations affect nutrient retention in water bodies the dataset was used to calibrate the hydrobio k model which explicitly considers the effect of residence times and temperature on nutrient retention application of the hydrobio k model across china reveals patterns of nutrient removal potential where regions with a higher density of small water bodies retain more nutrients than others such that regions like the yangtze river basin with a greater proportion of smaller water bodies have greater retention rates our results emphasize the importance of lentic systems and their function in nutrient removal and water quality improvement as well as the drivers and variability of these functions at the landscape scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water pollution nutrient retention nitrogen phosphorus small water bodies data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the past century human activity especially the extensive use of fertilizers has greatly altered global nutrient cycling gruber and galloway 2008 liu et al 2016 excess fertilizer enters water bodies through runoff exacerbating the eutrophication of inland and coastal waters van meter et al 2018 china is facing serious problems with excessive fertilizer use and degradation of water quality beyond that of most other countries bouwman et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 as the world s largest fertilizer applying country almost all provinces have exceeded the chinese standard for nitrogen n in surface water yu et al 2019 lakes rivers wetlands and reservoirs are important sinks for n and phosphorus p on the landscape in light of the high n and p use in farmland bouwman et al 2017 shen et al 2023 the sink function of inland water bodies is particularly important nutrient retention within a water body is defined as the difference between the inputs and outputs and includes both permanent and temporary removal pathways for n conversion to n gas via denitrification is considered a permanent n removal process and is the dominant pathway by which n is retained from moving downstream vymazal 2007 unlike n p has no permanent removal pathway instead p is temporarily retained through processes including sedimentation adsorption and uptake by plants and microorganisms reddy et al 1999 in general lentic waters i e lakes wetlands and reservoirs retain more nutrients than fluvial waters i e rivers and streams therefore they are important hotspots for both denitrification and p retention baron et al 2013 while much is known about nutrient retention in individual water bodies at the site level there is still a dearth of knowledge on how retention varies across geographies factors influencing nutrient retention processes have been discussed extensively in site level studies and even some meta analyses and include temperature ph vegetation water depth and hydraulic residence time hrt among others liang et al 2011 mayer et al 2007 shen et al 2021 in general these factors can be grouped into two categories hydrologic including hrt water depth etc and biogeochemical including temperature vegetation etc previous efforts to model nutrient retention in water bodies at the landscape scale have focused only on hydrologic controls cheng and basu 2017 but temperature also affects nutrient retention including the main pathway for n removal from aquatic systems denitrification dai et al 2020 knowles 1982 incorporating temperature into landscape nutrient retention modeling could improve their accuracy particularly over broad geographic areas like china which span large climatic gradients for large scale studies such as national or global syntheses a major limitation is the difficulty of harmonizing data across different studies and particularly across different types of ecosystems groffman et al 2006 still there have been a few attempts of global meta analyses to explore nutrient processing in inland water bodies cheng and basu 2017 jordan et al 2011 land et al 2016 land et al 2016 conducted a global meta analysis on the efficacy of constructed wetlands for nutrient retention and cheng and basu 2017 constructed a global water body dataset to analyze the nutrient retention of different lentic water bodies and their dominant controls however these global statistical analyses are biased toward studies from north america and europe and there is a significant underrepresentation of data from china despite the existence of many site level studies that have been conducted in china the majority of china based field studies have been published in chinese journals and without available translations these studies are rarely included in global syntheses not only do these data provide an opportunity for furthering our understanding of water resources in one of the most populous countries of the world but its availability to english speaking audiences brings value for global synthesis the overall goals of this study are therefore to establish a dataset of nutrient retention across water bodies in china and assess the dominant controls on their nutrient retention potential we will focus on both total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in our study the specific objectives of this study include 1 compiling data of nutrient retention in chinese waterbodies 2 developing a parsimonious model that describes nutrient retention as a function of hydrologic and biogeochemical controls and 3 scaling up the model to estimate nutrient retention across all water bodies in china both at the individual water body scale and at the scale of third order river basins 2 methods 2 1 constructing a nutrient retention dataset of water bodies in china a dataset of water bodies in china and their nutrient processing capabilities was constructed through a literature review in scopus and china national knowledge infrastructure cnki the largest and most accessed academic database in china in 2021 using the following search strings nutrients or nitrogen or nitrate or phosphorus or phosphate and wetland or lake or pond or reservoir and china or hong kong or macao or taiwan for inclusion in the dataset several criteria needed to be met first only field studies were included and studies conducted in constructed wetlands or mesocosm environments were included provided that they were set up outside and included vegetation second studies had to report input and output loads or concentrations of either tn or tp as well as hrt hydraulic residence time in addition to these parameters we extracted information from each study including water body surface area and depth mean annual temperature and other relevant site information our literature review yielded a total of 436 studies for inclusion in the dataset of chinese water bodies more than 90 of these studies were published in chinese language journals some studies reported multiple observations for a single water body yielding a total of 785 observations for tn and 625 for tp fig 1 for context previous meta analyses of nutrient retention in lentic water bodies by land et al 2016 and cheng and basu 2017 only included 4 and 11 studies conducted in china respectively this represents more than a 40 fold increase in the availability of data that is now accessible in english for global synthesis these data are valuable for understanding the role of water bodies in nutrient retention in china and as contributions to the global analytical dataset 2 2 examining controls on the nutrient removal rate constant k nutrient removal and retention rwbody in water bodies is estimated as the difference between the input and output load 1 r w b o d y m i n m o u t m i n 100 where m i n is the mass flux into the water body m as reported in the study and includes inputs from both non point sources and point sources of pollution and m o u t m is the mass flux at the outlet reported in the studies retention processes are typically modeled as first order kinetic reactions for both n and p cheng and basu 2017 yang et al 2016 2 k ln 1 r w b o d y 100 1 t where k is the first order removal rate constant d 1 and t is the mean water residence time i e hrt d all nutrient retention pathways such as denitrification and sedimentation are implicitly assumed to be included in the removal rate constants k we evaluated the effect of hydrology and morphology versus temperature on the reaction rate constants using two approaches first to assess the influence of temperature on the nutrient removal rate constant k the dataset was binned into three groups by site temperature which captures the range of climatic regimes found across china the kruskal wallis test was used to compare the differences between groups we then developed regression relationships between the first order removal rate constants and various hydrologic factors that describe the water bodies namely surface area hrt and depth the relationships between the residuals of the regression functions between k and hrt and temperature were evaluated to understand if temperature explained some of the scatter in the relationship 2 3 developing the hydrobio k model for nutrient retention a hydrologic and biogeochemical processes based removal rate constant hydrobio k model was established for predicting k using multiple linear regression the specific model equation is 3 ln k a l n x h y d r o b t c c where a b and c are constants xhydro represents one of the hydrologic parameters hrt surface area and water depth and tc is the corrected temperature that has been normalized as 4 t c t 20 10 where t is the mean annual temperature at each study location 20 is the reference temperature that most denitrification measurements have occurred and 10 is the normalized parameter the temperature correction is derived from the relationship describing the increase in microbial denitrification with temperature wollheim et al 2008 in this model we utilize air temperature as it is a readily obtainable parameter compared to water temperature which can enhance the ease of applying the model when b eq 3 is set to zero the model predicts nutrient removal using only the hydrologic parameters allowing independent evaluation of the hydrologic contributions to this ecosystem function the processes for building the relationship between k and hydrological and biogeochemical parameters are shown in section 3 2 the hydrobio k model was calibrated using the chinese waterbody dataset created in section 2 1 importantly the database we constructed is not limited to the hydrobio k model and can also be used for other waterbody nutrient removal models including the global news model and the image model mayorga et al 2010 beusen et al 2016 2015 by necessity negative removal rate constants were omitted from model fitting in order to solve for the exponent using logarithms but this data is still retained in the dataset to compare the use of different hydrologic parameters only observations from studies with all relevant parameters reported hrt surface area water depth were used additionally the hydrobio k model underwent a parameter sensitivity analysis using the one at a time oat measure wherein one parameter was varied at a time while holding the others fixed hamby 1994 the mean standard deviation sd of the parameters was used to conduct the oat analysis table s1 in order to compare the sensitivity of different parameters we used the sensitivity index i 5 i δ o δ f f o where f is the parameter in hydrobio k model i e a b or c δ f is the change of f o is the origin model results δ o is the results change due to the change of the parameter here we chose two model output metrics for the sensitive analysis national mean k value for the single waterbody and mean nutrient retention at the third order river basin scale table s2 the larger the absolute value of the i the higher the sensitivity of the parameter to compare the effect of temperature hydrology and morphology we used different versions of the hydrobio k model and evaluated several metrics for the goodness of fit the three metrics used for model comparison were 6 r 2 1 s s r s s t 7 a i c n l n s s r 2 p 1 n l n n 8 b i c n l n s s r p 1 l n n n l n n where r2 is the coefficient of determination aic is the akaike information criterion bic is the bayesian information criterion ssr is the sum of squared residuals sst is the total sum of squares n is the sample size and p is the number of independent variables r2 shows how well the data fits the regression model the higher the r2 the better the model however r2 alone is not sufficient for comparing models of different complexity because more complex models often have higher r2 at the expense of interpretability compared to r2 aic and bic penalize the inclusion of additional variables in a model bic has a stronger penalty the lower the aic and bic the better the model the model with the maximum r2 and minimum aic and bic were used to evaluate the national water body nutrient retention 2 4 nutrient retention in water bodies at the watershed scales the hydrobio k model was applied to estimate the removal rate constant of every individual water body in china input data for the water body scale removal rate constant calculation includes hrt and temperature fig 2 as hrt is difficult to obtain directly surface area was used to estimate hrt for each water body using the following relationship 9 h r t c a w b o d y d where c and d are constants and a w b o d y represents the individual water body surface area m2 the hrt area relationship was fitted using all water bodies included in the present study fig s2 the watershed scale nutrient retention percent r w s h d was evaluated as the sum of individual water body nutrient retention as 10 r w s h d i n α r w b o d y i a w b o d y i a w s h d where n is the number of water bodies in the watershed a w s h d is the watershed area m2 and α is the catchment area to waterbody area ratio cheng et al 2020 wu and lane 2017 2023 this equation yields an estimate of watershed nutrient removal as a fraction of nutrient input to the watershed regardless of the absolute mass of n input to the watershed the watershed scale assessment was conducted in third order river basins and then aggregated to first order river basins considering the great uncertainty of α and its effects on results table s2 monte carlo simulations were used to show the uncertainty of the results at the watershed scale we conducted 200 monte carlo simulations and the results were shown as mean sd in this paper besides in some basins the sum of water body contributing area can sometimes be great than the basins area in these cases the α was adjusted to make sure the sum of water body contributing area is equal to the basin area cheng et al 2020 we used china s national land use and cover change cnlucc land use map 30 m resolution the year 2015 to identify water bodies including lakes reservoirs ponds and wetlands and excluding rivers and paddy wetlands xu et al 2018 the surface area of individual water bodies was calculated from the national water body map the average annual temperature for each water body was derived from the annual spatial interpolation dataset of meteorological elements in china which is 1 km grid cell daily temperature data generated by spatial interpolation of observations from more than 2400 meteorological stations nationwide xu 2022 spatial analysis was performed in arcmap 10 3 and statistical analysis was conducted in origin 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing nutrient retention across different water bodies in china in general the median retention was 46 and 51 for n and p respectively across all water bodies in china median tn retention percent for wetlands lakes and reservoirs is 49 40 and 30 respectively while for tp the median values are 56 43 and 40 respectively fig 3 we found the retention percentages for wetlands to be significantly greater than lakes and reservoirs for both tn and tp while retention percentages were not significantly different between lakes and reservoirs fig 3 this trend may be driven by differences in water depth because shallower water bodies have a greater surface area of contact with sediments that promote nutrient uptake and retention cheng and basu 2017 shen et al 2021 in our dataset the mean water depth of reservoirs exceeded 20 m while the mean water depth in wetlands was 0 7 m these results are similar to existing studies which report retention percentages ranging from 32 to 49 for tn and 48 to 50 for tp cheng and basu 2017 land et al 2016 note that 0 4 and 1 1 of the studies documented negative retention percentages for tn and tp and these have been removed in further analysis in addition our dataset shows that the retention rate of tp is greater than that of tn this finding is unexpected given that n has a permanent removal pathway for lentic waterbodies while p does not influent n is microbially converted to n2 by nitrification and denitrification a process that is sensitive to the surrounding temperature and oxygen conditions however p retention has no analogous microbially mediated retention pathway and instead is retained in water bodies mainly through sedimentation and adsorption hendriks and langeveld 2017 it should be noted that while denitrification is a permanent removal pathway for n p is only temporarily stored in sediments thus making it possible to release p in cases of environmental disturbance for example in taihu lake wind speeds greater than 6 m s disturb sediments releasing p and turning the lake from a pollution sink to the source qin et al 2006 3 2 hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on the nutrient removal rate constant we used the dataset to explore the correlation between hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on the removal rate constants k similar to cheng and basu 2017 we found a significant inverse relationship between k and the hydraulic retention time hrt p 0 01 a power function was able to describe the k hrt relationship for both tn and tp fig 4 the hypothesis of physical constraints i e sediment area to volume ratio as described before is considered the dominant factor limiting k cheng and basu 2017 the exponent of power function in this study was 1 0 and 1 0 for tn and tp respectively our findings are slightly lower than the exponents reported in cheng and basu 2017 of 0 91 for tn and 0 75 for tp this difference may be related to the latitude of the study sites most of the sites in our dataset are located in the subtropical and temperate zones while the global water body dataset in cheng and basu s paper represent a wider range of latitudes specifically our findings corroborate that large water bodies have lower nutrient removal rate constants as they have a smaller sediment area to volume ratio similar to the k hrt relationship k also showed a significant inverse correlation with the surface area and depth of the water bodies fig s1 p 0 01 albeit the relationships were weaker than the k hrt relationship unsurprisingly the three hydrological parameters hrt surface area and water depth are strongly correlated with one another p 0 01 whereby larger and deeper water bodies have longer hrt the relationships between these physical parameters suggest that water body size and depth can be used to estimate hrt which is useful in cases where hrt cannot be directly obtained next we explored whether temperature can be used as an additional factor to explain some of the scatter in the k hrt relationship temperature varies widely across china ranging from the tropical zone to the cool temperate zone fig 5a and thus it is important to understand how this variation impacts the nutrient removal rate constants to explore this relationship we divided k into three groups according to temperature t we used cut off values for temperatures of 15 and 20 such that group 1 is t 15 group 2 is 15 t 20 and group 3 is t 20 fig 5 our results showed a significant difference between the three groups for tn p 0 05 while for tp only group 3 t 20 was significantly different from the other two groups fig 5b these results indicated that temperature impacts both n and p retention processes but n removal is more sensitive to temperature compared to p finally we explored the correlation between kt where kt is the residual of k and kh and kh is given by the power function relationship as shown in fig 4 and tc we found a significant positive correlation between tc and kt p 0 01 for tn and p 0 05 for tp and an exponential function can be used to describe the tc kt relationship p 0 01 as denitrification is the main pathway for n removal these exponential results are consistent with the relationship between denitrification rate and temperature established by previous studies donner et al 2002 kovacic et al 2000 3 3 hydrobio k model parameters calibration we tested several regression model formulations to describe k as a function of hrt surface area water depth and mean temperature in the case of the single factor hydrologic model no 1 3 in table 1 the hrt produced the best overall results all hydrobio k models no 4 6 in table 1 show a marginal improvement over the single factor hydrologic model with the same hydrologic parameter the addition of the temperature parameter to the hydrologic model improves model performance for both n and p though the improvement is more significant for n this finding supports the hypothesis that the retention of n in water bodies is more dependent on biological processes as compared to p for which retention is more strongly mediated by physical processes these results demonstrate the importance of considering temperature for nutrient retention especially for n among all the models inclusion of tc and hrt yielded the best model performance model no 5 model in table 1 although the improvement in r2 is modest compared to the model no 2 model in table 1 before introducing tc the aic and bic indicate the improvement is not negligible even considering the increase in variables furthermore the minor contribution of temperature to the hydrobio k model is meaningful when extrapolating across a region with widely different climatic zones such as china based on the no 5 model in table the sensitivity analysis results showed that parameter a in eq 3 was the most sensitive consistent with our previous results suggesting that hydrological processes are the main process controlling nutrient removal table s2 the hydrobio k model offers a quick and concise means of assessing water bodies with readily available input data previous attempts to model nutrient retention including the global news mayorga et al 2010 and image beusen et al 2016 2015 models employ default parameters to estimate retention whereas the hydrobio k model is parameterized with data directly from our study region of china furthermore the database we constructed here is not limited to this one use but can be readily applied to other water body nutrient retention models including global news and image another strength of our model is that is provides an annual k value for individual water bodies however one limitation is that it cannot accurately reflect seasonal or short term variations in k for instance during periods of increased precipitation and flow rates hrt and removal rate constants can fluctuate rapidly and the hydrobio k model has difficulty capturing these changes 3 4 variation in removal rate constant between water bodies the best performing model no 5 in table 1 was applied across all water bodies in china to assess the variability in the removal rates constant of tn and tp the removal rate constants k varied substantially across more than 250 000 water bodies in china with a mean rate constant of 2 3 10 2 1 7 10 2 d 1 mean sd for tn and 3 3 10 2 2 1 10 2 d 1 for tp respectively fig s3 the distribution of rate constants is driven both by water body size and the substantial temperature gradient across the country to explore this variability further we estimated the mean nutrient removal rate at the scale of ten first order river basins in china fig 6a mean removal rate constants k across all water bodies in these ten basins ranged from 1 1 10 2 to 2 6 10 2 d 1 for tn and from 1 9 10 2 to 3 6 10 2 d 1 for tp the medium value of k and its range at the first class river basin scale was shown in table s3 this spatial heterogeneity can be attributed to differences in temperature as china s first order basins span a broad temperature range the songhua river basin has the lowest annual average temperature 2 2 and the corresponding lowest value for the rate constant 1 1 10 2 d 1 for tn and 1 9 10 2 d 1 for tp while the pearl river basin with the highest annual average temperature of 20 5 has a much greater rate constant 2 6 10 2 and 3 6 10 2 d 1 for tn and tp respectively indeed we found a linear relationship between the mean k value at the river basin scale and the mean annual temperature across the basin for both tn fig 6b and tp fig 6c we found that for every degree increase in temperature the k value increased by 7 8 10 4 for tn and 8 1 10 4 for tp while the linearity observed in the k t relationship is not unexpected given the incorporation of t in the hydrobio k model what was interesting is that the yangtze river basin deviated from the overall statistical trend fig 6b c though the yangtze river basin is not the region with the highest temperature it has the highest k value we argue that this occurs because the basin average k value is an effective property that depends on both the temperature and the distribution of water body sizes across the basin compared to other basins the yangtze river basin has a higher proportion of small water bodies and because small water bodies have larger k the size effect plays a greater role here compared to the temperature effect the proportion of small water bodies surface area 104 m2 in the yangtze river basin exceeds 30 compared to a range of 8 to 20 for all other basins fig 6d e this result emphasizes the importance of small water bodies in nutrient retention however under the influence of human activities small water bodies in many parts of the world are under significant threat from drainage and conversion to other land uses curado et al 2011 van meter and basu 2015 the hydrobio k model based assessment of water bodies highlights the importance of protecting and restoring small water bodies 3 5 cumulative nutrient retention potential at the watershed scale spatially explicit calculations of nutrient retention potential at the scale of the individual water bodies fig 7a can be used to assess n and p retention at the third order river basin scale rwshd fig 7b c china s water bodies are most densely distributed in northeastern china the tibetan plateau and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin fig 7a where the percent water body area range from 4 to 7 in contrast regions like northwestern china such as xinjiang province and southwest basin have a much lower density of water bodies among all ten first order river basins southwest basin has the lowest percent water body area comprising only 1 of the watershed regions with the highest percent water body area also correspond to greater nutrient retention potential the songhua river basin has the highest percent nutrient retention with 14 6 mean sd and 24 10 for tn and tp respectively fig 7d e in contrast although the yangtze river basin has the highest k value the percent nutrient retention was only 7 4 for tn and 10 5 for tp due to the low overall percent water body area however the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin have much higher percent nutrient retention 13 7 for tn and 17 9 tp than the basin as a whole because the percent water body area is much greater in these sub basins the nuance of the spatial distribution of water bodies is critical as anthropogenic nutrient inputs also vary regionally and can be quite high in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin shen et al 2023 yan et al 2022 for another major river basin in china yellow river basin the percent nutrient retention was 5 2 for tn and 8 4 for tp respectively the percent nutrient retention in the yellow river basin is relatively lower compared to the yangtze river basin which can be attributed to the low percent water body area it is also important to note that percent retention at the watershed scale is lower than percent retention at the water body scale and this accounts for portions of the catchments that do not drain into lentic water bodies 4 conclusion inland water bodies are important sinks of nutrients and other contaminants in the landscape however there currently is a lack of understanding on the magnitudes of nutrient retention across water body size and climatic gradients here we build a dataset on nutrient retention in lentic systems with a specific focus on china a region that has been underrepresented in most global studies this is particularly important in the context of increasing fertilizer inputs and degrading water quality across farmlands and rivers in china we compiled data from studies published in chinese language journals increasing the number of studies from china previously available for inclusion in global meta analyses from fewer than 15 cheng and basu 2017 land et al 2016 to more than 436 studies we found median retention of 46 and 51 for n and p respectively across the water bodies in our national synthesis with wetlands more efficiently retaining nutrients than either lakes or reservoirs we used this dataset to develop a new model the hydrobio k model that explicitly considers the effect of both residence time and temperature on nutrient retention in water bodies the hydrobio k model provides quick estimates of n and p removal efficiency for both single water bodies and watershed scales the model was used to estimate spatial patterns in nutrient retention across china for both first and third order river basins the removal rate constant k varied substantially at the water body scale across china with a mean rate constant of 2 3 10 2 1 7 10 2 d 1 mean sd for tn and 3 3 10 2 2 1 10 2 d 1 for tp respectively variation in k can be attributed primarily to differences in temperature that varied from 2 2 in the songhua river basin to 20 5 in the pearl river basin interestingly in the yangtze river basin we found the prevalence of small water bodies outweighs the effect of colder temperatures resulting in higher overall nutrient retention than basins with similar climates at the watershed scale the percent nutrient removal potential is driven primarily by the percent area coverage of water bodies for example cold regions like the songhua river basin have high nutrient removal potential due to the high percent water body area despite having a lower removal rate constant our results highlight the role of water body density water body size and temperature on nutrient removal potentials across water bodies in china while most global syntheses of nutrient retention rates are biased towards north america and europe our work brings a large dataset of nutrient retention in china to english speaking audiences this dataset can be used in future global syntheses of nutrient cycling and retention in lentic systems analysis of this dataset demonstrates the importance of water body size as a control on first order nutrient removal rate constants and like similar studies underscores the role of small water bodies in nutrient retention cheng and basu 2017 unlike previous works our model also demonstrates how regional temperature differences influence nutrient retention in water bodies finding higher removal rate constants in warmer regions application of the hydrobio k model across china reveals patterns of nutrient removal potential where regions with a higher density of small water bodies retain more nutrients than others our results help understand broad spatial patterns of nutrient retention at the national scale in china that can help managers to better understand the role of water bodies in the landscape and to develop environmental management strategies this understanding is critical as water bodies in china and globally are undergoing rapid reconfiguration due to climate change and human activities agriculture and urbanization our upscaled watershed scale retention percentages results highlight dual control of the size distribution of water bodies and regional temperature gradients a national scale assessment of the nutrient retention potential of water bodies in the context of their changing distribution on the landscape will help improve strategies for water body protection and

14770,lentic water bodies including lakes reservoirs and wetlands retain excess nutrients in runoff from agricultural and urban activities and protect downstream water bodies from eutrophication to develop effective nutrient mitigation strategies it is important to understand the controls on nutrient retention in lentic systems and what drives variability between different systems and geographical regions efforts to synthesize water body nutrient retention at the global scale are biased toward studies from north america and europe numerous studies published in chinese language journals exist in the extensive china national knowledge infrastructure cnki but are missing from global synthesis due to their absence in english language journal databases we address this gap by synthesizing data from 417 waterbodies in china to assess hydrologic and biogeochemical drivers of nutrient retention in this study we found median retention of 46 and 51 for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively across all water bodies in our national synthesis and on average wetlands retain more nutrients than lakes or reservoirs the analysis of this dataset highlights the influence of water body size on first order nutrient removal rate constants as well as how regional temperature variations affect nutrient retention in water bodies the dataset was used to calibrate the hydrobio k model which explicitly considers the effect of residence times and temperature on nutrient retention application of the hydrobio k model across china reveals patterns of nutrient removal potential where regions with a higher density of small water bodies retain more nutrients than others such that regions like the yangtze river basin with a greater proportion of smaller water bodies have greater retention rates our results emphasize the importance of lentic systems and their function in nutrient removal and water quality improvement as well as the drivers and variability of these functions at

nutrient retention modeling could improve their accuracy particularly over broad geographic areas like china which span large climatic gradients for large scale studies such as national or global syntheses a major limitation is the difficulty of harmonizing data across different studies and particularly across different types of ecosystems groffman et al 2006 still there have been a few attempts of global meta analyses to explore nutrient processing in inland water bodies cheng and basu 2017 jordan et al 2011 land et al 2016 land et al 2016 conducted a global meta analysis on the efficacy of constructed wetlands for nutrient retention and cheng and basu 2017 constructed a global water body dataset to analyze the nutrient retention of different lentic water bodies and their dominant controls however these global statistical analyses are biased toward studies from north america and europe and there is a significant underrepresentation of data from china despite the existence of many site level studies that have been conducted in china the majority of china based field studies have been published in chinese journals and without available translations these studies are rarely included in global syntheses not only do these data provide an opportunity for furthering our understanding of water resources in one of the most populous countries of the world but its availability to english speaking audiences brings value for global synthesis the overall goals of this study are therefore to establish a dataset of nutrient retention across water bodies in china and assess the dominant controls on their nutrient retention potential we will focus on both total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in our study the specific objectives of this study include 1 compiling data of nutrient retention in chinese waterbodies 2 developing a parsimonious model that describes nutrient retention as a function of hydrologic and biogeochemical controls and 3 scaling up the model to estimate nutrient retention across all water bodies in china both at the individual water body scale and at the scale of third order river basins 2 methods 2 1 constructing a nutrient retention dataset of water bodies in china a dataset of water bodies in china and their nutrient processing capabilities was constructed through a literature review in scopus and china national knowledge infrastructure cnki the largest and most accessed academic database in china in 2021 using the following search strings nutrients or nitrogen or nitrate or phosphorus or phosphate and wetland or lake or pond or reservoir and china or hong kong or macao or taiwan for inclusion in the dataset several criteria needed to be met first only field studies were included and studies conducted in constructed wetlands or mesocosm environments were included provided that they were set up outside and included vegetation second studies had to report input and output loads or concentrations of either tn or tp as well as hrt hydraulic residence time in addition to these parameters we extracted information from each study including water body surface area and depth mean annual temperature and other relevant site information our literature review yielded a total of 436 studies for inclusion in the dataset of chinese water bodies more than 90 of these studies were published in chinese language journals some studies reported multiple observations for a single water body yielding a total of 785 observations for tn and 625 for tp fig 1 for context previous meta analyses of nutrient retention in lentic water bodies by land et al 2016 and cheng and basu 2017 only included 4 and 11 studies conducted in china respectively this represents more than a 40 fold increase in the availability of data that is now accessible in english for global synthesis these data are valuable for understanding the role of water bodies in nutrient retention in china and as contributions to the global analytical dataset 2 2 examining controls on the nutrient removal rate constant k nutrient removal and retention rwbody in water bodies is estimated as the difference between the input and output load 1 r w b o d y m i n m o u t m i n 100 where m i n is the mass flux into the water body m as reported in the study and includes inputs from both non point sources and point sources of pollution and m o u t m is the mass flux at the outlet reported in the studies retention processes are typically modeled as first order kinetic reactions for both n and p cheng and basu 2017 yang et al 2016 2 k ln 1 r w b o d y 100 1 t where k is the first order removal rate constant d 1 and t is the mean water residence time i e hrt d all nutrient retention pathways such as denitrification and sedimentation are implicitly assumed to be included in the removal rate constants k we evaluated the effect of hydrology and morphology versus temperature on the reaction rate constants using two approaches first to assess the influence of temperature on the nutrient removal rate constant k the dataset was binned into three groups by site temperature which captures the range of climatic regimes found across china the kruskal wallis test was used to compare the differences between groups we then developed regression relationships between the first order removal rate constants and various hydrologic factors that describe the water bodies namely surface area hrt and depth the relationships between the residuals of the regression functions between k and hrt and temperature were evaluated to understand if temperature explained some of the scatter in the relationship 2 3 developing the hydrobio k model for nutrient retention a hydrologic and biogeochemical processes based removal rate constant hydrobio k model was established for predicting k using multiple linear regression the specific model equation is 3 ln k a l n x h y d r o b t c c where a b and c are constants xhydro represents one of the hydrologic parameters hrt surface area and water depth and tc is the corrected temperature that has been normalized as 4 t c t 20 10 where t is the mean annual temperature at each study location 20 is the reference temperature that most denitrification measurements have occurred and 10 is the normalized parameter the temperature correction is derived from the relationship describing the increase in microbial denitrification with temperature wollheim et al 2008 in this model we utilize air temperature as it is a readily obtainable parameter compared to water temperature which can enhance the ease of applying the model when b eq 3 is set to zero the model predicts nutrient removal using only the hydrologic parameters allowing independent evaluation of the hydrologic contributions to this ecosystem function the processes for building the relationship between k and hydrological and biogeochemical parameters are shown in section 3 2 the hydrobio k model was calibrated using the chinese waterbody dataset created in section 2 1 importantly the database we constructed is not limited to the hydrobio k model and can also be used for other waterbody nutrient removal models including the global news model and the image model mayorga et al 2010 beusen et al 2016 2015 by necessity negative removal rate constants were omitted from model fitting in order to solve for the exponent using logarithms but this data is still retained in the dataset to compare the use of different hydrologic parameters only observations from studies with all relevant parameters reported hrt surface area water depth were used additionally the hydrobio k model underwent a parameter sensitivity analysis using the one at a time oat measure wherein one parameter was varied at a time while holding the others fixed hamby 1994 the mean standard deviation sd of the parameters was used to conduct the oat analysis table s1 in order to compare the sensitivity of different parameters we used the sensitivity index i 5 i δ o δ f f o where f is the parameter in hydrobio k model i e a b or c δ f is the change of f o is the origin model results δ o is the results change due to the change of the parameter here we chose two model output metrics for the sensitive analysis national mean k value for the single waterbody and mean nutrient retention at the third order river basin scale table s2 the larger the absolute value of the i the higher the sensitivity of the parameter to compare the effect of temperature hydrology and morphology we used different versions of the hydrobio k model and evaluated several metrics for the goodness of fit the three metrics used for model comparison were 6 r 2 1 s s r s s t 7 a i c n l n s s r 2 p 1 n l n n 8 b i c n l n s s r p 1 l n n n l n n where r2 is the coefficient of determination aic is the akaike information criterion bic is the bayesian information criterion ssr is the sum of squared residuals sst is the total sum of squares n is the sample size and p is the number of independent variables r2 shows how well the data fits the regression model the higher the r2 the better the model however r2 alone is not sufficient for comparing models of different complexity because more complex models often have higher r2 at the expense of interpretability compared to r2 aic and bic penalize the inclusion of additional variables in a model bic has a stronger penalty the lower the aic and bic the better the model the model with the maximum r2 and minimum aic and bic were used to evaluate the national water body nutrient retention 2 4 nutrient retention in water bodies at the watershed scales the hydrobio k model was applied to estimate the removal rate constant of every individual water body in china input data for the water body scale removal rate constant calculation includes hrt and temperature fig 2 as hrt is difficult to obtain directly surface area was used to estimate hrt for each water body using the following relationship 9 h r t c a w b o d y d where c and d are constants and a w b o d y represents the individual water body surface area m2 the hrt area relationship was fitted using all water bodies included in the present study fig s2 the watershed scale nutrient retention percent r w s h d was evaluated as the sum of individual water body nutrient retention as 10 r w s h d i n α r w b o d y i a w b o d y i a w s h d where n is the number of water bodies in the watershed a w s h d is the watershed area m2 and α is the catchment area to waterbody area ratio cheng et al 2020 wu and lane 2017 2023 this equation yields an estimate of watershed nutrient removal as a fraction of nutrient input to the watershed regardless of the absolute mass of n input to the watershed the watershed scale assessment was conducted in third order river basins and then aggregated to first order river basins considering the great uncertainty of α and its effects on results table s2 monte carlo simulations were used to show the uncertainty of the results at the watershed scale we conducted 200 monte carlo simulations and the results were shown as mean sd in this paper besides in some basins the sum of water body contributing area can sometimes be great than the basins area in these cases the α was adjusted to make sure the sum of water body contributing area is equal to the basin area cheng et al 2020 we used china s national land use and cover change cnlucc land use map 30 m resolution the year 2015 to identify water bodies including lakes reservoirs ponds and wetlands and excluding rivers and paddy wetlands xu et al 2018 the surface area of individual water bodies was calculated from the national water body map the average annual temperature for each water body was derived from the annual spatial interpolation dataset of meteorological elements in china which is 1 km grid cell daily temperature data generated by spatial interpolation of observations from more than 2400 meteorological stations nationwide xu 2022 spatial analysis was performed in arcmap 10 3 and statistical analysis was conducted in origin 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing nutrient retention across different water bodies in china in general the median retention was 46 and 51 for n and p respectively across all water bodies in china median tn retention percent for wetlands lakes and reservoirs is 49 40 and 30 respectively while for tp the median values are 56 43 and 40 respectively fig 3 we found the retention percentages for wetlands to be significantly greater than lakes and reservoirs for both tn and tp while retention percentages were not significantly different between lakes and reservoirs fig 3 this trend may be driven by differences in water depth because shallower water bodies have a greater surface area of contact with sediments that promote nutrient uptake and retention cheng and basu 2017 shen et al 2021 in our dataset the mean water depth of reservoirs exceeded 20 m while the mean water depth in wetlands was 0 7 m these results are similar to existing studies which report retention percentages ranging from 32 to 49 for tn and 48 to 50 for tp cheng and basu 2017 land et al 2016 note that 0 4 and 1 1 of the studies documented negative retention percentages for tn and tp and these have been removed in further analysis in addition our dataset shows that the retention rate of tp is greater than that of tn this finding is unexpected given that n has a permanent removal pathway for lentic waterbodies while p does not influent n is microbially converted to n2 by nitrification and denitrification a process that is sensitive to the surrounding temperature and oxygen conditions however p retention has no analogous microbially mediated retention pathway and instead is retained in water bodies mainly through sedimentation and adsorption hendriks and langeveld 2017 it should be noted that while denitrification is a permanent removal pathway for n p is only temporarily stored in sediments thus making it possible to release p in cases of environmental disturbance for example in taihu lake wind speeds greater than 6 m s disturb sediments releasing p and turning the lake from a pollution sink to the source qin et al 2006 3 2 hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on the nutrient removal rate constant we used the dataset to explore the correlation between hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on the removal rate constants k similar to cheng and basu 2017 we found a significant inverse relationship between k and the hydraulic retention time hrt p 0 01 a power function was able to describe the k hrt relationship for both tn and tp fig 4 the hypothesis of physical constraints i e sediment area to volume ratio as described before is considered the dominant factor limiting k cheng and basu 2017 the exponent of power function in this study was 1 0 and 1 0 for tn and tp respectively our findings are slightly lower than the exponents reported in cheng and basu 2017 of 0 91 for tn and 0 75 for tp this difference may be related to the latitude of the study sites most of the sites in our dataset are located in the subtropical and temperate zones while the global water body dataset in cheng and basu s paper represent a wider range of latitudes specifically our findings corroborate that large water bodies have lower nutrient removal rate constants as they have a smaller sediment area to volume ratio similar to the k hrt relationship k also showed a significant inverse correlation with the surface area and depth of the water bodies fig s1 p 0 01 albeit the relationships were weaker than the k hrt relationship unsurprisingly the three hydrological parameters hrt surface area and water depth are strongly correlated with one another p 0 01 whereby larger and deeper water bodies have longer hrt the relationships between these physical parameters suggest that water body size and depth can be used to estimate hrt which is useful in cases where hrt cannot be directly obtained next we explored whether temperature can be used as an additional factor to explain some of the scatter in the k hrt relationship temperature varies widely across china ranging from the tropical zone to the cool temperate zone fig 5a and thus it is important to understand how this variation impacts the nutrient removal rate constants to explore this relationship we divided k into three groups according to temperature t we used cut off values for temperatures of 15 and 20 such that group 1 is t 15 group 2 is 15 t 20 and group 3 is t 20 fig 5 our results showed a significant difference between the three groups for tn p 0 05 while for tp only group 3 t 20 was significantly different from the other two groups fig 5b these results indicated that temperature impacts both n and p retention processes but n removal is more sensitive to temperature compared to p finally we explored the correlation between kt where kt is the residual of k and kh and kh is given by the power function relationship as shown in fig 4 and tc we found a significant positive correlation between tc and kt p 0 01 for tn and p 0 05 for tp and an exponential function can be used to describe the tc kt relationship p 0 01 as denitrification is the main pathway for n removal these exponential results are consistent with the relationship between denitrification rate and temperature established by previous studies donner et al 2002 kovacic et al 2000 3 3 hydrobio k model parameters calibration we tested several regression model formulations to describe k as a function of hrt surface area water depth and mean temperature in the case of the single factor hydrologic model no 1 3 in table 1 the hrt produced the best overall results all hydrobio k models no 4 6 in table 1 show a marginal improvement over the single factor hydrologic model with the same hydrologic parameter the addition of the temperature parameter to the hydrologic model improves model performance for both n and p though the improvement is more significant for n this finding supports the hypothesis that the retention of n in water bodies is more dependent on biological processes as compared to p for which retention is more strongly mediated by physical processes these results demonstrate the importance of considering temperature for nutrient retention especially for n among all the models inclusion of tc and hrt yielded the best model performance model no 5 model in table 1 although the improvement in r2 is modest compared to the model no 2 model in table 1 before introducing tc the aic and bic indicate the improvement is not negligible even considering the increase in variables furthermore the minor contribution of temperature to the hydrobio k model is meaningful when extrapolating across a region with widely different climatic zones such as china based on the no 5 model in table the sensitivity analysis results showed that parameter a in eq 3 was the most sensitive consistent with our previous results suggesting that hydrological processes are the main process controlling nutrient removal table s2 the hydrobio k model offers a quick and concise means of assessing water bodies with readily available input data previous attempts to model nutrient retention including the global news mayorga et al 2010 and image beusen et al 2016 2015 models employ default parameters to estimate retention whereas the hydrobio k model is parameterized with data directly from our study region of china furthermore the database we constructed here is not limited to this one use but can be readily applied to other water body nutrient retention models including global news and image another strength of our model is that is provides an annual k value for individual water bodies however one limitation is that it cannot accurately reflect seasonal or short term variations in k for instance during periods of increased precipitation and flow rates hrt and removal rate constants can fluctuate rapidly and the hydrobio k model has difficulty capturing these changes 3 4 variation in removal rate constant between water bodies the best performing model no 5 in table 1 was applied across all water bodies in china to assess the variability in the removal rates constant of tn and tp the removal rate constants k varied substantially across more than 250 000 water bodies in china with a mean rate constant of 2 3 10 2 1 7 10 2 d 1 mean sd for tn and 3 3 10 2 2 1 10 2 d 1 for tp respectively fig s3 the distribution of rate constants is driven both by water body size and the substantial temperature gradient across the country to explore this variability further we estimated the mean nutrient removal rate at the scale of ten first order river basins in china fig 6a mean removal rate constants k across all water bodies in these ten basins ranged from 1 1 10 2 to 2 6 10 2 d 1 for tn and from 1 9 10 2 to 3 6 10 2 d 1 for tp the medium value of k and its range at the first class river basin scale was shown in table s3 this spatial heterogeneity can be attributed to differences in temperature as china s first order basins span a broad temperature range the songhua river basin has the lowest annual average temperature 2 2 and the corresponding lowest value for the rate constant 1 1 10 2 d 1 for tn and 1 9 10 2 d 1 for tp while the pearl river basin with the highest annual average temperature of 20 5 has a much greater rate constant 2 6 10 2 and 3 6 10 2 d 1 for tn and tp respectively indeed we found a linear relationship between the mean k value at the river basin scale and the mean annual temperature across the basin for both tn fig 6b and tp fig 6c we found that for every degree increase in temperature the k value increased by 7 8 10 4 for tn and 8 1 10 4 for tp while the linearity observed in the k t relationship is not unexpected given the incorporation of t in the hydrobio k model what was interesting is that the yangtze river basin deviated from the overall statistical trend fig 6b c though the yangtze river basin is not the region with the highest temperature it has the highest k value we argue that this occurs because the basin average k value is an effective property that depends on both the temperature and the distribution of water body sizes across the basin compared to other basins the yangtze river basin has a higher proportion of small water bodies and because small water bodies have larger k the size effect plays a greater role here compared to the temperature effect the proportion of small water bodies surface area 104 m2 in the yangtze river basin exceeds 30 compared to a range of 8 to 20 for all other basins fig 6d e this result emphasizes the importance of small water bodies in nutrient retention however under the influence of human activities small water bodies in many parts of the world are under significant threat from drainage and conversion to other land uses curado et al 2011 van meter and basu 2015 the hydrobio k model based assessment of water bodies highlights the importance of protecting and restoring small water bodies 3 5 cumulative nutrient retention potential at the watershed scale spatially explicit calculations of nutrient retention potential at the scale of the individual water bodies fig 7a can be used to assess n and p retention at the third order river basin scale rwshd fig 7b c china s water bodies are most densely distributed in northeastern china the tibetan plateau and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin fig 7a where the percent water body area range from 4 to 7 in contrast regions like northwestern china such as xinjiang province and southwest basin have a much lower density of water bodies among all ten first order river basins southwest basin has the lowest percent water body area comprising only 1 of the watershed regions with the highest percent water body area also correspond to greater nutrient retention potential the songhua river basin has the highest percent nutrient retention with 14 6 mean sd and 24 10 for tn and tp respectively fig 7d e in contrast although the yangtze river basin has the highest k value the percent nutrient retention was only 7 4 for tn and 10 5 for tp due to the low overall percent water body area however the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin have much higher percent nutrient retention 13 7 for tn and 17 9 tp than the basin as a whole because the percent water body area is much greater in these sub basins the nuance of the spatial distribution of water bodies is critical as anthropogenic nutrient inputs also vary regionally and can be quite high in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin shen et al 2023 yan et al 2022 for another major river basin in china yellow river basin the percent nutrient retention was 5 2 for tn and 8 4 for tp respectively the percent nutrient retention in the yellow river basin is relatively lower compared to the yangtze river basin which can be attributed to the low percent water body area it is also important to note that percent retention at the watershed scale is lower than percent retention at the water body scale and this accounts for portions of the catchments that do not drain into lentic water bodies 4 conclusion inland water bodies are important sinks of nutrients and other contaminants in the landscape however there currently is a lack of understanding on the magnitudes of nutrient retention across water body size and climatic gradients here we build a dataset on nutrient retention in lentic systems with a specific focus on china a region that has been underrepresented in most global studies this is particularly important in the context of increasing fertilizer inputs and degrading water quality across farmlands and rivers in china we compiled data from studies published in chinese language journals increasing the number of studies from china previously available for inclusion in global meta analyses from fewer than 15 cheng and basu 2017 land et al 2016 to more than 436 studies we found median retention of 46 and 51 for n and p respectively across the water bodies in our national synthesis with wetlands more efficiently retaining nutrients than either lakes or reservoirs we used this dataset to develop a new model the hydrobio k model that explicitly considers the effect of both residence time and temperature on nutrient retention in water bodies the hydrobio k model provides quick estimates of n and p removal efficiency for both single water bodies and watershed scales the model was used to estimate spatial patterns in nutrient retention across china for both first and third order river basins the removal rate constant k varied substantially at the water body scale across china with a mean rate constant of 2 3 10 2 1 7 10 2 d 1 mean sd for tn and 3 3 10 2 2 1 10 2 d 1 for tp respectively variation in k can be attributed primarily to differences in temperature that varied from 2 2 in the songhua river basin to 20 5 in the pearl river basin interestingly in the yangtze river basin we found the prevalence of small water bodies outweighs the effect of colder temperatures resulting in higher overall nutrient retention than basins with similar climates at the watershed scale the percent nutrient removal potential is driven primarily by the percent area coverage of water bodies for example cold regions like the songhua river basin have high nutrient removal potential due to the high percent water body area despite having a lower removal rate constant our results highlight the role of water body density water body size and temperature on nutrient removal potentials across water bodies in china while most global syntheses of nutrient retention rates are biased towards north america and europe our work brings a large dataset of nutrient retention in china to english speaking audiences this dataset can be used in future global syntheses of nutrient cycling and retention in lentic systems analysis of this dataset demonstrates the importance of water body size as a control on first order nutrient removal rate constants and like similar studies underscores the role of small water bodies in nutrient retention cheng and basu 2017 unlike previous works our model also demonstrates how regional temperature differences influence nutrient retention in water bodies finding higher removal rate constants in warmer regions application of the hydrobio k model across china reveals patterns of nutrient removal potential where regions with a higher density of small water bodies retain more nutrients than others our results help understand broad spatial patterns of nutrient retention at the national scale in china that can help managers to better understand the role of water bodies in the landscape and to develop environmental management strategies this understanding is critical as water bodies in china and globally are undergoing rapid reconfiguration due to climate change and human activities agriculture and urbanization our upscaled watershed scale retention percentages results highlight dual control of the size distribution of water bodies and regional temperature gradients a national scale assessment of the nutrient retention potential of water bodies in the context of their changing distribution on the landscape will help improve strategies for water body protection and

14771,hydrophobic interaction is a prevalent sorption mechanism of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas in natural and engineered environments in this study we combined quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d atomic force microscope afm with force mapping and molecular dynamics md simulation to probe the molecular behavior of pfas at the hydrophobic interface on a ch3 terminated self assembled monolayer sam perfluorononanoic acid pfna showed 2 fold higher adsorption than perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos that has the same fluorocarbon tail length but a different head group kinetic modeling using the linearized avrami model suggests that the pfna pfos surface interaction mechanisms can evolve over time this is confirmed by afm force distance measurements which shows that while the adsorbed pfna pfos molecules mostly lay flat a portion of them formed aggregates hierarchical structures of 1 10 nm in size after lateral diffusion on surface pfos showed a higher affinity to aggregate than pfna association with air nanobubbles is observed for pfos but not pfna md simulations further showed that pfna has a greater tendency than pfos to have its tail inserted into the hydrophobic sam which can enhance adsorption but limit lateral diffusion consistent with the relative behavior of pfna pfos in qcm and afm experiments this integrative qcm afm md study reveals that the interfacial behavior of pfas molecules can be heterogeneous even on a relatively homogeneous surface graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas sorption hydrophobic surfaces self

perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a group of synthetic organic compounds widely used as surfactants in consumer products and firefighting buck et al 2011 moody and field 2000 these compounds can persist in the environment evich et al 2022 and bioaccumulate in the food chain conder et al 2008 they have been found in surface water and groundwater at levels above human and ecological health thresholds cdc 2019 sunderland et al 2019 the strong c f bonds in pfass bond dissociation energy of 485 kj mol 1 o hagan 2008 contribute to their resistance to degradation in both natural and engineered systems mahinroosta and senevirathna 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 sorption plays an important role in determining the natural fate of pfas lyu et al 2022 as well as for developing sorption based pfas removal processes for water treatment such as activated carbon sorption mccleaf et al 2017 and ion exchange boyer et al 2021 however the amphiphilic and oleophobic characteristics of pfass render it difficult to accurately predict their sorption based on surface and solution conditions deng et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 for example when attempting to correlate pfas sorption with the bulk properties of soil sediment such as organic fraction protein content anion or cation exchange capacity and mineral type the co variation of these properties in the sorbent has been shown to lead to confounding results ebrahimi et al 2021 gagliano et al 2020 li et al 2019 2018 soil sediment organic content a classic parameter to predict the sorption of legacy organic contaminants was found to positively correlate with pfas sorption in some studies guelfo and higgins 2013 higgins and luthy 2006 jeon et al 2011 li et al 2019 milinovic et al 2015 qian et al 2017 wei et al 2017 you et al 2010 but not in others barzen hanson et al 2017 lee and mabury 2017 li et al 2018 pan and you 2010 for most engineered sorbents hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions drive pfas sorption gagliano et al 2020 but other interaction mechanisms such as van der waals forces hydrogen bonding and ligand exchange can also contribute especially if hydrophobic electrostatic interactions are weak and or specific sorbent functional groups are present du et al 2014 li et al 2021 some studies also postulated the formation of hierarchical structures of pfas on various sorbent surfaces johnson et al 2007 yu et al 2009 but direct evidence of such structures is largely absent the complexity of pfas surface interaction warrants the use of advanced characterization and computational tools to reveal molecular scale behaviors for example fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was employed to characterize the surface complexation gao and chorover 2012 zhao et al 2014 ligand exchange gao and chorover 2012 and hydrophobic interactions wei et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos with various clay minerals quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d is a surface sensitive mass balance that quantifies the accumulated mass at the surface with a sensitivity of 10 ng cm2 qcm d has been employed to study the adsorption and conformational changes of proteins on polymers nagasawa et al 2015 siow et al 2019 foulants scalants on membrane functional groups huang et al 2020 wu et al 2014 and surfactants on various surfaces kou and xu 2016 nalam et al 2019 to date only one study has applied qcm d to investigate pfas surface interaction which showed that pfas was incorporated into model phospholipid bilayers following a passive partitioning pathway and gradually fluidized the bilayer fitzgerald et al 2018 molecular dynamics md simulations have been used to investigate the interaction of pfas with clay minerals loganathan and wilson 2022 wang et al 2021 willemsen and bourg 2021 yan et al 2020 2021 polymers choudhary et al 2022 kancharla et al 2022 and graphene materials jiang et al 2021 a few studies combined md simulation with batch sorption experiments wang et al 2021 yan et al 2020 2021 in these studies the md simulations for pfas sorption on clays corroborated the mechanisms suggested by the experimental results and assisted in identifying the pfas binding sites hydrophobic interaction is a universal mechanism contributing to the sorption of different pfas on a wide range of sorbents therefore in this study we employed an integrated approach utilizing qcm d atomic force microscope afm and md simulations to elucidate the hydrophobic interaction between pfas and surface at the molecular scale two model pfass were employed perfluorononanoic acid pfna and pfos featuring identical lengths of the fluorinated alkyl chain but different head groups i e carboxylate vs sulfonate the model hydrophobic surface is a highly ordered methyl group terminated self assembled monolayer ch3 terminated sam qcm d adsorption measurements of pfas were first conducted to determine the pfna pfos sorption isotherms and kinetics the pfas adsorbed qcm sensors were then analyzed by afm imaging and force spectroscopy which identified the state of the adsorbed pfna pfos molecules on the sam lastly fully atomistic md simulations were performed to provide insight into the origins of the pfna pfos molecular behavior at the interface in our study we observed higher adsorption of pfna than pfos but the formation of aggregated structures at the hydrophobic surfaces is more predominant for pfos than for pfna this study is among the first to provide a comprehensive mechanistic view of pfas molecules at the hydrophobic interface 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and solution preparation details on the materials as well as the protocols for preparing solutions and ch3 terminated sam are provided in supplementary information si 1 in this study ch3 terminated sam was selected as a model hydrophobic surface compared with other hydrophobic sam e g c6h5 n sam ch3 terminated sams have fewer gauche defects vericat et al 2005 and thus minimize any confounding effects on the adsorption of pfas 2 2 qcm d experiments pfna pfos adsorption experiments were conducted using qcm d e4 model q sense biolin scientific on ch3 terminated sam coated sensors at 25 c with a flow rate of 25 µl min 1 the changes in frequency f and dissipation d were recorded across multiple overtones of the sensor s fundamental frequency 5 mhz two types of adsorption experiments were conducted stepwise experiments where the surface was exposed sequentially to a series of pfna or pfos solutions 50 100 200 350 and 500 mg l were used to determine adsorption isotherm single concentration experiments where the sensor was exposed to a single pfna pfos solution were used to prepare samples for kinetic modeling and afm analyses details are shown in si 2 the highest pfna and pfos concentration used in the experiments 500 mg l was below their respective critical micelle concentrations 1299 and 1500 mg l respectively kunieda and shinoda 1976 reth et al 2011 the pfas solution concentration range was selected to 1 observe measurable mass sorption on the ch3 terminated sam using qcm and 2 mimic the ppm level pfas concentrations often found near contaminated source sites brusseau et al 2020 vu and wu 2022 the adsorbed masses from the single concentration experiments were comparable with those from the stepwise experiments further discussed below the adsorbed pfna pfos masses were estimated by sauerbrey s equation and the kelvin voigt model si 2 origin pro 2022 was used in isotherm and kinetic model fitting 2 3 adsorption isotherm models the following isotherm models were evaluated it should be noted that pfna pfos adsorption did not achieve equilibrium in qcm experiments even after prolonged exposure further discussed below however this is typical for surfactant adsorption at the interface below cmc zeng et al 2020 and isotherm modeling can still provide mechanistic insight into the molecular behavior at the interface a the zhu and gu adsorption isotherm this model initially developed to understand the sorption of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds on polystyrene latex zhu and gu 1991 involves a two step process first the surfactant molecules are adsorbed individually by interacting with the solid surface second enhanced mass accumulation occurs as aggregates micellar or hemimicellar form at the interface resulting via interactions with either the free or adsorbed species the general form of the model is 1 m c m m a x k 1 c 1 n g k 2 c n g 1 1 k 1 c 1 k 2 c n g 1 where m c ng c m 2 is the amount of adsorbate on the surface at equilibrium when the surfactant concentration is c mg l m m a x ng c m 2 is the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity k 1 l mg and k 2 l mg n g 1 are the equilibrium constants of the reaction between the surface and the surfactant molecules first step and that between the adsorbed surfactants from the first step and incoming surfactant molecules second step and n g is the aggregation number in this study two limiting cases of eq 1 are considered i when k 2 0 and n g 1 eq 1 reduces to the langmuir isotherm equation langmuir 1918 which describes the

henceforth called zhu and gu aggregate type isotherm has been used in the literature to describe the sorption and subsequent aggregation of surfactants sds on moringa oleifera seed extract beltran heredia and sanchez martin 2009 pentaethylene glycol monodecyl ether on silica thibaut et al 2000 and marolophen np5 on ultrafiltration membranes nguyen et al 2015 a freundlich isotherm this model

of m for pfna pfos adsorption were fit to the avrami kinetic model avrami 1939 1940 1941 originally developed to model the kinetics of phase change during crystallization this sigmoidal model has later been used to describe the sorption of heavy metals lopes et al 2003 zheng et al 2021 dyes cestari et al 2005 royer et al 2009 vargas et al 2011 and organic micropollutants djilani et al 2012 5 m

order and t min the time the linearized form of this equation is presented as 6 ln ln 1 α n a v ln t ln k a v where α is the left hand side of eq 6 this form of the avrami kinetic model enables the identification of different rates of physicochemical processes occurring during the sorption process cestari et al 2004 vieira et al 2007 2 5 afm imaging and force mapping afm imaging and force mapping bioinfinity oxford instrument usa were employed to characterize the bare gold qcm sensors ch3 terminated sam and pfna pfos adsorbed surfaces afm measurements were performed within 72 h after qcm experiments the samples were equilibrated in di water for at least 30 min prior to data acquisition to minimize thermal drift topographical images of the ch3 terminated sam with adsorbed pfna pfos were obtained using tapping silicon cantilever kn 42 n m and or contact silicon cantilever kn 0 2 n m imaging modes the average root mean square roughness rq for the samples was obtained from measuring on at least three locations each with a scan area of 500 nm 500 nm for force mapping an afm cantilever with a sharp silicon nitride tip kn 0 02 n m and tip radius 20 30 nm was employed the stiffness of the cantilever was calibrated using the thermal noise method butt and jaschke 1995 the deflection sensitivity of the cantilever was measured by obtaining a force distance profile on freshly cleaned silicon dioxide surfaces in di water for each sample six force maps 144 force distance fd curves per map were obtained at random locations each with a scan area of 500 nm 500 nm and a trigger force of 5 nn the approach velocity of the cantilever was held at 250 nm s to minimize the effects of hydrodynamic forces on the force measurements this approach velocity was kept constant across all experiments 2 6 molecular dynamics simulations fully atomistic md simulations were performed a gold substrate of a dimension of 40 40 10 å3 with the top surface orientation as 111 was fixed as a rigid body the surface of the gold substrate was passivated with a layer of sam molecules initially 24 identical pfna pfos molecules were vertically suspended above the sam layer corresponding to a surface coverage of 1 5 molecules nm2 of the adsorbed pfna pfos masses 142 421 ng cm2 equivalent to 1 7 5 4 molecules nm2 obtained from qcm d experiments 500 mg l pfna pfos 2 h the timestep in our simulations is 0 1 femtosecond 20 million timesteps were calculated for each simulation separate simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of the initial orientation of the pfna pfos molecules tail up i e c f tail pointing away from the sam interface or tail down an equilibration is held until the molecules fully interact with the surface and the total energy of the system and the position of molecules have reached to a stabilized condition since we focus on the near surface interaction between pfna pfos and ch3 terminated sam no water molecules were considered in the simulation the simulations have periodic boundary conditions in both the x and y axis a langevin thermostat was applied to the free atoms to maintain a temperature equilibrium of 300 k the inter atomic interactions among the sam molecules and pfna pfos were described via the optimized potentials for the liquid simulations opls force field the simulations jorgensen et al 1996 jorgensen and tirado rives 1988 were performed using lammps software plimpton 1995 thompson et al 2022 the density of atoms in the z axis is calculated as the total number of atoms per bin in the z direction 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of pfna and pfos in qcm d experiments the synthesized ch3 terminated sam has similar characteristics as those reported in the literature huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 si 3 the sorption of pfna pfos on sam in qcm experiments is shown in fig 1 stepwise experiments the frequency drops indicate added pfna pfos mass on the ch3 terminated sam nalam et al 2019 as solution concentration increased the frequency drop became greater there was negligible change in dissipation at low pfna pfos concentrations but dissipation increased when pfna pfos concentrations increased above 100 mg l a preliminary experiment using pfna suggests that the adsorption process did not achieve equilibrium even after exposure up to 20 h fig s2 however a rapid frequency drop occurred within the first 30 min after the pfas solution was introduced to the surface followed by a significantly slower mass change with time therefore a 2 h interval was employed in all stepwise experiments as the adsorption period at each solution concentration to capture the initial interactions between pfna pfos and the ch3 terminated sam at the same solution concentration the frequency drop was greater in pfna experiments than in pfos experiments suggesting higher pfna adsorption at the hydrophobic surface assuming either insignificant or comparable trapped solvent by both pfas for example f at the end of the 2 h adsorption was 4 1 2 hz three replicates and 2 2 2 hz for 50 mg l pfna and pfos respectively after solvent rinse the magnitude of f decreased by 2 10 hz fig s3 indicating that a fraction of the adsorbed pfna pfos molecules were weakly associated with the surface and were rinsed away the adsorbed masses for pfna and pfos were calculated using sauerbrey s equation 100 mg l and kelvin voigt s model 200 500 mg l respectively because when pfna pfos solution concentrations exceeded 100 mg l f values varied with overtone and d exceeded 1 10 6 indicating a viscoelastic nature of the adsorbed layers the accumulated adsorbed mass before rinse at each solution concentration is shown in table s1 more pfna mass molecules are adsorbed than pfos for example after 2 h exposure to 200 mg l solution the adsorbed pfna mass 226 19 ng cm2 486 41 pmol cm2 is greater than that of pfos 127 30 ng cm2 254 60 pmol cm2 a comparison of the adsorbed pfna pfos mass between stepwise and single concentration experiments at the same adsorption time 2 h did not show a significant difference fig s4 suggesting that the adsorption history did not substantially impact the adsorption behavior nalam et al 2019 correspondingly the adsorbed masses from the stepwise experiments were used for isotherm modeling three isotherm models were evaluated the freundlich model showed the most inferior fit while the langmuir eq 2 and zhu and gu aggregate type eq 3 isotherms were comparable fig 2 and table 1 however true langmuir adsorption is unlikely for pfna pfos at the interface given the absence of an equilibrated mass even after 20 h fig s2b and based on the afm characterization results below on the other hand the ng values in the zhu and gu aggregate type model were greater than 1 for both pfna and pfos indicating a possible association among the adsorbed molecules on the surface fig 3 a shows the initial adsorption kinetics of pfna and pfos at 50 mg l and 500 mg l on ch3 terminated sam all exhibiting an s shaped profile the pseudo first or second order kinetic models previously used in pfas batch sorption studies askeland et al 2020 wei et al 2017 did not fit our data because the first 20 min adsorption accounted for 90 of the total mass adsorbed fig s5 the corresponding data were used for fitting to the linearized avrami kinetic model fig 3b for all four fittings two distinct segments were observed suggesting that there were different dominant interaction mechanisms as the adsorption progresses over time cestari et al 2004 vieira et al 2007 the kinetic fitting parameters for the two segments are presented in table 2 for the first segment the nav1 values for pfna and pfos are similar and exhibit similar concentration dependence this allows kav1 values between pfna and pfos to be compared given the similar units min nav the similar nav1 and kav1 values suggest that pfna and pfos behaved similarly at this initial adsorption stage the pfna pfos molecules mostly likely interacted with the sam surface directly the transition into the second segment occurred at 11 min ln t 2 4 the difference in nav2 values between pfna and pfos suggests that their adsorption mechanisms started to diverge possibly involving different degrees of lateral diffusion and aggregation after the surface became more crowded with the adsorbed pfas as suggested by afm and md analyses below in summary the qcm experiments show that pfna shows higher adsorption capacity on ch3 terminated sam than pfos the adsorption isotherm and kinetic modeling suggest that there is likely a range of pfna and pfos behaviors at the interface 3 2 afm characterization of surface adsorbed pfna and pfos fig 4 shows that after pfna pfos adsorption the underlying sam features were retained but a few globular structures of 15 35 nm in width were also observed the section profiles show that these structures are 5 8 nm in height considering that these structures have dimensions more than double the length of pfna pfos molecules 1 14 nm torres et al 2009 wang et al 2015 they should be aggregates or hierarchical structures of pfna pfos molecules the globular structures were predominantly found near the grain boundaries indicating that surface roughness as low as 1 26 0 10 nm can possibly assist the initiation of pfas molecule aggregation although visually distinct on the afm images the globular structures do not account for the majority of the adsorbed pfna pfos mass based on this estimate using the molar volume of pfna 264 7 cm3 mol and assuming the globular features in fig 4b are spherical pfna micelles with an average diameter of 10 nm and the highest possible packing density i e the same density as a pure pfna phase the 9 micelles on the 0 25 µm2 surface captured by the image contributes to only 3 3 ng cm2 pfna less than 1 of the total pfna mass adsorbed 494 ng cm2 in other words most pfna pfos molecules adsorbed as thin molecular layer s not resolved via afm images possibly lying parallel on the surface due to dominating hydrophobic interactions afm force mapping was conducted to further characterize the structural organization of pfna pfos on ch3 terminated sam surfaces first pull off forces from the retract fd curves were determined from three force maps collected at random locations on the sample fig 5 the pull off forces for the pfna and pfos adsorbed surfaces 0 75 0 34 and 1 0 0 20 nn respectively are 3 4 times higher than that for ch3 terminated sam 0 23 0 03 nn the higher adhesion forces can be attributed to the greater hydrophobic interaction of the silica tip with the cf3 groups in pfna pfos than that with the ch3 terminal groups on the sam surface additionally the pfna pfos adsorbed sams showed a greater spread in the pull off forces than the fresh sam surface suggesting different orientations densities and or structures of pfna pfos molecules at the hydrophobic interface second the approach fd curves from six force maps were examined for pfna pfos adsorbed surfaces a portion of these approach curves showed one or more discontinuities force steps i e a drop in the force as the separation distance between the approaching tip and the surface is decreased the characteristic features of force steps are as defined in fig 6 a a force step arises when the afm tip initially compresses a stiff hierarchical structure or an aggregate adsorbed at the interface during approach and upon reaching a contact force higher than the stiffness of the structure ruptures the structure and squeezes out of the confinement between the tip and substrate because the interface in our measurements is a compressible sam layer instead of a hard silica substrate the zero separation between the structure aggregate and the sam interface is set at the base of the slope closest to the infinite wall the gray portion in fig 6a is dominated by the compression of the sam layer a higher percentage of the approach curves for the pfos adsorbed surface 39 displayed force steps in comparison with those for the pfna adsorbed surface 6 indicating that pfos molecules are more likely to form aggregates structures despite fewer adsorbed molecules a consistent trend was observed in triplicate samples the characteristics of the force steps indicate the type and nature of the aggregate structure for example fd curves with two consecutive force steps may represent an ordered structure with two layers usually observed for micelles or bilayers the distribution of step size slope and distance from the interface for all fd curves with force steps is shown as histograms in fig 6b d fig 6e and 6f explore the relationship between the stiffness the distance from the sam interface and the size of the aggregates structures there is no correlation between the stiffness and the distance of the pfna pfos aggregates structures from the sam interface but most aggregate structures are 1 5 nm in size the majority of the pfna aggregates structures were soft slope 0 2 n m formed at the vicinity of the sam interface x1 0 and their fd curves presented only one force step in comparison most pfos aggregates structures were also soft but a much higher number of their fd curves displayed multiple force steps with some features considerably far away from the sam interface fd curves with 1 3 force steps within 10 nm from the interface likely correspond to hierarchically layered or micellar structures of pfos molecules but those with force steps more than 10 nm away are unlikely to originate from multi layered densely packed structures further inspection of these fd curves showed that they exhibit a distinct plateau in force between the force steps example shown in the inset of fig 6d a unique feature previously reported for the fd curves resulting from the presence of air bubbles on graphite wang et al 2017 this plateau corresponds to a process where the afm tip presses onto the air bubble walczyk and schonherr 2014 wang et al 2017 indeed careful topographic and phase imaging soft tapping of pfos adsorbed surfaces showed spherical structures with dimensions larger than 20 nm indicating the formation of stabilized air bubbles at the hydrophobic interface si 10 pfass are known to partition at the air water interface liu et al 2022 lyu et al 2018 meng et al 2014 notably air bubble assisted sorption was found to contribute to more than 70 of pfos sorption on carbon nanotubes and graphene meng et al 2014 given the absence of nanobubbles on pfna adsorbed sam surfaces the nanobubbles on the pfos adsorbed surfaces likely originated from the solution where pfos molecules stabilized the trapped air collectively the afm imaging and force mapping revealed the state of the pfna pfos molecules adsorbed on the ch3 terminated sam while a small fraction of molecules formed large aggregates others lay flat or formed small aggregates or hierarchical structures this indicates a non negligible heterogeneity in the pfna pfos adsorption behavior despite the relatively homogeneous hydrophobic surface 3 3 molecular dynamics simulations md simulations were employed to further elucidate the molecular interactions of pfas at the hydrophobic sam interface the ch3 terminated sam constructed on the gold substrate 40 40 å2 was brought in contact with 24 molecules of either pfna or pfos to match the range of the surface coverage of the adsorbed molecules obtained from the qcm adsorption experiments two initial orientations of the pfna pfos molecules were evaluated i e all the molecules were brought towards the surface with either tail up fluorocarbon chain away from sam surface or tail down configurations all simulations reached equilibrium by the end of the simulation as shown by the total energy fig s8 and radial distribution function at different times fig s9 the system achieved equilibrium faster when pfna pfos molecules were initially in the tail down orientation as expected from the greater affinity of the fluorocarbon chain than the polar head group towards the hydrophobic sam fig 7 a d show the top view molecular snapshots and the corresponding 2d xy plane density maps of pfna and pfos molecules adsorbed on the ch3 terminated sam with tail down initial orientation the top view snapshots show that pfos molecules on the surface are more likely to have their head groups pointing away from the surface and avoiding the hydrophobic sam interface fig 7b while the pfna molecules largely lay flat fig 7a maximizing the interactions between the fluorocarbon chain and the sam interface moreover the 2d density profile of pfna molecules fig 7c displayed a greater uniformity in atomic density than pfos fig 7d suggesting that pfna molecules resulted in a more homogenous coverage while pfos molecules tend to form aggregates consistent with the results from the afm force measurements the greater degree of aggregation of pfos than pfna at the sam interface was also observed when the initial pfna pfos orientation was tail up si video v1 tail up the 1d density profiles fig 7f for adsorbed pfna or pfos showed that the maximum density peak position for pfos was farther away than that for pfna from the sam interface the preferential interactions of pfos molecules with each other rather than with sam suggests the higher probability for pfos molecules to form aggregated structures in comparison pfna s preferential interaction with the ch3 terminated sam can explain the greater pfna adsorption consistent with qcm results the simulation also revealed an additional interaction between pfna pfos molecules and the ch3 termianted sam as shown in the side view snapshots fig 7e some fluorocarbon chains of the pfna and pfos molecules insert into the sam layer the z direction density profiles of atoms fig 7f showed there exists a more significant overlap in the density profiles between pfna and sam than between pfos and sam indicating more pfna molecules inserted into sam the insertion behavior of pfna molecules into sam may impact their lateral diffusion and reduce the tendency to form aggregated structures at the interface 3 4 comparing molecular scale and macro scale pfas sorption studies our study used a model hydrophobic surface ch3 terminated sam to isolate the hydrophobic interaction as a pfas sorption mechanism the molecular level characterization of pfas adsorption in this study revealed some different phenomena compared with those obtained from batch experiments for example in contrast to the greater pfna adsorption in our experiments pfos is adsorbed more than pfna in soil log k d of pfos 1 5 1 8 times greater nguyen et al 2020 pereira et al 2018 attributable to a combination of different mechanisms other than hydrophobic interaction e g electrostatic interactions cai et al 2022 the s shaped avrami adsorption kinetics observed in our experiments is distinct from previous studies which used the biexponential model indicative of two or more types of sorption sites e g pfos sorption on natural soil li et al 2019 sediment higgins and luthy 2006 chitosan zhang et al 2011 and sewage sludge zhang et al 2013 or used the pseudo second order model reflective of pfas sorbent chemical interaction e g pfos sorption on soils askeland et al 2020 wei et al 2017 montmorillonite clay zhou et al 2010 and activated carbon and anion exchange resin deng et al 2015 yu et al 2009 by directly measuring adsorbed mass using qcm with high temporal resolution and nanogram level sensitivity we were able to capture the s shaped avrami kinetics revealing the evolution of adsorption mechanisms over time although langmuir and zhu and gu aggregate type models fit the adsorption data comparably the afm and md analyses clearly showed the presence of hierarchical structure and or aggregates of pfna pfos molecules on sam surface and the possible insertion of their fluorocarbon tail into the hydrophobic layer both violating the langmuir isotherm assumption of homogeneous adsorption the diverse pfas molecular behavior at the interface despite the homogeneity of sam suggests that systematic evaluation is needed to establish the fate of these molecules 4 conclusion this study integrated qcm d afm imaging and force spectroscopy and md simulations to probe the fundamental mechanisms of pfas sorption at the hydrophobic interface on ch3 terminated sam a relatively homogeneous model hydrophobic surface a range of pfas molecular behavior was observed adsorbed pfna pfos molecules generally lie flat or form small aggregate hierarchical structures on the surface while a small fraction of them forms large aggregates or in the case of pfos associate with nanosized air bubbles at the interface a comparison of pfna and pfos revealed the impacts of the head group polarity pfna with the carboxylate head group is adsorbed more than pfos with the sulfonate head group however a greater percentage of adsorbed pfos molecules forms aggregates hierarchical structures both pfna and pfos showed multistage adsorption kinetics consistent with a sorption process involving an initial interaction between sam and the pfna pfos molecules and the subsequent lateral diffusion of adsorbed pfna pfos molecules to form aggregates pfna and to a lesser extent pfos can insert into the ch3 terminated sam layer which is consistent with the greater tendency of pfna to be adsorbed and its more uniform distribution at the interface considering that hydrophobic interaction is a universal sorption mechanism for a wide range of pfas and surfaces our results contribute to the understanding of pfas sorption by natural and engineered sorbents e g through interaction with the organic fraction of soil sediment and the polymer backbone of resins especially regarding to the molecular behavior near sorption sites where pfas molecules are enriched declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following

14771,hydrophobic interaction is a prevalent sorption mechanism of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas in natural and engineered environments in this study we combined quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d atomic force microscope afm with force mapping and molecular dynamics md simulation to probe the molecular behavior of pfas at the hydrophobic interface on a ch3 terminated self assembled monolayer sam perfluorononanoic acid pfna showed 2 fold higher adsorption than perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos that has the same fluorocarbon tail length but a different head group kinetic modeling using the linearized avrami model suggests that the pfna pfos surface interaction mechanisms can evolve over time this is confirmed by afm force distance measurements which shows that while the adsorbed pfna pfos molecules mostly lay flat a portion of them formed aggregates hierarchical structures of 1 10 nm in size after lateral diffusion on surface pfos showed a higher affinity to aggregate than pfna association with air nanobubbles is observed for pfos but not pfna md simulations further showed that pfna has a greater tendency than pfos to have its tail inserted into the hydrophobic sam which can enhance adsorption but limit lateral diffusion consistent with the relative behavior of pfna pfos in qcm and afm experiments this integrative qcm afm md study reveals that the interfacial behavior of pfas molecules can be heterogeneous even on a relatively homogeneous surface graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas sorption hydrophobic surfaces self

perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a group of synthetic organic compounds widely used as surfactants in consumer products and firefighting buck et al 2011 moody and field 2000 these compounds can persist in the environment evich et al 2022 and bioaccumulate in the food chain conder et al 2008 they have been found in surface water and groundwater at levels above human and ecological health thresholds cdc 2019 sunderland et al 2019 the strong c f bonds in pfass bond dissociation energy of 485 kj mol 1 o hagan 2008 contribute to their resistance to degradation in both natural and engineered systems mahinroosta and senevirathna 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 sorption plays an important role in determining the natural fate of pfas lyu et al 2022 as well as for developing sorption based pfas removal processes for water treatment such as activated carbon sorption mccleaf et al 2017 and ion exchange boyer et al 2021 however the amphiphilic and oleophobic characteristics of pfass render it difficult to accurately predict their sorption based on surface and solution conditions deng et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 for example when attempting to correlate pfas sorption with the bulk properties of soil sediment such as organic fraction protein content anion or cation exchange capacity and mineral type the co variation of these properties in the sorbent has been shown to lead to confounding results ebrahimi et al 2021 gagliano et al 2020 li et al 2019 2018 soil sediment organic content a classic parameter to predict the sorption of legacy organic contaminants was found to positively correlate with pfas sorption in some studies guelfo and higgins 2013 higgins and luthy 2006 jeon et al 2011 li et al 2019 milinovic et al 2015 qian et al 2017 wei et al 2017 you et al 2010 but not in others barzen hanson et al 2017 lee and mabury 2017 li et al 2018 pan and you 2010 for most engineered sorbents hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions drive pfas sorption gagliano et al 2020 but other interaction mechanisms such as van der waals forces hydrogen bonding and ligand exchange can also contribute especially if hydrophobic electrostatic interactions are weak and or specific sorbent functional groups are present du et al 2014 li et al 2021 some studies also postulated the formation of hierarchical structures of pfas on various sorbent surfaces johnson et al 2007 yu et al 2009 but direct evidence of such structures is largely absent the complexity of pfas surface interaction warrants the use of advanced characterization and computational tools to reveal molecular scale behaviors for example fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was employed to characterize the surface complexation gao and chorover 2012 zhao et al 2014 ligand exchange gao and chorover 2012 and hydrophobic interactions wei et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos with various clay minerals quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d is a surface sensitive mass balance that quantifies the accumulated mass at the surface with a sensitivity of 10 ng cm2 qcm d has been employed to study the adsorption and conformational changes of proteins on polymers nagasawa et al 2015 siow et al 2019 foulants scalants on membrane functional groups huang et al 2020 wu et al 2014 and surfactants on various surfaces kou and xu 2016 nalam et al 2019 to date only one study has applied qcm d to investigate pfas surface interaction which showed that pfas was incorporated into model phospholipid bilayers following a passive partitioning pathway and gradually fluidized the bilayer fitzgerald et al 2018 molecular dynamics md simulations have been used to investigate the interaction of pfas with clay minerals loganathan and wilson 2022 wang et al 2021 willemsen and bourg 2021 yan et al 2020 2021 polymers choudhary et al 2022 kancharla et al 2022 and graphene materials jiang et al 2021 a few studies combined md simulation with batch sorption experiments wang et al 2021 yan et al 2020 2021 in these studies the md simulations for pfas sorption on clays corroborated the mechanisms suggested by the experimental results and assisted in identifying the pfas binding sites hydrophobic interaction is a universal mechanism contributing to the sorption of different pfas on a wide range of sorbents therefore in this study we employed an integrated approach utilizing qcm d atomic force microscope afm and md simulations to elucidate the hydrophobic interaction between pfas and surface at the molecular scale two model pfass were employed perfluorononanoic acid pfna and pfos featuring identical lengths of the fluorinated alkyl chain but different head groups i e carboxylate vs sulfonate the model hydrophobic surface is a highly ordered methyl group terminated self assembled monolayer ch3 terminated sam qcm d adsorption measurements of pfas were first conducted to determine the pfna pfos sorption isotherms and kinetics the pfas adsorbed qcm sensors were then analyzed by afm imaging and force spectroscopy which identified the state of the adsorbed pfna pfos molecules on the sam lastly fully atomistic md simulations were performed to provide insight into the origins of the pfna pfos molecular behavior at the interface in our study we observed higher adsorption of pfna than pfos but the formation of aggregated structures at the hydrophobic surfaces is more predominant for pfos than for pfna this study is among the first to provide a comprehensive mechanistic view of pfas molecules at the hydrophobic interface 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and solution preparation details on the materials as well as the protocols for preparing solutions and ch3 terminated sam are provided in supplementary

are shown in si 2 the highest pfna and pfos concentration used in the experiments 500 mg l was below their respective critical micelle concentrations 1299 and 1500 mg l respectively kunieda and shinoda 1976 reth et al 2011 the pfas solution concentration range was selected to 1 observe measurable mass sorption on the ch3 terminated sam using qcm and 2 mimic the ppm level pfas concentrations often found near contaminated source sites brusseau et al 2020 vu and wu 2022 the adsorbed masses from the single concentration experiments were comparable with those from the stepwise experiments further discussed below the adsorbed pfna pfos masses were estimated by sauerbrey s equation and the kelvin voigt model si 2 origin pro 2022 was used in isotherm and kinetic model fitting 2 3 adsorption isotherm models the following isotherm models were evaluated it should be noted that pfna pfos adsorption did not achieve equilibrium in qcm experiments even after prolonged exposure further discussed below however this is typical for surfactant adsorption at the interface below cmc zeng et al 2020 and isotherm modeling can still provide mechanistic insight into the molecular behavior at the interface a the zhu and gu adsorption isotherm this model initially developed to understand the sorption of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds on polystyrene latex zhu and gu 1991 involves a two step process first the surfactant molecules are adsorbed individually by interacting with the solid surface second enhanced mass accumulation occurs as aggregates micellar or hemimicellar form at the interface resulting via interactions with either the free or adsorbed species the general form of the model is 1 m c m m a x k 1 c 1 n g k 2 c n g 1 1 k 1 c 1 k 2 c n g 1 where m c ng c m 2 is the amount of adsorbate on the surface at equilibrium when the surfactant concentration is c mg l m m a x ng c m 2 is the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity k 1 l mg and k 2 l mg n g 1 are the equilibrium constants of the reaction between the surface and the surfactant molecules first step and that between the adsorbed surfactants from the first step and incoming surfactant molecules second step and n g is the aggregation number in this study two limiting cases of eq 1 are considered i when k 2 0 and n g 1 eq 1 reduces to the langmuir isotherm equation langmuir 1918 which describes the monolayer surface coverage of the adsorbate on a homogeneous adsorbent and assumes no interactions among the molecules in the solution or after adsorption on the surface 2 m c m m a x l k l c 1 k l c

henceforth called zhu and gu aggregate type isotherm has been used in the literature to describe the sorption and subsequent aggregation of surfactants sds on moringa oleifera seed extract beltran heredia and sanchez martin 2009 pentaethylene glycol monodecyl ether on silica thibaut et al 2000 and marolophen np5 on ultrafiltration membranes nguyen et al 2015 a freundlich isotherm this model

distribution constant and 1 n f dimensionless is the degree of heterogeneity in this equation 1 n f 1 represents cooperative sorbate sorbate interactions 2 4 adsorption kinetic model the time profiles of m for pfna pfos adsorption were fit to the avrami kinetic model avrami 1939 1940 1941 originally developed to model the kinetics of phase change during crystallization this sigmoidal model has later been used to describe the sorption of heavy metals lopes et al 2003 zheng et al 2021 dyes cestari et al 2005 royer et al 2009 vargas et al 2011 and organic micropollutants djilani et al 2012 5 m

order and t min the time the linearized form of this equation is presented as 6 ln ln 1 α n a v ln t ln k a v where α is the left hand side of eq 6 this form of the avrami kinetic model enables the identification of different rates of physicochemical processes occurring during the sorption process cestari et al 2004 vieira et al 2007 2 5 afm imaging and force mapping afm imaging and force mapping bioinfinity oxford instrument usa were employed to characterize the bare gold qcm sensors ch3 terminated sam and pfna pfos adsorbed surfaces afm measurements were performed within 72 h after qcm experiments the samples were equilibrated in di water for at least 30 min prior to data acquisition to minimize thermal drift topographical images of the ch3 terminated sam with adsorbed pfna pfos were obtained using tapping silicon cantilever kn 42 n m and or contact silicon cantilever kn 0 2 n m imaging modes the average root mean square roughness rq for the samples was obtained from measuring on at least three locations each with a scan area of 500 nm 500 nm for force mapping an afm cantilever with a sharp silicon nitride tip kn 0 02 n m and tip radius 20 30 nm was employed the stiffness of the cantilever was calibrated using the thermal noise method butt and jaschke 1995 the deflection sensitivity of the cantilever was measured by obtaining a force distance profile on freshly cleaned silicon dioxide surfaces in di water for each sample six force maps 144 force distance fd curves per map were obtained at random locations each with a scan area of 500 nm 500 nm and a trigger force of 5 nn the approach velocity of the cantilever was held at 250 nm s to minimize the effects of hydrodynamic forces on the force measurements this approach velocity was kept constant across all experiments 2 6 molecular dynamics simulations fully atomistic md simulations were performed a gold substrate of a dimension of 40 40 10 å3 with the top surface orientation as 111 was fixed as a rigid body the surface of the gold substrate was passivated with a layer of sam molecules initially 24 identical pfna pfos molecules were vertically suspended above the sam layer corresponding to a surface coverage of 1 5 molecules nm2 of the adsorbed pfna pfos masses 142 421 ng cm2 equivalent to 1 7 5 4 molecules nm2 obtained from qcm d experiments 500 mg l pfna pfos 2 h the timestep in our simulations is 0 1 femtosecond 20 million timesteps were calculated for each simulation separate simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of the initial orientation of the pfna pfos molecules tail up i e c f tail pointing away from the sam interface or tail down an equilibration is held until the molecules fully interact with the surface and the total energy of the system and the position of molecules have reached to a stabilized condition since we focus on the near surface interaction between pfna pfos and ch3 terminated sam no water molecules were considered in the simulation the simulations have periodic boundary conditions in both the x and y axis a langevin thermostat was applied to the free atoms to maintain a temperature equilibrium of 300 k the inter atomic interactions among the sam molecules and pfna pfos were described via the optimized potentials for the liquid simulations opls force field the simulations jorgensen et al 1996 jorgensen and tirado rives 1988 were performed using lammps software plimpton 1995 thompson et al 2022 the density of atoms in the z axis is calculated as the total number of atoms per bin in the z direction 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of pfna and pfos in qcm d experiments the synthesized ch3 terminated sam has similar characteristics as those reported in the literature huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 si 3 the sorption of pfna pfos on sam in qcm experiments is shown in fig 1 stepwise experiments the frequency drops indicate added pfna pfos mass on the ch3 terminated sam nalam et al 2019 as solution concentration increased the frequency drop became greater there was negligible change in dissipation at low pfna pfos concentrations but dissipation increased when pfna pfos concentrations increased above 100 mg l a preliminary experiment using pfna suggests that the adsorption process did not achieve equilibrium even after exposure up to 20 h fig s2 however a rapid frequency drop occurred within the first 30 min after the pfas solution was introduced to the surface followed by a significantly slower mass change with time therefore a 2 h interval was employed in all stepwise experiments as the adsorption period at each solution concentration to capture the initial interactions between pfna pfos and the ch3 terminated sam at the same solution concentration the frequency drop was greater in pfna experiments than in pfos experiments suggesting higher pfna adsorption at the hydrophobic surface assuming either insignificant or comparable trapped solvent by both pfas for example f at the end of the 2 h adsorption was 4 1 2 hz three replicates and 2 2 2 hz for 50 mg l pfna and pfos respectively after solvent rinse the magnitude of f decreased by 2 10 hz fig s3 indicating that a fraction of the adsorbed pfna pfos molecules were weakly associated with the surface and were rinsed away the adsorbed masses for pfna and pfos were calculated using sauerbrey s equation 100 mg l and kelvin voigt s model 200 500 mg l respectively because when pfna pfos solution concentrations exceeded 100 mg l f values varied with overtone and d exceeded 1 10 6 indicating a viscoelastic nature of the adsorbed layers the accumulated adsorbed mass before rinse at each solution concentration is shown in table s1 more pfna mass molecules are adsorbed than pfos for example after 2 h exposure to 200 mg l solution the adsorbed pfna mass 226 19 ng cm2 486 41 pmol cm2 is greater than that of pfos 127 30 ng cm2 254 60 pmol cm2 a comparison of the adsorbed pfna pfos mass between stepwise and single concentration experiments at the same adsorption time 2 h did not show a significant difference fig s4 suggesting that the adsorption history did not substantially impact the adsorption behavior nalam et al 2019 correspondingly the adsorbed masses from the stepwise experiments were used for isotherm modeling three isotherm models were evaluated the freundlich model showed the most inferior fit while the langmuir eq 2 and zhu and gu aggregate type eq 3 isotherms were comparable fig 2 and table 1 however true langmuir adsorption is unlikely for pfna pfos at the interface given the absence of an equilibrated mass even after 20 h fig s2b and based on the afm characterization results below on the other hand the ng values in the zhu and gu aggregate type model were greater than 1 for both pfna and pfos indicating a possible association among the adsorbed molecules on the surface fig 3 a shows the initial adsorption kinetics of pfna and pfos at 50 mg l and 500 mg l on ch3 terminated sam all exhibiting an s shaped profile the pseudo first or second order kinetic models previously used in pfas batch sorption studies askeland et al 2020 wei et al 2017 did not fit our data because the first 20 min adsorption accounted for 90 of the total mass adsorbed fig s5 the corresponding data were used for fitting to the linearized avrami kinetic model fig 3b for all four fittings two distinct segments were observed suggesting that there were different dominant interaction mechanisms as the adsorption progresses over time cestari et al 2004 vieira et al 2007 the kinetic fitting parameters for the two segments are presented in table 2 for the first segment the nav1 values for pfna and pfos are similar and exhibit similar concentration dependence this allows kav1 values between pfna and pfos to be compared given the similar units min nav the similar nav1 and kav1 values suggest that pfna and pfos behaved similarly at this initial adsorption stage the pfna pfos molecules mostly likely interacted with the sam surface directly the transition into the second segment occurred at 11 min ln t 2 4 the difference in nav2 values between pfna and pfos suggests that their adsorption mechanisms started to diverge possibly involving different degrees of lateral diffusion and aggregation after the surface became more crowded with the adsorbed pfas as suggested by afm and md analyses below in summary the qcm experiments show that pfna shows higher adsorption capacity on ch3 terminated sam than pfos the adsorption isotherm and kinetic modeling suggest that there is likely a range of pfna and pfos behaviors at the interface 3 2 afm characterization of surface adsorbed pfna and pfos fig 4 shows that after pfna pfos adsorption the underlying sam features were retained but a few globular structures of 15 35 nm in width were also observed the section profiles show that these structures are 5 8 nm in height considering that these structures have dimensions more than double the length of pfna pfos molecules 1 14 nm torres et al 2009 wang et al 2015 they should be aggregates or hierarchical structures of pfna pfos molecules the globular structures were predominantly found near the grain boundaries indicating that surface roughness as low as 1 26 0 10 nm can possibly assist the initiation of pfas molecule aggregation although visually distinct on the afm images the globular structures do not account for the majority of the adsorbed pfna pfos mass based on this estimate using the molar volume of pfna 264 7 cm3 mol and assuming the globular features in fig 4b are spherical pfna micelles with an average diameter of 10 nm and the highest possible packing density i e the same density as a pure pfna phase the 9 micelles on the 0 25 µm2 surface captured by the image contributes to only 3 3 ng cm2 pfna less than 1 of the total pfna mass adsorbed 494 ng cm2 in other words most pfna pfos molecules adsorbed as thin molecular layer s not resolved via afm images possibly lying parallel on the surface due to dominating hydrophobic interactions afm force mapping was conducted to further characterize the structural organization of pfna pfos on ch3 terminated sam surfaces first pull off forces from the retract fd curves were determined from three force maps collected at random locations on the sample fig 5 the pull off forces for the pfna and pfos adsorbed surfaces 0 75 0 34 and 1 0 0 20 nn respectively are 3 4 times higher than that for ch3 terminated sam 0 23 0 03 nn the higher adhesion forces can be attributed to the greater hydrophobic interaction of the silica tip with the cf3 groups in pfna pfos than that with the ch3 terminal groups on the sam surface additionally the pfna pfos adsorbed sams showed a greater spread in the pull off forces than the fresh sam surface suggesting different orientations densities and or structures of pfna pfos molecules at the hydrophobic interface second the approach fd curves from six force maps were examined for pfna pfos adsorbed surfaces a portion of these approach curves showed one or more discontinuities force steps i e a drop in the force as the separation distance between the approaching tip and the surface is decreased the characteristic features of force steps are as defined in fig 6 a a force step arises when the afm tip initially compresses a stiff hierarchical structure or an aggregate adsorbed at the interface during approach and upon reaching a contact force higher than the stiffness of the structure ruptures the structure and squeezes out of the confinement between the tip and substrate because the interface in our measurements is a compressible sam layer instead of a hard silica substrate the zero separation between the structure aggregate and the sam interface is set at the base of the slope closest to the infinite wall the gray portion in fig 6a is dominated by the compression of the sam layer a higher percentage of the approach curves for the pfos adsorbed surface 39 displayed force steps in comparison with those for the pfna adsorbed surface 6 indicating that pfos molecules are more likely to form aggregates structures despite fewer adsorbed molecules a consistent trend was observed in triplicate samples the characteristics of the force steps indicate the type and nature of the aggregate structure for example fd curves with two consecutive force steps may represent an ordered structure with two layers usually observed for micelles or bilayers the distribution of step size slope and distance from the interface for all fd curves with force steps is shown as histograms in fig 6b d fig 6e and 6f explore the relationship between the stiffness the distance from the sam interface and the size of the aggregates structures there is no correlation between the stiffness and the distance of the pfna pfos aggregates structures from the sam interface but most aggregate structures are 1 5 nm in size the majority of the pfna aggregates structures were soft slope 0 2 n m formed at the vicinity of the sam interface x1 0 and their fd curves presented only one force step in comparison most pfos aggregates structures were also soft but a much higher number of their fd curves displayed multiple force steps with some features considerably far away from the sam interface fd curves with 1 3 force steps within 10 nm from the interface likely correspond to hierarchically layered or micellar structures of pfos molecules but those with force steps more than 10 nm away are unlikely to originate from multi layered densely packed structures further inspection of these fd curves showed that they exhibit a distinct plateau in force between the force steps example shown in the inset of fig 6d a unique feature previously reported for the fd curves resulting from the presence of air bubbles on graphite wang et al 2017 this plateau corresponds to a process where the afm tip presses onto the air bubble walczyk and schonherr 2014 wang et al 2017 indeed careful topographic and phase imaging soft tapping of pfos adsorbed surfaces showed spherical structures with dimensions larger than 20 nm indicating the formation of stabilized air bubbles at the hydrophobic interface si 10 pfass are known to partition at the air water interface liu et al 2022 lyu et al 2018 meng et al 2014 notably air bubble assisted sorption was found to contribute to more than 70 of pfos sorption on carbon nanotubes and graphene meng et al 2014 given the absence of nanobubbles on pfna adsorbed sam surfaces the nanobubbles on the pfos adsorbed surfaces likely originated from the solution where pfos molecules stabilized the trapped air collectively the afm imaging and force mapping revealed the state of the pfna pfos molecules adsorbed on the ch3 terminated sam while a small fraction of molecules formed large aggregates others lay flat or formed small aggregates or hierarchical structures this indicates a non negligible heterogeneity in the pfna pfos adsorption behavior despite the relatively homogeneous hydrophobic surface 3 3 molecular dynamics simulations md simulations were employed to further elucidate the molecular interactions of pfas at the hydrophobic sam interface the ch3 terminated sam constructed on the gold substrate 40 40 å2 was brought in contact with 24 molecules of either pfna or pfos to match the range of the surface coverage of the adsorbed molecules obtained from the qcm adsorption experiments two initial orientations of the pfna pfos molecules were evaluated i e all the molecules were brought towards the surface with either tail up fluorocarbon chain away from sam surface or tail down configurations all simulations reached equilibrium by the end of the simulation as shown by the total energy fig s8 and radial distribution function at different times fig s9 the system achieved equilibrium faster when pfna pfos molecules were initially in the tail down orientation as expected from the greater affinity of the fluorocarbon chain than the polar head group towards the hydrophobic sam fig 7 a d show the top view molecular snapshots and the corresponding 2d xy plane density maps of pfna and pfos molecules adsorbed on the ch3 terminated sam with tail down initial orientation the top view snapshots show that pfos molecules on the surface are more likely to have their head groups pointing away from the surface and avoiding the hydrophobic sam interface fig 7b while the pfna molecules largely lay flat fig 7a maximizing the interactions between the fluorocarbon chain and the sam interface moreover the 2d density profile of pfna molecules fig 7c displayed a greater uniformity in atomic density than pfos fig 7d suggesting that pfna molecules resulted in a more homogenous coverage while pfos molecules tend to form aggregates consistent with the results from the afm force measurements the greater degree of aggregation of pfos than pfna at the sam interface was also observed when the initial pfna pfos orientation was tail up si video v1 tail up the 1d density profiles fig 7f for adsorbed pfna or pfos showed that the maximum density peak position for pfos was farther away than that for pfna from the sam interface the preferential interactions of pfos molecules with each other rather than with sam suggests the higher probability for pfos molecules to form aggregated structures in comparison pfna s preferential interaction with the ch3 terminated sam can explain the greater pfna adsorption consistent with qcm results the simulation also revealed an additional interaction between pfna pfos molecules and the ch3 termianted sam as shown in the side view snapshots fig 7e some fluorocarbon chains of the pfna and pfos molecules insert into the sam layer the z direction density profiles of atoms fig 7f showed there exists a more significant overlap in the density profiles between pfna and sam than between pfos and sam indicating more pfna molecules inserted into sam the insertion behavior of pfna molecules into sam may impact their lateral diffusion and reduce the tendency to form aggregated structures at the interface 3 4 comparing molecular scale and macro scale pfas sorption studies our study used a model hydrophobic surface ch3 terminated sam to isolate the hydrophobic interaction as a pfas sorption mechanism the molecular level characterization of pfas adsorption in this study revealed some different phenomena compared with those obtained from batch experiments for example in contrast to the greater pfna adsorption in our experiments pfos is adsorbed more than pfna in soil log k d of pfos 1 5 1 8 times greater nguyen et al 2020 pereira et al 2018 attributable to a combination of different mechanisms other than hydrophobic interaction e g electrostatic interactions cai et al 2022 the s shaped avrami adsorption kinetics observed in our experiments is distinct from previous studies which used the biexponential model indicative of two or more types of sorption sites e g pfos sorption on natural soil li et al 2019 sediment higgins and luthy 2006 chitosan zhang et al 2011 and sewage sludge zhang et al 2013 or used the pseudo second order model reflective of pfas sorbent chemical interaction e g pfos sorption on soils askeland et al 2020 wei et al 2017 montmorillonite clay zhou et al 2010 and activated carbon and anion exchange resin deng et al 2015 yu et al 2009 by directly measuring adsorbed mass using qcm with high temporal resolution and nanogram level sensitivity we were able to capture the s shaped avrami kinetics revealing the evolution of adsorption mechanisms over time although langmuir and zhu and gu aggregate type models fit the adsorption data comparably the afm and md analyses clearly showed the presence of hierarchical structure and or aggregates of pfna pfos molecules on sam surface and the possible insertion of their fluorocarbon tail into the hydrophobic layer both violating the langmuir isotherm assumption of homogeneous adsorption the diverse pfas molecular behavior at the interface despite the homogeneity of sam suggests that systematic evaluation is needed to establish the fate of these molecules 4 conclusion this study integrated qcm d afm imaging and force spectroscopy and md simulations to probe the fundamental mechanisms of pfas sorption at the hydrophobic interface on ch3 terminated sam a relatively homogeneous model hydrophobic surface a range of pfas molecular behavior was observed adsorbed pfna pfos molecules generally lie flat or form small aggregate hierarchical structures on the surface while a small fraction of them forms large aggregates or in the case of pfos associate with nanosized air bubbles at the interface a comparison of pfna and pfos revealed the impacts of the head group polarity pfna with the carboxylate head group is adsorbed more than pfos with the sulfonate head group however a greater percentage of adsorbed pfos molecules forms aggregates hierarchical structures both pfna and pfos showed multistage adsorption kinetics consistent with a sorption process involving an initial interaction between sam and the pfna pfos molecules and the subsequent lateral diffusion of adsorbed pfna pfos molecules to form aggregates pfna and to a lesser extent pfos can insert into the ch3 terminated sam layer which is consistent with the greater tendency of pfna to be adsorbed and its more uniform distribution at the interface considering that hydrophobic interaction is a universal sorption mechanism for a wide range of pfas and surfaces our results contribute to the understanding of pfas sorption by natural and engineered sorbents e g through interaction with the organic fraction of soil sediment and the polymer backbone of resins especially regarding to the molecular behavior near sorption sites where pfas molecules are enriched declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following

14772,removing harmful antibiotics is essential to reclaiming water from municipal secondary effluent electroactive membranes are effective in the removal of antibiotics but challenged by the abundant coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants in municipal secondary effluent to eliminate the interference of macromolecular organic pollutants in the removal of antibiotics we propose a novel

control membrane with the electroactive layer on the top that showed decreased tc removal after the addition of ha e g decreased by 13 2 at 1 v the decreased tc removal of the control membrane was

pani electroactive layer and a bottom pan layer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water stress has motivated researchers and engineers worldwide to reclaim water from municipal secondary effluent one of the recent prominent concerns relevant to secondary effluent reclamation is the removal of harmful antibiotics ineffectively degraded during the secondary biological treatment process pressure driven membrane separation is extensively utilized to reuse secondary effluent in wastewater treatment plants however microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf cannot retain antibiotics because of their large membrane pore size nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro can retain antibiotics but require a high operation pressure to yield a low permeate flux electroactive membranes have been recently developed to address the challenge of removing antibiotics from wastewater fan et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 electroactive membranes are electrically conductive and electrochemically reactive and they can remove antibiotics through electrochemical degradation during filtration highly effective removal of antibiotics can be realized with electroactive membranes with a pore size at the level of mf and uf breaking the trade off between permeability and rejection of traditional membranes almassi et al 2019 mo et al 2022 electroactive membranes can be fabricated by modifying traditional insulated polymeric membranes carbonaceous materials metals and conducting polymers are often integrated to endow polymeric membranes with electrical conductivity li et al 2021 liu et al 2021a 2021b thamaraiselvan et al 2021 yu et al 2019 the electrocatalytic reactivity of membranes can be enhanced by incorporating metal oxide or nanoscale metallic catalysts li et al 2020 2022b liu et al 2020 zheng et al 2021a 2021b surface coating is preferable to blending when these components are integrated because a consecutive electroactive layer can be easily formed on the polymeric membrane examples of electroactive membranes include a carbon cloth supported polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane removing sulfamethoxazole by 81 5 at 4 v li et al 2022a a fe2o3 in carbon nanotube cnt decorated polytetrafluoroethylene membrane degrading tetracycline tc by 97 5 at 2 5 v guo et al 2021a and a cnt polypyrrole coated pvdf membrane removing carbamazepine by 90 at 2 3 ma cm2 xu et al 2022 a challenging issue in the removal of antibiotics from secondary effluent by electroactive membranes is the coexistence of diverse organic pollutants among which humic acid ha protein and polysaccharide have received considerable attention guo et al 2021b jin et al 2016 shon et al 2006 sun et al 2016 they are macromolecular organic pollutants whose molecular weights mws usually 1 kda or 0 5 kda according to different studies are larger than that of antibiotics 0 5 kda guo et al 2021b jarusutthirak and amy 2007 shon et al 2006 these macromolecular organic pollutants exist at a much higher concentration than antibiotics do in secondary effluent their interference with the removal of antibiotics cannot be neglected and has elicited much attention the presence of ha has been reported to reduce the removal efficiency of electroactive membranes toward antibiotics although the removal efficiency is high in a feed with antibiotics as the sole organic pollutant e g from 90 to 20 for florfenicol in the presence of 50 mg l of ha guo et al 2021a jiang et al 2018 impeded antibiotic degradation on electroactive membranes has also been observed in the context of realistic water such as lake water where humic substances are predominant liu et al 2020 2015 competition for reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals and covering of reactive sites i e membrane fouling on electroactive membranes are the two ways through which coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants interfere with antibiotic removal liu et al 2015 yang et al 2020 however solutions to diminish the adverse impact of coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants on antibiotic removal are still lacking advancing the design of electroactive membranes is a promising strategy to overcome this shortcoming and match membranes with the complex circumstances of real water matrices existing electroactive membranes often locate electrocatalysts on the top surface or distribute them across the whole membrane skeleton consequently coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants are brought into contact with electrocatalysts and participate in competitive oxidation with antibiotics on electroactive membranes avoiding any contact between coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants and electrocatalysts is the key to reducing their influence on antibiotic removal a two layer membrane structure with a top polymeric uf layer and a bottom electroactive layer is a potential strategy to achieve this goal the top polymeric uf layer aims to retain most coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants and allow the penetration of antibiotics by taking advantage of their size difference therefore the bottom electroactive layer can degrade antibiotics with little interference from macromolecular organic pollutants such a two layer structure with an mf uf layer on the top and an electroactive layer at the bottom has been adopted in a few studies li et al 2022a zheng et al 2017 however these studies have not focused on the advantage of this structural design in eliminating the detrimental impact of coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants on antibiotic removal this study fabricated the top uf separation layer with polyacrylonitrile pan a common polymer for uf membranes and the bottom electroactive layer with carboxylate cnts and polyaniline pani conducting polymer with excellent electrical conductivity pan cnt pani membrane for short karmakar et al 2018 mo et al 2022 the fabrication and characterization of the pan cnt pani membrane were first investigated ha was selected as the delegate for macromolecular organic pollutants because it is smaller than protein and polysaccharide in size and more difficult to reject tc was used as the delegate for antibiotics which is frequently detected in secondary effluent wang et al 2020 the advantage of the pan cnt pani membrane in the removal of antibiotics was demonstrated by using a cnt pani pan membrane as a control with a reversed membrane structure the electroactive layer was located on the top surface of the pan layer the interfering mechanisms of ha and the removal manner of the pan cnt pani membrane were elucidated to explain the membrane s advantage in antibiotic removal finally practical implications were established for the pan cnt pani membrane through investigations on its durability and removal performance in the context of real municipal secondary effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents pan molecular weight of 150 000 da n n

formation of the cnt pani electroactive layer at the bottom the surface with large pores of the hydrolyzed pan substrate the cnt suspension was centrifuged to remove coarse particles and diluted by thirty folds with deionized water the diluted cnt suspension 90 ml was vacuum filtered through the hydrolyzed pan substrate 7 cm in diameter of which the bottom surface faced the suspension to form the cnt layer the cnt modified pan substrate pan cnt membrane for short was then immersed in the ani solution 0 2 m ani in 2 m hcl and taken out after 20 min to vertically drain the ani solution until no liquid drops fell off an aps solution of 2 ml 0 1 m aps in 2 m hcl was carefully added drop by drop to the bottom surface of the pan substrate the contact of aps with the residual ani initiated the in situ polymerization of ani to form pani with a green color at the bottom of the pan substrate baker et al 2017 ćirić marjanović 2013 zhang et al 2019 the aps solution was drained after 2 min and the membrane was sealed in a culture dish for 6 h where the reaction between the residue of aps and ani continued finally the membrane was immersed in ga solution for 30 min at 45 c to enhance the cross linking and the pan cnt pani membrane was obtained for comparison a cnt pani electroactive layer was also prepared on the top surface the surface with small pores of the hydrolyzed pan substrate the membrane with such a structure design was denoted as the cnt pani pan membrane the fabrication procedures for the cnt pani pan membrane resembled those for the pan cnt pani membrane except that the cnt layer was formed on the top surface of the pan substrate 2 3 performance evaluation of electroactive membranes in the electro filtration system the filtration performance of the electroactive membranes was assessed using a bench scale circular electro filtration system fig 2 the filtration directions of the pan cnt pani and cnt pani pan membranes are shown in fig 1 the membrane coupon was loaded into a circular membrane cell effective filtration area of 12 56 cm2 with a built in ti ring as the current collector for the membrane the position of the ti ring in the membrane cell varied with the tested membrane to ensure its contact with the electroactive layer i e in contact with the bottom of the pan cnt pani membrane and with the top of the cnt pani pan membrane the membrane cell also had a circular ti plate acting as the counter electrode above the membrane with a distance of 1 cm the membrane was connected to dc power during filtration and served as the anode a pump introduced the feed solution placed in the thermostatic bath at 25 c into the membrane cell and the filtration pressure was controlled by the valve an electronic mass balance was used to measure the permeate mass and determine the membrane flux each filtration run was begun by compacting the membrane under 0 2 mpa for 30 min by using deionized water followed by assessing its filtration performance under 0 1 mpa the removal performance was evaluated using two different feed solutions under varied applied voltages 0 to 1 5 v the tc feed contained 0 8 mg l of tc and the tc ha feed contained 0 8 mg l of tc and 20 mg l of ha in deionized water 20 mg l of ha simulated the presence of macromolecular organic pollutants in the real secondary effluent a fixed concentration ratio among the macromolecular organic pollutants ha protein and polysaccharide has not been reported so ha was selected as the delegate because of its smallest mw the concentration of 20 mg l was selected according to the concentration range of the total organic carbon toc in the real secondary effluent the tc concentration was higher than that in the real secondary effluent to ensure a precise measurement and exclude the impact of the adsorption of pipes and pump on the tc feed concentration a reasonably high concentration of antibiotics at the level of 1 mg l has also been used in previous studies li et al 2022a xu et al 2022 zheng et al 2017 both feed solutions also contained 1 mm of nahco3 to mimic the ph of the secondary effluent and 10 mm of na2so4 to provide conductivity filtration was conducted for 180 min in most cases and samples were collected at intervals to determine the tc and ha concentrations and membrane flux the tc removal performance of pan cnt pani and cnt pani pan membranes in the absence and presence of ha was compared to demonstrate the advantage of the former the filtration period was extended to 9 h to examine the performance stability of the pan cnt pani membrane the feed solution was prepared by spiking 0 8 mg l of tc into the municipal secondary effluent obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant and filtered under 1 5 v to provide practical implications for the pan cnt pani membrane membrane fouling experiments were performed using the feed with ha but not tc that was filtered for 3 h under 0 v to examine the impact of ha fouling on tc removal the analysis of the ha fouled membranes is presented in sections 2 4 and 2 5 2 4 electrochemical degradation performance of electroactive membranes in the electrolysis cell to focus on the electrochemical degradation of tc and ha the electroactive membrane was tested in an electrolysis cell working volume of 300 ml where the membrane served as the anode but not a filter and a ti plate acted as the counter electrode the electroactive membrane was orientated toward the counter electrode in the same way as that in the electro filtration system the concentrations of tc ha and electrolytes in the feed solution were identical to those used in the electro filtration system the concentration variation of tc in the absence of ha was monitored for the pan cnt pani membrane under alternated voltages 2 5 v for the first 100 min and 0 v for the following 100 min to differentiate the contributions of electrochemical degradation and electro adsorption to tc removal ha degradation was investigated using the cnt pani pan membrane under 2 5 v in the feed solution without tc additionally the clean and ha fouled cnt pani pan membranes were tested for tc removal under 2 5 v to demonstrate the attachment of ha onto the membrane during tc removal the voltage 2 5 v used in the electrolysis cell was higher than that used for the electro filtration system 0 1 5 v because the mass transfer of pollutants was limited in the electrolysis cell so the voltage needed to be increased to facilitate electrochemical reactions however the applied voltage should not be too high to oxidize the cnts the voltage of 2 5 v was the maximum one used in our preliminary experiments and at this voltage the tc degradation performance of membranes was stable 2 5 analytical methods the pan

1 ml min through the c18 column at a temperature of 35 c samples were pretreated using a 0 45 µm filter and injected with a volume of 20 µl the retention time of tc was approximately 3 343 min and an ultraviolet uv detector was used to detect tc at a wavelength of 356 nm the calibration curve was established linear regression coefficient of 0 998 using standard solutions with the tc concentration ranging within 0 05 5 mg l ha was measured by a uv spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 254 nm the presence of ta did not affect the measurement of ha because of its low concentration and low absorbance at 254 nm fig s1 toc in the municipal secondary effluent was measured with a toc analyzer shimadzu japan the cnts in the suspension for membrane fabrication and the membrane permeate collected during 9 h of filtration described in section 2 3 were quantified by uv absorption at a wavelength of 295 nm on the basis of the calibration curve linear regression coefficient of 0 999 with the concentration ranging from 0 0005wt to 0 003wt 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the pan cnt pani membrane the fabricated pan membrane presented a typical asymmetric structure with a dense skin layer and a loose bottom layer the bottom membrane surface was used for the coating of the electroactive layer the pores at the bottom surface were completely covered by intertwined nanofibers of cnts figs 3 a1 and 3a2 after filtering the cnt suspension the cnts were buried to some degree and the rough surface became smooth when the polymerization of ani into pani was completed fig 3a3 the xps spectra figs 3b and s2a show the disappearance of n after cnt coating and the re appearance of n after pani formation the deconvoluted c1s spectra revealed the characteristic peaks of

pan cnt pani membrane than in the pan cnt membrane figs 3b2 and 3b3 hence chemical reactions were assumed to occur among cnts pani and ga ga reacted with pani thereby forming the tertiary amine n c 3 and increasing the percentage of sp3 c zhang et al 2019 the carboxyl groups in the cnts might have reacted with the amine group in pani to form the amide group moreover the carboxyl groups might have reacted with ga to form the ester bond co c dudchenko et al 2014 although the change in the peak intensity was difficult to distinguish because the peak position of c o overlapped with that of c n in pani abdulla et al 2015 therefore the cnt pani electroactive layer was fully cross linked notably the pan membrane was hydrolyzed and carried carboxyl groups so cross linking between the substrate and the electroactive layer also occurred via the reactions of the carboxyl groups the stability of the pan cnt pani membrane with a firmly attached bottom electroactive layer was confirmed by sonication after which the membrane structure was maintained fig s3 the reactions between ga and pani and between the carboxyl and amine groups were proposed to be the main pathways to achieving stability of the pan cnt pani membrane because the pan cnt membrane cross linked with ga showed poor stability during sonication fig s3 the pan cnt pani membrane exhibited a conductivity of 190 s m which is comparable to the conductivity of electrically conductive membranes in literature mo et al 2022 the conductivity of the pan cnt pani membrane was higher than that of the pan cnt membrane suggesting that the cnts and pani played a critical role in rendering the insulated pan membrane electrically conductive fig 3c as reported zhang et al 2019 the role of the cnts and pani in facilitating the redox reactions was further verified based on the cv curves after cnt coating the redox peaks for fe cn 6 3 2 appeared and the peak current density intensified after the formation of pani via the polymerization of ani on the cnt layer fig 3d the characterization in fig 3 implied that the fabricated pan cnt pani membrane exhibited good electrochemical properties electrical conductivity and structural stability 3 2 removal performance of the pan cnt pani membrane and its advantage in tc degradation in the presence of ha the removal performance of the pan cnt pani membrane filtering the feed with tc and ha was investigated under 1 5 v as the anode and 0 v the pan cnt pani membrane was categorized as uf membranes with a pure water flux of approximately 235 9 lmh bar the removal efficiency of ha whose molecular size was 4 nm xiao 2011 was maintained at approximately 96 during 3 h of filtration regardless of the voltage fig 4 a meanwhile the pan membrane showed a nearly complete ha removal 96 during filtration at 0 v fig 4b but could not degrade ha as demonstrated in the electrolysis cell fig s4 therefore the high ha removal of the pan cnt pani membrane was attributed to the physical sieving by the pores of the pan layer by contrast tc with a small molecular size 1 nm estimated based on the mw xiao et al 2018 was only rejected by approximately 20 by the pan membrane so the tc removal efficiency of the pan cnt pani membrane under 0 v was low however the application of 1 5 v voltage considerably improved the tc removal efficiency of the pan cnt pani membrane with a value steadily higher than 90 during 3 h of filtration the enhanced removal of tc was assumed to have resulted from oxidation after the role of electro adsorption was excluded in the electrolysis cell the tc concentration did not recover to the initial value 0 55 mg l after the voltage was switched from 2 5 v to 0 v fig s5 suggesting that electro adsorption hardly contributed to the tc removal of the pan cnt pani membrane and that oxidation played the key role in tc removal when the membrane was applied with a voltage given that the pan membrane could not oxidize tc fig s4 the oxidation of tc took place at the cnt pani electroactive layer probably in the cnts based on a previous study that reported that a cnt filter degraded tc liu et al 2015 therefore the two layer structure of the pan cnt pani membrane pan layer at the top and cnt pani electroactive layer at the bottom enabled the membrane to retain ha via the pan layer and allowed tc to be transported and reach the cnt pani electroactive layer for electrochemical degradation this sequential removal manner physical sieving of ha followed by electrochemical oxidation of tc conforms to our expectation and helps eliminate the interference of ha with tc removal which will be discussed in the next paragraph the influence of ha on the tc degradation of the pan cnt pani membrane was investigated by comparing the tc removal efficiency in the absence and presence of ha under 0 5 1 and 1 5 v fig 5 a the tc removal efficiency was averaged for 3 h of filtration because it was almost constant during filtration fig s6 an increase in the applied voltage improved the tc degradation in both cases the addition of ha to the feed hardly changed the tc removal efficiency of the pan cnt pani membrane under the three applied voltages according to the calculated difference in tc removal efficiency fig 5c without ha 43 6 4 7 67 8 2 4 and 92 2 2 1 for 0 5 1 and 1 5 v respectively with ha 45 6 7 3 69 1 5 1 and 92 2 1 1 for 0 5 1 and 1 5 v respectively however ha s influence on tc degradation was clearly observed for the cnt pani pan membrane in which the structure an electroactive layer on the top of the pan layer was opposite to that of the pan cnt pani membrane unlike on the pan cnt pani membrane the presence of ha impaired the tc degradation of the cnt pani pan membrane fig 5b specifically after ha was added into the feed the tc removal efficiency of the cnt pani pan membrane was reduced by 4 8 13 2 and 4 6 under 0 5 1 and 1 5 v respectively fig 5c when only tc was filtered the cnt pani pan membrane displayed tc removal efficiencies similar to those of the pan cnt pani membrane under 1 and 1 5 v however the pan cnt pani membrane outperformed the cnt pani pan membrane in tc removal in the presence of ha fig 5d the results in fig 5 confirm the advantage of placing the electroactive layer at the bottom in eliminating the influence of ha on tc degradation the advantage of the pan cnt pani membrane over the cnt pani pan membrane was maximized under a moderate applied voltage namely 1 v in this study although such an advantage was less obvious when the applied voltage was low or high 0 5 and 1 5 v in this study increasing the applied voltage is another strategy to reduce the interference of ha in the tc removal of electroactive membranes but at the expense of increased energy consumption 3 3 ways through which ha interfered with tc degradation on the cnt pani electroactive layer the ways through which ha affected tc degradation on the cnt pani electroactive layer were further investigated to verify the superiority of the pan cnt pani membrane the exploration was performed with the cnt pani pan membrane in which the cnt pani electroactive layer was simultaneously brought into contact with tc and ha during filtration a plausible way through which ha reduces the removal efficiency of tc is that ha competes with tc for the reactive sites on the cnt pani electroactive layer or the oxidative species generated by the electroactive layer this competition effect if present should be amplified because ha usually exists at a much higher concentration than tc does in secondary effluent in this study the oxidation of ha on the cnt pani electroactive layer was investigated in the electrolysis cell to provide evidence on the competition effect however ha concentration did not decline during electrolysis under 2 5 v fig 6 a this finding implies that competition with tc for reactive sites or oxidative species could not explain why the presence of ha decelerated the tc degradation of the cnt pani pan membrane fig 5c given that ha was not degraded on the cnt pani electroactive layer the attachment of ha onto the layer might occur because ha can easily cause membrane fouling due to its hydrophobic nature and the continuous imposition of drag force from water flow during filtration guo et al 2021b the cnt pani electroactive layer serving as the anode would accelerate the attachment of ha with negative charges therefore the flux decline of the cnt pani pan membrane during filtration under 1 v was investigated and is presented in fig 6b 1 v was chosen because at this voltage the interference of ha was the most severe as indicated in fig 5c the addition of ha to the feed aggregated the membrane fouling leading to a low flux after 5 min of filtration 134 lmh vs 182 lmh for the tc ha and tc feed respectively this phenomenon was also confirmed by the final membrane flux after 3 h of filtration 81 lmh for the tc ha feed and 118 lmh for the tc feed and a darkened yellow color observed on the membrane surface after filtering the tc ha feed it indicates that ha attached to the membrane during filtration which occurred on the cnt pani pan electroactive layer because it directly faced the feed the attachment of ha was another plausible way through which ha impaired tc degradation on the cnt pani electroactive layer the ha solution was filtered through the cnt pani pan membrane for 3 h without an applied voltage and the fouled cnt pani pan membrane was tested to confirm the inference above the area surrounded by the cv curve was considerably reduced for the fouled cnt pani pan membrane compared with the clean cnt pani pan membrane fig 6c furthermore the fouled cnt pani pan membrane degraded tc more slowly than the clean cnt pani pan membrane did as demonstrated in the electrolysis cell fig 6d the changes in the cv curve and the degradation profile of tc in the electrolysis cell suggested that the attachment of ha onto the cnt pani electroactive layer was probably the key reason for the impeded tc degradation of the cnt pani pan membrane in the presence of ha this effect was also observed when tc degradation was compared in the solutions containing tc and tc ha fig 6d in the electrolysis cell the presence of ha already induced the slow degradation of tc this probably resulted from the physical adsorption of ha onto the cnt pani electroactive layer partially covering the reactive sites for tc degradation on the basis of the analysis above the interference of ha in tc degradation was dominated by its attachment onto the cnt pani electroactive layer but not by its competition with tc for oxidation fig 7 thus the advantage of the pan cnt pani membrane relied on the ability of the membrane to avoid the attachment of ha onto the electroactive layer with the aid of the pan layer acting as a filter fig 7 this attribute maintained the electrochemical activity of the cnt pani electroactive layer as verified by the cv curves of the fouled and clean pan cnt pani membranes fig 6c and consequently guaranteed tc degradation on the basis of the sieving oxidation sequential removal manner such a membrane structural design with a top pore finely tuned uf separation layer and a bottom electroactive layer shows promise in eliminating the detrimental impacts of macromolecular organic pollutants on antibiotic removal from secondary effluent electroactive membranes with this unique two layer structure and distinct removal mechanisms are strategic candidates for tackling the complicated water matrix in realistic applications however fouling at the top surface still needs control to recover the water flux of the pan cnt pani membrane 3 4 implications for the practical application of the pan cnt pani membrane the filtration period was prolonged to 9 h to examine the performance stability of the pan cnt pani membrane under 1 v at which its advantage over the cnt pani pan membrane was evident stable removal performance of the membrane was observed with ha removal 95 and tc removal 60 fig 8 a during 9 h of filtration the slightly increased removal efficiency of tc was probably due to membrane fouling that gradually narrowed the membrane pores the absorbance of uv of the permeate was monitored with time to verify the leaching of cnts and pani from the membrane during filtration fig 8b no characteristic peaks for pani were observed fan et al 2008 and a slight characteristic peak at 295 nm for cnts was detected in the permeate collected during the first hour absorbance of 0 075 however this absorbance peak disappeared in the permeate collected during the following hours of filtration these results indicate that tiny loosely bound cnts might have leached at the beginning but most cnts stayed on the membrane due to the cross linking between the electroactive layer and pan substrate as explained in section 3 1 the leaching percentage of cnts was only 0 8 from the pan cnt pani membrane with a cnt loading mass of 3 5 g m2 calculated using the calibration curve fig s7 moreover the filtration experiment using the feed with electrolytes was performed to observe the membrane morphology change the sem images of the pan cnt pani membrane before and after filtration were similar fig s8 and leaching of cnts and pani was negligible fig s9 based on the uv vis absorbance and toc concentration in the permeate further demonstrating that the mechanical strength of the membrane was sufficient however the diminished cv curve after 9 h of filtration fig 8c indicated the loss of the electrochemical activity of the pan cnt pani membrane this result was probably due to the adsorption of the by products of tc on the electroactive layer or the oxidation of cnts or pani during long term operation duan et al 2016 eftekhari et al 2017 the loss of protons doped in pani which are necessary for conducting electrons might also be a reason for the electrochemical activity deterioration of the pan cnt pani membrane baker et al 2017 thus sustaining the reactive activity of the pan cnt pani membrane during long term operation is still a challenge although its physical structural stability is assured the pan cnt pani membrane performed well when ha was used as the model coexisting organic pollutant however ha is only a portion of organic pollutants in real secondary effluent and the used model foulant of ha has a narrow size distribution 6 to 70 kda xiao 2011 xiao et al 2018 real secondary effluent contains various organic pollutants ranging from 100 da to 100 kda specifically the large mw molecules mw 10 kda are mainly polysaccharide and protein the medium mw molecules 500 da mw 10 kda belong to ha substance and the low mw molecules include refractory organic pollutants organic acid and simple sugars jarusutthirak and amy 2007 shon et al 2006 thus in this study the merit of placing the electroactive layer at the bottom was further explored in the context of real secondary effluent fig 8d the small organic pollutants in the real secondary effluent may penetrate the top pan layer and decelerate tc degradation on the bottom cnt pani layer therefore 1 5 v which was the maximum voltage in the tests with the ha model foulant was chosen to filter the real secondary effluent and achieve high tc removal efficiency compared to the case with the synthetic tc feed fig 4a tc was removed to a smaller extent in the background of the real secondary effluent for the pan cnt pani membrane in the synthetic tc feed 92 in the real secondary effluent background 80 this result was obtained because the real secondary effluent contained small organic pollutants that could not be rejected as effectively as the large ha model foulant as evidenced by the low toc removal efficiency of approximately 20 for the real secondary effluent fig s10 consequently the cnt pani electroactive layer underwent fouling by these small organic pollutants passing through the pan layer and tc degradation was impeded however the reduction in the tc removal efficiency of the pan cnt pani membrane was less obvious than that of the cnt pani pan membrane in the synthetic tc feed 90 in the real wastewater background 55 these results demonstrate the potential merit of the pan cnt pani membrane in diminishing the adverse impacts of coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants on antibiotic degradation however the structural design of the uf layer should be reconsidered in the future to narrow down the pores and effectively reject small organic pollutants so that sequential removal by the electroactive membrane can be realized 4 conclusions a novel electroactive membrane pan cnt pani membrane with a top pan uf separation layer and a bottom cnt pani electroactive layer was fabricated and investigated for its potential to reduce the impacts of coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants on antibiotic removal from municipal secondary effluent the pan cnt pani membrane had an electrical conductivity of 190 s m and exhibited good electrochemical reactivity tc was effectively electrochemically degraded on the pan cnt pani membrane 92 at 1 5 v moreover the tc removal efficiency of the pan cnt pani membrane was marginally affected by ha compared with that of the cnt pani pan membrane with a top electroactive layer which showed reduced tc removal in the presence of ha the prevention of ha attachment onto the bottom cnt pani electroactive layer by retaining ha via the top pan layer was the main reason for the unaffected tc removal of the pan cnt pani membrane in the presence of ha the structural stability of the pan cnt pani membrane was maintained via cross linking and its removal efficiency was stable during 9 h of filtration the pan cnt pani membrane also showed superiority in tc removal in the context of real secondary effluent this study provides a promising solution to deal with the challenge of removing antibiotics faced by electroactive membranes in complicated real secondary effluent matrices with the presence of abundant and diverse macromolecular organic pollutants

14772,removing harmful antibiotics is essential to reclaiming water from municipal secondary effluent electroactive membranes are effective in the removal of antibiotics but challenged by the abundant coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants in municipal secondary effluent to eliminate the interference of macromolecular organic pollutants in the removal of antibiotics we propose a novel electroactive membrane with a top polyacrylonitrile pan ultrafiltration layer and a bottom electroactive layer composed of carbon nanotubes cnts and polyaniline pani when filtering the mixture of tetracycline tc a typical antibiotic and humic acid ha a typical macromolecular organic pollutant the pan cnt pani membrane performed sequential removal it retained ha at the pan layer by 96 and allowed tc to reach the electroactive layer where it was electrochemically oxidized e g by 92 at 1 5 v the tc removal of the pan cnt pani membrane was marginally affected by ha unlike that of the control membrane with the electroactive layer on the top that showed decreased tc removal after the addition of ha e g decreased by 13 2 at 1 v the decreased tc removal of the control membrane was attributed to the attachment but not competitive oxidation of ha on the electroactive layer that impaired the electrochemical reactivity the ha removal prior to tc degradation realized by the pan cnt pani membrane avoided the attachment of ha and guaranteed tc removal on the electroactive layer long term filtration for 9 h revealed the stability of the pan cnt pani membrane and its advantageous

from municipal secondary effluent one of the recent prominent concerns relevant to secondary effluent reclamation is the removal of harmful antibiotics ineffectively degraded during the secondary biological treatment process pressure driven membrane separation is extensively utilized to reuse secondary effluent in wastewater treatment plants however microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf cannot retain antibiotics because of their large membrane pore size nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro can retain antibiotics but require a high operation pressure to yield a low permeate flux electroactive membranes have been recently developed to address the challenge of removing antibiotics from wastewater fan et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 electroactive membranes are electrically conductive and electrochemically reactive and they can remove antibiotics through electrochemical degradation during filtration highly effective removal of antibiotics can be realized with electroactive membranes with a pore size at the level of mf and uf breaking the trade off between permeability and rejection of traditional membranes almassi et al 2019 mo et al 2022 electroactive membranes can be fabricated by modifying traditional insulated polymeric membranes carbonaceous materials metals and conducting polymers are often integrated to endow polymeric membranes with electrical conductivity li et al 2021 liu et al 2021a 2021b thamaraiselvan et al 2021 yu et al 2019 the electrocatalytic reactivity of membranes can be enhanced by incorporating metal oxide or nanoscale metallic catalysts li et al 2020 2022b liu et al 2020 zheng et al 2021a 2021b surface coating is preferable to blending when these components are integrated because a consecutive electroactive layer can be easily formed on the polymeric membrane examples of electroactive membranes include a carbon cloth supported polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane removing sulfamethoxazole

membrane removing carbamazepine by 90 at 2 3 ma cm2 xu et al 2022 a challenging issue in the removal of antibiotics from secondary effluent by electroactive membranes is the coexistence of diverse organic pollutants among which humic acid ha protein and polysaccharide have received considerable attention guo et al 2021b jin et al 2016 shon et al 2006 sun et al 2016 they are macromolecular organic pollutants whose molecular weights mws usually 1 kda or 0 5 kda according to different studies are larger than that of antibiotics 0 5 kda guo et al 2021b jarusutthirak and amy 2007 shon et al 2006 these macromolecular organic pollutants exist at a much higher concentration than antibiotics do in secondary effluent their interference with the removal of antibiotics cannot be neglected and has elicited much attention the presence of ha has been reported to reduce the removal efficiency of electroactive membranes toward antibiotics although the removal efficiency is high in a feed with antibiotics as the sole organic pollutant e g from 90 to 20 for florfenicol in the presence of 50 mg l of ha guo et al 2021a jiang et al 2018 impeded antibiotic degradation on electroactive membranes has also been observed in the context of realistic water such as lake water where humic substances are predominant liu et al 2020 2015 competition for reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals and covering of reactive sites i e membrane fouling on electroactive membranes are the two ways through which coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants interfere with antibiotic removal liu et al 2015 yang et al 2020 however solutions to diminish the adverse impact of coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants on antibiotic removal are still lacking advancing the design of electroactive membranes is a promising strategy to overcome this shortcoming and match membranes with the complex circumstances of real water matrices existing electroactive membranes often locate electrocatalysts on the top surface or distribute them across the whole membrane skeleton consequently coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants are brought into contact with electrocatalysts and participate in competitive oxidation with antibiotics on electroactive membranes avoiding any contact between coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants and electrocatalysts is the key to reducing their influence on antibiotic removal a two layer membrane structure with a top polymeric uf layer and a bottom electroactive layer is a potential strategy to achieve this goal the top polymeric uf layer aims to retain most coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants and allow the penetration of antibiotics by taking advantage of their size difference therefore the bottom electroactive layer can degrade antibiotics with little interference from macromolecular organic pollutants such a two layer structure with an mf uf layer on the top and an electroactive layer at the bottom has been adopted in a few studies li et al 2022a zheng et al 2017 however these studies have not focused on the advantage of this structural design in eliminating the detrimental impact of coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants on antibiotic removal this study fabricated the top uf separation layer with polyacrylonitrile pan a common polymer for uf membranes and the bottom electroactive layer with carboxylate cnts and polyaniline pani conducting polymer with excellent electrical conductivity pan cnt pani membrane for short karmakar et al 2018 mo et al 2022 the fabrication and characterization of the pan cnt pani membrane were first investigated ha was selected as the delegate for macromolecular organic pollutants because it is smaller than protein and polysaccharide in size and more difficult to reject tc was used as the delegate for antibiotics which is frequently detected in secondary effluent wang et al 2020 the advantage of the pan cnt pani membrane in the removal of antibiotics was demonstrated by using a cnt pani pan membrane as a control with a reversed membrane structure the electroactive layer was located on the top surface of the pan layer the interfering mechanisms of ha and the removal manner of the pan cnt pani membrane were elucidated to explain the membrane s advantage in antibiotic removal finally practical implications were established for the pan cnt pani membrane through investigations on its durability and removal performance in the context of real municipal secondary effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents pan molecular weight of 150 000 da n n dimethylformamide dmf and ha were purchased from sigma aldrich saint louis mo usa the carboxylate cnt suspension with a cnt concentration of 0 5wt was supplied by xfnano nanjing china the carboxylate cnts cnts for short in the subsequent sections contained 2wt carboxyl groups and were 10 30 µm in length and 10 20 nm in diameter the other chemicals used for membrane fabrication included aniline ani mecoxlane inc shanghai china ammonium persulfate aps hydrochloric acid and glutaraldehyde ga tc was supplied by j k scientific beijing china and the chemicals used for tc detection acetonitrile methanol and oxalate were of chromatographic grade 2 2 electroactive membrane fabrication the pan cnt pani membrane was fabricated via a two step procedure fig 1 the first step was to prepare the pan substrate through the non solvent induced phase inversion technique with a casting solution composed of pan 18wt and dmf 82wt the mass concentration of pan was determined via preliminary experiments the resultant pan substrate was hydrolyzed in naoh solution 2 m at 45 c for 5 min to generate carboxyl groups as cross linking sites for the electroactive layer qiu et al 2011 the second step was the formation of the cnt pani electroactive layer at the bottom the surface with large pores of the hydrolyzed pan substrate the cnt suspension was centrifuged to remove coarse particles and diluted by thirty folds with deionized water the diluted cnt suspension 90 ml was vacuum filtered through the hydrolyzed pan substrate 7 cm in diameter of which the bottom surface faced the suspension to form the cnt layer the cnt modified pan substrate pan cnt membrane for short was then immersed in the ani solution 0 2 m ani in 2 m hcl and taken out after 20 min to vertically drain the ani solution until no liquid drops fell off an aps solution of 2 ml 0 1 m aps in 2 m hcl was carefully added drop by drop to the bottom surface of the pan substrate the contact of aps with the residual ani initiated the in situ polymerization of ani to form pani with a green color at the bottom of the pan substrate baker et al 2017 ćirić marjanović 2013 zhang et al 2019 the aps solution was drained after 2 min and the membrane was sealed in a culture dish for 6 h where the reaction between the residue of aps and ani continued finally the membrane was immersed in ga solution for 30 min at 45 c to enhance the cross linking and the pan cnt pani membrane was obtained for comparison a cnt pani electroactive layer was also prepared on the top surface the surface with small pores of the hydrolyzed pan substrate the membrane with such a structure design was denoted as the cnt pani pan membrane the fabrication procedures for the cnt pani pan membrane resembled those for the pan cnt pani membrane except that the cnt layer was formed on the top surface of the pan substrate 2 3 performance evaluation of electroactive membranes in the electro filtration system the filtration performance of the electroactive membranes was assessed using a bench scale circular electro filtration system fig 2 the filtration directions of the pan cnt pani and cnt pani pan membranes are shown in fig 1 the membrane coupon was loaded into a circular membrane cell effective filtration area of 12 56 cm2 with a built in ti ring as the current collector for the membrane the position of the ti ring in the membrane cell varied with the tested membrane to ensure its contact with the electroactive layer i e in contact with the bottom of the pan cnt pani membrane and with the top of the cnt pani pan membrane the membrane cell also had a circular ti plate acting as the counter electrode above the membrane with a distance of 1 cm the membrane was connected to dc power during filtration and served as the anode a pump introduced the feed solution placed in the thermostatic bath at 25 c into the membrane cell and the filtration pressure was controlled by the valve an electronic mass balance was used to measure the permeate mass and determine the membrane flux each filtration run was begun by compacting the membrane under 0 2 mpa for 30 min by using deionized water followed by assessing its filtration performance under 0 1 mpa the removal performance was evaluated using two different feed solutions under varied applied voltages 0 to 1 5 v the tc feed contained 0 8 mg l of tc and the tc ha feed contained 0 8 mg l of tc and 20 mg l of ha in deionized water 20 mg l of ha simulated the presence of macromolecular organic pollutants in the real secondary effluent a fixed concentration ratio among the macromolecular organic pollutants ha protein and polysaccharide has not been reported so ha was selected as the delegate because of its smallest mw the concentration of 20 mg l was selected according to the concentration range of the total organic carbon toc in the real secondary effluent the tc concentration was higher than that in the real secondary effluent to ensure a precise measurement and exclude the impact of the adsorption of pipes and pump on the tc feed concentration a reasonably high concentration of antibiotics at the level of 1 mg l has also been used in previous studies li et al 2022a xu et al 2022 zheng et al 2017 both feed solutions also contained 1 mm of nahco3 to mimic the ph of the secondary effluent and 10 mm of na2so4 to provide conductivity filtration was conducted for 180 min in most cases and samples were collected at intervals to determine the tc and ha concentrations and membrane flux the tc removal performance of pan cnt pani and cnt pani pan membranes in the absence and presence of ha was compared to demonstrate the advantage of the former the filtration period was extended to 9 h to examine the performance stability of the pan cnt pani membrane the feed solution was prepared by spiking 0 8 mg l of tc into the municipal secondary effluent obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant and filtered under 1 5 v to provide practical implications for the pan cnt pani membrane membrane fouling experiments were performed using the feed with ha but not tc that was filtered for 3 h under 0 v to examine the impact of ha fouling on tc removal the analysis of the ha fouled membranes is presented in sections 2 4 and 2 5 2 4 electrochemical degradation performance of electroactive membranes in the electrolysis cell to focus on the electrochemical degradation of tc and ha the electroactive membrane was tested in an electrolysis cell working volume of 300 ml where the membrane served as the anode but not a filter and a ti plate acted as the counter electrode the electroactive membrane was orientated toward the counter electrode in the same way as that in the electro filtration system the concentrations of tc ha and electrolytes in the feed solution were identical to those used in the electro filtration system the concentration variation of tc in the absence of ha was monitored for the pan cnt pani membrane under alternated voltages 2 5 v for the first 100 min and 0 v for the following 100 min to differentiate the contributions of electrochemical degradation and electro adsorption to tc removal ha degradation was investigated using the cnt pani pan membrane under 2 5 v in the feed solution without tc additionally the clean and ha fouled cnt pani pan membranes were tested for tc removal under 2 5 v to demonstrate the attachment of ha onto the membrane during tc removal the voltage 2 5 v used in the electrolysis cell was higher than that used for the electro filtration system 0 1 5 v because the mass transfer of pollutants was limited in the electrolysis cell so the voltage needed to be increased to facilitate electrochemical reactions however the applied voltage should not be too high to oxidize the cnts the voltage of 2 5 v was the maximum one used in our preliminary experiments and at this voltage the tc degradation performance of membranes was stable 2 5 analytical methods the pan pan cnt and pan cnt pani membranes were characterized through scanning electron microscopy sem gemini sem500 zeiss germany x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps nexsa thermo fisher scientific

filtration described in section 2 3 the concentration of tc was measured through high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 20ad shimadzu japan equipped with a c18 column shim pack gist shimadzu japan 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 µm the mobile phase was prepared by mixing oxalate solution 0 01 m in ultrapure water acetonitrile and methanol at a volume ratio of 60 30 10 the mobile phase flowed at a rate of 1 ml min through the c18 column at a temperature of 35 c samples were pretreated using a 0 45 µm filter and injected with a volume of 20 µl the retention time of tc was approximately 3 343 min and an ultraviolet uv detector was used to detect tc at a wavelength of 356 nm the calibration curve was established linear regression coefficient of 0 998 using standard solutions with the tc concentration ranging within 0 05 5 mg l ha was measured by a uv spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 254 nm the presence of ta did not affect the measurement of ha because of its low concentration and low absorbance at 254 nm fig s1 toc in the municipal secondary effluent was measured with a toc analyzer shimadzu japan the cnts in the suspension for membrane fabrication and the membrane permeate collected during 9 h of filtration described in section 2 3 were quantified by uv absorption at a wavelength of 295 nm on the basis of the calibration curve linear regression coefficient of 0 999 with the concentration ranging from 0 0005wt to 0 003wt 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the pan cnt pani membrane the fabricated pan membrane presented a typical asymmetric structure with a dense skin layer and a loose bottom layer the bottom membrane surface was used for the coating of the electroactive layer the pores at the bottom surface were completely covered by intertwined nanofibers of cnts figs 3 a1 and 3a2 after filtering the cnt suspension the cnts were buried to some degree and the rough surface became smooth when the polymerization of ani into pani was completed fig 3a3 the xps spectra figs 3b and s2a show the disappearance of n after cnt coating and the re appearance of n after pani formation the deconvoluted c1s spectra revealed the characteristic peaks of

pan cnt pani membrane than in the pan cnt membrane figs 3b2 and 3b3 hence chemical reactions were assumed to occur among cnts pani and ga ga reacted with pani thereby forming the tertiary amine n c 3 and increasing the percentage of sp3 c zhang et al 2019 the carboxyl groups in the cnts might have reacted with the amine group in pani to form the amide group moreover the carboxyl groups might have reacted with ga to form the ester bond co c dudchenko et al 2014 although the change in the peak intensity was difficult to distinguish because the peak position of c o overlapped with that of c n in pani abdulla et al 2015 therefore the cnt pani electroactive layer was fully cross linked notably the pan membrane was hydrolyzed and carried carboxyl groups so cross linking between the substrate and the electroactive layer also occurred via the reactions of the carboxyl groups the stability of the pan cnt pani membrane with a firmly attached bottom electroactive layer was confirmed by sonication after which the membrane structure was maintained fig s3 the reactions between ga and pani and between the carboxyl and amine groups were proposed to be the main pathways to achieving stability of the pan cnt pani membrane because the pan cnt membrane cross linked with ga showed poor stability during sonication fig s3 the pan cnt pani membrane exhibited a conductivity of 190 s m which is comparable to the conductivity of electrically conductive membranes in literature mo et al 2022 the conductivity of the pan cnt pani membrane was higher than that of the pan cnt membrane suggesting that the cnts and pani played a critical role in rendering the insulated pan membrane electrically conductive fig 3c as reported zhang et al 2019 the role of the cnts and pani in facilitating the redox reactions was further verified based on the cv curves after cnt coating the redox peaks for fe cn 6 3 2 appeared and the peak current density intensified after the formation of pani via the polymerization of ani on the cnt layer fig 3d the characterization in fig 3 implied that the fabricated pan cnt pani membrane exhibited good electrochemical properties electrical conductivity and structural stability 3 2 removal performance of the pan cnt pani membrane and its advantage in tc degradation in the presence of ha the removal performance of the pan cnt pani membrane filtering the feed with tc and ha was investigated under 1 5 v as the anode and 0 v the pan cnt pani membrane was categorized as uf membranes with a pure water flux of approximately 235 9 lmh bar the removal efficiency of ha whose molecular size was 4 nm xiao 2011 was maintained at approximately 96 during 3 h of filtration regardless of the voltage fig 4 a meanwhile the pan membrane showed a nearly complete ha removal 96 during filtration at 0 v fig 4b but could not degrade ha as demonstrated in the electrolysis cell fig s4 therefore the high ha removal of the pan cnt pani membrane was attributed to the physical sieving by the pores of the pan layer by contrast tc with a small molecular size 1 nm estimated based on the mw xiao et al 2018 was only rejected by approximately 20 by the pan membrane so the tc removal efficiency of the pan cnt pani membrane under 0 v was low however the application of 1 5 v voltage considerably improved the tc removal efficiency of the pan cnt pani membrane with a value steadily higher than 90 during 3 h of filtration the enhanced removal of tc was assumed to have resulted from oxidation after the role of electro adsorption was excluded in the electrolysis cell the tc concentration did not recover to the initial value 0 55 mg l after the voltage was switched from 2 5 v to 0 v fig s5 suggesting that electro adsorption hardly contributed to the tc removal of the pan cnt pani membrane and that oxidation played the key role in tc removal when the membrane was applied with a voltage given that the pan membrane could not oxidize tc fig s4 the oxidation of tc took place at the cnt pani electroactive layer probably in the cnts based on a previous study that reported that a cnt filter degraded tc liu et al 2015 therefore the two layer structure of the pan cnt pani membrane pan layer at the top and cnt pani electroactive layer at the bottom enabled the membrane to retain ha via the pan layer and allowed tc to be transported and reach the cnt pani electroactive layer for electrochemical degradation this sequential removal manner physical sieving of ha followed by electrochemical oxidation of tc conforms to our expectation and helps eliminate the interference of ha with tc removal which will be discussed in the next paragraph the influence of ha on the tc degradation of the pan cnt pani membrane was investigated by comparing the tc removal efficiency in the absence and presence of ha under 0 5 1 and 1 5 v fig 5 a the tc removal efficiency was averaged for 3 h of filtration because it was almost constant during filtration fig s6 an increase in the applied voltage improved the tc degradation in both cases the addition of ha to the feed hardly changed the tc removal efficiency of the pan cnt pani membrane under the three applied voltages according to the calculated difference in tc removal efficiency fig 5c without ha 43 6 4 7 67 8 2 4 and 92 2 2 1 for 0 5 1 and 1 5 v respectively with ha 45 6 7 3 69 1 5 1 and 92 2 1 1 for 0 5 1 and 1 5 v respectively however ha s influence on tc degradation was clearly observed for the cnt pani pan membrane in which the structure an electroactive layer on the top of the pan layer was opposite to that of the pan cnt pani membrane unlike on the pan cnt pani membrane the presence of ha impaired the tc degradation of the cnt pani pan membrane fig 5b specifically after ha was added into the feed the tc removal efficiency of the cnt pani pan membrane was reduced by 4 8 13 2 and 4 6 under 0 5 1 and 1 5 v respectively fig 5c when only tc was filtered the cnt pani pan membrane displayed tc removal efficiencies similar to those of the pan cnt pani membrane under 1 and 1 5 v however the pan cnt pani membrane outperformed the cnt pani pan membrane in tc removal in the presence of ha fig 5d the results in fig 5 confirm the advantage of placing the electroactive layer at the bottom in eliminating the influence of ha on tc degradation the advantage of the pan cnt pani membrane over the cnt pani pan membrane was maximized under a moderate applied voltage namely 1 v in this study although such an advantage was less obvious when the applied voltage was low or high 0 5 and 1 5 v in this study increasing the applied voltage is another strategy to reduce the interference of ha in the tc removal of electroactive membranes but at the expense of increased energy consumption 3 3 ways through which ha interfered with tc degradation on the cnt pani electroactive layer the ways through which ha affected tc degradation on the cnt pani electroactive layer were further investigated to verify the superiority of the pan cnt pani membrane the exploration was performed with the cnt pani pan membrane in which the cnt pani electroactive layer was simultaneously brought into contact with tc and ha during filtration a plausible way through which ha reduces the removal efficiency of tc is that ha competes with tc for the reactive sites on the cnt pani electroactive layer or the oxidative species generated by the electroactive layer this competition effect if present should be amplified because ha usually exists at a much higher concentration than tc does in secondary effluent in this study the oxidation of ha on the cnt pani electroactive layer was investigated in the electrolysis cell to provide evidence on the competition effect however ha concentration did not decline during electrolysis under 2 5 v fig 6 a this finding implies that competition with tc for reactive sites or oxidative species could not explain why the presence of ha decelerated the tc degradation of the cnt pani pan membrane fig 5c given that ha was not degraded on the cnt pani electroactive layer the attachment of ha onto the layer might occur because ha can easily cause membrane fouling due to its hydrophobic nature and the continuous imposition of drag force from water flow during filtration guo et al 2021b the cnt pani electroactive layer serving as the anode would accelerate the attachment of ha with negative charges therefore the flux decline of the cnt pani pan membrane during filtration under 1 v was investigated and is presented in fig 6b 1 v was chosen because at this voltage the interference of ha was the most severe as indicated in fig 5c the addition of ha to the feed aggregated the membrane fouling leading to a low flux after 5 min of filtration 134 lmh vs 182 lmh for the tc ha and tc feed respectively this phenomenon was also confirmed by the final membrane flux after 3 h of filtration 81 lmh for the tc ha feed and 118 lmh for the tc feed and a darkened yellow color observed on the membrane surface after filtering the tc ha feed it indicates that ha attached to the membrane during filtration which occurred on the cnt pani pan electroactive layer because it directly faced the feed the attachment of ha was another plausible way through which ha impaired tc degradation on the cnt pani electroactive layer the ha solution was filtered through the cnt pani pan membrane for 3 h without an applied voltage and the fouled cnt pani pan membrane was tested to confirm the inference above the area surrounded by the cv curve was considerably reduced for the fouled cnt pani pan membrane compared with the clean cnt pani pan membrane fig 6c furthermore the fouled cnt pani pan membrane degraded tc more slowly than the clean cnt pani pan membrane did as demonstrated in the electrolysis cell fig 6d the changes in the cv curve and the degradation profile of tc in the electrolysis cell suggested that the attachment of ha onto the cnt pani electroactive layer was probably the key reason for the impeded tc degradation of the cnt pani pan membrane in the presence of ha this effect was also observed when tc degradation was compared in the solutions containing tc and tc ha fig 6d in the electrolysis cell the presence of ha already induced the slow degradation of tc this probably resulted from the physical adsorption of ha onto the cnt pani electroactive layer partially covering the reactive sites for tc degradation on the basis of the analysis above the interference of ha in tc degradation was dominated by its attachment onto the cnt pani electroactive layer but not by its competition with tc for oxidation fig 7 thus the advantage of the pan cnt pani membrane relied on the ability of the membrane to avoid the attachment of ha onto the electroactive layer with the aid of the pan layer acting as a filter fig 7 this attribute maintained the electrochemical activity of the cnt pani electroactive layer as verified by the cv curves of the fouled and clean pan cnt pani membranes fig 6c and consequently guaranteed tc degradation on the basis of the sieving oxidation sequential removal manner such a membrane structural design with a top pore finely tuned uf separation layer and a bottom electroactive layer shows promise in eliminating the detrimental impacts of macromolecular organic pollutants on antibiotic removal from secondary effluent electroactive membranes with this unique two layer structure and distinct removal mechanisms are strategic candidates for tackling the complicated water matrix in realistic applications however fouling at the top surface still needs control to recover the water flux of the pan cnt pani membrane 3 4 implications for the practical application of the pan cnt pani membrane the filtration period was prolonged to 9 h to examine the performance stability of the pan cnt pani membrane under 1 v at which its advantage over the cnt pani pan membrane was evident stable removal performance of the membrane was observed with ha removal 95 and tc removal 60 fig 8 a during 9 h of filtration the slightly increased removal efficiency of tc was probably due to membrane fouling that gradually narrowed the membrane pores the absorbance of uv of the permeate was monitored with time to verify the leaching of cnts and pani from the membrane during filtration fig 8b no characteristic peaks for pani were observed fan et al 2008 and a slight characteristic peak at 295 nm for cnts was detected in the permeate collected during the first hour absorbance of 0 075 however this absorbance peak disappeared in the permeate collected during the following hours of filtration these results indicate that tiny loosely bound cnts might have leached at the beginning but most cnts stayed on the membrane due to the cross linking between the electroactive layer and pan substrate as explained in section 3 1 the leaching percentage of cnts was only 0 8 from the pan cnt pani membrane with a cnt loading mass of 3 5 g m2 calculated using the calibration curve fig s7 moreover the filtration experiment using the feed with electrolytes was performed to observe the membrane morphology change the sem images of the pan cnt pani membrane before and after filtration were similar fig s8 and leaching of cnts and pani was negligible fig s9 based on the uv vis absorbance and toc concentration in the permeate further demonstrating that the mechanical strength of the membrane was sufficient however the diminished cv curve after 9 h of filtration fig 8c indicated the loss of the electrochemical activity of the pan cnt pani membrane this result was probably due to the adsorption of the by products of tc on the electroactive layer or the oxidation of cnts or pani during long term operation duan et al 2016 eftekhari et al 2017 the loss of protons doped in pani which are necessary for conducting electrons might also be a reason for the electrochemical activity deterioration of the pan cnt pani membrane baker et al 2017 thus sustaining the reactive activity of the pan cnt pani membrane during long term operation is still a challenge although its physical structural stability is assured the pan cnt pani membrane performed well when ha was used as the model coexisting organic pollutant however ha is only a portion of organic pollutants in real secondary effluent and the used model foulant of ha has a narrow size distribution 6 to 70 kda xiao 2011 xiao et al 2018 real secondary effluent contains various organic pollutants ranging from 100 da to 100 kda specifically the large mw molecules mw 10 kda are mainly polysaccharide and protein the medium mw molecules 500 da mw 10 kda belong to ha substance and the low mw molecules include refractory organic pollutants organic acid and simple sugars jarusutthirak and amy 2007 shon et al 2006 thus in this study the merit of placing the electroactive layer at the bottom was further explored in the context of real secondary effluent fig 8d the small organic pollutants in the real secondary effluent may penetrate the top pan layer and decelerate tc degradation on the bottom cnt pani layer therefore 1 5 v which was the maximum voltage in the tests with the ha model foulant was chosen to filter the real secondary effluent and achieve high tc removal efficiency compared to the case with the synthetic tc feed fig 4a tc was removed to a smaller extent in the background of the real secondary effluent for the pan cnt pani membrane in the synthetic tc feed 92 in the real secondary effluent background 80 this result was obtained because the real secondary effluent contained small organic pollutants that could not be rejected as effectively as the large ha model foulant as evidenced by the low toc removal efficiency of approximately 20 for the real secondary effluent fig s10 consequently the cnt pani electroactive layer underwent fouling by these small organic pollutants passing through the pan layer and tc degradation was impeded however the reduction in the tc removal efficiency of the pan cnt pani membrane was less obvious than that of the cnt pani pan membrane in the synthetic tc feed 90 in the real wastewater background 55 these results demonstrate the potential merit of the pan cnt pani membrane in diminishing the adverse impacts of coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants on antibiotic degradation however the structural design of the uf layer should be reconsidered in the future to narrow down the pores and effectively reject small organic pollutants so that sequential removal by the electroactive membrane can be realized 4 conclusions a novel electroactive membrane pan cnt pani membrane with a top pan uf separation layer and a bottom cnt pani electroactive layer was fabricated and investigated for its potential to reduce the impacts of coexisting macromolecular organic pollutants on antibiotic removal from municipal secondary effluent the pan cnt pani membrane had an electrical conductivity of 190 s m and exhibited good electrochemical reactivity tc was effectively electrochemically degraded on the pan cnt pani membrane 92 at 1 5 v moreover the tc removal efficiency of the pan cnt pani membrane was marginally affected by ha compared with that of the cnt pani pan membrane with a top electroactive layer which showed reduced tc removal in the presence of ha the prevention of ha attachment onto the bottom cnt pani electroactive layer by retaining ha via the top pan layer was the main reason for the unaffected tc removal of the pan cnt pani membrane in the presence of ha the structural stability of the pan cnt pani membrane was maintained via cross linking and its removal efficiency was stable during 9 h of filtration the pan cnt pani membrane also showed superiority in tc removal in the context of real secondary effluent this study provides a promising solution to deal with the challenge of removing antibiotics faced by electroactive membranes in complicated real secondary effluent matrices with the presence of abundant and diverse macromolecular organic pollutants

14773,the widespread use of antibiotics has created an antibiotic resistance genes args enriched environment which causes high risks on human and animal health although antibiotics can be partially adsorbed and degraded in wastewater treatment processes striving for a complete understanding of the microbial adaptive mechanism to antibiotic stress remains urgent combined with metagenomics and metabolomics this study revealed that anammox consortia could adapt to lincomycin by spontaneously changing the preference for metabolite utilization and establishing interactions with eukaryotes such

above 85 figure 1 and s1 the stoichiometric ratios of the nitrite consumption to ammonium removal r s and the nitrate production to ammonium removal r p represent whether anammox process is dominant in the system strous et al 1998 the r s and r p of r0 and r1 fluctuated around the theoretical values 1 32 and 0 26 throughout the experiment indicating that lin did not affect the main nitrogen removal pathway of the anammox system initially the saas of r0 and r1 were 234 3 28 4 and 340 1 26 3 mg g 1 vss d 1 respectively with the addition of 0 2 mg l 1 lin in r1 the saa dramatically decreased to 147 6 3 3 mg g 1 vss d 1 unexpectedly as the antibiotic concentration continually increased the saa of r1 could almost rebounded to the original level from the perspectives of nitrogen removal performance and saa the anammox process could adapt to the stress of lin the adaptation mechanism of anammox system to lin was further analyzed by deciphering the microbial community structure and interspecific interactions the co occurrence network based on the spearman rank correlation coefficient showed that the three modules were composed of different taxonomic profiles with planctomycetes proteobacteria chloroflexi and acidobacteria being the dominant phyla figure 2 a planctomycetes was the dominant phylum with an average abundance of 55 56 in all samples and anaob was the main genus table s4 five genera of anaob were detected including ca kuenenia ca brocadia ca jettenia ca scalindua and ca anammoximicrobium figures 3 a and s2 the abundances of these anaob in phases ii and iii were higher than their initial values in r1 verifying that the anammox system was tolerant with the addition of lin table s5 these results suggested that the abundance of key species in the system changed significantly under lin stress which could affect the interspecies interactions the co occurrence network of key genera in planctomycetes showed that planctomycetes were divided into three modules figure 3b ca kuenenia ca brocadia ca jettenia and ca scalindua gathered into one module correlation analysis manifested that ca kuenenia was significantly negatively correlated with that of ca brocadia p 0 01 which might be due to their close functional proximity and competition in the ecological niche figure 3c ca brocadia r strategy preferred to grow in biofilms or biogranules while ca kuenenia k strategy competed with other anaob in suspended sludge wang et al 2020 zheng et al 2016 eukaryotes as the second major consortia in the anammox system cooperated with bacteria to maintain the ecosystem stability osinska et al 2015 ascomycota and basidiomycota were key phyla in eukaryotes with the abundances of 7 0 and 1 6 respectively figure s2 their abundances in r1 were higher than those in r0 in phase iii indicating that they might contribute to maintaining the anammox system stability in response to the antibiotic stress by analyzing the correlation between bacteria and eukaryotes anaob was negatively correlated with ascomycota and basidiomycota implying the competitions among them figure s3 due to their different substrate utilization and functions ascomycota and basidiomycota could live together for a long time hening and nguyen 2020 as filamentous bacteria they established a complex network and provided attachments for bacteria which was beneficial for bacterial growth and aggregation osinska et al 2015 in addition eukaryotes have also been reported to secrete peroxidase or demethylase to degrade lin such as caldariomyces fumago li et al 2021b zhu et al 2020 lin can be degraded through following pathways i hydroxylation s oxidation and nitrosation ii demethylation or demethylthioation iii cleavage of piperazine moiety zhou et al 2021 however no lin degrading eukaryote was detected in this anammox system according to co occurrence networks of the top 400 microorganisms in the anammox system lin significantly changed the stability of microbial consortia figure 2b compared with phase i the modularity of microbial consortia was significantly increased in phase ii indicating that the microbial consortia structure was more stable with a higher resistance to the external stress mercado et al 2022 according to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis a moderate level of stress could maintain a high diversity of population roxburgh et al 2004 this explained the fact that low concentration lin did not exceed the threshold of microbial tolerance in general with the increase in lin concentration microbial functions were not disturbed but their stability and diversity were improved nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis revealed that the microbial similarity among samples increased after the addition of lin figure s3 on the other hand simpson and shannon values of the idna fraction were initially decreased and then increased as with the antibiotic concentration table s6 these findings verified that microbial communities in the anammox system altered their interspecific interactions under lin stress 3 2 horizontal transfer of intracellular and extracellular args sequences of the edna and idna fractions were assembled and divided into bacterial viral archaeal eukaryotic and unclassified groups and their proportions in edna and idna were similar after taxonomic classification of contigs assembled from the metagenomic sequencing reads principal component analysis pca and venn diagram were visualized figure s4 with the addition of lin microorganisms of edna shared fewer species than that of idna and the numbers of endemic species also decreased to explore the potential interactions between edna and idna fractions the functional gene subsystem classification in edna and idna were identified there were 6 functional subsystems of metagenomic sequences including cellular processes environmental information processing genetic information processing human diseases metabolism and organismal systems figure s5 the relative abundances of functional pathways were almost identical in edna and idna indicating that the microbial functions of edna and idna were closely related the mobilome results showed that plasmids were more abundant than insertion elements integrons and phages with the relative abundances of 46 0 and 47 0 in edna and idna respectively their abundances decreased from phases i to iii figure 4 phages could mediate the transfer of mges cui et al 2018 and the variations in plasmid abundance affected the transfer of args in and out of cells different concentrations of lin interfered with the abundance of integrons and insertion elements the total amount of integrons in edna was significantly lower than that in idna while the total amount of insertion elements in edna was significantly higher than that in idna the abundances of integrons first decreased and then increased in idna during the whole experimental period while the abundances of inserted elements showed an opposite trend figure 4b and c in edna the abundances of integrons continuously increased while the abundances of insertion elements also changed in the opposite direction among the integrons and insertion elements in edna and idna inti1 52 7 and 59 1 and iscku8 37 1 and 34 9 were the most dominant respectively figure s5 vatanen et al 2022 suggested that the enhanced interspecific interactions facilitated hgt frequency by increasing bacterial conjugation therefore the changes in megs of edna and idna were closely related to complex interspecific interactions the profile of resistomic analysis results displayed more distinct patterns among edna and idna fractions figure s5 a total of 25 distinct args from 9 different antibiotic resistance families were present in the idna and edna fractions the total abundance of args in the idna fraction was much higher than that in the edna fraction manifesting that most args were confined within cells while specific args could float in sludge samples there was absolute dominance of bacitracin resistance genes 87 6 and 91 7 respectively in idna and edna in idna and edna the abundance of bacitracin and sulfonamide resistance genes increased with the increasing of lin concentration figure s6 the variation in the abundances of args in edna and idna suggested that args transfer might contribute to microbial adaptation to lin 3 3 the crispr system and global regulatory genes regulated the hgt of args global regulatory genes kora korb and trba were reported to involve in the conjugative transfer of args through plasmids samuels et al 2000 compared with phase ii the abundances of trba in the idna fraction decreased significantly by 64 5 and those of kora and korb also exhibited a slight downward trend in phase iii figure 4 the mating pair formation mpf system involving in the development of coupling bridges among cell surface proteins at the early phase of coupling was activated by the downregulation of global regulatory genes zatyka et al 2001 the trfa protein that contributed to the activation of dna replication might decrease when kora and korb suppressed the expression of trfa promoter trfap zhang et al 2018 to verify whether the translation level of genes was affected by lin trfa protein was detected by western blotting compared with the control group 2 mg l 1 lin increased the expression of trfa protein therefore as the abundances of kora and korb decreased dna replication became active and favored hgt bacteria changed the abundance of key proteins through endogenous regulation improving the conjugative transfer of args huang et al 2022c moreover the upregulation of cas9 protein was observed after the addition of 2 mg l 1 lin indicating that the crispr cas system was activated by lin stress previous studies reported that bacteria could degrade viral dna through the crispr cas system nath et al 2022 according to metagenomic analysis the total abundance of phages decreased in phase ii bacteria kill phages based on the crispr system mainly through three steps including adaptation expression and stress chen et al 2021b initially bacteria integrated foreign dna fragments into the crispr array and then express crispr rna crrna from the obtained spacer region crrna functions as a recognition signal to help cas proteins to enter the phage dna during invasion and subsequently functions as an endonuclease to break down the phage dna chen et al 2021b based on the resistomic analysis the hypothesis that microorganisms adapt to lin stress by changing the path and frequency of args transfer is verified 3 4 antibiotic stress changed the metabolic pathway of anammox consortia the metabolic activities of microorganisms played a crucial role in maintaining the mass transfer efficiency and nitrogen removal performance of the anammox system chen et al 2021a in r0 and r1 437 metabolites were discovered in the continuous flow experiment partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da plots showed that the spatial distribution of different phases clustered into two groups and the samples of r0 and r1 were obviously separated figure s3 venn diagrams demonstrated that 350 metabolites were shared between r0 and r1 in phases i and iii figure s7 however their abundances significantly changed in phase iii particularly the metabolites related to nucleotide metabolism and amino acid metabolism figure 5 these results indicated that lin inhibited the metabolic activities of microorganisms in the anammox system in phase iii variable importance in the projection vip fold change fc and p value analyses suggested that significant changes in metabolites occurred in r0 and r1 figures 5 and s7 metabolites involving in amino acid metabolism such as phe gly lle thr and ala increased significantly in r1 reproduction and survival are two dependent factors for biological fitness in each life history link limited resources need to be allocated optimally if the energy distribution of one link is raised the energy of another link must be reduced cody 1966 therefore changing energy allocation and metabolite utilization preferences are efficient ways for microorganisms to adapt to the antibiotic stress oshiki et al 2011 in addition increasing amino acid metabolites contributed to the synthesis of more proteins which were probably secreted to the extracellular matrix and became a part of eps thus the eps content of r1 increased by 6 3 in phase iii compared with that in phase i figure 1 all 343 and 95 metabolites were classified into six kegg first grade pathways while 64 and 31 metabolites among them were classified into metabolism in the positive ion channel pos and negative ion channel neg models respectively the dominant third pathways were purine metabolism pyrimidine metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism which belonged to two secondary pathways of nucleotide metabolism and amino acid metabolism figure 5d furthermore lin also altered the activity of key metabolic pathways to understand the metabolic differences between samples the pathway activity profiling papi algorithm was used to calculate metabolic pathway activities the activities of arginine and proline metabolism purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism were significantly higher than those of others the changes in metabolic pathways were reflected not only in the intracellular matrix but also in the extracellular matrix figure s5 comparing the functional metabolic pathways of edna and idna signaling molecules and interactions lipid metabolism and other amino acid metabolisms revealed significant p 0 05 differences in edna and idna 3 5 qs based regulation of the microbial utilization preference for metabolites qs is a ubiquitous interaction and communication pathway in microbial consortia that can regulate bacterial behavior by secreting signaling molecules shrout and nerenberg 2012 qs has been reported to be beneficial for microorganisms to resist environmental stress by increasing eps secretion zhang et al 2020 recently more studies have proposed that qs is also an important regulatory approach for anaob under environmental stress guo et al 2021 metagenomic analysis suggested that the abundances of genes related to signal transduction in r1 showed a gradually increasing trend during the experimental period figure 5 moreover the abundances of metabolites related to signaling metabolic pathways were significantly lower in phase iii than in the initial phase these results indicated that the signal conduction ability among microorganisms was enhanced with lin concentration implying an increase in metabolite utilization goo et al 2015 meanwhile the abundances of genes in amino acid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism increased with the lin concentration and the key functional genes hdh and nirs in nitrogen metabolism also increased combined with the metabolomic analysis the preference of microorganisms to metabolic amino acids was changed figure s7 the abundance of tyramine a precursor of tyrosine increased by 12 73 in phase iii in contrast the abundances of l proline and l glutamate decreased microorganisms use cheap or readily available amino acids due to the low cost of their synthesis especially under environmental stress costly amino acids are ubiquitous in rarely expressed proteins while cheap amino acids are ubiquitous in highly expressed proteins swire 2007 the central law of genetics holds that genetic information multiplies at each stage and it consumes more energy or cellular resources than the previous one gao et al 2021 therefore reducing the utilization of tyrosine costly amino acids and switching to proline and glutamate cheap amino acids could be beneficial for microbial survival under antibiotic stress overall the above results prove that qs regulation affected ecological interactions through the exchange of nearby signal molecules or metabolites allen et al 2016 4 conclusions the anammox system exhibited a remarkable tolerance to the long term stress of lin in this study and adaptation mechanisms of anammox consortia were elucidated based on multiomic analyses microorganisms in the anammox system adapted to antibiotic stress by changing the interspecific interactions and the preference of microbial metabolites through qs regulation the altered interspecific interactions were also closely related to the complex horizontal transfer of args and mges at the genetic level microorganisms regulated the efficiency and pathway of args transfer via the crispr system and global regulatory genes enabling them to stably grow in an antibiotic stressed condition this study provides a new insight of using

14773,the widespread use of antibiotics has created an antibiotic resistance genes args enriched environment which causes high risks on human and animal health although antibiotics can be partially adsorbed and degraded in wastewater treatment processes striving for a complete understanding of the microbial adaptive mechanism to antibiotic stress remains urgent combined with metagenomics and metabolomics this study revealed that anammox consortia could adapt to lincomycin by spontaneously changing the preference for metabolite utilization and establishing interactions with eukaryotes such as ascomycota and basidiomycota specifically quorum sensing qs based microbial regulation and the args transfer mediated by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr system and global regulatory genes were the principal adaptive strategies western blotting results validated that cas9 and trfa were mainly responsible for the alteration of args transfer pathway these findings

term addition of oxytetracycline ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin increased the abundances of antibiotic resistance genes args in the anammox system which probably contributed to the resistance of anammox consortia zhang et al 2019 the tolerance of anammox consortia to various organics facilitates its full scale application in treating antibiotic containing wastewater fan et al 2021 fan et al

visualized by gephi v 0 9 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial cooperation to alleviate antibiotic stress in the continuous flow experiment the nres of two reactors were stable at a high level of above 85 figure 1 and s1 the stoichiometric ratios of the nitrite consumption to ammonium removal r s and the nitrate production to ammonium removal r p represent whether anammox process is dominant in the system strous et al 1998 the r s and r p of r0 and r1 fluctuated around the theoretical values 1 32 and 0 26 throughout the experiment indicating that lin did not affect the main nitrogen removal pathway of the anammox system initially the saas of r0 and r1 were 234 3 28 4 and 340 1 26 3 mg g 1 vss d 1 respectively with the addition of 0 2 mg l 1 lin in r1 the saa dramatically decreased to 147 6 3 3 mg g 1 vss d 1 unexpectedly as the antibiotic concentration continually increased the saa of r1 could almost rebounded to the original level from the perspectives of nitrogen removal performance and saa the anammox process could adapt to the stress of lin the adaptation mechanism of anammox system to lin was further analyzed by deciphering the microbial community structure and interspecific interactions the co occurrence network based on the spearman rank correlation coefficient showed that the three modules were composed of different taxonomic profiles with planctomycetes proteobacteria chloroflexi and acidobacteria being the dominant phyla figure 2 a planctomycetes was the dominant phylum with an average abundance of 55 56 in all samples and anaob was the main genus table s4 five genera of anaob were detected including ca kuenenia ca brocadia ca jettenia ca scalindua and ca anammoximicrobium figures 3 a and s2 the abundances of these anaob in phases ii and iii were higher than their initial values in r1 verifying that the anammox system was tolerant with the addition of lin table s5 these results suggested that the abundance of key species in the system changed significantly under lin stress which could affect the interspecies interactions the co occurrence network of key genera in planctomycetes showed that planctomycetes were divided into three modules figure 3b ca kuenenia ca brocadia ca jettenia and ca scalindua gathered into one module correlation analysis manifested that ca kuenenia was significantly negatively correlated with that of ca brocadia p 0 01 which might be due to their close functional proximity and competition in the ecological niche figure 3c ca brocadia r strategy preferred to grow in biofilms or biogranules while ca kuenenia k strategy competed with other anaob in suspended sludge wang et al 2020 zheng et al 2016 eukaryotes as the second major consortia in the anammox system cooperated with bacteria to maintain the ecosystem stability osinska et al 2015 ascomycota and basidiomycota were key phyla in eukaryotes with the abundances of 7 0 and 1 6 respectively figure s2 their abundances in r1 were higher than those in r0 in phase iii indicating that they might contribute to maintaining the anammox system stability in response to the antibiotic stress by analyzing the correlation between bacteria and eukaryotes anaob was negatively correlated with ascomycota and basidiomycota implying the competitions among them figure s3 due to their different substrate utilization and functions ascomycota and basidiomycota could live together for a long time hening and nguyen 2020 as filamentous bacteria they established a complex network and provided attachments for bacteria which was beneficial for bacterial growth and aggregation osinska et al 2015 in addition eukaryotes have also been reported to secrete peroxidase or demethylase to degrade lin such as caldariomyces fumago li et al 2021b zhu et al 2020 lin can be degraded through following pathways i hydroxylation s oxidation and nitrosation ii demethylation or demethylthioation iii cleavage of piperazine moiety zhou et al 2021 however no lin degrading eukaryote was detected in this anammox system according to co occurrence networks of the top 400 microorganisms in the anammox system lin significantly changed the stability of microbial consortia figure 2b compared with phase i the modularity of microbial consortia was significantly increased in phase ii indicating that the microbial consortia structure was more stable with a higher resistance to the external stress mercado et al 2022 according to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis a moderate level of stress could maintain a high diversity of population roxburgh et al 2004 this explained the fact that low concentration lin did not exceed the threshold of microbial tolerance in general with the increase in lin concentration microbial functions were not disturbed but their stability and diversity were improved nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis revealed that the microbial similarity among samples increased after the addition of lin figure s3 on the other hand simpson and shannon values of the idna fraction were initially decreased and then increased as with the antibiotic concentration table s6 these findings verified that microbial communities in the anammox system altered their interspecific interactions under lin stress 3 2 horizontal transfer of intracellular and extracellular args sequences of the edna and idna fractions were assembled and divided into bacterial viral archaeal eukaryotic and unclassified groups and their proportions in edna and idna were similar after taxonomic classification of contigs assembled from the metagenomic sequencing reads principal component analysis pca and venn diagram were visualized figure s4 with the addition of lin microorganisms of edna shared fewer species than that of idna and the numbers of endemic species also decreased to explore the potential interactions between edna and idna fractions the functional gene subsystem classification in edna and idna were identified there were 6 functional subsystems of metagenomic sequences including cellular processes environmental information processing genetic information processing human diseases metabolism and organismal systems figure s5 the relative abundances of functional pathways were almost identical in edna and idna indicating that the microbial functions of edna and idna were closely related the mobilome results showed that plasmids were more abundant than insertion elements integrons and phages with the relative abundances of 46 0 and 47 0 in edna and idna respectively their abundances decreased from phases i to iii figure 4 phages could mediate the transfer of mges cui et al 2018 and the variations in plasmid abundance affected the transfer of args in and out of cells different concentrations of lin interfered with the abundance of integrons and insertion elements the total amount of integrons in edna was significantly lower than that in idna while the total amount of insertion elements in edna was significantly higher than that in idna the abundances of integrons first decreased and then increased in idna during the whole experimental period while the abundances of inserted elements showed an opposite trend figure 4b and c in edna the abundances of integrons continuously increased while the abundances of insertion elements also changed in the opposite direction among the integrons and insertion elements in edna and idna inti1 52 7 and 59 1 and iscku8 37 1 and 34 9 were the most dominant respectively figure s5 vatanen et al 2022 suggested that the enhanced interspecific interactions facilitated hgt frequency by increasing bacterial conjugation therefore the changes in megs of edna and idna were closely related to complex interspecific interactions the profile of resistomic analysis results displayed more distinct patterns among edna and idna fractions figure s5 a total of 25 distinct args from 9 different antibiotic resistance families were present in the idna and edna fractions the total abundance of args in the idna fraction was much higher than that in the edna fraction manifesting that most args were confined within cells while specific args could float in sludge samples there was absolute dominance of bacitracin resistance genes 87 6 and 91 7 respectively in idna and edna in idna and edna the abundance of bacitracin and sulfonamide resistance genes increased with the increasing of lin concentration figure s6 the variation in the abundances of args in edna and idna suggested that args transfer might contribute to microbial adaptation to lin 3 3 the crispr system and global regulatory genes regulated the hgt of args global regulatory genes kora korb and trba were reported to involve in the conjugative transfer of args through plasmids samuels et al 2000 compared with phase ii the abundances of trba in the idna fraction decreased significantly by 64 5 and those of kora and korb also exhibited a slight downward trend in phase iii figure 4 the mating pair formation mpf system involving in the development of coupling bridges among cell surface proteins at the early phase of coupling was activated by the downregulation of global regulatory genes zatyka et al 2001 the trfa protein that contributed to the activation of dna replication might decrease when kora and korb suppressed the expression of trfa promoter trfap zhang et al 2018 to verify whether the translation level of genes was affected by lin trfa protein was detected by western blotting compared with the control group 2 mg l 1 lin increased the expression of trfa protein therefore as the abundances of kora and korb decreased dna replication became active and favored hgt bacteria changed the abundance of key proteins through endogenous regulation improving the conjugative transfer of args huang et al 2022c moreover the upregulation of cas9 protein was observed after the addition of 2 mg l 1 lin indicating that the crispr cas system was activated by lin stress previous studies reported that bacteria could degrade viral dna through the crispr cas system nath et al 2022 according to metagenomic analysis the total abundance of phages decreased in phase ii bacteria kill phages based on the crispr system mainly through three steps including adaptation expression and stress chen et al 2021b initially bacteria integrated foreign dna fragments into the crispr array and then express crispr rna crrna from the obtained spacer region crrna functions as a recognition signal to help cas proteins to enter the phage dna during invasion and subsequently functions as an endonuclease to break down the phage dna chen et al 2021b based on the resistomic analysis the hypothesis that microorganisms adapt to lin stress by changing the path and frequency of args transfer is verified 3 4 antibiotic stress changed the metabolic pathway of anammox consortia the metabolic activities of microorganisms played a crucial role in maintaining the mass transfer efficiency and nitrogen removal performance of the anammox system chen et al 2021a in r0 and r1 437 metabolites were discovered in the continuous flow experiment partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da plots showed that the spatial distribution of different phases clustered into two groups and the samples of r0 and r1 were obviously separated figure s3 venn diagrams demonstrated that 350 metabolites were shared between r0 and r1 in phases i and iii figure s7 however their abundances significantly changed in phase iii particularly the metabolites related to nucleotide metabolism and amino acid metabolism figure 5 these results indicated that lin inhibited the metabolic activities of microorganisms in the anammox system in phase iii variable importance in the projection vip fold change fc and p value analyses suggested that significant changes in metabolites occurred in r0 and r1 figures 5 and s7 metabolites involving in amino acid metabolism such as phe gly lle thr and ala increased significantly in r1 reproduction and survival are two dependent factors for biological fitness in each life history link limited resources need to be allocated optimally if the energy distribution of one link is raised the energy of another link must be reduced cody 1966 therefore changing energy allocation and metabolite utilization preferences are efficient ways for microorganisms to adapt to the antibiotic stress oshiki et al 2011 in addition increasing amino acid metabolites contributed to the synthesis of more proteins which were probably secreted to the extracellular matrix and became a part of eps thus the eps content of r1 increased by 6 3 in phase iii compared with that in phase i figure 1 all 343 and 95 metabolites were classified into six kegg first grade pathways while 64 and 31 metabolites among them were classified into metabolism in the positive ion channel pos and negative ion channel neg models respectively the dominant third pathways were purine metabolism pyrimidine metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism which belonged to two secondary pathways of nucleotide metabolism and amino acid metabolism figure 5d furthermore lin also altered the activity of key metabolic pathways to understand the metabolic differences between samples the pathway activity profiling papi algorithm was used to calculate metabolic pathway activities the activities of arginine and proline metabolism purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism were significantly higher than those of others the changes in metabolic pathways were reflected not only in the intracellular matrix but also in the extracellular matrix figure s5 comparing the functional metabolic pathways of edna and idna signaling molecules and interactions lipid metabolism and other amino acid metabolisms revealed significant p 0 05 differences in edna and idna 3 5 qs based regulation of the microbial utilization preference for metabolites qs is a ubiquitous interaction and communication pathway in microbial consortia that can regulate bacterial behavior by secreting signaling molecules shrout and nerenberg 2012 qs has been reported to be beneficial for microorganisms to resist environmental stress by increasing eps secretion zhang et al 2020 recently more studies have proposed that qs is also an important regulatory approach for anaob under environmental stress guo et al 2021 metagenomic analysis suggested that the abundances of genes related to signal transduction in r1 showed a gradually increasing trend during the experimental period figure 5 moreover the abundances of metabolites related to signaling metabolic pathways were significantly lower in phase iii than in the initial phase these results indicated that the signal conduction ability among microorganisms was enhanced with lin concentration implying an increase in metabolite utilization goo et al 2015 meanwhile the abundances of genes in amino acid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism increased with the lin concentration and the key functional genes hdh and nirs in nitrogen metabolism also increased combined with the metabolomic analysis the preference of microorganisms to metabolic amino acids was changed figure s7 the abundance of tyramine a precursor of tyrosine increased by 12 73 in phase iii in contrast the abundances of l proline and l glutamate decreased microorganisms use cheap or readily available amino acids due to the low cost of their synthesis especially under environmental stress costly amino acids are ubiquitous in rarely expressed proteins while cheap amino acids are ubiquitous in highly expressed proteins swire 2007 the central law of genetics holds that genetic information multiplies at each stage and it consumes more energy or cellular resources than the previous one gao et al 2021 therefore reducing the utilization of tyrosine costly amino acids and switching to proline and glutamate cheap amino acids could be beneficial for microbial survival under antibiotic stress overall the above results prove that qs regulation affected ecological interactions through the exchange of nearby signal molecules or metabolites allen et al 2016 4 conclusions the anammox system exhibited a remarkable tolerance to the long term stress of lin in this study and adaptation mechanisms of anammox consortia were elucidated based on multiomic analyses microorganisms in the anammox system adapted to antibiotic stress by changing the interspecific interactions and the preference of microbial metabolites through qs regulation the altered interspecific interactions were also closely related to the complex horizontal transfer of args and mges at the genetic level microorganisms regulated the efficiency and pathway of args transfer via the crispr system and global regulatory genes enabling them to stably grow in an antibiotic stressed condition this study provides a new insight of using genetic engineering technology to modify bacterial behaviors in anammox system facilitating its stable and full scale development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

14774,scaling of calcium sulfate caso4 is a stumbling block to the development of membrane distillation md which holds promise for the treatment of saline water wastewater despite increasing efforts made to understand the scaling behavior of caso4 in a process of md and thereby develop strategies for mitigating the negative effects considerable uncertainty remains about occurrence of the wetting and structural damage that could result from the strong crystal membrane interactions this study combined experimental and theoretical approaches to corroborate that a higher degree of supersaturation could be achieved by concentrating the caso4 in the feed at a faster rate the elevated supersaturation would be in favor of exerting substantially high crystallization pressure on the membrane structures in particular the theoretical analysis established two dimensionless groups for measuring the relative importance of the concentration effect and quantifying the essential role played by the crystalline growth respectively in addition to alleviating the uncertainty this study would be beneficial to the design of md processes with improved scaling resistance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation calcium sulfate scaling induced wetting concentration effect crystal membrane interactions crystallization model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction application of membrane distillation md to the treatment of saline water wastewater is plagued by the scaling phenomenon alkhudhiri et al 2012 drioli et al 2015 fortunato et al 2018 rezaei et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015 the advantage of improving the water recovery via an md based approach is limited by the high risk of concentrating sparingly soluble salts to a high degree of supersaturation at which crystalline particles could rapidly grow and deposit on the membrane surface in contrast to alkaline salts e g calcium carbonate it is usually ineffective to inhibit the formation of gypsum i e calcium sulfate dihydrate caso4 2h2o by adjusting ph of the feed gryta 2009 hamdona and al hadad 2007 lin et al 2011 the risk of scaling is substantially increased for the caso4 containing feed whose temperature is elevated to create a difference of vapor pressure across the hydrophobic membrane since the exothermic dissolution of gypsum can result in a decrease in the solubility gryta 2008 although considerable efforts have been made to investigate the scaling behavior of caso4 in md only a limited number of studies directed attention to the complex crystal membrane interactions that could be the essential mechanisms accounting for the scaling induced wetting and irreversible damage of the membrane structures establishing correlations between the threshold of crystallization and the operating conditions constituted a focus of early studies on the scaling of caso4 in md the experimental measurements were usually based on the concept of induction period dai et al 2022 huang et al 2020 lancia et al 1999 lin et al 2011 sohnel et al 1988 warsinger et al 2017 which is technically dependent on the ability of detecting the initial appearance of crystals after creating a supersaturation for example he et al he et al 2009b determined the onset of forming gypsum in the feed for an md process by monitoring the variation in the concentration of calcium ions while refilling the feed to match the conceptual requirement of a constant supersaturation although the pioneering study by he et al confirmed the deposition of gypsum on the membrane surface the characterization indicated that no significant decrease in the vapor flux resulted from the scaling of caso4 this observation was in contrast to most of subsequent investigations that reported not only a severe flux decline christie et al 2020 liu et al 2021a nghiem and cath 2011 shirazi et al 2010 srisurichan et al 2006 but also the associated wetting and even structural damage christie et al 2020 gryta 2009 he et al 2008 karanikola et al 2018 liu et al 2022a liu et al 2022b of the hydrophobic membrane various strategies have been explored to address the challenges in mitigating negative effects of the scaling of caso4 on the efficiency of md in addition to the use of antiscalants he et al 2009a huang et al 2020 yin et al 2021 it is of particular interest to tailor the hydrophobic membrane with novel physicochemical characteristics that can substantially delay the nucleation of caso4 for example karanikola et al karanikola et al 2018 proposed a hydrophobic membrane with an engineered slippery surface confirming that a higher energetic barrier of nucleation could be created by enhancing the hydrophobicity and lowering the surface porosity nevertheless the performance evaluation of the slippery membrane actually affirmed that achieving a relatively low potential of nucleation could not eliminate downsides emanating from the occurrence of scaling that is when crystalline particles of gypsum were inevitably formed after a longer induction period and deposited on the surface of the slippery membrane a considerable decline in the vapor flux was still observed and almost immediately followed by the increase in electrical conductivity of the distillate i e an indicator of the occurrence of pore wetting in comparison with the occurrence of scaling induced flux decline in md experimental results in the literature exhibited higher uncertainty on whether the hydrophobic membrane could be wetted owing to the growth and deposition of gypsum particles an example of the uncertainty can be given by comparing two studies on the scaling of caso4 in md with similar operating conditions peng et al peng et al 2015 employed a brine of reverse osmosis containing caso4 of 1 8 g l and other salts such as sodium chloride nacl as the feed that was continuously concentrated by md the feed and distillate temperatures were maintained at 77 c and 35 c respectively liu et al liu et al 2021a directly dissolved gypsum in deionized water to form a feed solution solely containing caso4 1 6 g l for an md process performed with a transmembrane temperature difference of 40 c despite the similarity in the initial concentration of caso4 the hydrophobic membrane was wetted owing to the formation of gypsum in the former case whereas the latter reported a negligible variation in electrical conductivity of the distillate this comparison is inconsistent with the knowledge that the mixture of salts should have a lower potential of forming gypsum since the presence of nacl and other salts could increase the solubility of caso4 li and demopoulos 2005 zhang et al 2013 another example of the uncertainty can be found in an early study by gryta gryta 2009 that applied md to the concentration of various saline solutions in a stage wise way in the first stage of md fresh water was drawn from a boiled wastewater of 3 2 l containing caso4 of 0 96 g l and other salts such as nacl until a sharp increase in electrical conductivity of the distillate was detected after removing the crystalline particles of gypsum the retentate 2 0 l of the first stage was used as the feed containing caso4 of 0 92 g l and other salts in the second stage of md the md based concentration was stopped when the hydrophobic membrane was wetted again the interesting observation was that the wetted membrane in the second stage could not be restored owing to the structural damage the irreversible damage indicated stronger crystal membrane interactions occurring in the second stage though both the stages of md were initiated with approximately equal concentrations of caso4 and performed under the same conditions the dynamical aspect of crystal membrane interactions in md was analyzed by liu et al liu et al 2022a indicating that the membrane structures could be initially stretched and subsequently compressed by the growing crystals the study by christie et al christie et al 2020 proposed to quantify the strength of crystal membrane interactions in terms of the crystallization pressure which is defined to quantify the thermodynamical equilibrium between the loaded crystalline faces and the squeezed liquid film steiger 2005 when recognizing the negative effects of concentration and temperature polarization it is reasonable to simplify the analysis by assuming a direct dependence of the crystallization pressure on the degree of supersaturation in feed bulk that should be continuously varied by the competition between the concentration and crystallization therefore this study was motivated to ascertain the role played by the concentration rate in changing the crystal membrane interactions via both experimental and theoretical approaches in particular the scaling of caso4 in md was systematically characterized by setting either the vapor flux or the feed volume at different levels thereby varying the concentration rate while the dependence of the achievable maximum concentration amc of caso4 on the concentration rate was corroborated by modeling the nucleation and growth of gypsum in combination with an md process 2 experimental procedures and theoretical modeling 2 1 in situ and ex situ characterization of the scaling induced wetting the direct contact mode ashoor et al 2016 lawson and lloyd 1996 was employed to implement a series of md processes with an apparatus described in the prior studies liu et al 2021b 2022b the filtration cell accommodated a commercial composite membrane annuo zhejiang china composed of a hydrophobic top layer polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and a relatively hydrophilic substrate polyethylene terephthalate pet providing an effective area of 34 cm2 when fixing the feed temperature at 60 c the transmembrane temperature difference was varied in different tests by setting the distillate temperature at 20 c 30 c and 40 c the distillate container 2000 ml was continuously weighed to estimate the volume of water drawn from the feed the volumetric concentration factor vcf was evaluated as the ratio of the initial feed volume v 0 set at 500 ml 1000 ml and 2000 ml in different tests to the reduced feed volume v at a specific time after achieving a stabilized vapor flux sodium sulfate na2so4 aladdin and calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o shanghai lingfeng china were mixed into the feed to form a supersaturated solution of caso4 3 5 g l the saturation index si defined as the logarithmic ratio of the ionic activity product to the solubility product christie et al 2020 for the fresh feed was determined as 0 15 using the geochemical code of phreeqc christie et al 2020 kiefer et al 2019 yin et al 2022 the formation of gypsum in the feed bulk was in situ monitored via two different approaches on the one hand a system of fourier domain optical coherence tomography oct ganymede iii hr thorlabs usa was employed to estimate the probability of finding crystals pfcs in terms of the fraction of crystal dominated voxels at a specific height above the membrane surface details available in supporting information si method s 1 or refer to prior studies on the oct based characterization for membrane processes li et al 2016 li et al 2023 liu et al 2020 shang et al 2020 wong et al 2021 on the other hand the salt concentrations were estimated using a conductivity meter mettler toledo model no fe38 details available in si method s 2 in particular the electrical conductivity on the distillate side was also monitored to indicate the occurrence of wetting the duration of each of the in situ measurements was dependent on how long a significant increase in electrical conductivity of the distillate was observed after the onset of scaling after stopping the md process all the scaled membranes were carefully washed with fresh water and sonicated in a water bath of 50 c kq 500de kunshan china to remove the deposited gypsum the structural damage was then examined by the characterizations of both scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su3800 japan and oct in a complementary sense in particular the oct datasets were exploited to create depth profiles of surface averaged intensity sai which correlated the structural damage with the variations in the local reflectance details available in si method s 3 on the other hand the regenerated i e cleaned and dried at 50 c membrane was tested again in an md process with the feed and distillate temperatures set at 60 c and 30 c respectively nacl guangzhou chemistry reagent china was added into the deionized water to prepare a salt containing feed 11 7 g l while the electrical conductivity was monitored to indicate the occurrence of wetting 2 2 formulating the crystallization in an md process when ignoring the secondary nucleation resulting from the crystals existing in the feed hoang et al 2007 it is assumed that the primary nucleation dominate the formation of gypsum and the linear growth be characterized by the length l of the needle like gypsum crystals antony et al 2011 he et al 2008 on the one hand the rate of primary nucleation b is related with the relative supersaturation s c c e c e c e denotes the solubility as follows 1 b k b exp β ln 2 s 1 where k b is the rate coefficient of primary nucleation and β is a thermodynamical parameter lumping the effects of the temperature and the interfacial tension barbier et al 2009 on the other hand the rate of linear growth g is empirically estimated by a power law barbier et al 2009 kobari et al 2010 2011 sarkar et al 2006 2 g d l d t k g s g where k g is the temperature dependent rate coefficient of linear growth and g is the order of linear growth the population balance in a feed volume of v can be implemented in terms of the population density function n l t i e the number of crystals having a characteristic size l per unit volume of solvent thereby correlating the primary nucleation and the linear growth as follows 3 d v n l t d t v n l d l d t n t q n v b δ l l 0 where q is the flow rate of vapor in md and the contribution of nucleation is restricted by the dirac delta function δ with a shift of the initial size l 0 i e the characteristic size of nuclei barbier et al 2009 the i th moment μ i of the crystal size distribution csd is defined as 4 μ i 0 l i n l t d l note that μ 3 should be proportional to the specific volume of crystals when assuming a constant volumetric shape factor k v v c l 3 v c denotes the volume of a crystal therefore the variation in amount of caso4 in the liquid phase owing to the formation of crystals having a density of ρ c can be formulated as 5 d v c d t d v ρ c k v μ 3 d t this relationship can be further recast into details available in si method s 4 6 d c d t ρ c k v 3 g μ 2 b l 0 3 q v c the moment based technique details available in si method s 5 was employed to numerically solve the differential equations and thereby obtain the concentration of caso4 in the feed as a function of time 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlating the scaling induced wetting with the concentration rate varying the transmembrane temperature difference from 20 c to 40 c increased the initial vapor flux from 18 lmh to 40 lmh as demonstrated in fig 1 a when the feed volume was fixed at 1000 ml the increased vapor flux should give rise to a higher concentration rate which is corroborated by comparing the variations in the vcf as a function of time in fig 1b moreover the degrees of both the polarized concentration and temperature profiles could also be substantially varied as the convective transfer toward the membrane surface was intensified or weakened note that the concentration polarization should be coupled with the temperature polarization to change the heterogeneous nucleation of caso4 in opposite ways although the effect of concentrating the crystallizing species was alleviated by the decreased temperature owing to the retrograde solubility there could be different potentials of nucleation at the feed membrane interface as indicated by the interfacial concentrations of caso4 and the corresponding values of si listed in fig 1a theoretically estimated in terms of si method s 6 the prediction is consistent with the bulk crystallization that was monitored by the oct and is quantified by the temporal evolution of pfcs in the feed bulk fig 1c achieving a higher value of pfcs at the steady state also indicates that the degree of supersaturation could be more effectively increased to favor the nucleation in comparison with the growth brandse et al 1977 liu et al 2022b the amount of caso4 in the feed bulk was oppositely varied by the concentration and crystallization thereby giving rise to a maximum which is confirmed by the measured feed conductivity fig 2 a and the estimated concentration of caso4 fig 2b it clearly shows that the amc is raised by implementing the md with a faster rate of removing water from the feed this observation not only corroborates the different aqueous environment for the nucleation and growth but also indicates that the greatest strength of crystal membrane interactions could be considerably varied owing to the change in the concentration rate the varied crystal membrane interactions can be quantified by calculating the crystallization pressure associated with the amc in terms of the study by christie et al christie et al 2020 the calculation results indicate that the fastest concentration rate could enable a crystallization pressure of 11 3 mpa which was 1 mpa higher than that for the lowest concentration rate the measurements of distillate conductivity fig 2c provide direct evidence that the membrane structures could interact with the growing crystals in different ways that is all the md processes resulted in a wetted hydrophobic membrane except for the one with the lowest transmembrane temperature difference 20 c where the distillate conductivity was not significantly increased a further examination was implemented by testing the regenerated membranes in an md process with an nacl containing feed when plotting the distillate conductivity as a function of time fig 2d it is interesting to note that the membrane wetted in the md process with the highest transmembrane temperature difference 40 c could not be restored to an effective barrier for the nacl containing feed a reasonable explanation is that the crystal membrane interactions resulting from the fastest concentration rate could be sufficiently strong to cause irreversible damage to the membrane structures 3 2 ascertaining the relative importance of varying the concentration rate when varying the vapor flux of md both the phenomena of concentration and polarization could synergistically contribute to the changes in the aqueous environment where the saturated caso4 formed nuclei and grew to a size comparable to that characterizing the porous structures of the hydrophobic membrane in order to decouple the concentration effect from the polarization phenomena the concentration rate was also varied by setting the initial volume of the feed solution at different values while fixing the transmembrane temperature difference at 30 c to yield the same initial vapor flux thereby maintaining the degree of polarizing the concentration and temperature profiles on the membrane surface as demonstrated by the plots of the vcf as a function of time in fig 3 a changing the initial feed volume can vary the concentration rate in a similar way to that achieved by setting the vapor flux at a different value the associated variations in the distillate conductivity are plotted in fig 3b to indicate whether the hydrophobic membrane was wetted owing to the scaling in comparison with the cases where the initial vapor flux was decreased from 27 lmh to 18 lmh while fixing the initial feed volume at 1000 ml as shown by the plots denoted in blue in fig 1 increasing the initial feed volume from 1000 ml to 2000 ml while fixing the initial vapor flux at 27 lmh changed the concentration rate to a relatively low level despite the slower concentration rate it is interesting to note that the hydrophobic membrane was wetted after a longer period this discrepancy can be an indication that the effect of concentration polarization should not be ignored in the context of raising the local supersaturation of caso4 in the boundary layer in contrast decreasing the initial feed volume from 1000 ml to 500 ml while fixing the initial vapor flux at 27 lmh not only resulted in the wetting as indicated by the result plotted in fig 3b but also gave rise to structural damage that could not be restored by cleaning and drying the scaled membrane as indicated by the result plotted in fig 3c in order to further validate the irreversible damage to the membrane structures the regenerated membranes were examined in terms of both the direct imaging of sem and the sai profiles created from the oct scans the sem images obtained at three different regions on the membrane surface are shown in the upper panel of figs 4 a to 4c for the cases with different initial feed volumes respectively it is evident that the fastest concentration rate could be in favor of achieving a higher degree of supersaturation and thereby creating a crystallization pressure sufficiently strong to deform the polymeric network beyond the yield point guo et al 2022 lynn et al 2020 in addition to the damage on the membrane surface the penetration of the growing crystals through the hydrophobic layer 20 μm is confirmed by comparing the sai profiles in the bottom panel of fig 4a that is in comparison with the

value of r g this observation explains why the concentration of caso4 can achieve a relatively high value when concentrating the caso4 in the feed with a faster rate the dependence of the amc on the

14774,scaling of calcium sulfate caso4 is a stumbling block to the development of membrane distillation md which holds promise for the treatment of saline water wastewater despite increasing efforts made to understand the scaling behavior of caso4 in a process of md and thereby develop strategies for mitigating the negative effects considerable uncertainty remains about occurrence of the wetting and structural damage that could result from the strong crystal membrane interactions this study combined experimental and theoretical approaches to corroborate that a higher degree of supersaturation could be achieved by concentrating the caso4 in the feed at a faster rate the elevated supersaturation would be in favor of exerting substantially high crystallization pressure on the membrane structures in particular the theoretical analysis established two dimensionless groups for measuring the relative importance of the concentration effect and quantifying the essential role played by the crystalline growth respectively in addition to alleviating the uncertainty this study would be beneficial to the design of md processes with improved scaling resistance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation calcium sulfate scaling induced wetting concentration effect crystal membrane interactions crystallization model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction application of membrane distillation md to the treatment of saline water wastewater is plagued by the scaling phenomenon alkhudhiri et al 2012 drioli et al 2015 fortunato et al 2018 rezaei et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015 the advantage of improving the water recovery via an md based approach is limited by the high risk of concentrating sparingly soluble salts to a high degree of supersaturation at which crystalline particles could rapidly grow and deposit on the membrane surface in contrast to alkaline salts e g calcium carbonate it is usually ineffective to inhibit the formation of gypsum i e calcium sulfate dihydrate caso4 2h2o by adjusting ph of the feed gryta 2009 hamdona and al hadad 2007 lin et al 2011 the risk of scaling is substantially increased for the caso4 containing feed whose temperature is elevated to create a difference of vapor pressure across the hydrophobic membrane since the exothermic dissolution of gypsum can result in a decrease in the solubility gryta 2008 although considerable efforts have been made to investigate the scaling behavior of caso4 in md only a limited number of studies directed attention to the complex crystal membrane interactions that could be the essential mechanisms accounting for the scaling induced wetting and irreversible damage of the membrane structures establishing correlations between the threshold of crystallization and the operating conditions constituted a focus of early studies on the scaling of caso4 in md the experimental measurements were usually based on the concept of induction period dai et al 2022 huang et al 2020 lancia et al 1999 lin et al 2011 sohnel et al 1988 warsinger et al 2017 which is technically dependent on the ability of detecting the initial appearance of crystals after creating a supersaturation for example he et al he et al 2009b determined the onset of forming gypsum in the feed for an md process by monitoring the variation in the concentration of calcium ions while refilling the feed to match the conceptual requirement of a constant supersaturation although the pioneering study by he et al confirmed the deposition of gypsum on the membrane surface the characterization indicated that no significant decrease in the vapor flux resulted from the scaling of caso4 this observation was in contrast to most of subsequent investigations that reported not only a severe flux decline christie et al 2020 liu et al 2021a nghiem and cath 2011 shirazi et al 2010 srisurichan et al 2006 but also the associated wetting and even structural damage christie et al 2020 gryta 2009 he et al 2008 karanikola et al 2018 liu et al 2022a liu et al 2022b of the hydrophobic membrane various strategies have been explored to address the challenges in mitigating negative effects of the scaling of caso4 on the efficiency of md in addition to the use of antiscalants he et al 2009a huang et al 2020 yin et al 2021 it is of particular interest to tailor the hydrophobic membrane with novel physicochemical characteristics that can substantially delay the nucleation of caso4 for example karanikola et al karanikola et al 2018 proposed a hydrophobic membrane with an engineered slippery surface confirming that a higher energetic barrier of nucleation could be created by enhancing the hydrophobicity and lowering the surface porosity nevertheless the performance evaluation of the slippery membrane actually affirmed that achieving a relatively low potential of nucleation could not eliminate downsides emanating from the occurrence of scaling that is when crystalline particles of gypsum were inevitably formed after a longer induction period and deposited on the surface of the slippery membrane a considerable decline in the vapor flux was still observed and almost immediately followed by the increase in electrical conductivity of the distillate i e an indicator of the occurrence of pore wetting in comparison with the occurrence of scaling induced flux decline in md experimental results in the literature exhibited higher uncertainty on whether the hydrophobic membrane could be wetted owing to the growth and deposition of gypsum particles an example of the uncertainty can be given by comparing two studies on the scaling of caso4 in md with similar operating conditions peng et al peng et al 2015 employed a brine of reverse osmosis containing caso4 of 1 8 g l and other salts such as sodium chloride nacl as the feed that was continuously concentrated by md the feed and distillate temperatures were maintained at 77 c and 35 c respectively liu et al liu et al 2021a directly dissolved gypsum in deionized water to form a feed solution solely containing caso4 1 6 g l for an md process performed with a transmembrane temperature difference of 40 c despite the similarity in the initial concentration of caso4 the hydrophobic membrane was wetted owing to the formation of gypsum in the former case whereas the latter reported a negligible variation in electrical conductivity of the distillate this comparison is inconsistent with the knowledge that the mixture of salts should have a lower potential of forming gypsum since the presence of nacl and other salts could increase the solubility of caso4 li and demopoulos 2005 zhang et al 2013 another example of the uncertainty can be found in an early study by gryta gryta 2009 that applied md to the concentration of various saline solutions in a stage wise way in the first stage of md fresh water was drawn from a boiled wastewater of 3 2 l containing caso4 of 0 96 g l and other salts such as nacl until a sharp increase in electrical conductivity of the distillate was detected after removing the crystalline particles of gypsum the retentate 2 0 l of the first stage was used as the feed containing caso4 of 0 92 g l and other salts in the second stage of md the md based concentration was stopped when the hydrophobic membrane was wetted again the interesting observation was that the wetted membrane in the second stage could not be restored owing to the structural damage the irreversible damage indicated stronger crystal membrane interactions occurring in the second stage though both the stages of md were initiated with approximately equal concentrations of caso4 and performed under the same conditions the dynamical aspect of crystal membrane interactions in md was analyzed by liu et al liu et al 2022a indicating that the membrane structures could be initially stretched and subsequently compressed by the growing crystals the study by christie et al christie et al 2020 proposed to quantify the strength of crystal membrane interactions in terms of the crystallization pressure which is defined to quantify the thermodynamical equilibrium between the loaded crystalline faces and the squeezed liquid film steiger 2005 when recognizing the negative effects of concentration and temperature polarization it is reasonable to simplify the analysis by assuming a direct dependence of the crystallization pressure on the degree of supersaturation in feed bulk that should be continuously varied by the competition between the concentration and crystallization therefore this study was motivated to ascertain the role played by the concentration rate in changing the crystal membrane interactions via both experimental and theoretical approaches in particular the scaling of caso4 in md was systematically characterized by setting either the vapor flux or the feed volume at different levels thereby varying the concentration rate while the dependence of the achievable maximum concentration amc of caso4 on the concentration rate was corroborated by modeling the nucleation and growth of gypsum in combination with an md process 2 experimental procedures and theoretical modeling 2 1 in situ and ex situ characterization of the scaling induced wetting the direct contact mode ashoor et al 2016 lawson and lloyd 1996 was employed to implement a series of md processes with an apparatus described in the prior studies liu et al 2021b 2022b the filtration cell accommodated a commercial composite membrane annuo zhejiang china composed of a hydrophobic top layer polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and a relatively hydrophilic substrate polyethylene terephthalate pet providing an effective area of 34 cm2 when fixing the feed temperature at 60 c the transmembrane temperature difference was varied in different tests by setting the distillate temperature at 20 c 30 c and 40 c the distillate container 2000 ml was continuously weighed to estimate the volume of water drawn from the feed the volumetric concentration factor vcf was evaluated as the ratio of the initial feed volume v 0 set at 500 ml 1000 ml and 2000 ml in different tests to the reduced feed volume v at a specific time after achieving a stabilized vapor flux sodium sulfate na2so4 aladdin and calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o shanghai lingfeng china were mixed into the feed to form a supersaturated solution of caso4 3 5 g l the saturation index si defined as the logarithmic ratio of the ionic activity product to the solubility product christie et al 2020 for the fresh feed was determined as 0 15 using the geochemical code of phreeqc christie et al 2020 kiefer et al 2019 yin et al 2022 the formation of gypsum in the feed bulk was in situ monitored via two different approaches on the one hand a system of fourier domain optical coherence tomography oct ganymede iii hr thorlabs usa was employed to estimate the probability of finding crystals pfcs in terms of the fraction of crystal dominated voxels at a specific height above the membrane surface details available in supporting information si method s 1 or refer to prior studies on the oct based characterization for membrane processes li et al 2016 li et al 2023 liu et al 2020 shang et al 2020 wong et al 2021 on the other hand the salt concentrations were estimated using a conductivity meter mettler toledo model no fe38 details available in si method s 2 in particular the electrical conductivity on the distillate side was also monitored to indicate the occurrence of wetting the duration of each of the in situ measurements was dependent on how long a significant increase in electrical conductivity of the distillate was observed after the onset of scaling after stopping the md process all the scaled membranes were carefully washed with fresh water and sonicated in a water bath of 50 c kq 500de kunshan china to remove the deposited gypsum the structural damage was then examined by the characterizations of both scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su3800 japan and oct in a complementary sense in particular the oct datasets were exploited to create depth profiles of surface averaged intensity sai which correlated the structural damage with the variations in the local reflectance details available in si method s 3 on the other hand the regenerated i e cleaned and dried at 50 c membrane was tested again in an md process with the feed and distillate temperatures set at 60 c and 30 c respectively nacl guangzhou chemistry reagent china was added into the deionized water to prepare a salt containing feed 11 7 g l while the electrical conductivity was monitored to indicate the occurrence of wetting 2 2 formulating the crystallization in an md process when ignoring the secondary nucleation resulting from the crystals existing in the feed hoang et al 2007 it is assumed that the primary nucleation dominate the formation of gypsum and the linear growth be characterized by the length l of the needle like gypsum crystals antony et al 2011 he et al 2008 on the one hand the rate of primary nucleation b is related with the relative supersaturation s c c e c e c e denotes the solubility as follows 1 b k b exp β ln 2 s 1 where k b is the rate coefficient of primary nucleation and β is a thermodynamical parameter lumping the effects of the temperature and the interfacial tension barbier et al 2009 on the other hand the rate of linear growth g is empirically estimated by a power law barbier et al 2009 kobari et al 2010 2011 sarkar et al 2006 2 g d l d t k g s g where k g is the temperature dependent rate coefficient of linear growth and g is the order of linear growth the population balance in a feed volume of v can be implemented in terms of the population density function n l t i e the number of crystals having a characteristic size l per unit volume of solvent thereby correlating the primary nucleation and the linear growth as follows 3 d v n l t d t v n l d l d t n t q n v b δ l l 0 where q is the flow rate of vapor in md and the contribution of nucleation is restricted by the dirac delta function δ with a shift of the initial size l 0 i e the characteristic size of nuclei barbier et al 2009 the i th moment μ i of the crystal size distribution csd is defined as 4 μ i 0 l i n l t d l note that μ 3 should be proportional to the specific volume of crystals when assuming a constant volumetric shape factor k v v c l 3 v c denotes the volume of a crystal therefore the variation in amount of caso4 in the liquid phase owing to the formation of crystals having a density of ρ c can be formulated as 5 d v c d t d v ρ c k v μ 3 d t this relationship can be further recast into details available in si method s 4 6 d c d t ρ c k v 3 g μ 2 b l 0 3 q v c the moment based technique details available in si method s 5 was employed to numerically solve the differential equations and thereby obtain the concentration of caso4 in the feed as a function of time 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlating the scaling induced wetting with the concentration rate varying the transmembrane temperature difference from 20 c to 40 c increased the initial vapor flux from 18 lmh to 40 lmh as demonstrated in fig 1 a when the feed volume was fixed at 1000 ml the increased vapor flux should give rise to a higher concentration rate which is corroborated by comparing the variations in the vcf as a function of time in fig 1b moreover the degrees of both the polarized concentration and temperature profiles could also be substantially varied as the convective transfer toward the membrane surface was intensified or weakened note that the concentration polarization should be coupled with the temperature polarization to change the heterogeneous nucleation of caso4 in opposite ways although the effect of concentrating the crystallizing species was alleviated by the decreased temperature owing to the retrograde solubility there could be different potentials of nucleation at the feed membrane interface as indicated by the interfacial concentrations of caso4 and the corresponding values of si listed in fig 1a theoretically estimated in terms of si method s 6 the prediction is consistent with the bulk crystallization that was monitored by the oct and is quantified by the temporal evolution of pfcs in the feed bulk fig 1c achieving a higher value of pfcs at the steady state also indicates that the degree of supersaturation could be more effectively increased to favor the nucleation in comparison with the growth brandse et al 1977 liu et al 2022b the amount of caso4 in the feed bulk was oppositely varied by the concentration and crystallization thereby giving rise to a maximum which is confirmed by the measured feed conductivity fig 2 a and the estimated concentration of caso4 fig 2b it clearly shows that the amc is raised by implementing the md with a faster rate of removing water from the feed this observation not only corroborates the different aqueous environment for the nucleation and growth but also indicates that the greatest strength of crystal membrane interactions could be considerably varied owing to the change in the concentration rate the varied crystal membrane interactions can be quantified by calculating the crystallization pressure associated with the amc in terms of the study by christie et al christie et al 2020 the calculation results indicate that the fastest concentration rate could enable a crystallization pressure of 11 3 mpa which was 1 mpa higher than that for the lowest concentration rate the measurements of distillate conductivity fig 2c provide direct evidence that the membrane structures could interact with the growing crystals in different ways that is all the md processes resulted in a wetted hydrophobic membrane except for the one with the lowest transmembrane temperature difference 20 c where the distillate conductivity was not significantly increased a further examination was implemented by testing the regenerated membranes in an md process with an nacl containing feed when plotting the distillate conductivity as a function of time fig 2d it is interesting to note that the membrane wetted in the md process with the highest transmembrane temperature difference 40 c could not be restored to an effective barrier for the nacl containing feed a reasonable explanation is that the crystal membrane interactions resulting from the fastest concentration rate could be sufficiently strong to cause irreversible damage to the membrane structures 3 2 ascertaining the relative importance of varying the concentration rate when varying the vapor flux of md both the phenomena of concentration and polarization could synergistically contribute to the changes in the aqueous environment where the saturated caso4 formed nuclei and grew to a size comparable to that characterizing the porous structures of the hydrophobic membrane in order to decouple the concentration effect from the polarization phenomena the concentration rate was also varied by setting the initial volume of the feed solution at different values while fixing the transmembrane temperature difference at 30 c to yield the same initial vapor flux thereby maintaining the degree of polarizing the concentration and temperature profiles on the membrane surface as demonstrated by the plots of the vcf as a function of time in fig 3 a changing the initial feed volume can vary the concentration rate in a similar way to that achieved by setting the vapor flux at a different value the associated variations in the distillate conductivity are plotted in fig 3b to indicate whether the hydrophobic membrane was wetted owing to the scaling in comparison with the cases where the initial vapor flux was decreased from 27 lmh to 18 lmh while fixing the initial feed volume at 1000 ml as shown by the plots denoted in blue in fig 1 increasing the initial feed volume from 1000 ml to 2000 ml while fixing the initial vapor flux at 27 lmh changed the concentration rate to a relatively low level despite the slower concentration rate it is interesting to note that the hydrophobic membrane was wetted after a longer period this discrepancy can be an indication that the effect of concentration polarization should not be ignored in the context of raising the local supersaturation of caso4 in the boundary layer in contrast decreasing the initial feed volume from 1000 ml to 500 ml while fixing the initial vapor flux at 27 lmh not only resulted in the wetting as indicated by the result plotted in fig 3b but also gave rise to structural damage that could not be restored by cleaning and drying the scaled membrane as indicated by the result plotted in fig 3c in order to further validate the irreversible damage to the membrane structures the regenerated membranes were examined in terms of both the direct imaging of sem and the sai profiles created from the oct scans the sem images obtained at three different regions on the membrane surface are shown in the upper panel of figs 4 a to 4c for the cases with different initial feed volumes respectively it is evident that the fastest concentration rate could be in favor of achieving a higher degree of
