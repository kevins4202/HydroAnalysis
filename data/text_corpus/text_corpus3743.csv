18715,the raw fresh leachate from municipal solid waste msw incineration plants contains high concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfas ammonia and metals all compounds that severely limit anaerobic digestion treatment efficiencies these inhibitory compounds make reactor systems unstable causing reactor start up periods to take more than 100 days even when the leachate is diluted significantly in this study granular activated carbon gac was incorporated into a bioreactor fed with raw incineration leachate addition of gac allowed direct treatment of raw incineration leachate without any start up acclimation period while the non amended control reactor soured immediately and collapsed within 17 days when hydraulic retention time hrt of the gac amended reactor was stepwise decreased to increase organic loading rates olr to 25 0 kgcod m3 d cod removal efficiencies remained stable at 90 metagenomic analysis of the gac amended reactor revealed that geobacter and methanosarcina species known to participate in direct interspecies electron transfer diet were more abundant in the gac amended reactor than the seed sludge in addition the abundance of genes coding for proteins thought to be involved in diet such as electrically conductive pili and the outer membrane c type cytochrome omcs increased significantly while genes involved in fermentation and nitrate narg and sulfate dsra reduction dropped significantly as the experiment progressed these results are significant because this is the first detailed investigation into the metabolic capabilities of microbial communities involved in efficient treatment of raw incineration leachate within biomethanogenic reactors that did not require a long start up period graphical abstract image 1 keywords incineration leachate granular activated carbon direct interspecies electron transfer methanogenesis metagenomic analysis 1 introduction in some countries the availability of non developed land makes landfilling a cost effective way to dispose of municipal solid waste msw de feo and de gisi 2014 however as the world becomes increasingly populated space for landfills is becoming scarce particularly in such chinese cities as beijing and shanghai lu et al 2015 in addition to limited space there are also many environmental hazards associated with landfills these include leaching of contaminants into groundwater and the generation of greenhouse gas emissions by landfills treating msw lou and nair 2009 mor et al 2006 these factors have motivated many cities in china to minimize the use of landfills and to start treating msw with incineration in fact the proportion of msw being treated by incineration increased from 7 in 2004 to 35 in 2017 cheng and hu 2010 wang et al 2018 and it is expected to increase to 40 in 2020 according to 13th five year ecological environmental protection plan promulgated by central committee of the communist party of china 2016 msw in china contains a high proportion of kitchen waste nie 2008 with high moisture content in order for incineration to work effectively water content needs to be reduced by storing msw in bunkers for 3 7 days prior to incineration nie 2008 ye et al 2011 during this storage period a considerable amount of fresh leachate 5 28 of the volume of the msw with high salinity 15 000 mg l high chemical oxygen demand cod usually 50 000 mg l and high ammonia concentrations usually 500 mg l is generated nie 2008 ye et al 2011 other harmful constituents that can become concentrated in the leachate include heavy metals e g pb ni zn and complex biorefractory organic compounds such as humic substances polyaromatic hydrocarbons adsorbable organic halogens and polychlorinated biphenyls nie 2008 wiszniowski et al 2006 some of these metals can also form chelates with humic acids and other toxic organic compounds making them more accessible for uptake into microbial cells adamo et al 2018 pang et al 2018 and inhibiting growth of microorganisms involved in the biological treatment of incineration leachate dang et al 2013 ye et al 2011 in many msw incineration plants incineration leachate gets treated anaerobically in biomethanogenic reactors nie 2008 frequently the toxic nature of incineration leachate impairs reactor performance while methods to improve biomethanogenic treatment of diluted incineration leachate have been identified these same methods cannot effectively treat raw incineration leachate dang et al 2013 ye et al 2011 as production of leachate by msw incineration facilities continues to increase the need to develop methods for treatment of raw incineration leachate is becoming more important currently dilution of leachate requires vast amounts of fresh water resources elimination of this dilution step would not only be less wasteful it would also be less labor intensive and more cost effective in recent years it has been shown that stimulation of direct interspecies electron transfer diet between bacteria and methanogens through the addition of conductive materials enhances the performance of methanogenic bioreactors some of the non biological conductive materials that are known to promote diet include magnetite jing et al 2017 yin et al 2018 biochar zhao et al 2016a granular activated carbon gac lee et al 2016 park et al 2018b zhang et al 2017b zhao et al 2016b and carbon cloth lei et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 bacteria can either transfer electrons from the oxidation of organic compounds extracellularly to methanogens via diet or they can indirectly transfer electrons through hydrogen formate interspecies transfer hfit holmes and smith 2016 diet is significantly more efficient as electrons are not lost through diffusion lovley 2017 which explains why anaerobic digestion is enhanced when diet is stimulated recently it has been reported that addition of carbon cloth lei et al 2016 or magnetite lei et al 2018 into bioreactors fed diluted msw incineration leachate enhanced treatment efficiencies and methane production rates however these amended reactors could not operate efficiently when they were fed raw incineration leachate in order to optimize bioreactors treating complex waste like raw incineration leachate metabolic processes being carried out by microorganisms within the reactors need to be understood many of the organisms found in anaerobic digesters cannot be grown in culture and even for those that can be grown it is difficult to know how they are impacted by the presence of other organisms in the community some studies have used metagenomic analysis to show that organisms involved in diet are enriched in bioreactors that have been supplemented with conductive materials jing et al 2017 park et al 2018a yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a however these studies primarily focused on general trends in microbial community structure rather than changes in the metabolic potential of the community observed over time the use of metagenomic data for real time analysis of microbial genomes can provide considerably more information regarding how microbial communities respond to changes in their environment identification of genes linked to important functions will help provide nucleic acid signatures that can be used for quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr qrt pcr assays to monitor reactor stability for example detection of transcripts for genes known to code for certain electron transfer proteins might signal that bioreactors are running efficiently whereas transcripts for stress response genes i e sos response heat shock response oxidative stress and the stringent response genes could warn technicians that conditions need to be adjusted to avoid reactor souring the objective of this study was to determine whether the incorporation of gac into methanogenic bioreactors enables efficient treatment of raw incineration leachate which has been a bottleneck of leachate biotreatment metagenomic studies were also done to provide insight into how changes in olr can impact the dominant metabolic processes occurring in gac amended reactors and how they can influence which organisms are participating in diet this study identifies a number of genes that can be used for the development of qrt pcr assays to test reactor performance and it provides valuable insight into treatment of raw incineration leachate 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculated sludge and fresh leachate sludge was collected from a full scale up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor treating food wastewater in

a new tube dna was extracted from the supernatant with the fastdna kit for soil qbiogene ca according to the manufacturer s instructions a micro volume spectrophotometer nanodrop 2000 usa was used to analyze dna concentration and purity 2 5 metagenomic analysis 2 5 1 library preparation and sequencing four sequencing libraries containing unique indexed paired end adaptors were constructed with the neb next ultratm dna library prep kit for illumina new england biolabs usa following the manufacturer s recommendations illumina library quality was assessed with the qubit 3 0 fluorometer bio rad and agilent 4200 system prior to sequencing on an illumina hiseq x ten platform illumia san diego usa by magigene biotechnology co ltd guangdong china 2 5 2 assembly of illumina reads all of the raw sequencing and qc filtered data were quality checked with fastqc http www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects fastqc initial raw non filtered forward and reverse metagenomic sequencing libraries contained an average of 44 007 849 reads that were 150 basepairs long sequences from all of the libraries were trimmed and filtered with trimmomatic software resulting in 20 991 777 quality reads per metagenomic sequencing library these paired end reads were then merged with flash and this generated 20 283 782 5 reads per library all metagenomic sequences were deposited in genbank under the accession number srp157512 seqman ngen dnastar was also used to assemble contigs from merged metagenomic reads 2 5 3 taxonomic classification of metagenomic reads ncbi blast 2 2 31 standalone software genomepeek software and mg rast were used to characterize metagenomic libraries protein coding reads from each of the metagenomic libraries were grouped into clusters with cd hit using the blosum62 scoring matrix and an e value of 0 001 all blastx output text files generated by ncbi blast 2 2 31 were imported into megan for taxonomic classification as previously described holmes et al 2017 2 5 4 analysis and identification of functional protein coding genes the nhmmer search function was used to scan qc filtered merged metagenomic reads for the presence of pila genes by comparison to a pila nucleotide hidden markov model hmm database built by hmmbuild in hmmer 3 the hmm database used for this comparison was built from an alignment of 88 different type iv pila nucleotide sequences as

et al 2008 3 results 3 1 performance of uasb reactors during stage 1 of the experiment both the gac amended and non amended control uasb reactors were fed raw incineration leachate and operated with an hrt set at 9 3 days which provided an olr of 5 9 kgcod m3 d in the control reactor cod removal efficiencies started to drop within the first few days of the experiment and the system completely deteriorated by day 17 fig 1 a the gac amended reactor on the other hand operated efficiently and reached cod removal efficiencies 90 during this stage of the experiment although the non amended control reactor was no longer operational after 17 days the gac amended reactor continued to operate for another 113 days hrt was gradually decreased in the gac amended reactor to 4 6 days stage 2 3 1 days stage 3 2 2 days stage 4 and 1 5 days stage 5 to stepwise increase the olr to 12 kgcod m3 d 17 1 kgcod m3 d 25 kgcod m3 d and 36 7 kgcod m3 d respectively cod removal efficiencies in the gac amended reactor fluctuated between 70 and 90 during the first 71 days of the experiment and became relatively constant 90 between days 72 and 115 even when the olr was increased to 25 kgcod m3 d during stage 4 of the experiment when the olr was further increased to 36 7 kgcod m3 d during stage 5 reactor efficiency dropped slightly effluent cod concentrations increased from 5200 mg l to 9000 mg l and cod removal efficiencies decreased to 83 with an effluent vfa concentration of 4 2 g l methane production rates of the gac amended reactor increased stepwise from 1 6 m3 stp m3 d to 9 6 m3 stp m3 d fig 1b the specific methane production was 0 27 m3 stp ch4 kgcod 88 9 of the removed cod was converted to methane according to the theoretical methane production rate of 0 35 l ch4 stp gcodremoved ye et al 2011 and the rest 11 1 was presumably transformed to biomass these results are similar to a uasb reactor lacking conductive material amendments that was fed msw incineration leachate ye et al 2011 however this other reactor was only operated at an olr of 12 5 kgcod m3 d significantly lower than 36 7 kgcod m3 d used in this study these results further demonstrate that the gac amended reactor could effectively treat raw incineration leachate even when the olr reached levels as high as 36 7 kgcod m3 d 3 2 vfa concentration total vfa concentrations in the control reactor increased to 9 5 g l within the first 16 days of the experiment while total vfas in the gac amended reactor stayed low throughout the experiment and dropped down to levels below detection limits during stage 3 of the experiment supplementary fig s2 butyrate concentrations had the greatest variation between the two reactors on day 16 2 6 g l butyrate was detected in the non amended control reactor while concentrations were negligible in the gac amended reactor concentrations of propionate and acetate reached 2 0 g l and 4 8 g l respectively in the non amended reactor prior to system deterioration on day 16 although total vfa concentrations in the gac amended reactor reached 6 5 g l 4 2 g l acetate 2 1 g l proprionate on day 20 they decreased to 0 7 g l only acetate by day 55 total vfa concentrations stayed low 1 6 g l at olrs of 12 17 1 and 25 kgcod m3 d but increased to 4 2 g l when the olr was increased to 36 7 kgcod m3 d 3 3 metagenomic analysis reveals significant shifts in dominant metabolisms four different metagenomic libraries were constructed from dna extracted from seed sludge and samples collected from the gac amended reactor during stages 1 day 58 3 day 95 and 4 day 110 of the experiment significant shifts in bacterial community structure were observed in the gac amended reactor at different stages of the experiment fig 2 while many sequences from nitrate reducing fermentative and sulfate reducing bacteria were observed in the library constructed from seed sludge the proportion of these sequences dropped significantly over time supplementary fig s3 the majority of narg adhe ldha pflb and poxb sequences clustered with the genus escherichia 42 6 78 3 of the sequences most of the dsra sequences clustered with the genera desulfobulbus 68 5 and desulfovibrio 20 3 quantitative analysis of gene copy numbers showed that there was a 240 fold difference between escherichia narg gene copy number in the seed sludge and stage 3 and 4 samples supplementary fig s4a and that all four of the escherichia fermentation genes dropped by three orders of magnitude supplementary fig s4b there was also a 5 fold difference between desulfobulbus dsra gene copies in the seed sludge and the gac amended reactor samples supplementary fig s4c archaeal community structure also shifted over time in the gac amended reactor supplementary fig s5a while methanogens were the dominant archaeal sequences in all four libraries 90 of the archaeal sequences the overall abundance of methanogens in the libraries increased over time in the metagenomic library constructed from seed sludge methanogenic sequences only accounted for 14 02 of the total sequences while methanogens accounted for 19 6 21 5 and 28 5 of the total sequences in the stage 1 3 and 4 samples supplementary fig s5a this increase in methanogens is likely due to the fact that the seed sludge was exposed to oxygen during collection and storage and that it contained high concentrations of complex organic compounds that cannot serve as substrates for methanogenesis as the reactor environment became more anaerobic and organic compounds were degraded to substrates that could be utilized by methanogens their numbers increased significantly analysis of sequences from the gene coding for the alpha subunit of methyl coenzyme a reductase mcra in the various libraries also showed that the composition of methanogens changed significantly over time supplementary fig s5b while acetoclastic methanogens from the genera methanothrix and methanosarcina dominated all 4 libraries and accounted for 59 65 of the mcra sequences their relative proportion changed in the seed sludge and stage 1 libraries methanothrix accounted for 56 9 and 59 2 of the mcra sequences and methanosarcina mcra only accounted for 3 4 and 5 9 of the sequences in the stage 3 and 4 libraries on the other hand methanothrix mcra sequences dropped down to 26 1 and 32 9 and methanosarcina increased to 32 4 and 26 4 of the mcra sequences the linear rpkm value of methanosarcina mcra gene copies also increased 18 fold in stage 3 and 4 samples compared to seed sludge while methanothrix gene copies decreased in stage 3 and 4 samples supplementary fig s3d methanothrix dominated the seed sludge because its higher affinity for acetate allows it to dominate environments with acetate concentrations below 1 mm jetten et al 1992 although acetate concentrations were sufficiently high to support growth of methanosarcina when stage 1 samples were collected on day 59 0 6 g l the longer hrt set during this stage favored the growth of methanothrix conklin et al 2006 as acetate concentrations remained high and hrt was lowered during stages 3 and 4 of the experiment methanosarcina became more significant members of the methanogenic community 3 4 increase in genes coding for proteins known to be involved in extracellular electron transfer in order for bacteria to serve as the electron donating partner for diet they need to be able to transfer electrons across the cell membrane to the extracellular environment lovley 2017 the overall proportion of bacteria capable of extracellular electron transfer i e geobacter clostridium thermosipho bacillus desulfotomaculum desulfobacterium desulfobulbus desulfovibrio and leptospirillum was lowest in the seed sludge samples 17 of the bacterial sequences and highest in the metagenome constructed from samples collected from the gac amended reactor during stage 3 29 of the bacterial sequences supplementary fig s6 sequences that clustered with the genus geobacter were significant members of the bacterial community in the gac amended reactor during stages 3 and 4 of the experiment however the proportion of geobacter sequences dropped from 9 5 during stage 3 to 3 during stage 4 supplementary fig s6 this decline in geobacter during stage 4 is likely due to higher concentrations of complex organics and heavy metals in the reactor caused by the high olr used during stage 4 wu et al 2015 while geobacter sequences increased in the gac amended reactor sequences from other deltaproteobacterial genera whose primary metabolism is sulfate reduction i e desulfobulbus and desulfovibrio decreased significantly over time in fact the proportion of desulfobulbus sequences in the seed sludge was 4 3 compared to only 0 7 and 0 9 of the sequences in stage 3 and 4 metagenomic libraries supplementary fig s6 in order for bacteria to participate in extracellular electron transfer electrons need to be moved from the menaquinone pool in the inner membrane across the periplasm and outer membrane to the outside of the cell bird et al 2011 mechanisms involved in electron transfer outside of the cell have been well studied in the fe iii reducing bacteria geobacter sulfurreducens and g metallireducens lovley et al 2011 and sequences from these species accounted for a significant proportion of the libraries electrically conductive pili gsu1496 and gmet 1399 and outer membrane c type cytochromes omcs gsu2504 and gmet 1868 have been shown to be required for extracellular electron transfer by g sulfurreducens and g metallireducens during diet rotaru et al 2014b summers et al 2010 it was possible to assemble both pila and omcs from the metagenomic data that shared 99 and 97 nucleotide sequence identity with g sulfurreducens the metagenomic pila shared the same aromatic amino acid residue abundance and distribution as gsu1496 indicating that this sequence likely codes for a conductive pilin protein malvankar et al 2011 walker et al 2017 supplementary fig s7 metagenomic omcs also had the same number of heme groups 6 as the omcs protein found in g sulfurreducens supplementary fig s7 gac amendments increased the number of these metagenomic pila and omcs gene copies fig 3 trans membrane spanning porin cytochrome complexes consisting of periplasmic cytochromes outer membrane porin proteins and outer membrane associated c type cytochromes pcc complexes are also involved in electron transport outside of the cell liu et al 2014 richardson et al 2012 two pcc complexes encoded by a gene cluster in the g sulfurreducens genome ombb omab omcb orfs ombc omac omcc are required for extracellular electron transfer to ferrihydrite liu et al 2014 and electrodes ha et al 2017 studies have also shown that g sulfurreducens utilizes components of these complexes to transfer electrons to the phototroph prosthecochloris aesaurii ha et al 2017 and to accept electrons from g metallireducens shrestha et al 2013 genes from both pcc complexes were detected in the metagenomic data metagenomic omcc omac ombc omcb omab and ombb shared 95 99 nucleotide identity with g sulfurreducens genes and the abundance of all of the genes from both pcc complexes increased significantly during stages 3 and 4 of the experiment fig 3 3 5 increase in genes coding for diet related proteins in methanogens recent transcriptomic studies have suggested that f420h2 dehydrogenase fpo plays an important role in electron transfer into the cytoplasm of methanosarcina during diet holmes et al 2018 among methanogens the fpo complex is mostly limited to methanosarcina and methanothrix species liang et al 2015 welte and deppenmeier 2014 this is interesting as methanosarcina and methanothrix are the only methanogens that have been proven to grow in co culture with bacteria via diet rotaru et al 2014a 2014b it was proposed that fpo from m barkeri can accept electrons from reduced methanophenazine mph2 and transfer those electrons to f420 in the cytoplasm during diet holmes et al 2018 it was also proposed that during diet f420h2 generated by the membrane bound fpo complex donates electrons to the cytoplasmic electron bifurcating heterodisulfide complex hdrabc to produce reduced ferredoxin and com s s cob which are required for the co2 reduction pathway similar to patterns found with the mcra gene methanothrix fpoa and hdra genes dominated seed sludge and stage 1 samples but methanosarcina fpoa and hdra genes were significantly higher in stages 3 and 4 of the experiment supplementary fig s8 fig 4 3 6 electrically conductive filaments enriched in gac amended reactors it has been shown that a diversity of prokaryotes produce e pili walker et al 2017 2018a 2018b and therefore might be capable of diet in fact another bacterium besides geobacter frequently found in methanogenic bioreactors syntrophus acetitrophicus has conductive pili and can participate in diet walker et al 2018a some archaea also produce archaella which have high homology to type iv pili albers and jarrell 2018 poweleit et al 2017 and are electrically conductive walker et al 2018b although it does not appear that archaella are required for diet as methanothrix species do not have archaealla makarova et al 2016 and archaellum flab genes were not significantly expressed in m barkeri cells during growth in co culture with g metallireducens via diet holmes et al 2018 it is still possible that their presence might help enhance diet and or anaerobic digestion studies of prokaryotic filaments have identified several criteria required for a pilin like monomer to be conductive walker et al 2017 2018a based on these criteria 85 of the bacterial pila and 31 of the archaeal flab proteins detected in the four metagenomes were potentially conductive supplementary fig s9 the highest proportion 39 of non conductive pila sequences was found in the seed sludge sample quantitative analysis of bacterial pila genes showed that conductive pila were 183 fold higher in stage 3 samples than seed sludge fig 5 a and conductive flab were 5 times higher in stage 3 and stage 4 samples than seed sludge fig 5b 3 7 conductivity of aggregates collected from gac amended reactor studies have shown that aggregates collected from anaerobic digesters that were participating in diet were conductive morita et al 2011 shrestha et al 2014 in this study conductivities of granules collected from seed sludge were compared to aggregates collected from the 5 different stages of the experiment in order to ensure that substrates leachate did not cause variations in granule conductivities over time sludge samples were washed three times with 0 1 m nacl the highest conductivity 98 13 3 12 μs cm was observed in aggregates collected during stage 3 of the experiment when geobacter sequences were most abundant fig 6 although the sample size was small only 3 metagenomic samples from the gac amended reactor there appeared to be a moderate correlation r2 0 67 between the abundance of conductive filaments and granule conductivity 4 discussion in the past bio methanogenic treatment of raw msw incineration leachate has been severely limited by extremely high cod and short chain fatty acid concentrations and such inhibitory compounds as ammonium calcium and heavy metals dang et al 2014 lei et al 2018 liu et al 2015 these factors make the reactor unstable and result in reactor souring particularly during the start up period this study showed that when gac was added to a uasb reactor it could efficiently treat raw incineration leachate without long term sludge acclimation by the 60th day of the experiment the gac amended reactor had a cod removal efficiency 90 a methane production rate of 1 7 m3 stp m3 d and a total vfa concentration of only 1 18 g l the non amended control reactor on the other hand had completely deteriorated by day 17 had cod removal efficiencies lower than 50 had low biogas production rates 0 05 m3 stp m3 d and had total vfa concentrations that reached 9 5 g l furthermore the gac amended reactor could operate at olrs as high as 36 7 kgcod m3 d although the cod removal efficiency dropped from 90 at lower olrs i e 25 kgcod m3 d to 83 when the olr was increased to 36 7 kgcod m3 d the methane production rates stayed high 9 7 m3 stp m3 d indicating that the gac amended reactor continued to operate stably it is also significant that the gac amended reactor could withstand higher olrs than any previously reported uasb reactor treating raw incineration leachate chang 1988 dang et al 2014 he et al 2009 ye et al 2011 table 2 this study also showed that the addition of gac to the reactor had a significant impact on microbial community dynamics acetoclastic methanogens were significant members of the methanogenic community throughout the experiment however while methanothrix was dominant in the early phases of operation methanosarcina became predominant once the reactor acclimated this is significant because reactors dominated by methanosarcina are more stable and can handle higher olrs than reactors dominated by methanothrix conklin et al 2006 although many methanosarcina species are capable of both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and can participate in diet or hfit holmes et al 2018 rotaru et al 2014b it is unlikely that they were participating in hfit because when olrs are high bacterial h2 production decreases to maintain h2 concentrations below the thermodynamic threshold arslan et al 2012 miceli et al 2016 spirito et al 2014 steinbusch et al 2011 however one limitation of the metagenomic analyses done in this study is that metabolic activities can only be inferred from genomic data future studies will have to examine transcriptomic and or proteomic data to confirm that methanosarcina is actively participating in diet in these gac amended reactors in addition to the increase in methanosarcina sequences a number of genes from other organisms known to participate in diet were also enriched for example the abundance of genes coding for the geobacter outer membrane c type cytochrome omcs summers et al 2010 geobacter pcc complexes ha et al 2017 and methanosarcinales f420h2 dehydrogenase holmes et al 2018 increased there was also an increase in the number of gene copies for conductive e pili which have been shown to be involved in electron transfer from the outer membrane of geobacter species to the surface of methanothrix and methanosarcina cells rotaru et al 2014a 2014b as the number of conductive e pili gene copies increased the conductivity of reactor aggregates also increased suggesting that the filaments were contributing to aggregate conductivity studies have shown a correlation between aggregate conductivity and diet in anaerobic digesters morita et al 2011 shrestha et al 2014 further supporting the theory that gac amendments enhanced diet in these reactors it should also be noted that the gac amended reactor performed best during stage 3 with higher cod removal efficiencies 92 3 lower effluent vfa concentrations and more stable operation fig 1 and supplementary fig s2 the proportion of geobacter and methanosarcina sequences in bacterial and archaeal metagenomic libraries 9 5 and 32 4 of the sequences was also highest at this stage supplementary fig s5 and supplementary fig s6 these sequence results along with the finding that sludge conductivity was highest in granules collected during stage 3 fig 6 demonstrated that diet was most enhanced during stage 3 of operation and this led to higher treatment efficiencies when the olr was increased from 17 1 kgcod m3 d to 25 0 kgcod m3 d during stage 4 diet facilitated by geobacter species did not appear to be as prevalent this is consistent with the fact that geobacter do not tend to be favored in environments with high olrs wu et al 2015 although geobacter abundance declined somewhat during this period cod removal efficiencies were only slightly lower 92 3 90 5 table 2 genera other than geobacter can participate in diet walker et al 2018a and sequences from other bacterial species that could potentially participate in diet i e bacteria capable of extracellular electron transfer increased in abundance during stage 4 these results show that gac amendments kept reactor conditions optimal for biomethanogenesis when the olr reached levels as high as 25 0 kgcod m3 d by facilitating diet between bacteria and methanogens however it appears that when olrs are elevated diet capable bacteria other than geobacter become more significant members of the microbial community further investigation into participation by these other bacterial genera is required 5 conclusion the addition of gac to uasb reactors facilitated efficient treatment of raw incineration leachate even when olrs were as high as 36 7 kgcod m3 d non amended reactors were unable to treat this leachate and completely deteriorated within the first 17 days of the experiment when the olr was only 5 9 kgcod m3 d metagenomic analysis of samples collected from the reactor at different stages of the experiment suggested that the addition of gac resulted in an enrichment of geobacter and methanosarcina both organisms that are capable of diet the conductivity of aggregates collected from the reactor increased over time and was highest when genes coding for conductive filaments were most abundant these results are significant and should be used to develop strategies for efficient degradation of toxic waste with high

18715,the raw fresh leachate from municipal solid waste msw incineration plants contains high concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfas ammonia and metals all compounds that severely limit anaerobic digestion treatment efficiencies these inhibitory compounds make reactor systems unstable causing reactor start up periods to take more than 100 days even when the leachate is diluted significantly in this study granular activated carbon gac was incorporated into a bioreactor fed with raw incineration leachate addition of gac allowed direct treatment of raw incineration leachate without any start up acclimation period while the non amended control reactor soured immediately and collapsed within 17 days when hydraulic retention time hrt of the gac amended reactor was stepwise decreased to increase organic loading rates olr to 25 0 kgcod m3 d cod removal efficiencies remained stable at 90 metagenomic analysis of the gac amended reactor revealed that geobacter and methanosarcina species known to participate in direct interspecies electron transfer diet were more abundant in the gac amended reactor than the seed sludge in addition the abundance of genes coding for proteins thought to be involved in diet such as electrically conductive pili and the outer membrane c type cytochrome omcs increased significantly while genes involved in fermentation and nitrate narg and sulfate dsra reduction dropped significantly as the experiment progressed these results are significant because this is the first detailed investigation into the metabolic capabilities of microbial communities involved in efficient treatment of raw incineration leachate within biomethanogenic reactors that did not require a long start up period graphical abstract image 1 keywords incineration leachate granular activated carbon direct interspecies electron transfer methanogenesis metagenomic analysis 1 introduction in some countries the availability of non developed land makes landfilling a cost effective way to dispose of municipal solid waste msw de feo and de gisi 2014 however as the world becomes increasingly populated space for landfills is becoming scarce particularly in such chinese cities as beijing and shanghai lu et al 2015 in addition to limited space there are also many environmental hazards associated with landfills these include leaching of contaminants into groundwater and the generation of greenhouse gas emissions by landfills treating msw lou and nair 2009 mor et al 2006 these factors have motivated many cities in china to minimize the use of landfills and to start treating msw with incineration in fact the proportion of msw being treated by incineration increased from 7 in 2004 to 35 in 2017 cheng and hu 2010 wang et al 2018 and it is expected to increase to 40 in 2020 according to 13th five year ecological environmental protection plan promulgated by central committee of the communist party of china 2016 msw in china contains a high proportion of kitchen waste nie 2008 with high moisture content in order for incineration to work effectively water content needs to be reduced by storing msw in bunkers for 3 7 days prior to incineration nie 2008 ye et al 2011 during this storage period a considerable amount of fresh leachate 5 28 of the volume of the msw with high salinity 15 000 mg l high chemical oxygen demand cod usually 50 000 mg l and high ammonia concentrations usually 500 mg l is generated nie 2008 ye et al 2011 other harmful constituents that can become concentrated in the leachate include heavy metals e g pb ni zn and complex biorefractory organic compounds such as humic substances polyaromatic hydrocarbons adsorbable organic halogens and polychlorinated biphenyls nie 2008 wiszniowski et al 2006 some of these metals can also form chelates with humic acids and other toxic organic compounds making them more accessible for uptake into microbial cells adamo et al 2018 pang et al 2018 and inhibiting growth of microorganisms involved in the biological treatment of incineration leachate dang et al 2013 ye et al 2011 in many msw incineration plants incineration leachate gets treated anaerobically in biomethanogenic reactors nie 2008 frequently the toxic nature of incineration leachate impairs reactor performance while methods to improve biomethanogenic treatment of diluted incineration leachate have been identified these same methods cannot effectively treat raw incineration leachate dang et al 2013 ye et al 2011 as production of leachate by msw incineration facilities continues to increase the need to develop methods for treatment of raw incineration leachate is becoming more important currently dilution of leachate requires vast amounts of fresh water resources elimination of this dilution step would not only be less wasteful it would also be less labor intensive and more cost effective in recent years it has been shown that stimulation of direct interspecies electron transfer diet between bacteria and methanogens through the addition of conductive materials enhances the performance of methanogenic bioreactors some of the non biological conductive materials that are known to promote diet include magnetite jing et al 2017 yin et al 2018 biochar zhao et al 2016a granular activated carbon gac lee et al 2016 park et al 2018b zhang et al 2017b zhao et al 2016b and carbon cloth lei et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 bacteria can either transfer electrons from the oxidation of organic compounds extracellularly to methanogens via diet or they can indirectly transfer electrons through hydrogen formate interspecies transfer hfit holmes and smith 2016 diet is significantly more efficient as electrons are not lost through diffusion lovley 2017 which explains why anaerobic digestion is enhanced when diet is stimulated recently it has been reported that addition of carbon cloth lei et al 2016 or magnetite lei et al 2018 into bioreactors fed diluted msw incineration leachate enhanced treatment efficiencies and methane production rates however these amended reactors could not operate efficiently when they were fed raw incineration leachate in order to optimize bioreactors treating complex waste like raw incineration leachate metabolic processes being carried out by microorganisms within the reactors need to be understood many of the organisms found in anaerobic digesters cannot be grown in culture and even for those that can be grown it is difficult to know how they are impacted by the presence of other organisms in the community some studies have used metagenomic analysis to show that organisms involved in diet are enriched in bioreactors that have been supplemented with conductive materials jing et al 2017 park et al 2018a yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a however these studies primarily focused on general trends in microbial community structure rather than changes in the metabolic potential of the community observed over time the use of metagenomic data for real time analysis of microbial genomes can provide considerably more information regarding how microbial communities respond to changes in their environment identification of genes linked to important functions will help provide nucleic acid signatures that can be used for quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr qrt pcr assays to monitor reactor stability for example detection of transcripts for genes known to code for certain electron transfer proteins might signal that bioreactors are running efficiently whereas transcripts for stress response genes i e sos response heat shock response oxidative stress and the stringent response genes could warn technicians that conditions need to be adjusted to avoid reactor souring the objective of this study was to determine whether the incorporation of gac into methanogenic bioreactors enables efficient treatment of raw incineration leachate which has been a bottleneck of leachate biotreatment metagenomic studies were also done to provide insight into how changes in olr can impact the dominant metabolic processes occurring in gac amended reactors and how they can influence which organisms are participating in diet this study identifies a number of genes that can be used for the development of qrt pcr assays to test reactor performance and it provides valuable insight into treatment of raw incineration leachate 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculated sludge and fresh leachate sludge was collected from a full scale up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor treating food wastewater in

agilent 4200 system prior to sequencing on an illumina hiseq x ten platform illumia san diego usa by magigene biotechnology co ltd guangdong china 2 5 2 assembly of illumina reads all of the raw sequencing and qc filtered data were quality checked with fastqc http www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects fastqc initial raw non filtered forward and reverse metagenomic sequencing libraries contained an average of 44 007 849 reads that were 150 basepairs long sequences from all of the libraries were trimmed and filtered with trimmomatic software resulting in 20 991 777 quality reads per metagenomic sequencing library these paired end reads were then merged with flash and this generated 20 283 782 5 reads per library all metagenomic sequences were deposited in genbank under the accession number srp157512 seqman ngen dnastar was also used to assemble contigs from merged metagenomic reads 2 5 3 taxonomic classification of metagenomic reads ncbi blast 2 2 31 standalone software genomepeek software and mg rast were used to characterize metagenomic libraries protein coding reads from each of the metagenomic libraries were grouped into clusters with cd hit using the blosum62

et al 2008 3 results 3 1 performance of uasb reactors during stage 1 of the experiment both the gac amended and non amended control uasb reactors were fed raw incineration leachate and operated with an hrt set at 9 3 days which provided an olr of 5 9 kgcod m3 d in the control reactor cod removal efficiencies started to drop within the first few days of the experiment and the system completely deteriorated by day 17 fig 1 a the gac amended reactor on the other hand operated efficiently and reached cod removal efficiencies 90 during this stage of the experiment although the non amended control reactor was no longer operational after 17 days the gac amended reactor continued to operate for another 113 days hrt was gradually decreased in the gac amended reactor to 4 6 days stage 2 3 1 days stage 3 2 2 days stage 4 and 1 5 days stage 5 to stepwise increase the olr to 12 kgcod m3 d 17 1 kgcod m3 d 25 kgcod m3 d and 36 7 kgcod m3 d respectively cod removal efficiencies in the gac amended reactor fluctuated between 70 and 90 during the first 71 days of the experiment and became relatively constant 90 between days 72 and 115 even when the olr was increased to 25 kgcod m3 d during stage 4 of the experiment when the olr was further increased to 36 7 kgcod m3 d during stage 5 reactor efficiency dropped slightly effluent cod concentrations increased from 5200 mg l to 9000 mg l and cod removal efficiencies decreased to 83 with an effluent vfa concentration of 4 2 g l methane production rates of the gac amended reactor increased stepwise from 1 6 m3 stp m3 d to 9 6 m3 stp m3 d fig 1b the specific methane production was 0 27 m3 stp ch4 kgcod 88 9 of the removed cod was converted to methane according to the theoretical methane production rate of 0 35 l ch4 stp gcodremoved ye et al 2011 and the rest 11 1 was presumably transformed to biomass these results are similar to a uasb reactor lacking conductive material amendments that was fed msw incineration leachate ye et al 2011 however this other reactor was only operated at an olr of 12 5 kgcod m3 d significantly lower than 36 7 kgcod m3 d used in this study these results further demonstrate that the gac amended reactor could effectively treat raw incineration leachate even when the olr reached levels as high as 36 7 kgcod m3 d 3 2 vfa concentration total vfa concentrations in the control reactor increased to 9 5 g l within the first 16 days of the experiment while total vfas in the gac amended reactor stayed low throughout the experiment and dropped down to levels below detection limits during stage 3 of the experiment supplementary fig s2 butyrate concentrations had the greatest variation between the two reactors on day 16 2 6 g l butyrate was detected in the non amended control reactor while concentrations were negligible in the gac amended reactor concentrations of propionate and acetate reached 2 0 g l and 4 8 g l respectively in the non amended reactor prior to system deterioration on day 16 although total vfa concentrations in the gac amended reactor reached 6 5 g l 4 2 g l acetate 2 1 g l proprionate on day 20 they decreased to 0 7 g l only acetate by day 55 total vfa concentrations stayed low 1 6 g l at olrs of 12 17 1 and 25 kgcod m3 d but increased to 4 2 g l when the olr was increased to 36 7 kgcod m3 d 3 3 metagenomic analysis reveals significant shifts in dominant metabolisms four different metagenomic libraries were constructed from dna extracted from seed sludge and samples collected from the gac amended reactor during stages 1 day 58 3 day 95 and 4 day 110 of the experiment significant shifts in bacterial community structure were observed in the gac amended reactor at different stages of the experiment fig 2 while many sequences from nitrate reducing fermentative and sulfate reducing bacteria were observed in the library constructed from seed sludge the proportion of these sequences dropped significantly over time supplementary fig s3 the majority of narg adhe ldha pflb and poxb sequences clustered with the genus escherichia 42 6 78 3 of the sequences most of the dsra sequences clustered with the genera desulfobulbus 68 5 and desulfovibrio 20 3 quantitative analysis of gene copy numbers showed that there was a 240 fold difference between escherichia narg gene copy number in the seed sludge and stage 3 and 4 samples supplementary fig s4a and that all four of the escherichia fermentation genes dropped by three orders of magnitude supplementary fig s4b there was also a 5 fold difference between desulfobulbus dsra gene copies in the seed sludge and the gac amended reactor samples supplementary fig s4c archaeal community structure also shifted over time in the gac amended reactor supplementary fig s5a while methanogens were the dominant archaeal sequences in all four libraries 90 of the archaeal sequences the overall abundance of methanogens in the libraries increased over time in the metagenomic library constructed from seed sludge methanogenic sequences only accounted for 14 02 of the total sequences while methanogens accounted for 19 6 21 5 and 28 5 of the total sequences in the stage 1 3 and 4 samples supplementary fig s5a this increase in methanogens is likely due to the fact that the seed sludge was exposed to oxygen during collection and storage and that it contained high concentrations of complex organic compounds that cannot serve as substrates for methanogenesis as the reactor environment became more anaerobic and organic compounds were degraded to substrates that could be utilized by methanogens their numbers increased significantly analysis of sequences from the gene coding for the alpha subunit of methyl coenzyme a reductase mcra in the various libraries also showed that the composition of methanogens changed significantly over time supplementary fig s5b while acetoclastic methanogens from the genera methanothrix and methanosarcina dominated all 4 libraries and accounted for 59 65 of the mcra sequences their relative proportion changed in the seed sludge and stage 1 libraries methanothrix accounted for 56 9 and 59 2 of the mcra sequences and methanosarcina mcra only accounted for 3 4 and 5 9 of the sequences in the stage 3 and 4 libraries on the other hand methanothrix mcra sequences dropped down to 26 1 and 32 9 and methanosarcina increased to 32 4 and 26 4 of the mcra sequences the linear rpkm value of methanosarcina mcra gene copies also increased 18 fold in stage 3 and 4 samples compared to seed sludge while methanothrix gene copies decreased in stage 3 and 4 samples supplementary fig s3d methanothrix dominated the seed sludge because its higher affinity for acetate allows it to dominate environments with acetate concentrations below 1 mm jetten et al 1992 although acetate concentrations were sufficiently high to support growth of methanosarcina when stage 1 samples were collected on day 59 0 6 g l the longer hrt set during this stage favored the growth of methanothrix conklin et al 2006 as acetate concentrations remained high and hrt was lowered during stages 3 and 4 of the experiment methanosarcina became more significant members of the methanogenic community 3 4 increase in genes coding for proteins known to be involved in extracellular electron transfer in order for bacteria to serve as the electron donating partner for diet they need to be able to transfer electrons across the cell membrane to the extracellular environment lovley 2017 the overall proportion of bacteria capable of extracellular electron transfer i e geobacter clostridium thermosipho bacillus desulfotomaculum desulfobacterium desulfobulbus desulfovibrio and leptospirillum was lowest in the seed sludge samples 17 of the bacterial sequences and highest in the metagenome constructed from samples collected from the gac amended reactor during stage 3 29 of the bacterial sequences supplementary fig s6 sequences that clustered with the genus geobacter were significant members of the bacterial community in the gac amended reactor during stages 3 and 4 of the experiment however the proportion of geobacter sequences dropped from 9 5 during stage 3 to 3 during stage 4 supplementary fig s6 this decline in geobacter during stage 4 is likely due to higher concentrations of complex organics and heavy metals in the reactor caused by the high olr used during stage 4 wu et al 2015 while geobacter sequences increased in the gac amended reactor sequences from other deltaproteobacterial genera whose primary metabolism is sulfate reduction i e desulfobulbus and desulfovibrio decreased significantly over time in fact the proportion of desulfobulbus sequences in the seed sludge was 4 3 compared to only 0 7 and 0 9 of the sequences in stage 3 and 4 metagenomic libraries supplementary fig s6 in order for bacteria to participate in extracellular electron transfer electrons need to be moved from the menaquinone pool in the inner membrane across the periplasm and outer membrane to the outside of the cell bird et al 2011 mechanisms involved in electron transfer outside of the cell have been well studied in the fe iii reducing bacteria geobacter sulfurreducens and g metallireducens lovley et al 2011 and sequences from these species accounted for a significant proportion of the libraries electrically conductive pili gsu1496 and gmet 1399 and outer membrane c type cytochromes omcs gsu2504 and gmet 1868 have been shown to be required for extracellular electron transfer by g sulfurreducens and g metallireducens during diet rotaru et al 2014b summers et al 2010 it was possible to assemble both pila and omcs from the metagenomic data that shared 99 and 97 nucleotide sequence identity with g sulfurreducens the metagenomic pila shared the same aromatic amino acid residue abundance and distribution as gsu1496 indicating that this sequence likely codes for a conductive pilin protein malvankar et al 2011 walker et al 2017 supplementary fig s7 metagenomic omcs also had the same number of heme groups 6 as the omcs protein found in g sulfurreducens supplementary fig s7 gac amendments increased the number of these metagenomic pila and omcs gene copies fig 3 trans membrane spanning porin cytochrome complexes consisting of periplasmic cytochromes outer membrane porin proteins and outer membrane associated c type cytochromes pcc complexes are also involved in electron transport outside of the cell liu et al 2014 richardson et al 2012 two pcc complexes encoded by a gene cluster in the g sulfurreducens genome ombb omab omcb orfs ombc omac omcc are required for extracellular electron transfer to ferrihydrite liu et al 2014 and electrodes ha et al 2017 studies have also shown that g sulfurreducens utilizes components of these complexes to transfer electrons to the phototroph prosthecochloris aesaurii ha et al 2017 and to accept electrons from g metallireducens shrestha et al 2013 genes from both pcc complexes were detected in the metagenomic data metagenomic omcc omac ombc omcb omab and ombb shared 95 99 nucleotide identity with g sulfurreducens genes and the abundance of all of the genes from both pcc complexes increased significantly during stages 3 and 4 of the experiment fig 3 3 5 increase in genes coding for diet related proteins in methanogens recent transcriptomic studies have suggested that f420h2 dehydrogenase fpo plays an important role in electron transfer into the cytoplasm of methanosarcina during diet holmes et al 2018 among methanogens the fpo complex is mostly limited to methanosarcina and methanothrix species liang et al 2015 welte and deppenmeier 2014 this is interesting as methanosarcina and methanothrix are the only methanogens that have been proven to grow in co culture with bacteria via diet rotaru et al 2014a 2014b it was proposed that fpo from m barkeri can accept electrons from reduced methanophenazine mph2 and transfer those electrons to f420 in the cytoplasm during diet holmes et al 2018 it was also proposed that during diet f420h2 generated by the membrane bound fpo complex donates electrons to the cytoplasmic electron bifurcating heterodisulfide complex hdrabc to produce reduced ferredoxin and com s s cob which are required for the co2 reduction pathway similar to patterns found with the mcra gene methanothrix fpoa and hdra genes dominated seed sludge and stage 1 samples but methanosarcina fpoa and hdra genes were significantly higher in stages 3 and 4 of the experiment supplementary fig s8 fig 4 3 6 electrically conductive filaments enriched in gac amended reactors it has been shown that a diversity of prokaryotes produce e pili walker et al 2017 2018a 2018b and therefore might be capable of diet in fact another bacterium besides geobacter frequently found in methanogenic bioreactors syntrophus acetitrophicus has conductive pili and can participate in diet walker et al 2018a some archaea also produce archaella which have high homology to type iv pili albers and jarrell 2018 poweleit et al 2017 and are electrically conductive walker et al 2018b although it does not appear that archaella are required for diet as methanothrix species do not have archaealla makarova et al 2016 and archaellum flab genes were not significantly expressed in m barkeri cells during growth in co culture with g metallireducens via diet holmes et al 2018 it is still possible that their presence might help enhance diet and or anaerobic digestion studies of prokaryotic filaments have identified several criteria required for a pilin like monomer to be conductive walker et al 2017 2018a based on these criteria 85 of the bacterial pila and 31 of the archaeal flab proteins detected in the four metagenomes were potentially conductive supplementary fig s9 the highest proportion 39 of non conductive pila sequences was found in the seed sludge sample quantitative analysis of bacterial pila genes showed that conductive pila were 183 fold higher in stage 3 samples than seed sludge fig 5 a and conductive flab were 5 times higher in stage 3 and stage 4 samples than seed sludge fig 5b 3 7 conductivity of aggregates collected from gac amended reactor studies have shown that aggregates collected from anaerobic digesters that were participating in diet were conductive morita et al 2011 shrestha et al 2014 in this study conductivities of granules collected from seed sludge were compared to aggregates collected from the 5 different stages of the experiment in order to ensure that substrates leachate did not cause variations in granule conductivities over time sludge samples were washed three times with 0 1 m nacl the highest conductivity 98 13 3 12 μs cm was observed in aggregates collected during stage 3 of the experiment when geobacter sequences were most abundant fig 6 although the sample size was small only 3 metagenomic samples from the gac amended reactor there appeared to be a moderate correlation r2 0 67 between the abundance of conductive filaments and granule conductivity 4 discussion in the past bio methanogenic treatment of raw msw incineration leachate has been severely limited by extremely high cod and short chain fatty acid concentrations and such inhibitory compounds as ammonium calcium and heavy metals dang et al 2014 lei et al 2018 liu et al 2015 these factors make the reactor unstable and result in reactor souring particularly during the start up period this study showed that when gac was added to a uasb reactor it could efficiently treat raw incineration leachate without long term sludge acclimation by the 60th day of the experiment the gac amended reactor had a cod removal efficiency 90 a methane production rate of 1 7 m3 stp m3 d and a total vfa concentration of only 1 18 g l the non amended control reactor on the other hand had completely deteriorated by day 17 had cod removal efficiencies lower than 50 had low biogas production rates 0 05 m3 stp m3 d and had total vfa concentrations that reached 9 5 g l furthermore the gac amended reactor could operate at olrs as high as 36 7 kgcod m3 d although the cod removal efficiency dropped from 90 at lower olrs i e 25 kgcod m3 d to 83 when the olr was increased to 36 7 kgcod m3 d the methane production rates stayed high 9 7 m3 stp m3 d indicating that the gac amended reactor continued to operate stably it is also significant that the gac amended reactor could withstand higher olrs than any previously reported uasb reactor treating raw incineration leachate chang 1988 dang et al 2014 he et al 2009 ye et al 2011 table 2 this study also showed that the addition of gac to the reactor had a significant impact on microbial community dynamics acetoclastic methanogens were significant members of the methanogenic community throughout the experiment however while methanothrix was dominant in the early phases of operation methanosarcina became predominant once the reactor acclimated this is significant because reactors dominated by methanosarcina are more stable and can handle higher olrs than reactors dominated by methanothrix conklin et al 2006 although many methanosarcina species are capable of both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and can participate in diet or hfit holmes et al 2018 rotaru et al 2014b it is unlikely that they were participating in hfit because when olrs are high bacterial h2 production decreases to maintain h2 concentrations below the thermodynamic threshold arslan et al 2012 miceli et al 2016 spirito et al 2014 steinbusch et al 2011 however one limitation of the metagenomic analyses done in this study is that metabolic activities can only be inferred from genomic data future studies will have to examine transcriptomic and or proteomic data to confirm that methanosarcina is actively participating in diet in these gac amended reactors in addition to the increase in methanosarcina sequences a number of genes from other organisms known to participate in diet were also enriched for example the abundance of genes coding for the geobacter outer membrane c type cytochrome omcs summers et al 2010 geobacter pcc complexes ha et al 2017 and methanosarcinales f420h2 dehydrogenase holmes et al 2018 increased there was also an increase in the number of gene copies for conductive e pili which have been shown to be involved in electron transfer from the outer membrane of geobacter species to the surface of methanothrix and methanosarcina cells rotaru et al 2014a 2014b as the number of conductive e pili gene copies increased the conductivity of reactor aggregates also increased suggesting that the filaments were contributing to aggregate conductivity studies have shown a correlation between aggregate conductivity and diet in anaerobic digesters morita et al 2011 shrestha et al 2014 further supporting the theory that gac amendments enhanced diet in these reactors it should also be noted that the gac amended reactor performed best during stage 3 with higher cod removal efficiencies 92 3 lower effluent vfa concentrations and more stable operation fig 1 and supplementary fig s2 the proportion of geobacter and methanosarcina sequences in bacterial and archaeal metagenomic libraries 9 5 and 32 4 of the sequences was also highest at this stage supplementary fig s5 and supplementary fig s6 these sequence results along with the finding that sludge conductivity was highest in granules collected during stage 3 fig 6 demonstrated that diet was most enhanced during stage 3 of operation and this led to higher treatment efficiencies when the olr was increased from 17 1 kgcod m3 d to 25 0 kgcod m3 d during stage 4 diet facilitated by geobacter species did not appear to be as prevalent this is consistent with the fact that geobacter do not tend to be favored in environments with high olrs wu et al 2015 although geobacter abundance declined somewhat during this period cod removal efficiencies were only slightly lower 92 3 90 5 table 2 genera other than geobacter can participate in diet walker et al 2018a and sequences from other bacterial species that could potentially participate in diet i e bacteria capable of extracellular electron transfer increased in abundance during stage 4 these results show that gac amendments kept reactor conditions optimal for biomethanogenesis when the olr reached levels as high as 25 0 kgcod m3 d by facilitating diet between bacteria and methanogens however it appears that when olrs are elevated diet capable bacteria other than geobacter become more significant members of the microbial community further investigation into participation by these other bacterial genera is required 5 conclusion the addition of gac to uasb reactors facilitated efficient treatment of raw incineration leachate even when olrs were as high as 36 7 kgcod m3 d non amended reactors were unable to treat this leachate and completely deteriorated within the first 17 days of the experiment when the olr was only 5 9 kgcod m3 d metagenomic analysis of samples collected from the reactor at different stages of the experiment suggested that the addition of gac resulted in an enrichment of geobacter and methanosarcina both organisms that are capable of diet the conductivity of aggregates collected from the reactor increased over time and was highest when genes coding for conductive filaments were most abundant these results are significant and should be used to develop strategies for efficient degradation of toxic waste with high

18716,the incomplete denitrification due to insufficient carbon resource in the wastewater treatment plants wwtps resulted in low nitrogen removal efficiency which has become a widespread problem in china and all around the world reducing the requirement of carbon source by manipulating the nitrogen removal pathway from conventional nitrification denitrification to partial nitrification denitrification is considered as an efficient solution in this article the feasibility of combining free nitrous acid fna sludge treatment and do control to achieve partial nitrification denitrification in a continuous flow system aerobic anoxic oxic process using real sewage was assessed the nitrite pathway was rapidly established in the experimental reactor within 23 days by simultaneously lowering do concentration in aerobic zone to 0 5 mg l and treating 30 of the activated sludge per day from the reactor in the fna sludge treatment unit with fna concentration of 1 2 mg n l and exposure time of 18 h the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were efficiently washed out and the partial nitrification process could maintain stable in the experimental reactor even after cease of fna treatment and increase of do concentrations in the main stream to 1 5 mg l with an average nitrite accumulation rate of above 78 in contrast the nitrite accumulation rate was just around 58 during low do concentrations phase and declined quickly to below 1 after the do concentrations were increased to 1 5 mg l in the control reactor which only utilized single strategy of do control to achieve nitrite pathway moreover a better sludge settleability and nitrogen removal performance could also be realized in the experimental reactor the results of nitrifying bacteria activities and quantities detection demonstrated that although nob activities in both reactors were effectively inhibited a certain amount of nob 6 26 106 copies g mlss were remained in the control reactor and multiplied rapidly as the do concentration increased which might break down the partial nitrification furthermore the quantity results of nitrogen cycling related functional genes showed that the increment of the ratio of nitrate reduced bacteria to total bacteria was 0 35 larger than that of nitric oxide bacteria in the control reactor while those two ratios increased similarly by 1 11 and 1 12 in the experimental reactor respectively which might be one potential cause of reduction in n2o emission of nitrite pathway achieved by fna based technologies graphical abstract image 1 keywords continuous process low c n real sewage nitrite pathway free nitrous acid do control bacteria community 1 introduction nitrogen pollution in aquatic ecosystems is a severe problem worldwide especially in developing countries like china by the end of 2017 there are still more than 30 lakes in china in the state of eutrophication mainly caused by nitrogen pollution despite lots of projects to improve water environment have been lunched since 2015 huang et al 2019 one of the most outstanding source of nitrogen pollution is the effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and it was reported that approximately 50 of wwtps in china did not meet the nitrogen discharge standard zhang et al 2016 the high nitrogen concentration in the effluent is primarily caused by the low carbon nitrogen ratio c n in the influent in most wwtps in china for example the c n ratios are only 3 3 and 4 0 on average in shanghai and beijing respectively hao et al 2015 jin et al 2014 sun et al 2016 insufficient carbon source in the influent leads to incomplete denitrification and resultant effects on nitrogen removal efficiency although addition of external carbon sources e g methanol and acetic acid could supplement complete denitrification it raises operating costs of wwtps and production of greenhouse gases and excessive sludge luo et al 2015 ma et al 2015 considering these drawbacks pathway altered from conventional nitrification denitrification to partial nitrification denitrification is a promising process which could not only reduce approximately 40 carbon demand for denitrification and 25 oxygen consumption for nitrification but also reduce the production of greenhouse gas and excessive sludge ge et al 2014 liu et al 2017 the key to achieve nitrite pathway is to selectively eliminate nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and retain ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in activated sludge sinha and annachhatre 2006 winkler and straka 2019 many approaches have been investigated to achieve nitrite pathway such as oxygen do concentration control sludge treatment by free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 high temperature and sludge retention time control peng and zhu 2006 regmi et al 2014a wang et al 2014 among those technologies do concentration control and fna sludge treatment are increasingly regarded as effective and promising technologies for achieving nitrite pathway the advantages of low do strategy are obvious mainly including cost savings by reduction of aeration rate dispense with extensive additional equipment and structures however its deficiencies cannot be neglected which limited the wide application of the sole method of low do firstly the established nitrite pathway by low do is prone to instability and is fragile to process disruptions besides the long establishment periods ma et al 2009 massara et al 2017 xue et al 2009 secondly some general problems including inefficiency of ammonia oxidation depression of sludge settleability and the increase of greenhouse emission were difficult to avoid as the consequences of low do in the system noda et al 2003 thus some researchers conclude that the low do strategy need to be coupled with other nitritation selection factors e g free nitrous acid inhibition to establish stable nitrite pathway in practice blackburne et al 2008b based on the finding that free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 is a strong biocidal agent that can cause cell lysis of many kinds of bacteria in wastewater treatment system wu et al 2018 and has a higher biocidal impact on nob than aob the nitrite pathway was successfully established in a sequencing batch reactor sbr through selective elimination of nob by treating 22 of the sludge from the bioreactor daily within a relative short establishment period of 15 days with no impact on ammonia oxidation efficiency wang et al 2014 in addition nitrite pathway achieved by this method could also contribute to the reduction of n2o emission wang et al 2016b improvement of sludge settleability li et al 2016 wang et al 2013 however as the fna treatment unit was required to be constantly presented to maintain the elimination effect of nob in main stream consumption of considerable dosage of nitrite and production of large amounts of nitrite containing wastewater from wash of treated sludge before return to main stream could offset the benefits that nitrite pathway brought nan et al 2019 wang et al 2014 moreover although there were some reports about successful achievement of nitrite pathway using fna most of which were carried out in uncontinuous flow systems using simulated wastewater duan et al 2018 wang et al 2014 2016b zhou et al 2011 a further investigation on the fna based technology which conducts in more representative continuous flow systems using real sewage and conforms better with the real situation in practice is lacked therefore a combined strategy of do control and fna sludge treatment might facilitate the stable nitrite pathway which integrates merits of both technologies the aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of combining fna sludge treatment and do control to establish stable nitrite pathway to be more representative and practical the experiment was conducted in continuous flow systems including two 70 l anaerobic anoxic oxic aao reactors receiving real sewage with one as a control and the other as the experimental reactor equipped with fna sludge treatment unit the optimal conditions in fna treatment unit including fna concentration and expose time for establishment of nitrite pathway were first determined by batch tests the do concentrations in aerobic zone were maintained at a low value of 0 5 mg l as the sludge was treated in the fna treatment unit and then the do concentrations were revised upward to 1 5 mg l after stable nitrite accumulation was achieved the fluctuations of nitrifying bacteria activities sludge settleability and nitrogen cycle bacteria populations were investigated and nitrite accumulation ratio along with the nitrogen removal performance in the two aao reactors were assessed and compared during the entire experiment 2 materials and methods 2 1 determination of optimal conditions for fna treatment unit to conduct this test a serious of reactors with a working volume of 1 l were set up and the activated sludge was obtained from the secondary settler in a wwtp in beijing the activities of aob and nob were tested immediately before fna treatment then 7 l of the sludge was divided evenly into seven identical reactors 1 l per reactor and nitrite stock solution 50 g n l was added to each reactor to produce the final fna concentrations of 0 0 0 4 0 8 1 2 1 6 2 0 and 2 4 mg n l respectively temperature was maintained at 25 0 0 5 c and ph was maintained at 6 0 0 1 using naoh and hcl solutions sludge samples were collected from each reactor every 6 h for 30 h and the activities of aob and nob were measured and expressed as the percentages of their activities prior to fna treatment the optimal conditions for fna treatment unit in the following experimental reactor were determinated on the results of tests described above under which conditions nob activity would be undetectable while aob activity would still remain as high as possible in possibly short exposure time 2 2 reactor set up and operation 2 2 1 reactor set up two identical continuous flow reactors made of polymethyl methacrylate with a working volume of 70 l were used in this study and each was connected to a secondary sedimentation tank which had a working volume of 18 9 l fig 1 one reactor severed as a control r1 and the other as an experiment reactor r2 with an fna treatment unit the fna unit was an enclosed cylindrical reactor with a working volume 10 l and equipped with a magnetic stirrer a temperature and ph control system the mainstream part of r1 and r2 was divided into ten equal compartments using removable baffles each with a volume of 7 l the first two compartments and the following two compartments equipped with a mechanical mixer each were established as anoxic zones and anaerobic zones respectively the last six compartments were established as oxic zones equipped with aeration device 2 2 2 reactor operation and monitoring the experiment was carried out in a wwtp in beijing and the real wastewater with low c n ratio and seed sludge were collected from the primary sedimentation tank and the secondary settler respectively main characteristics of the wastewater are listed in table 1 the operation of both r1 and r2 was divided into three phases with respect to different operating conditions phase i is a baseline phase and operation conditions of the two reactors were identical the influent flow velocity was 7 0 l h making a hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 h in both reactors the sludge retention time srt was maintained at 15 d by controlling sludge wastage the internal and external recycle ratios were 2 0 and 0 7 respectively the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration was 3000 500 mg l do concentrations were maintained at approximately 1 5 mg l in the aerobic zone using an on off airflow switch after the stable states were reached in phase i do in the aerobic zone of both r1 and r2 were lowered to 0 5 mg l in phase ii other operational conditions of the two reactors were still identical across control and treatment as well as along phase i and phase ii expect that an fna unit was added to r2 the operation processes of r2 were as follows 21 l mixed liquor 30 of the total reactor volume was collected from the last aerobic chamber over 1 h every day and condensed to 10 l resulting in a mlss of approximately 6000 mg l the condensed sludge was treated in the fna unit under the optimal conditions determinated in section 2 1 therefore the average sludge treatment frequency was 0 3 reactor volume per day after the treatment 10 l of fna treated condensed sludge was transferred to a sludge storage unit and then recirculated to the first anoxic chamber of r2 within 1 h after operations of r1 and r2 were stabilized in phase ii do concentrations in the aerobic zone of both r1 and r2 were brought to 1 5 mg l in phase iii the fna treatment unit was removed from r2 and operational conditions therefore identical as that of r1 which were as the same as those in phase i the operation temperature was maintained at 25 0 0 5 c and the ph was monitored but not controlled during all the phases the ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the influent and effluent from both reactors were measured every two days sludge samples were taken from r1 and r2 at the beginning and end of each phase for dna extraction and determination of nitrifying bacteria activities sludge settleability and nitrogen cycle bacteria populations in addition the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations and sludge volume index svi were determined every week 2 3 dna extraction and quantification of nitrogen cycle bacteria and functional genes 10 ml of each sludge sample was cold dried and used for microbial genomic dna extraction in triplicate using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals according to manufacturer s instructions the concentration of the total extracted dna was measured using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer thermo scientific nanodrop products wilmington de usa the abundances of nitrogen cycle bacteria and functional genes including aob nob nitrobacter and nitrospira and functional genes involved in denitrification processes were determined by real time pcr on a cfx96tm real time pcr system bio rad laboratories usa with a sybr method each reaction was performed in a total reaction mixture of 25 μl containing 9 5 μl nuclease free water 12 5 μl sybr premix ex taq ii takara dalian china 0 5 μl of each primer and 2 μl of dna the pcr amplification and detection program consisted of initial denaturation at 95 c for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 c 45 s at according annealing temperatures and 30 s at 72 c aob were targeted by the amoa function gene amoa total bacteria nitrobacter and nitrospira were targeted by 16s rrna genes the functional genes involved in denitrification processes nitrate reductase genes nitrite reductase genes and n2o reductase genes were targeted by narg and napa nirs and nirk and nosz respectively the primers used in qpcr were listed in table 2 tenfold serial dilutions of a known copy number of the plasmid dna were subjected to real time pcr to generate an external standard curve results with efficiency and correlation coefficients of above 95 and 0 98 respectively were employed triplicate data assays were performed for the decimally diluted standard plasmids samples and negative controls 2 4 analytical methods all wastewater samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter before analysis nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured by a continuous flow analytical system seal aa3 norderstedt germany in triplicate do ph and temperature were measured using a multiline multi 3630 ids wtw company germany mlss of the activated sludge were measured according to standard methods association 2005 and the activities of aob and nob were measured by a respirometer strathtox strathkelvin uk according to methods described in previous articles hao et al 2009 manser et al 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the optimal conditions of the fna treatment unit to determine the optimal conditions for the fna treatment unit to establish nitrite pathway in the main stream bioreactor batch tests were conducted to evaluate the inactivation of aob and nob under different fna concentrations and exposure times the remaining activities of aob and nob following fna treatment were shown in fig 2 a general decrease in the activities of both aob and nob could be observed after fna treatment the activities of aob were 54 5 and 39 3 as the fna concentrations were 0 8 and 1 2 mg n l with an exposure time of 18 h however the nob activities were both almost undetectable under the same treatment conditions these results are consistent with previous studies that nob is more sensitive to fna than aob kim et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 moreover the results illustrated that fna exposure time were also a crucial factor influencing the activities of aob and nob and should be took into consideration when utilized to establish nitrite pathway through fna sludge treatment for instance under the same fna concentration of 0 8 mg n l nob activities dropped from 25 0 to undetectable respectively when exposure time increased from 12 to 30 h thus considering operational efficiency and cost an fna concentration of 1 2 mg n l and an exposure time of 18 h were selected as the optimum conditions for subsequent bioreactor experiment in this study under which conditions nob were completely inactivated while aob still maintained the majority 52 50 of their activities different treatment temperatures properties and microbial community structures of used sludge could contribute to different optimum fna conditions in other reports coats et al 2017 duan et al 2018 wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2011 for instance an fna concentrations of 1 82 mg n l and an exposure time of 24 h were used to effectively eliminated nob wang et al 2016a 2016b and a higher fna concentrations of 3 64 mg n l deteriorated the settling properties of the sludge and caused significant loss of biomass during the long term operation of the mainstream reactor in the other article of them wang et al 2017a an fna concentration of 1 9 mg n l and an exposure time of 24 h were reported to be favorable conditions and a lower fna concentration of 1 1 mg n l could lead to poorer performance on nob elimination wang et al 2017b 3 2 performance of reactors with and without fna treatment unit 3 2 1 establishment and stabilization of nitrite pathway the operation of the control reactor r1 and experimental reactor r2 were divided into three phases and the nitrogen concentrations and the nitrite accumulation rate nar were shown in fig 3 in the baseline phase phase i the do concentrations in r1 and r2 were maintained at 1 5 mg l and nitrite was not accumulated in both reactors in phase ii do concentrations was decreased to 0 5 mg l in r2 and the fna treatment unit was added to treat 30 of the total sludge per day under the optimal conditions determined in section 3 1 the nar raised rapidly during the fna treatment period and reached to around 75 at day 53 and maintained stable during day 54 60 by contrast the nar in r1 increased to 58 84 at day 83 and remained stable in the following week in phase ii it took 23 days for r2 to establish stable nitrite pathway 30 days shorter than that of r1 moreover the average value of nar at stable stage of r2 in phase ii was also higher than that of r1 which were 76 95 1 91 and 58 12 1 11 respectively the establishment time and nar are two significant parameters to evaluate technologies to establish nitrite pathway kouba et al 2017 liu et al 2017 compared to previous reports the fna sludge treatment plus low do technology emerges its advantage on the aspect of shortening establishment time for instance the establishment time were 60 67 and 40 days respectively as the methods of low do free ammonia treatment and aerobic duration control were utilized to establish nitrite pathway in other researches regmi et al 2014b yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the combined restrain effect of fna and low do on the metabolism and multiplication of nob in this article might be attributed to the shorter establishment time pedrouso et al 2017 wen et al 2017 in the last phase the fna treatment unit was removed from r2 and the do concentrations in r1 and r2 were increased to 1 5 mg l as consequence the nar in r1 dropped rapidly from 56 63 on day 95 to 37 55 on day 97 and continued to decline quickly to 0 58 on day 121 and stayed at the same level with baseline phase until to the end of the experiment the result was similar to other reports using oxygen limited methods to establish nitrite pathway that as the do concentrations increased the nitrite pathway was easy to destroy guo et al 2009 liu and wang 2013 another study also reported that as the do concentration raised from 0 3 to 2 0 mg l the nitrite accumulation vanished guo et al 2009 the quick vanishing of nitrite accumulation might be because that nob were not completely washout in the reactor and the remained ones revived and outcompeted aob under high do concentration as nob multiplied faster than aob reino et al 2016 sinha and annachhatre 2006 by comparison the nitrite accumulation remained stable in r2 during phase iii with a high nar at 78 41 5 66 on average 3 2 2 nitrogen removal performance to assess the nitrogen removal performance of reactors with and without fna treatment the nh4 n concentrations in influent nh4 n no3 n and tn concentrations in effluent and tn rate in r1 and r2 were analyzed and compared all along the three phases during the entire experimental period fig 4 in phase i the operation conditions of r1 and r2 were identical and were representative wwtps in china zhang et al 2016 as shown in fig 4 the total nitrogen concentrations were relatively high in the effluence of r1 and r2 and the main nitrogen form was no3 n this problem is also widespread in chinese wwtps that low c n ratio in the influent normally contribute to poor nitrogen removal performance in traditional nitrification denitrification process principally caused by inefficient denitrification in the anaerobic zone due to insufficient carbon source han et al 2016 hao et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 as do concentrations decreased to 0 5 mg l in phase ii the tn removal rate increased accordingly as nitrite accumulation and reached the highest value at day 83 when the nitrite pathway was successfully established and remained stable in the following week with an average of 61 2 02 the improvement of tn removal rate in this phase might be because that as the nitrite pathway took place in r1 and alleviated the demand for carbon source to some extent bao et al 2017 ge et al 2014 however the ammonia removal rate decreased as do concentration was brought down to 0 5 mg l which was consistent with previous studies that low do concentrations could facilitate nitrite accumulation but it decreased the activity of aob and therefore failed to achieve high ammonia removal efficiencies ciudad et al 2005 kappeler and gujer 1992 kwak et al 2012 wen et al 2017 similar to r1 nh4 n concentrations in the effluent also increased after do concentration decreased to 0 5 mg l in r2 to enhance ammonia oxidation rate and to improve tn removal efficiencies further the do concentrations were reset to 1 5 mg l after the nitrite pathway was successfully established in r1 and r2 the nh4 n concentrations gradually decreased after do concentrations increased to 1 5 mg l in r1 while the nitrite pathway was destroyed as shown in fig 3 and the no3 n and tn concentrations increased accordingly thus the highest tn removal rate achieved in r1 was 61 2 02 when the nitrite pathway was successfully established under low do of 0 5 mg l and a higher do of 1 5 mg l could easily destroy the nitrite pathway in comparison the nh4 n and tn concentrations decreased in r2 and meanwhile the nitrite pathway was remained as do concentrations increased to 1 5 mg l fig 4 the best and stable tn removal performance in r2 was acquired in phase iii for more than 100 days with an average value of 76 4 15 which increased by 20 and 15 respectively compared to that of phase i and in stable nitrite pathway stage in r1 although the tn removal rate might be little lower than those of in other reports that used simulation wastewater and other kinds of reactors the tn concentrations in the effluence were lower than the strictest wastewater discharge standard in china 15 mg l for tn the grade i a discharge standard wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2011 3 3 changes of sludge settleability and nitrification bacterial activities and populations the variations of sludge volume index svi relative activities of aob and nob and the abundance of aob amoa and nob groups nitrospira and nitrobacter were determined to verify the effects of low do and fna treatment on sludge settleability and nitrifying bacteria during establishment of nitrite pathway fig 5 showed that the relative activities of nob dropped rapidly from 96 21 to 19 72 and then to 5 12 as do concentration decreased from 1 5 to 0 5 mg l on day 29 59 and 95 respectively in r1 in contrast the relative activities of aob decreased slightly from 92 25 to 86 17 and finally to 79 51 under the same conditions the disparity between activities of aob and nob under low do concentrations might contribute to the stable nitrite accumulation rate and achievement of nitrite pathway at phase ii in r1 which was also demonstrated in previous studies liu and wang 2013 ma et al 2009 however the decline rate of nob populations was smaller than that of nob activities which were 94 67 and 70 28 respectively although low do concentration of 0 5 mg l in r1 is unfavorable to nob growth and activity it was difficult to wash out most of the nob from the system liu et al 2018 yan et al 2018 the certain amount of nob remained in the system multiplied rapidly from 6 26 106 to 2 80 107 copies g mlss as the do raised from 0 5 mg l to 1 5 mg l at phase iii in r1 table s1 accompany with a rapid rise in nob activities from 5 12 to 103 25 which resulted in the decrease of nitrite accumulation and destruction of nitrite pathway fig 3 in r2 the addition of fna unit led to the decrease in aob activities as do concentration decreased from 1 5 mg l to 0 5 mg l compared to r1 however the obvious disparity between activities of aob and nob could still be observed the relative activities of aob and nob under low do concentration of 0 5 mg l at the end of phase ii were 55 32 and 2 12 respectively unlike to r1 there was no significant difference p 0 05 between decline rate of nob populations and nob activities moreover no increase of nob activities and populations could be observed as the do concentration raised from 0 5 mg l to 1 5 mg l the deterioration of sludge settleability could be clear observed in the control reactor using low do as the single strategy to achieved nitrite pathway with svi increased from 104 to 156 ml g as do concentration decreased from 1 5 mg l to 0 5 mg l the results were consistent with previous researches that employed do control as the only or mainly selection factor to established nitrite pathway ma et al reported a negative impact of nitrite pathway realized by controlling the do concentration at 0 4 0 7 mg l on the sludge settleability ma et al 2009 shaopo et al also found that low do 1 0 mg l could lead to poor sludge settleability in a cyclic activated sludge technology cast system shaopo et al 2011 the overgrowth of filamentous microorganisms thiothrix spp type 021n and type 1851 under low do concentrations might contribute to the poorer sludge settleability which need further investigation though ma et al 2013 martins et al 2003 similar to the previous report ma et al 2009 the svi in r1 decreased to 98 ml g on day 199 comparable p 0 05 to that in the baseline phase phase i as do concentrations were turned back to 1 5 mg l in phase iii in the contrast the svi decreased slightly from 108 ml g to 81 ml g as the combined strategy of low do and fna sludge treatment were implied in r2 which indicated that the deterioration of sludge settleability caused by low do was eliminated it was reported that particle size d50 of the sludge decreased from around 185 to 50 mm following fna treatment wang et al 2013 and svi positively correlated significantly p 0 05 with floc size jin et al 2003 which might lead to good sludge settleability after fna treatment on the other hand biocidal effect of fna could cause increasement of extracellular polymeric substances eps wang et al 2019 zahedi et al 2018 especially the content of protein which was recognized to be favorable for sludge settling chen et al 2001 he et al 2017 2018 a good sludge settleability was maintained in the following experiment in r2 which agreed with the results of previous studies that used the strategy of fna sludge treatment to achieve nitrite pathway wang et al 2013 2014 they found that svi in the experimental reactor was approximate to that in the control reactor and the sludge settleability was not significantly affected by fna treatment 3 4 dynamics of functional genes related to nitrogen cycling to investigate the changes of nitrogen cycling bacteria during nitrite pathway establishment by independent low do treatment and low do with fna sludge treatment the dynamics of corresponding functional genes were analyzed the proportions of the quantified genes to total bacterial 16s rrna gene copy number and the alterations after the nitrite pathway establishment in r1 and r2 were calculated and presented in fig 6 the functional genes relevant to ammonia oxidation amoa increased by 2 14 while the nitrite oxidation bacteria nitrospira and nitrobacter nob decreased by 0 09 in r1 respectively the results were consistent with the changes of functional bacteria copy number in sludge that aob were largely reserved decreased slightly from 4 30 107 to 2 96 107 copies g mlss while nob were washed out decreased dramatic from 2 11 107 to 6 26 106 copies g mlss during the nitrite pathway establishment fig 5 table s1 it was a consensus that the aob remained and nob were washed out during the achievement of nitrite pathway regardless of which methods were applied blackburne et al 2008a liu et al 2018 however the combined method of low do with fna sludge treatment used in r2 exhibited the advantage on washing out nob and resulted in a larger decrement in proportion of 0 75 than that of r1 the copy numbers of remained nob in r1 and r2 at the end of phase ii were 6 26 106 and 3 40 105 copies g mlss fig 5 table s1 with the relatives abundances of nitrobacter being 17 14 and 1 78 respectively which indicated that the combined strategy of low do with fna sludge treatment could eliminate nitrobacter more effectively than low do alone the advantage of combined strategy of low do and fna treatment on washing out nob especially nitrobacter might be one of the contributing factors to the stable nitrite pathway in r2 moreover functional genes involved in reducing nitrate to nitrite narg and napa decreased by 0 25 in r2 during the establishment of nitrite pathway while the number of that in r1 was 0 05 the reduction of nitrate to nitrite is a major step that theoretically consumes 40 carbon source of the entire denitrification demands and the decline of nitrate reduction could divert more surplus carbon source to bacteria participating in the rest of nitrogen reduction process and therefore improve the total nitrogen removal performance qian et al 2019 zielinska et al 2016 meanwhile denitrifying bacteria that harbored nitrite reductase genes nirs and nirk were also enriched in both r1 and r2 during the establishment of nitrite pathway with the increase were 0 97 and 1 11 respectively it could be noticed that r2 depleted more nitrate reductase genes and enriched more nitrite reductase genes than r1 simultaneously this might be because that treatment of sludge in fna unit combined with low do in the main steam selectively remained denitrifiers that could only reduce nitrite and eliminated denitrifiers that could only reduce nitrate focht and chang 1975 lu et al 2014 it was agreed with our previous study that the abundance of family rhodocyclaceae including a majority of genera that could use nitrite as an electron acceptor such as thauera zoogloea and dechloromonas increased slightly after fna treatment jiang et al 2018 the directional selection and selective optimization of the combined strategy of low do and fna treatment on denitrifying microbiology community might be another contributing factor to the stable nitrite pathway process in r2 which required further investigated though in addition the achievement of nitrite pathway also facilitated the enrichment of n2o reductase genes nosz which reduces n2o to n2 in r1 the portion of nosz genes increased by 0 6 significantly smaller p 0 05 than the increment of nitrite reductase genes the significant difference between the increment of these two kinds of functional genes might be one of the potential causes that enhance the emission of n2o when low do was applied as the main selected factor to achieve nitrite way reported in previous studies law et al 2011 mampaey et al 2016 wunderlin et al 2012 by comparison similar amount of nitrite reductase genes 1 11 and oxide reductase genes 1 12 were enriched in r2 which might be explained the observations in some reports that n2o emission was not increased as fna based technologies were used to establish nitrite pathway wang et al 2013 2014 2016b however there were also article reported that n2o emission increased in a nitrite pathway system with fna treatment on account of nitrifier denitrification duan et al 2018 hence more and further researches are required to draw firm conclusions 3 5 implications for wastewater treatment nitrogen removal via nitrite pathway in the mainstream is regarded as a promising technology to fulfill the increasing demand of energy saving and resource recovering wastewater treatment processes achieving stable nitrite pathway is one of the major bottlenecks for its wider practical applications an approach with great prospects that could establish stable nitrite pathway is approached in this study by treating sludge with fna in side stream and controlling do concentrations in mainstream simultaneously a long term stable nitrite pathway is achieved in a continuous process treating real sewage compared to previous reports that combined fna sludge treatment and do control to achieve nitritation the following differentia are lying in our researches first of all the fna treatment unit and the low do 0 5 mg l is not required constantly presented in this system the fna treatment was stopped and do concentrations were increased to 1 5 mg l when stable nitrite pathway was achieved one of the advantages of casing fna sludge treatment is that the operational costs could be largely decreased by significant reduction of fna consumption and nitrite containing water production from washing fna treated sludge and appropriate treatment of the latter should be seriously considered in practical applications to reduce this part of costs a decrease of sludge treatment frequencies from 1 4 to 1 8 wang et al 2016a and a low sludge treatment frequency of 1 16 wang et al 2017b were implied by previous researches leading to no significant loss of the mainstream reactor performance previous studies have revealed that the fna based approach is economically favorable due to significant savings in aeration energy methanol addition and sludge handling despite the additional costs of fna treatment duan et al 2018 wang et al 2016a 2017a and the strategy proposed in this study could further promote the favorableness in economy another advantage of casing fna sludge treatment is reducing the potential nob adaptation to fna treatment which was reported in recent studies coats et al 2017 duan et al 2019 and resulted from resistance to fna treatment of nob combining of appropriate nob controlling strategies fna treatment and low do could potentially cope with the nob adaptation challenge in this study duan et al 2019 on the other hand the advantages of increasing do concentrations to 1 5 mg l after the nitrite pathway is achieved are including avoidance of ammonia oxidation inefficiency and sludge settleability depression which were reported to be a generally defect of nitrite pathway achieved by low do wunderlin et al 2012 zhou et al 2008 however the deficiency of stopping fna treatment and increasing do concentrations in the reactor cannot be neglected too the risks of destruction of nitrite pathway in the mainstream could increase with the presence of a slight amount of nob mainly nitrospira and lack of any suppressing forces fna or low do the breakdown of nitrite pathway did not occur in this study might be contributed from 1 the vast majority of nob 99 were washed during the establishment of nitrite pathway under combined selective pressures of fna and low do fig 5 table s1 and moreover most of the remained nob are nitrospira 96 which were reported demonstrating no superiority over aob under a high do gilbert et al 2014 regmi et al 2014b wang et al 2016a 2 apart from acclimation and optimization of nitrifying bacterial community the combined strategy of fna treatment and low do could also acclimate and optimize the denifying bacterial community through enriching nitrite and nitrous oxide reduction denitrifiers and eliminating nitrate reduction denitrifiers simultaneously fig 6 which enhanced the stability of nitrite pathway against fluctuation of environmental factors the other difference between this study and previous studies is that a more representative continuous wastewater treatment process aao process and real wastewater were used in this study which might be closer to the actual situation and more instructive to practical applications of this technology but it could lead to reactor performance not as good as the sequencing batch reactor using synthetic wastewater for instance a nar of more 80 was achieved in an sbr treating synthetic wastewater containing ammonium at 57 mg of n l without organic carbon wang et al 2016a and a less n2o mission was observed wang et al 2016b at last it is worthy of note that a longer experiments period in pilot scale or full scale tests are required to fully verify the stability of the established nitrite pathway and the feasibility of this strategy 4 conclusions the feasibility of combining fna sludge treatment and do control to establish nitrite pathway in a continuous flow system using real sewage was assessed and the reactor performance and dynamics of functional bacteria related to nitrogen cycling were investigated and compared the following conclusions were drawn an fna concentration of 1 2 mg n l and an exposure time of 18 h were optimum conditions to simultaneously inactivate nob completely and maintain aob the stable nitrite pathway was successfully established through combining fna sludge treatment and do control with the majority of nob washout an average nitrite accumulation rate of 78 and an average total nitrogen removal rate of 76 were achieved in a continuous flow system at do concentration of 1 5 mg l using real sewage which increased by 20 and 15 respectively compared to baseline phase and stable nitrite pathway phase in control reactor established by only low do control the nitrite pathway established by combining fna sludge treatment and do control showed better sludge settleability and process stability than that established by do control merely as do concentration raised from 0 5 mg l to 1 5 mg l the nitrification and denitrification bacteria communities were acclimated and optimized during the establishment of nitrite pathway

18716,the incomplete denitrification due to insufficient carbon resource in the wastewater treatment plants wwtps resulted in low nitrogen removal efficiency which has become a widespread problem in china and all around the world reducing the requirement of carbon source by manipulating the nitrogen removal pathway from conventional nitrification denitrification to partial nitrification denitrification is considered as an efficient solution in this article the feasibility of combining free nitrous acid fna sludge treatment and do control to achieve partial nitrification denitrification in a continuous flow system aerobic anoxic oxic process using real sewage was assessed the nitrite pathway was rapidly established in the experimental reactor within 23 days by simultaneously lowering do concentration in aerobic zone to 0 5 mg l and treating 30 of the activated sludge per day from the reactor in the fna sludge treatment unit with fna concentration of 1 2 mg n l and exposure time of 18 h the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were efficiently washed out and the partial nitrification process could maintain stable in the experimental reactor even after cease of fna treatment and increase of do concentrations in the main stream to 1 5 mg l with an average nitrite accumulation rate of above 78 in contrast the nitrite accumulation rate was just around 58 during low do concentrations phase and declined quickly to below 1 after the do concentrations were increased to 1 5 mg l in the control reactor which only utilized single strategy of do control to achieve nitrite pathway moreover a better sludge settleability and nitrogen removal performance could also be realized in the experimental reactor the results of nitrifying bacteria activities and quantities detection demonstrated that although nob activities in both reactors were effectively inhibited a certain amount of nob 6 26 106 copies g mlss were remained in the control reactor and multiplied rapidly as the do concentration increased which might break down the partial nitrification furthermore the quantity results of nitrogen cycling related functional genes showed that the increment of the ratio of nitrate reduced bacteria to total bacteria was 0 35 larger than that of nitric oxide bacteria in the control reactor while those two ratios increased similarly by 1 11 and 1 12 in the experimental reactor respectively which might be one potential cause of reduction in n2o emission of nitrite pathway achieved by fna based technologies graphical abstract image 1 keywords continuous process low c n real sewage nitrite pathway free nitrous acid do control bacteria community 1 introduction nitrogen pollution in aquatic ecosystems is a severe problem worldwide especially in developing countries like china by the end of 2017 there are still more than 30 lakes in china in the state of eutrophication mainly caused by nitrogen pollution despite lots of projects to improve water environment have been lunched since 2015 huang et al 2019 one of the most outstanding source of nitrogen pollution is the effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and it was reported that approximately 50 of wwtps in china did not meet the nitrogen discharge standard zhang et al 2016 the high nitrogen concentration in the effluent is primarily caused by the low carbon nitrogen ratio c n in the influent in most wwtps in china for example the c n ratios are only 3 3 and 4 0 on average in shanghai and beijing respectively hao et al 2015 jin et al 2014 sun et al 2016 insufficient carbon source in the influent leads to incomplete denitrification and resultant effects on nitrogen removal efficiency although addition of external carbon sources e g methanol and acetic acid could supplement complete denitrification it raises operating costs of wwtps and production of greenhouse gases and excessive sludge luo et al 2015 ma et al 2015 considering these drawbacks pathway altered from conventional nitrification denitrification to partial nitrification denitrification is a promising process which could not only reduce approximately 40 carbon demand for denitrification and 25 oxygen consumption for nitrification but also reduce the production of greenhouse gas and excessive sludge ge et al 2014 liu et al 2017 the key to achieve nitrite pathway is to selectively eliminate nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and retain ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in activated sludge sinha and annachhatre 2006 winkler and straka 2019 many approaches have been investigated to achieve nitrite pathway such as oxygen do concentration control sludge treatment by free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 high temperature and sludge retention time control peng and zhu 2006 regmi et al 2014a wang et al 2014 among those technologies do concentration control and fna sludge treatment are increasingly regarded as effective and promising technologies for achieving nitrite pathway the advantages of low do strategy are obvious mainly including cost savings by reduction of aeration rate dispense with extensive additional equipment and structures however its deficiencies cannot be neglected which limited the wide application of the sole method of low do firstly the established nitrite pathway by low do is prone to instability and is fragile to process disruptions besides the long establishment periods ma et al 2009 massara et al 2017 xue et al 2009 secondly some general problems including inefficiency of ammonia oxidation depression of sludge settleability and the increase of greenhouse emission were difficult to avoid as the consequences of low do in the system noda et al 2003 thus some researchers conclude that the low do strategy need to be coupled with other nitritation selection factors e g free nitrous acid inhibition to establish stable nitrite pathway in practice blackburne et al 2008b based on the finding that free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 is a strong biocidal agent that can cause cell lysis of many kinds of bacteria in wastewater treatment system wu et al 2018 and has a higher biocidal impact on nob than aob the nitrite pathway was successfully established in a sequencing batch reactor sbr through selective elimination of nob by treating 22 of the sludge from the bioreactor daily within a relative short establishment period of 15 days with no impact on ammonia oxidation efficiency wang et al 2014 in addition nitrite pathway achieved by this method could also contribute to the reduction of n2o emission wang et al 2016b improvement of sludge settleability li et al 2016 wang et al 2013 however as the fna treatment unit was required to be constantly presented to maintain the elimination effect of nob in main stream consumption of considerable dosage of nitrite and production of large amounts of nitrite containing wastewater from wash of treated sludge before return to main stream could offset the benefits that nitrite pathway brought nan et al 2019 wang et al 2014 moreover although there were some reports about successful achievement of nitrite pathway using fna most of which were carried out in uncontinuous flow systems using simulated wastewater duan et al 2018 wang et al 2014 2016b zhou et al 2011 a further investigation on the fna based technology which conducts in more representative continuous flow systems using real sewage and conforms better with the real situation in practice is lacked therefore a combined strategy of do control and fna sludge treatment might facilitate the stable nitrite pathway which integrates merits of both technologies the aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of combining fna sludge treatment and do control to establish stable nitrite pathway to be more representative and practical the experiment was conducted in continuous flow systems including two 70 l anaerobic anoxic oxic aao reactors receiving real sewage with one as a control and the other as the experimental reactor equipped with fna sludge treatment unit the optimal conditions in fna treatment unit including fna concentration and expose time for establishment of nitrite pathway were first determined by batch tests the do concentrations in aerobic zone were maintained at a low value of 0 5 mg l as the sludge was treated in the fna treatment unit and then the do concentrations were revised upward to 1 5 mg l after stable nitrite accumulation was achieved the fluctuations of nitrifying bacteria activities sludge settleability and nitrogen cycle bacteria populations were investigated and nitrite accumulation ratio along with the nitrogen removal performance in the two aao reactors were assessed and compared during the entire experiment 2 materials and methods 2 1 determination of optimal conditions for fna treatment unit to conduct this test a serious of reactors with a working volume of 1 l were set up and the activated sludge was obtained from the secondary settler in a wwtp in beijing the activities of aob and nob were tested immediately before fna treatment then 7 l of the sludge was divided evenly into seven identical reactors 1 l per reactor and nitrite stock solution 50 g n l was added to each reactor to produce the final fna concentrations of 0 0 0 4 0 8 1 2 1 6 2 0 and 2 4 mg n l respectively temperature was maintained at 25 0 0 5 c and ph was maintained at 6 0 0 1 using naoh and hcl solutions sludge samples were collected from each reactor every 6 h for 30 h and the activities of aob and nob were measured and expressed as the percentages of their activities prior to fna treatment the optimal conditions for fna treatment unit in the following experimental reactor were determinated on the results of tests described above under which conditions nob activity would be undetectable while aob activity would still remain as high as possible in possibly short exposure time 2 2 reactor set up and operation 2 2 1 reactor set up two identical continuous flow reactors made of polymethyl methacrylate with a working volume of 70 l were used in this study and each was connected to a secondary sedimentation tank which had a working volume of 18 9 l fig 1 one reactor severed as a control r1 and the other as an experiment reactor r2 with an fna treatment unit the fna unit was an enclosed cylindrical reactor with a working volume 10 l and equipped with a magnetic stirrer a temperature and ph control system the mainstream part of r1 and r2 was divided into ten equal compartments using removable baffles each with a volume of 7 l the first two compartments and the following two compartments equipped with a mechanical mixer each were established as anoxic zones and anaerobic zones respectively the last six compartments were established as oxic zones equipped with aeration device 2 2 2 reactor operation and monitoring the experiment was carried out in a wwtp in beijing and the real wastewater with low c n ratio and seed sludge were collected from the primary sedimentation tank and the secondary settler respectively main characteristics of the wastewater are listed in table 1 the operation of both r1 and r2 was divided into three phases with respect to different operating conditions phase i is a baseline phase and operation conditions of the two reactors were identical the influent flow velocity was 7 0 l h making a hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 h in both reactors the sludge retention time srt was maintained at 15 d by controlling sludge wastage the internal and external recycle ratios were 2 0 and 0 7 respectively the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration was 3000 500 mg l do concentrations were maintained at approximately 1 5 mg l in the aerobic zone using an on off airflow switch after the stable states were reached in phase i do in the aerobic zone of both r1 and r2 were lowered to 0 5 mg l in phase ii other operational conditions of the two reactors were still identical across control and treatment as well as along phase i and phase ii expect that an fna unit was added to r2 the operation processes of r2 were as follows 21 l mixed liquor 30 of the total reactor volume was collected from the last aerobic chamber over 1 h every day and condensed to 10 l resulting in a mlss of approximately 6000 mg l the condensed sludge was treated in the fna unit under the optimal conditions determinated in section 2 1 therefore the average sludge treatment frequency was 0 3 reactor volume per day after the treatment 10 l of fna treated condensed sludge was transferred to a sludge storage unit and then recirculated to the first anoxic chamber of r2 within 1 h after operations of r1 and r2 were stabilized in phase ii do concentrations in the aerobic zone of both r1 and r2 were brought to 1 5 mg l in phase iii the fna treatment unit was removed from r2 and operational conditions therefore identical as that of r1 which were as the same as those in phase i the operation temperature was maintained at 25 0 0 5 c and the ph was monitored but not controlled during all the phases the ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the influent and effluent from both reactors were measured every two days sludge samples were taken from r1 and r2 at the beginning and end of each phase for dna extraction and determination of nitrifying bacteria activities sludge settleability and nitrogen cycle bacteria populations in addition the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations and sludge volume index svi were determined every week 2 3 dna extraction and quantification of nitrogen cycle bacteria and functional genes 10 ml of each sludge sample was cold dried and used for microbial genomic dna extraction in triplicate using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals according to manufacturer s instructions the concentration of the total extracted dna was measured using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer thermo scientific nanodrop products wilmington de usa the abundances of nitrogen cycle bacteria and functional genes including aob nob nitrobacter and nitrospira and functional genes involved in denitrification processes were determined by real time pcr on a cfx96tm real time pcr system bio rad laboratories usa with a sybr method each reaction was performed in a total reaction mixture of 25 μl containing 9 5 μl nuclease free water 12 5 μl sybr premix ex taq ii takara dalian china 0 5 μl of each primer and 2 μl of dna the pcr amplification and detection program consisted of initial denaturation at 95 c for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 c 45 s at according annealing temperatures and 30 s at 72 c aob were targeted by the amoa function gene amoa total bacteria nitrobacter and nitrospira were targeted by 16s rrna genes the functional genes involved in denitrification processes nitrate reductase genes nitrite reductase genes and n2o reductase genes were targeted by narg and napa nirs and nirk and nosz respectively the primers used in qpcr were listed in table 2 tenfold serial dilutions of a known copy number of the plasmid dna were subjected to real time pcr to generate an external standard curve results with efficiency and correlation coefficients of above 95 and 0 98 respectively were employed triplicate data assays were performed for the decimally diluted standard plasmids samples and negative controls 2 4 analytical methods all wastewater samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter before analysis nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured by a continuous flow analytical system seal aa3 norderstedt germany in triplicate do ph and temperature were measured using a multiline multi 3630 ids wtw company germany mlss of the activated sludge were measured according to standard methods association 2005 and the activities of aob and nob were measured by a respirometer strathtox strathkelvin uk according to methods described in previous articles hao et al 2009 manser et al 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the optimal conditions of the fna treatment unit to determine the optimal conditions for the fna treatment unit to establish nitrite pathway in the main stream bioreactor batch tests were conducted to evaluate the inactivation of aob and nob under different fna concentrations and exposure times the remaining activities of aob and nob following fna treatment were shown in fig 2 a general decrease in the activities of both aob and nob could be observed after fna treatment the activities of aob were 54 5 and 39 3 as the fna concentrations were 0 8 and 1 2 mg n l with an exposure time of 18 h however the nob activities were both almost undetectable under the same treatment conditions these results are consistent with previous studies that nob is more sensitive to fna than aob kim et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 moreover the results illustrated that fna exposure time were also a crucial factor influencing the activities of aob and nob and should be took into consideration when utilized to establish nitrite pathway through fna sludge treatment for instance under the same fna concentration of 0 8 mg n l nob activities dropped from 25 0 to undetectable respectively when exposure time increased from 12 to 30 h thus considering operational efficiency and cost an fna concentration of 1 2 mg n l and an exposure time of 18 h were selected as the optimum conditions for subsequent bioreactor experiment in this study under which conditions nob were completely inactivated while aob still maintained the majority 52 50 of their activities different treatment temperatures properties and microbial community structures of used sludge could contribute to different optimum fna conditions in other reports coats et al 2017 duan et al 2018 wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2011 for instance an fna concentrations of 1 82 mg n l and an exposure time of 24 h were used to effectively eliminated nob wang et al 2016a 2016b and a higher fna concentrations of 3 64 mg n l deteriorated the settling properties of the sludge and caused significant loss of biomass during the long term operation of the mainstream reactor in the other article of them wang et al 2017a an fna concentration of 1 9 mg n l and an exposure time of 24 h were reported to be favorable conditions and a lower fna concentration of 1 1 mg n l could lead to poorer performance on nob elimination wang et al 2017b 3 2 performance of reactors with and without fna treatment unit 3 2 1 establishment and stabilization of nitrite pathway the operation of the control reactor r1 and experimental reactor r2 were divided into three phases and the nitrogen concentrations and the nitrite accumulation rate nar were shown in fig 3 in the baseline phase phase i the do concentrations in r1 and r2 were maintained at 1 5 mg l and nitrite was not accumulated in both reactors in phase ii do concentrations was decreased to 0 5 mg l in r2 and the fna treatment unit was added to treat 30 of the total sludge per day under the optimal conditions determined in section 3 1 the nar raised rapidly during the fna treatment period and reached to around 75 at day 53 and maintained stable during day 54 60 by contrast the nar in r1 increased to 58 84 at day 83 and remained stable in the following week in phase ii it took 23 days for r2 to establish stable nitrite pathway 30 days shorter than that of r1 moreover the average value of nar at stable stage of r2 in phase ii was also higher than that of r1 which were 76 95 1 91 and 58 12 1 11 respectively the establishment time and nar are two significant parameters to evaluate technologies to establish nitrite pathway kouba et al 2017 liu et al 2017 compared to previous reports the fna sludge treatment plus low do technology emerges its advantage on the aspect of shortening establishment time for instance the establishment time were 60 67 and 40 days respectively as the methods of low do free ammonia treatment and aerobic duration control were utilized to establish nitrite pathway in other researches regmi et al 2014b yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the combined restrain effect of fna and low do on the metabolism and multiplication of nob in this article might be attributed to the shorter establishment time pedrouso et al 2017 wen et al 2017 in the last phase the fna treatment unit was removed from r2 and the do concentrations in r1 and r2 were increased to 1 5 mg l as consequence the nar in r1 dropped rapidly from 56 63 on day 95 to 37 55 on day 97 and continued to decline quickly to 0 58 on day 121 and stayed at the same level with baseline phase until to the end of the experiment the result was similar to other reports using oxygen limited methods to establish nitrite pathway that as the do concentrations increased the nitrite pathway was easy to destroy guo et al 2009 liu and wang 2013 another study also reported that as the do concentration raised from 0 3 to 2 0 mg l the nitrite accumulation vanished guo et al 2009 the quick vanishing of nitrite accumulation might be because that nob were not completely washout in the reactor and the remained ones revived and outcompeted aob under high do concentration as nob multiplied faster than aob reino et al 2016 sinha and annachhatre 2006 by comparison the nitrite accumulation remained stable in r2 during phase iii with a high nar at 78 41 5 66 on average 3 2 2 nitrogen removal performance to assess the nitrogen removal performance of reactors with and without fna treatment the nh4 n concentrations in influent nh4 n no3 n and tn concentrations in effluent and tn rate in r1 and r2 were analyzed and compared all along the three phases during the entire experimental period fig 4 in phase i the operation conditions of r1 and r2 were identical and were representative wwtps in china zhang et al 2016 as shown in fig 4 the total nitrogen concentrations were relatively high in the effluence of r1 and r2 and the main nitrogen form was no3 n this problem is also widespread in chinese wwtps that low c n ratio in the influent normally contribute to poor nitrogen removal performance in traditional nitrification denitrification process principally caused by inefficient denitrification in the anaerobic zone due to insufficient carbon source han et al 2016 hao et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 as do concentrations decreased to 0 5 mg l in phase ii the tn removal rate increased accordingly as nitrite accumulation and reached the highest value at day 83 when the nitrite pathway was successfully established and remained stable in the following week with an average of 61 2 02 the improvement of tn removal rate in this phase might be because that as the nitrite pathway took place in r1 and alleviated the demand for carbon source to some extent bao et al 2017 ge et al 2014 however the ammonia removal rate decreased as do concentration was brought down to 0 5 mg l which was consistent with previous studies that low do concentrations could facilitate nitrite accumulation but it decreased the activity of aob and therefore failed to achieve high ammonia removal efficiencies ciudad et al 2005 kappeler and gujer 1992 kwak et al 2012 wen et al 2017 similar to r1 nh4 n concentrations in the effluent also increased after do concentration decreased to 0 5 mg l in r2 to enhance ammonia oxidation rate and to improve tn removal efficiencies further the do concentrations were reset to 1 5 mg l after the nitrite pathway was successfully established in r1 and r2 the nh4 n concentrations gradually decreased after do concentrations increased to 1 5 mg l in r1 while the nitrite pathway was destroyed as shown in fig 3 and the no3 n and tn concentrations increased accordingly thus the highest tn removal rate achieved in r1 was 61 2 02 when the nitrite pathway was successfully established under low do of 0 5 mg l and a higher do of 1 5 mg l could easily destroy the nitrite pathway in comparison the nh4 n and tn concentrations decreased in r2 and meanwhile the nitrite pathway was remained as do concentrations increased to 1 5 mg l fig 4 the best and stable tn removal performance in r2 was acquired in phase iii for more than 100 days with an average value of 76 4 15 which increased by 20 and 15 respectively compared to that of phase i and in stable nitrite pathway stage in r1 although the tn removal rate might be little lower than those of in other reports that used simulation wastewater and other kinds of reactors the tn concentrations in the effluence were lower than the strictest wastewater discharge standard in china 15 mg l for tn the grade i a discharge standard wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2011 3 3 changes of sludge settleability and nitrification bacterial activities and populations the variations of sludge volume index svi relative activities of aob and nob and the abundance of aob amoa and nob groups nitrospira and nitrobacter were determined to verify the effects of low do and fna treatment on sludge settleability and nitrifying bacteria during establishment of nitrite pathway fig 5 showed that the relative activities of nob dropped rapidly from 96 21 to 19 72 and then to 5 12 as do concentration decreased from 1 5 to 0 5 mg l on day 29 59 and 95 respectively in r1 in contrast the relative activities of aob decreased slightly from 92 25 to 86 17 and finally to 79 51 under the same conditions the disparity between activities of aob and nob under low do concentrations might contribute to the stable nitrite accumulation rate and achievement of nitrite pathway at phase ii in r1 which was also demonstrated in previous studies liu and wang 2013 ma et al 2009 however the decline rate of nob populations was smaller than that of nob activities which were 94 67 and 70 28 respectively although low do concentration of 0 5 mg l in r1 is unfavorable to nob growth and activity it was difficult to wash out most of the nob from the system liu et al 2018 yan et al 2018 the certain amount of nob remained in the system multiplied rapidly from 6 26 106 to 2 80 107 copies g mlss as the do raised from 0 5 mg l to 1 5 mg l at phase iii in r1 table s1 accompany with a rapid rise in nob activities from 5 12 to 103 25 which resulted in the decrease of nitrite accumulation and destruction of nitrite pathway fig 3 in r2 the addition of fna unit led to the decrease in aob activities as do concentration decreased from 1 5 mg l to 0 5 mg l compared to r1 however the obvious disparity between activities of aob and nob could still be observed the relative activities of aob and nob under low do concentration of 0 5 mg l at the end of phase ii were 55 32 and 2 12 respectively unlike to r1 there was no significant difference p 0 05 between decline rate of nob populations and nob activities moreover no increase of nob activities and populations could be observed as the do concentration raised from 0 5 mg l to 1 5 mg l the deterioration of sludge settleability could be clear observed in the control reactor using low do as the single strategy to achieved nitrite pathway with svi increased from 104 to 156 ml g as do concentration decreased from 1 5 mg l to 0 5 mg l the results were consistent with previous researches that employed do control as the only or mainly selection factor to established nitrite pathway ma et al reported a negative impact of nitrite pathway realized by controlling the do concentration at 0 4 0 7 mg l on the sludge settleability ma et al 2009 shaopo et al also found that low do 1 0 mg l could lead to poor sludge settleability in a cyclic activated sludge technology cast system shaopo et al 2011 the overgrowth of filamentous microorganisms thiothrix spp type 021n and type 1851 under low do concentrations might contribute to the poorer sludge settleability which need further investigation though ma et al 2013 martins et al 2003 similar to the previous report ma et al 2009 the svi in r1 decreased to 98 ml g on day 199 comparable p 0 05 to that in the baseline phase phase i as do concentrations were turned back to 1 5 mg l in phase iii in the contrast the svi decreased slightly from 108 ml g to 81 ml g as the combined strategy of low do and fna sludge treatment were implied in r2 which indicated that the deterioration of sludge settleability caused by low do was eliminated it was reported that particle size d50 of the sludge decreased from around 185 to 50 mm following fna treatment wang et al 2013 and svi positively correlated significantly p 0 05 with floc size jin et al 2003 which might lead to good sludge settleability after fna treatment on the other hand biocidal effect of fna could cause increasement of extracellular polymeric substances eps wang et al 2019 zahedi et al 2018 especially the content of protein which was recognized to be favorable for sludge settling chen et al 2001 he et al 2017 2018 a good sludge settleability was maintained in the following experiment in r2 which agreed with the results of previous studies that used the strategy of fna sludge treatment to achieve nitrite pathway wang et al 2013 2014 they found that svi in the experimental reactor was approximate to that in the control reactor and the sludge settleability was not significantly affected by fna treatment 3 4 dynamics of functional genes related to nitrogen cycling to investigate the changes of nitrogen cycling bacteria during nitrite pathway establishment by independent low do treatment and low do with fna sludge treatment the dynamics of corresponding functional genes were analyzed the proportions of the quantified genes to total bacterial 16s rrna gene copy number and the alterations after the nitrite pathway establishment in r1 and r2 were calculated and presented in fig 6 the functional genes relevant to ammonia oxidation amoa increased by 2 14 while the nitrite oxidation bacteria nitrospira and nitrobacter nob decreased by 0 09 in r1 respectively the results were consistent with the changes of functional bacteria copy number in sludge that aob were largely reserved decreased slightly from 4 30 107 to 2 96 107 copies g mlss while nob were washed out decreased dramatic from 2 11 107 to 6 26 106 copies g mlss during the nitrite pathway establishment fig 5 table s1 it was a consensus that the aob remained and nob were washed out during the achievement of nitrite pathway regardless of which methods were applied blackburne et al 2008a liu et al 2018 however the combined method of low do with fna sludge treatment used in r2 exhibited the advantage on washing out nob and resulted in a larger decrement in proportion of 0 75 than that of r1 the copy numbers of remained nob in r1 and r2 at the end of phase ii were 6 26 106 and 3 40 105 copies g mlss fig 5 table s1 with the relatives abundances of nitrobacter being 17 14 and 1 78 respectively which indicated that the combined strategy of low do with fna sludge treatment could eliminate nitrobacter more effectively than low do alone the advantage of combined strategy of low do and fna treatment on washing out nob especially nitrobacter might be one of the contributing factors to the stable nitrite pathway in r2 moreover functional genes involved in reducing nitrate to nitrite narg and napa decreased by 0 25 in r2 during the establishment of nitrite pathway while the number of that in r1 was 0 05 the reduction of nitrate to nitrite is a major step that theoretically consumes 40 carbon source of the entire denitrification demands and the decline of nitrate reduction could divert more surplus carbon source to bacteria participating in the rest of nitrogen reduction process and therefore improve the total nitrogen removal performance qian et al 2019 zielinska et al 2016 meanwhile denitrifying bacteria that harbored nitrite reductase genes nirs and nirk were also enriched in both r1 and r2 during the establishment of nitrite pathway with the increase were 0 97 and 1 11 respectively it could be noticed that r2 depleted more nitrate reductase genes and enriched more nitrite reductase genes than r1 simultaneously this might be because that treatment of sludge in fna unit combined with low do in the main steam selectively remained denitrifiers that could only reduce nitrite and eliminated denitrifiers that could only reduce nitrate focht and chang 1975 lu et al 2014 it was agreed with our previous study that the abundance of family rhodocyclaceae including a majority of genera that could use nitrite as an electron acceptor such as thauera zoogloea and dechloromonas increased slightly after fna treatment jiang et al 2018 the directional selection and selective optimization of the combined strategy of low do and fna treatment on denitrifying microbiology community might be another contributing factor to the stable nitrite pathway process in r2 which required further investigated though in addition the achievement of nitrite pathway also facilitated the enrichment of n2o reductase genes nosz which reduces n2o to n2 in r1 the portion of nosz genes increased by 0 6 significantly smaller p 0 05 than the increment of nitrite reductase genes the significant difference between the increment of these two kinds of functional genes might be one of the potential causes that enhance the emission of n2o when low do was applied as the main selected factor to achieve nitrite way reported in previous studies law et al 2011 mampaey et al 2016 wunderlin et al 2012 by comparison similar amount of nitrite reductase genes 1 11 and oxide reductase genes 1 12 were enriched in r2 which might be explained the observations in some reports that n2o emission was not increased as fna based technologies were used to establish nitrite pathway wang et al 2013 2014 2016b however there were also article reported that n2o emission increased in a nitrite pathway system with fna treatment on account of nitrifier denitrification duan et al 2018 hence more and further researches are required to draw firm conclusions 3 5 implications for wastewater treatment nitrogen removal via nitrite pathway in the mainstream is regarded as a promising technology to fulfill the increasing demand of energy saving and resource recovering wastewater treatment processes achieving stable nitrite pathway is one of the major bottlenecks for its wider practical applications an approach with great prospects that could establish stable nitrite pathway is approached in this study by treating sludge with fna in side stream and controlling do concentrations in mainstream simultaneously a long term stable nitrite pathway is achieved in a continuous process treating real sewage compared to previous reports that combined fna sludge treatment and do control to achieve nitritation the following differentia are lying in our researches first of all the fna treatment unit and the low do 0 5 mg l is not required constantly presented in this system the fna treatment was stopped and do concentrations were increased to 1 5 mg l when stable nitrite pathway was achieved one of the advantages of casing fna sludge treatment is that the operational costs could be largely decreased by significant reduction of fna consumption and nitrite containing water production from washing fna treated sludge and appropriate treatment of the latter should be seriously considered in practical applications to reduce this part of costs a decrease of sludge treatment frequencies from 1 4 to 1 8 wang et al 2016a and a low sludge treatment frequency of 1 16 wang et al 2017b were implied by previous researches leading to no significant loss of the mainstream reactor performance previous studies have revealed that the fna based approach is economically favorable due to significant savings in aeration energy methanol addition and sludge handling despite the additional costs of fna treatment duan et al 2018 wang et al 2016a 2017a and the strategy proposed in this study could further promote the favorableness in economy another advantage of casing fna sludge treatment is reducing the potential nob adaptation to fna treatment which was reported in recent studies coats et al 2017 duan et al 2019 and resulted from resistance to fna treatment of nob combining of appropriate nob controlling strategies fna treatment and low do could potentially cope with the nob adaptation challenge in this study duan et al 2019 on the other hand the advantages of increasing do concentrations to 1 5 mg l after the nitrite pathway is achieved are including avoidance of ammonia oxidation inefficiency and sludge settleability depression which were reported to be a generally defect of nitrite pathway achieved by low do wunderlin et al 2012 zhou et al 2008 however the deficiency of stopping fna treatment and increasing do concentrations in the reactor cannot be neglected too the risks of destruction of nitrite pathway in the mainstream could increase with the presence of a slight amount of nob mainly nitrospira and lack of any suppressing forces fna or low do the breakdown of nitrite pathway did not occur in this study might be contributed from 1 the vast majority of nob 99 were washed during the establishment of nitrite pathway under combined selective pressures of fna and low do fig 5 table s1 and moreover most of the remained nob are nitrospira 96 which were reported demonstrating no superiority over aob under a high do gilbert et al 2014 regmi et al 2014b wang et al 2016a 2 apart from acclimation and optimization of nitrifying bacterial community the combined strategy of fna treatment and low do could also acclimate and optimize the denifying bacterial community through enriching nitrite and nitrous oxide reduction denitrifiers and eliminating nitrate reduction denitrifiers simultaneously fig 6 which enhanced the stability of nitrite pathway against fluctuation of environmental factors the other difference between this study and previous studies is that a more representative continuous wastewater treatment process aao process and real wastewater were used in this study which might be closer to the actual situation and more instructive to practical applications of this technology but it could lead to reactor performance not as good as the sequencing batch reactor using synthetic wastewater for instance a nar of more 80 was achieved in an sbr treating synthetic wastewater containing ammonium at 57 mg of n l without organic carbon wang et al 2016a and a less n2o mission was observed wang et al 2016b at last it is worthy of note that a longer experiments period in pilot scale or full scale tests are required to fully verify the stability of the established nitrite pathway and the feasibility of this strategy 4 conclusions the feasibility of combining fna sludge treatment and do control to establish nitrite pathway in a continuous flow system using real sewage was assessed and the reactor performance and dynamics of functional bacteria related to nitrogen cycling were investigated and compared the following conclusions were drawn an fna concentration of 1 2 mg n l and an exposure time of 18 h were optimum conditions to simultaneously inactivate nob completely and maintain aob the stable nitrite pathway was successfully established through combining fna sludge treatment and do control with the majority of nob washout an average nitrite accumulation rate of 78 and an average total nitrogen removal rate of 76 were achieved in a continuous flow system at do concentration of 1 5 mg l using real sewage which increased by 20 and 15 respectively compared to baseline phase and stable nitrite pathway phase in control reactor established by only low do control the nitrite pathway established by combining fna sludge treatment and do control showed better sludge settleability and process stability than that established by do control merely as do concentration raised from 0 5 mg l to 1 5 mg l the nitrification and denitrification bacteria communities were acclimated and optimized during the establishment of nitrite pathway with elimination of nob and nitrate reduced bacteria and enrichment of aob and nitrite reduced bacteria and nitric oxide bacteria author contributions x z s j and c j conceived and designed the

18717,antibiotic resistance genes args including extracellular args eargs and intracellular args iargs are recognized as emerging environmental contaminants despite extensive efforts to profile args in their hotspots wastewater treatment plants wwtps the contribution of eargs to antibiotic resistance spread remains unclear here we applied metagenomic sequencing to investigate the distribution mobility and microbial hosts of eargs in activated sludge from five wwtps the total relative abundance eargs ranged from 9 5 10 6 to 1 3 10 4 mainly encompassing elfamycin dual drug and aminoglycoside resistance genes multiple eargs e g ef tu ropb and rpsl mutants were shared among the five wwtps and some clustered in the same genetic element e g ef tu rpsj eargs were found to frequently co localize with the emges e g sul1 3 cs tnas3 sul2 inti1 isvsa3 and tetx p63039 which may facilitate the mobilization of eargs most eargs likely originated from the genera mycobacterium 6 7 nitrosomonas 5 3 steroidobacter 5 3 nitrospira 5 2 and pseudomonas 5 1 no significant difference in the diversity abundance and mobility was observed between eargs and iargs the host composition of eargs and iargs from municipal wwtps are consistently dominated by nitrosomonas steroidobacter nitrospira and pseudomonas while some differentially enriched genera especially nitrospira in the hosts of iargs compared with those of eargs from the swine wwtp were identified our findings corroborate the mobile eargs reservoir in wwtps thereby laying foundation for mitigating widespread antibiotic resistance graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge metagenomic sequencing extracellular antibiotic resistance genes extracellular mobile genetic elements hosts 1 introduction antibiotic resistance has become a serious threat to human health and global economic stability world health organization 2014 pehrsson et al 2016 according to the centers for disease control and prevention more than two million people per year are estimated to be infected with antibiotic resistant bacteria resulting in at least 23 000 deaths and 55 billion dollars costs for healthcare and productivity in united states centers for disease control and prevention 2013 this problem is exacerbated by the exchange of antibiotic resistance between environmental microbes and pathogens munck et al 2015 ng et al 2017 pehrsson et al 2016 as the genetic vehicle of antibiotic resistance antibiotic resistance genes args are recognized as emerging environmental contaminants pruden et al 2006 sanderson et al 2016 wastewater treatment plants wwtps can bring together antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic residues and other potential agents that favor the selection of args in the activated sludge and also provide an ideal environment for the horizontal transfer of args in activated sludge by a supply of rich nutrients and close cell to cell interaction rizzo et al 2013 therefore activated sludge in wwtps is of particular concern as an environmental hotspot for args guo et al 2017 ju et al 2019 munck et al 2015 ng et al 2017 rizzo et al 2013 generally there are two forms of args in the activated sludge intracellular args iargs and extracellular args eargs dong et al 2019 mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 both of which can facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance through horizontal gene transfer hgt ju et al 2019 munck et al 2015 pehrsson et al 2016 hgt may occur via three mechanisms including conjugation transduction and transformation soucy et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 as a component of bacterial cell iargs can spread via conjugation or transduction in contrast the dissemination of eargs originating from cell lysis or secretion dominiak et al 2011 wu and xi 2009 occurs through transformation mao et al 2014 considering the different propagation characteristics of iargs and eargs it is important to distinguish their distribution in activated sludge wwtps especially with a membrane reactor mbr process may successfully reduce iargs by retaining most of their carrier i e antibiotic resistant bacteria munir et al 2011 however it remains unclear whether eargs can be completely removed from wwtps eargs in activated sludge may leak into wastewater following external shocks e g vigorous shearing resulting from aeration in mbr tanks menniti and morgenroth 2010 moreover eargs can survive after the common advanced water treatment technologies such as membrane filters breazeal et al 2013 ultraviolet light disinfection mckinney and pruden 2012 and chlorine disinfection zhang et al 2018 persist in wastewater for up to several months breazeal et al 2013 dong et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 and ultimately release into the environment and potentially be assimilated by environmental and pathogenic strains in fact genetic transformation assays have shown the successful transformation of extracellular methicillin resistant gene meca to staphylococcus aureus naquin et al 2015 and extracellular plasmid contained bla shv to escherichia coli in wastewater dong et al 2019 noting the potential role of eargs in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in depth investigations of eargs reservoirs in wwtps are urgently needed although recent studies preliminarily revealed the occurrence of eargs and iargs in river sediment mao et al 2014 livestock waste zhang et al 2013 estuary biofilm guo et al 2018 and activated sludge dong et al 2019 they did not provide a broad spectrum profile of both forms of args or any information regarding their microbial hosts mainly due to the limitations of the quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr approach used mullany 2014 high throughput sequencing based metagenomic can overcome the drawback of the qpcr approach that having limited args targets restricted to the availability of the primers and can identify the mobility and host of args mullany 2014 munck et al 2015 thus representing a powerful and promising tool for studying the distribution and fate of different forms of args in the environment mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids insertion sequences iss and integrons are important vectors for args transmission chen et al 2016 ju et al 2019 ma et al 2015 and can also be transferred by transformation domingues et al 2012 therefore as well as carrying eargs the extracellular mges emges themselves may be involved in the transformation process providing a much broader capacity for horizontal acquisition of antibiotic resistance traits yet no information is available on the diversity and abundance of emges in activated sludge making their roles in the mobilization of eargs obscure characterizing the microbial hosts of args can determine the microbial species and genotypes that are most likely to exchange antibiotic resistance forsberg et al 2012 huijbers et al 2015 pehrsson et al 2016 for instance forsberg et al 2012 implied that six args from two soil organisms most closely related to pseudomonas sp k94 23 could move to many pathogens including acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa via hgt recently klebsiella pneumoniae was identified as a key trafficker of args e g carbapenem resistance genes bla kpc bla oxa 48 and bla ndm 1 between environmental microorganism and human pathogens wyres and holt 2018 despite numerous studies identifying potential hosts of args forsberg et al 2012 johnson et al 2016 ju et al 2019 li et al 2015 pehrsson et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 the microbial hosts of eargs remain poorly defined here for the first time we applied metagenomic sequencing to comprehensively assess eargs in activated sludge the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to evaluate the diversity and abundance of eargs 2 to determine the co occurrence patterns and the mobility of eargs 3 to identify the microbial hosts of eargs and 4 to distinguish the distribution mobility and the microbial hosts of eargs and iargs our findings might shed light on the fate of the previously neglected source of args i e eargs in activated sludge thus are helpful to bridge the critical knowledge gaps regarding wwtps to disseminate args 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection activated sludge samples were collected from five full scale wwtps including three municipal wwtps with anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o mbr process abbreviated as m mbr1 m mbr2 and m mbr3 one municipal wwtp with a2 o process abbreviated as m and one wwtp treating swine manure wastewater with a2 o mbr process abbreviated as s mbr in china in may 2018 samples were taken at the mbr in the a2 o mbr process based wwtps or the aeration tank in the a2 o process based wwtp in duplicate we focused on samples from mbrs process based wwtps for the following reasons 1 mbr technology is now actively being pursued in water treatment or reuse for instance the total treatment capacity of large scale mbrs 10 000 m3 per day is expected to increase from 1 0 to 10 0 million m3 per day by 2017 meng et al 2017 whereas their potential risk in increasing antibiotic resistance remains largely unknown 2 compared with conventional activated sludge process based wwtps the horizontal exchange of iargs or eargs in mbrs might occur more frequently because of the high microbial density and diversity in these systems munck et al 2015 yang et al 2013 and 3 mbr systems can substantially reduce iargs via efficient retention of antibiotic resistant bacteria munir et al 2011 but whether they can also remove eargs is still unclear the information on the five wwtps is summarized in table s1 all activated sludge samples were transported to the laboratory on ice for immediate extracellular dna edna and intracellular dna idna extraction 2 2 extraction and purification of edna and idna for metagenomic sequencing all edna and idna samples in activated sludge was extracted according to mao et al 2014 which was confirmed to be effective and favorable for extracting edna and idna from biological samples without cross contamination as indicated by the quantitative quality control including limit of quantification and extraction recovery using a reliable internal standard method dong et al 2019 guo et al 2018 mao et al 2014 briefly approximately 0 02 g volatile suspended solids of samples were incubated with 4 ml nah2po4 0 12 m ph 8 0 and 0 1 g of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone and was shaken at 250 rpm for 10 min at 25 c following centrifugation 10 000 g 4 c 10 min ct15rt tianmei scientific instrument co shanghai china and filtration 0 22 μm pore size pvdf millipore bedford ma usa another 4 ml nah2po4 0 12 m ph 8 0 was added to the pellets which was subjected to the same extraction for three times all filtrates were collected and combined the edna in the filtrate was precipitated using 1 w v cetyltrimethylammonium bromide sigma aldrich according to a previous protocol corinaldesi et al 2005 after edna extraction idna in the pellets was extracted by the sds based method zhou et al 1996 both of edna and idna were purified using a phenol chloroform method corinaldesi et al 2005 the purity and concentrations of the edna and idna was determined using a spectrophotometer nanodrop 1000 thermo scientific wilmington de usa the absorbance ratios of od260 280 and od260 230 were required to be above 1 8 and 2 0 respectively 2 3 metagenomic sequencing and gene prediction a detailed flowchart for the metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic analysis is shown in fig s1 using an index pe150 strategy paired end sequencing 150 bp reads and 8 bp index sequence the sequencing was conducted on an illumina hiseq 3000 4000 platform novegene beijing china the metagenomic library construction cluster generation and data processing are detailed in si s1 an average of 51 million of clean reads was generated for each dna sample resulting in a total of 153 74 gbp of clean data table s2 we next assembled the trimmed clean reads into 8 31 million contigs of 500 bp in length with n50 length of 919 1515 bp and read mapping rate of 30 6 62 4 table s2 then we predicted the open reading frames orfs within the assembled contigs using metagenemark zhu et al 2010 which can also determine the orfs arrangements i e location and direction finally we used cd hit to remove the redundant orfs by pair wise comparison using a criterion of 95 identity over 90 of the shorter orf length fu et al 2012 qin et al 2010 and obtained a non redundant gene catalogue containing 5 46 million orfs with an average length of 633 bp 2 4 metagenomic sequence annotation 2 4 1 args annotation to identify putative args we aligned the protein sequences predicted from the non redundant gene catalogue against the widely used the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card https card mcmaster ca gibson et al 2015 jia et al 2017a pehrsson et al 2016 using the basic local alignment search tool for proteins blastp with e value 10 50 gibson et al 2015 an orf was annotated as an arg if the best blastp hit showed at least 80 identity over a query coverage of 85 gibson et al 2015 this threshold was confirmed to be perfect precision 100 and high recall 99 0 02 for args identification by precision recall assessment gibson et al 2015 we then manually sorted the identified arg like orfs into various arg types e g tetracycline resistance genes and subtypes e g teta according to the card 2 4 2 mges annotation to explore the distribution of mges including integrons iss and plasmids we used a nucleotide blast blastn to align the trimmed clean reads for the diversity and abundance of mges and assembled contigs for the arrangements of mges against the databases downloaded from integrall moura et al 2009 isfinder siguier et al 2015 and the national center for biotechnology information ncbi refseq database respectively fig s2 a read or contig was annotated as an integron or is sequence if the best blastn e value 10 5 hit had a nucleotide sequence identity 90 over an alignment length of at least 75 bp kristiansson et al 2011 plasmid like sequences were identified if the best blastn e value 10 5 hit had a nucleotide sequence identity 95 over an alignment length of at least 90 bp chen et al 2013 2016 hu et al 2016a 2 4 3 taxonomic annotation to determine the taxonomic affiliations of the predicted orfs we aligned the non redundant gene catalogue to the ncbi integrated non redundant database using blastp with an e value 10 5 qin et al 2010 we then retained the blastp alignment hits using cutoffs of bit score 50 and 10 of the top 50 hits chen et al 2016 yang et al 2014 and determined the taxonomic rank of each orf by the lowest common ancestor lca based algorithm using megan huson et al 2011 the widely used lca based approach is expected to be conservative i e high number of unspecific assignments but accurate i e low rate of false positive assignments port et al 2012 qin et al 2010 finally we retrieved the taxonomic annotations of args orfs to track their potential microbial hosts 2 5 analysis of args clusters and args mobility to determine the genetic co occurrence of args we first sorted the args clusters i e multiple args co localized on the same contig referred to as arg arg based on the identities of arg orfs we then retrieved the arrangement of these arg clusters via the aforementioned orf prediction for analysis of the args mobility a contig was considered of interest if it simultaneously contained an arg orf and putative mge referred to as arg mge to identify the arg mge clusters we applied a script https github com zs402606665 arg mge clusters to compare the annotation of the args and mges the arrangement of arg arg and arg mge clusters was visualized using scalable vector graphics 1 2 2 6 determination of the relative abundance of args and mges the relative abundance of arg orfs was determined as previously described hu et al 2013 qin et al 2012 using the following equation 1 ab args i n i l i i 1 n n i l i where ab args i is the relative abundance of arg orfs i n i is the number of the clean reads mapped to the arg orf i l i is the length of arg orf i bp the relative abundance of each arg type or subtype was calculated by summing the relative abundance of all the arg orfs belonging to the same type or subtypes the relative abundance of mge sequences was calculated according to previous studies bengtsson palme et al 2016 lekunberri et al 2018 using the following equation 2 ab mges i n i l reads l i j 1 n n j l reads l j where ab mges i is the relative abundance of mge sequence i copy of mge per copy of 16s rrna gene n i is the number of the clean reads mapped to an mge reference sequence l i is the length of mge reference sequence bp n j is the number of the clean reads mapped to a 16s rrna gene in the silva rrna database version ssu ref nr 128 blastn parameters e value 10 5 identity 80 and alignment length 50 bp bai et al 2013 baumlisberger et al 2015 l j is the length of 16s rrna reference sequence bp n is the number of the mapped 16s rrna reference sequences and l reads is the length of metagenomic sequencing reads i e 150 bp 2 7 statistical analysis based on the number of randomly sampling reads that map 95 identity and 95 coverage to the unique arg and mge the rarefaction curves were plotted using the r package vegan oksanen et al 2015 kruskal wallis test was conducted using spss 19 0 spss inc chicago il usa to analyze differences in the abundance of eargs among the samples differences between eargs and iargs were revealed using paired t test and the linear discriminate analysis lda effect size lefse method segata et al 2011 a p value of 0 05 and lda score 3 0 niederdorfer et al 2016 was considered statistically significant with the number of earg subtypes the venn diagram was plotted using venndiagram 1 6 17 in r project chen and boutros 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 diversity abundance and co occurrence of eargs as an environmental args diagnostic approach metagenomic analysis permits broad spectrum profiling of args therefore we performed metagenomic analysis to investigate the diversity and abundance of eargs our rarefaction curve analysis showed that the majority of the eargs in the wwtps were identified fig s3 overall we identified a total of 11 915 unique earg orfs in the ten edna samples table s3 these eargs which comprised 234 subtypes 112 163 in each sample conferred resistance to 24 groups of antibiotics 21 24 in each sample fig 1 a and encompassed all major antibiotic resistance mechanisms fig s4 and si s2 the total relative abundance of eargs in each sample ranged from 9 5 10 6 to 1 3 10 4 fig 1a elfamycin resistance genes were the most abundant earg type in all samples followed by genes encoding dual resistance and aminoglycoside resistance with these three earg types accounting for 70 2 of the total eargs abundance fig 1b and fig s5 accordingly ef tu ropb and rpsl mutants were the predominant earg subtypes fig 1c ef tu can encode the most abundant protein in the bacterial cell and is required for peptide elongation in bacterial protein synthesis prezioso et al 2017 the mutation of ef tu confers resistance to elfamycin in total we identified five ef tu earg subtypes with the escherichia coli ef tu mutants conferring resistance to kirromycin as the dominating subtype fig s5 the presence of ef tu mutants in activated sludge was firstly reported by mccall and xagoraraki 2018 recently ef tu mutants was also found to be the dominant args in wwtps effluent and its receiving water body bondarczuk and piotrowska seget 2019 it should be noted that the putative arg subtypes including ef tu ropb rpsl gyra gyrb katg rpoc and pare are caused by specific mutations e g amino acids substitutions which deserves further validation in the future we also compared the distribution of eargs across the wwtps samples in addition to their similar diversity we observed no significant differences in the total abundance of eargs among the municipal samples i e m mbr1 m mbr2 m mbr3 and m kruskal wallis test p 0 05 fig 1a despite their different processing characteristics and spatial patterns table s1 this is somewhat unexpected as we hypothesized that the abundance of eargs would be higher in the mbr sample than those in the non mbr sample because of the higher potential for hgt of the args due to the frequent cell to cell contact endowed by the dense biomass munck et al 2015 yang et al 2013 and the high extracellular matrix production resulting from the vigorous aeration in mbr meng et al 2008 this suggests that other factors such as bacterial phylogeny jia et al 2017b ju et al 2019 luo et al 2017 munck et al 2015 and selective pressure including antibiotics and heavy metals gao et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 may structure the eargs content in contrast the eargs abundance in the swine wwtp samples i e s mbr was up to 1 1 5 times higher than those in the municipal samples regardless of the treatment process i e mbr or non mbr fig 1a indicating the high potential of swine waste to facilitate the propagation of args johnson et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 in particular a large fraction of tetracycline resistance genes 20 3 was identified in the swine sample whereas such genes only occupied 4 3 5 6 of the total eargs abundance in the municipal samples fig 1b and c the enrichment of tetracycline resistance genes in swine wwtp might be correlated with the abuse of tetracycline zhu et al 2013 or numerous mges johnson et al 2016 furthermore we found that 75 of the 234 earg subtypes fig 2 a which accounted for 88 9 91 2 91 1 86 4 and 83 8 of the total relative abundance of eargs in m mbr1 m mbr2 m mbr3 m and s mbr respectively fig 2b were shared among the five samples reflecting the high compositional similarity of the eargs the shared eargs were dominated by ef tu ropb and rpsl mutants fig 2b in addition we observed multiple genetic co occurrences of eargs on the same contig accounting for 2 0 6 1 of the earg carrying contigs table s3 for example ef tu mutant was detected together with rpsj mutant or rpsl mutant on one assembled contig from all ten samples fig 3 and fig s6 co occurring arg clusters have also been reported in previous studies bengtsson palme et al 2016 ma et al 2015 ng et al 2017 pehrsson et al 2016 for instance bengtsson palme et al 2016 demonstrated that beta lactamase resistance genes bla oxa 2 and bla oxa 10 were located together with sul1 in the total dna from activated sludge samples the co location of eargs may be enriched from co selection agents e g antibiotic and heavy metal and hgt i e clustering different eargs subtypes by mges mediated hgt johnson et al 2016 ju et al 2016 3 2 mobility of eargs the role of mges in the movement and proliferation of iargs has been widely elucidated elsewhere chen et al 2016 johnson et al 2016 ju et al 2019 ng et al 2017 pehrsson et al 2016 therefore we investigated the distribution of emges and their co location pattern with the eargs in the activated sludge samples to explore the mobility of eargs our rarefaction curve indicated that the sequencing depth is sufficient to characterize the emges profiles fig s3 in total we annotated 289 359 integrons 697 1021 iss and 1350 1427 plasmids with the total abundance of 0 3539 0 5422 copy per copy of 16s rrna gene 0 5543 0 7498 copy per copy of 16s rrna gene 0 0407 0 1170 copy per copy of 16s rrna gene respectively fig 4 after further classification we found that inti1 was the most abundant integron type accounting for 84 2 87 2 of the total integron abundance tn3 is256 is5 and is3 were the dominant iss families totally occupying 26 4 51 9 of the total iss abundance fig 4 in fact these integrons and iss have been found to be prevalent in activated sludge and are correlated with various args ng et al 2017 tian et al 2016 wang et al 2013 although no dominating types of plasmid were observed among the ten samples we identified some args carried plasmids e g pbi136 containing ermf fig s7 to further ascertain the role of emges in the potential mobility of eargs we examined the flanking genetic sequences in the assembled contigs that contained eargs in all 2 4 17 4 of the eargs carrying contigs was identified as being flanked by more than one emge table s3 specifically the numerous co location of eargs and emges e g sul1 3 cs tnas3 sul2 inti1 isvsa3 and tetx p63039 was observed in all samples fig 5 and fig s8 reflecting the high mobility of sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes in the environment previous studies have shown that the relative abundances of sul1 sul2 and tetx were correlated with that of inti1 and genetically co localized with inti1 bengtsson palme et al 2016 pehrsson et al 2016 wang et al 2016 indeed these args subtypes are typically located beside the 3 conservative region of inti1 wang et al 2016 we also found that two multidrug resistance genes oprj and mexd belonging to the efflux pump families embedded in plasmids fig 5 exacerbating the main public health concern of wwtps notably the number of contigs carrying earg emge in the swine sample was much higher than that in the municipal samples table s3 suggesting a relatively high rate of eargs mobilization in swine wwtp however it should be noted that the identification of earg emge may largely depend on the assembly efficiency of metagenomic sequencing table s2 and table s3 which means that adapted assembly approaches are needed to better understand the co location patterns of earg emge bengtsson palme et al 2016 mobilization has been confirmed as the main barrier to args spread forsberg et al 2014 munck et al 2015 that is once mobilized args can be found outside the local environment and even in clinical pathogens forsberg et al 2014 munck et al 2015 to date the presence of arg mge clusters has been broadly reported in wwtps chen et al 2016 munck et al 2015 pehrsson et al 2016 soil forsberg et al 2012 sediment bengtsson palme et al 2014 chen et al 2016 feces chen et al 2016 johnson et al 2016 ma et al 2015 and human pathogen forsberg et al 2012 here the eargs especially multidrug resistance determinants were firstly found to co localize with the emges underlining their potential to shuttle between the wwtps and clinic 3 3 microbial hosts of eargs microbial hosts tracking might be used to search for the link within environmental stains or between environmental and clinical bacteria huijbers et al 2015 therefore we retrieved the taxonomical assignment of earg orfs based on a combination of blastp alignment and lca based algorithm to comprehensively track the hosts of eargs overall the percentages of taxonomical annotation of args at the genus 35 1 and species 31 6 levels were relatively low which impeded a comprehensive identification of earg hosts fig 6 a this limitation is common in taxonomical annotation based on metagenomic data primarily because of the conservative nature i e high rate of unspecific assignments of lca approach port et al 2012 qin et al 2010 and a limited knowledge of the microbial sources of args in the environmental samples albertsen et al 2013 despite this we annotated 4179 earg orfs at the genus level these orfs may be derived from 375 genera with the majority identified as mycobacterium 6 7 nitrosomonas 5 3 steroidobacter 5 3 nitrospira 5 2 and pseudomonas 5 1 fig 6b indeed these genera have been recognized as the hosts of numerous args in previous studies for instance mycobacterium was found to carry tetv zhao et al 2019 and aac 2 i ma et al 2019 ng et al 2019 while nitrosomonas may harbored pena oqxbgb vanhac2 vanr f and dfrk guo et al 2017 as the most abundant earg subtypes ef tu mutant mainly originated from nitrospira nitrosomonas and hyphomicrobium fig 6c as the genetic vector of eargs edna was previously confirmed to be mainly belonging to the ammonium oxidizing nitrosomonas and the nitrite oxidizing nitrospira by combining staining with fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques dominiak et al 2011 these results suggest bacterial communities participating in the nitrogen cycle may act as the hosts of args based on the genus defined earg orfs we further explored the differences in the hosts of the eargs among the five wwtps our analysis showed that the composition of eargs hosts among municipal wwtps were similar which differed sharply from those of the swine wwtp earg orfs from municipal wwtps are mainly from mycobacterium nitrosomonas steroidobacter nitrospira and pseudomonas in contrast the hosts of eargs in swine wwtp are dominated by pseudomonas and clostridium fig 6d both of which were frequently identified as the candidates harboring the args in the animal gut fang et al 2014 hu et al 2016b li et al 2015 and livestock breeding wastewater jia et al 2017b 3 4 difference in the distribution mobility and microbial hosts between eargs and iargs since the two forms of args eargs and iargs possess substantial differences in their dissemination and propagation pathways mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 it is vital to distinguish their characteristics distribution mobility and microbial hosts generally the diversity and abundance between eargs and iargs was similar in m mbr1 and s mbr fig 7 a recently dong et al 2019 reported that the relative abundance of all the detected eargs were usually 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of iargs in activated sludge from municipal and pharmaceutical industry wwtps these findings corroborated that activated sludge is an important reservoir of eargs when compared with well known iargs pools we further examine the statistical differences between eargs and iargs using lefse method segata et al 2011 as shown in fig 7b and c 10 args categories at type level and 15 args categories at subtype level were found to be significantly different between the two forms of args specifically elfamycin ef tu mutant and tetracycline tet36 resistance genes were more abundant for iargs when compared with those for eargs on the contrary the abundance of genes resistant to peptide liar and rpoc mutants aminocoumarin pary mutant rifamycin rpob and rpoc mutants polymine emba embc and inia mutants fluoroquinolone pare mutant and dual drug gyra parc and mtra mutants were found to be significantly higher for eargs than these for iargs fig 7b and c to date there is no consensus for the differences between relative abundance of specific eargs and iargs types or subtypes for instance zhang et al 2013 found that the relative abundance of sul1 teto and tetx in the extracellular form was significantly lower than that of its intracellular counterpart in livestock waste sludge paired t test p 0 05 while the relative abundance of sul2 and tetq was comparable in both args forms the discrimination of eargs and iargs may correlate with the type of surrounding physical and genetic i e chromosomes or plasmids borne environment for args mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 and might be shaped by the conversion between iargs and eargs accompanied by their proliferation and degradation dong et al 2019 we next explored the difference in the mobility between eargs and iargs no significant differences inthe relative abundances of emges was observed paired t test p 0 05 fig 8 despite this we found the relative abundance of int1 the typical marker for args pollution dong et al 2019 johnson et al 2016 was significantly lower in eargs than that in iargs paired t test p 0 05 fig s9 this was consistent with the results of dong et al 2019 who have quantified the abundance of inti1 by qpcr our findings demonstrated that even free from the bacteria cell eargs can maintain their mobility finally we compared the microbial hosts of the eargs and iargs we found no significant difference in their composition from municipal wwtps both of which are dominated by nitrosomonas steroidobacter nitrospira and pseudomonas fig 9 a suggesting that most of the eargs may originate from the nonspecific lysis of microbial cells dominiak et al 2011 wu and xi 2009 for the swine wwtp the hosts of eargs and iargs are both mainly from pseudomonas and clostridium some differentially enriched genera in the microbial host of iargs versus that of eargs within the swine wwtp were identified fig 9a in particular a large fraction of nitrospira was presented in the hosts of iargs whereas such genus was nearly undetectable in the hosts of eargs fig 9a notably significantly higher proportion of mycobacterium was found in the host of eargs than in iargs host paired t test p 0 05 fig 9a which is further supported by the lefse analysis fig 9b 4 conclusions to our best knowledge this is the first documentation for broad spectrum profiling of eargs in activated sludge from wwtps using a metagenomic approach our study confirmed the existence of eargs reservoir in activated sludge our characterization of the distribution mobility and microbial sources of eargs in wwtps could clarify their potential to the spread of args in the environment and thus is critical for addressing the conflicting strategies aimed at water sustainability and public health goals the major conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the total eargs abundance in activated sludge from five wwtps ranging from 9 5 10 6 to 1 3 10 4 multiple shared earg subtypes e g ef tu ropb and rpsl mutants and some co localized eargs e g ef tu rpsj and ef tu rpsl among the wwtps samples were identified 2 289 359 integrons 697 1021 iss and 1350 1427 plasmids were annotated in the edna samples with the total abundance of 0 3539 0 5422 copy per copy of 16s rrna gene 0 5543 0 7498 copy per copy of 16s rrna gene 0 0407 0 1170 copy per copy of 16s rrna gene respectively in addition 2 4 17 4 of the unique eargs especially sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes carrying contigs was flanked by more than one emge e g sul1 3 cs tnas3 sul2 inti1 isvsa3 and tetx p63039 3 eargs from municipal wwtps are mainly derived from mycobacterium nitrosomonas steroidobacter nitrospira and pseudomonas whereas the hosts of eargs in swine wwtp are dominated by pseudomonas and clostridium 4 eargs and iargs showed the similar diversity abundance and mobility no significant difference in their host composition from municipal wwtps both dominated by nitrosomonas steroidobacter nitrospira and pseudomonas while some differentially enriched genera particularly nitrospira in the hosts of iargs compared with those of eargs in the swine wwtp were identified although our results preliminary revealed the eargs reservoir in the activated sludge examining more spatial and temporal samples for eargs profiling identifying the key operational parameters and environmental factors that contribute to the dynamic and release of eargs and exploring the degree of true transformation of eargs and the pathways for eargs transforming to clinic are merited in the future study declaration of

18717,antibiotic resistance genes args including extracellular args eargs and intracellular args iargs are recognized as emerging environmental contaminants despite extensive efforts to profile args in their hotspots wastewater treatment plants wwtps the contribution of eargs to antibiotic resistance spread remains unclear here we applied metagenomic sequencing to investigate the distribution mobility and microbial hosts of eargs in activated sludge from five wwtps the total relative abundance eargs ranged from 9 5 10 6 to 1 3 10 4 mainly encompassing elfamycin dual drug and aminoglycoside resistance genes multiple eargs e g ef tu ropb and rpsl mutants were shared among the five wwtps and some clustered in the same genetic element e g ef tu rpsj eargs were found to frequently co localize with the emges e g sul1 3 cs tnas3 sul2 inti1 isvsa3 and tetx p63039 which may facilitate the mobilization of eargs most eargs likely originated from the genera mycobacterium 6 7 nitrosomonas 5 3 steroidobacter 5 3 nitrospira 5 2 and pseudomonas 5 1 no significant difference in the diversity abundance and mobility was observed between eargs and iargs the host composition of eargs and iargs from municipal wwtps are consistently dominated by nitrosomonas steroidobacter nitrospira and pseudomonas while some differentially enriched genera especially nitrospira in the hosts of iargs compared with those of eargs from the swine wwtp were identified our findings corroborate the mobile eargs reservoir in wwtps thereby laying foundation for mitigating widespread antibiotic resistance graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge metagenomic sequencing extracellular antibiotic resistance genes extracellular mobile genetic elements hosts 1 introduction antibiotic resistance has become a serious threat to human health and global economic stability world health organization 2014 pehrsson et al 2016 according to the centers for disease control and prevention more than two million people per year are estimated to be infected with antibiotic resistant bacteria resulting in at least 23 000 deaths and 55 billion dollars costs for healthcare and productivity in united states centers for disease control and prevention 2013 this problem is exacerbated by the exchange of antibiotic resistance between environmental microbes and pathogens munck et al 2015 ng et al 2017 pehrsson et al 2016 as the genetic vehicle of antibiotic resistance antibiotic resistance genes args are recognized as emerging environmental contaminants pruden et al 2006 sanderson et al 2016 wastewater treatment plants wwtps can bring together antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic residues and other potential agents that favor the selection of args in the activated sludge and also provide an ideal environment for the horizontal transfer of args in activated sludge by a supply of rich nutrients and close cell to cell interaction rizzo et al 2013 therefore activated sludge in wwtps is of particular concern as an environmental hotspot for args guo et al 2017 ju et al 2019 munck et al 2015 ng et al 2017 rizzo et al 2013 generally there are two forms of args in the activated sludge intracellular args iargs and extracellular args eargs dong et al 2019 mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 both of which can facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance through horizontal gene transfer hgt ju et al 2019 munck et al 2015 pehrsson et al 2016 hgt may occur via three mechanisms including conjugation transduction and transformation soucy et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 as a component of bacterial cell iargs can spread via conjugation or transduction in contrast the dissemination of eargs originating from cell lysis or secretion dominiak et al 2011 wu and xi 2009 occurs through transformation mao et al 2014 considering the different propagation characteristics of iargs and eargs it is important to distinguish their distribution in activated sludge wwtps especially with a membrane reactor mbr process may successfully reduce iargs by retaining most of their carrier i e antibiotic resistant bacteria munir et al 2011 however it remains unclear whether eargs can be completely removed from wwtps eargs in activated sludge may leak into wastewater following external shocks e g vigorous shearing resulting from aeration in mbr tanks menniti and morgenroth 2010 moreover eargs can survive after the common advanced water treatment technologies such as membrane filters breazeal et al 2013 ultraviolet light disinfection mckinney and pruden 2012 and chlorine disinfection zhang et al 2018 persist in wastewater for up to several months breazeal et al 2013 dong et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 and ultimately release into the environment and potentially be assimilated by environmental and pathogenic strains in fact genetic transformation assays have shown the successful transformation of extracellular methicillin resistant gene meca to staphylococcus aureus naquin et al 2015 and extracellular plasmid contained bla shv to escherichia coli in wastewater dong et al 2019 noting the potential role of eargs in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in depth investigations of eargs reservoirs in wwtps are urgently needed although recent studies preliminarily revealed the occurrence of eargs and iargs in river sediment mao et al 2014 livestock waste zhang et al 2013 estuary biofilm guo et al 2018 and activated sludge dong et al 2019 they did not provide a broad spectrum profile of both forms of args or any information regarding their microbial hosts mainly due to the limitations of the quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr approach used mullany 2014 high throughput sequencing based metagenomic can overcome the drawback of the qpcr approach that having limited args targets restricted to the availability of the primers and can identify the mobility and host of args mullany 2014 munck et al 2015 thus representing a powerful and promising tool for studying the distribution and fate of different forms of args in the environment mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids insertion sequences iss and integrons are important vectors for args transmission chen et al 2016 ju et al 2019 ma et al 2015 and can also be transferred by transformation domingues et al 2012 therefore as well as carrying eargs the extracellular mges emges themselves may be involved in the transformation process providing a much broader capacity for horizontal acquisition of antibiotic resistance traits yet no information is available on the diversity and abundance of emges in activated sludge making their roles in the mobilization of eargs obscure characterizing the microbial hosts of args can determine the microbial species and genotypes that are most likely to exchange antibiotic resistance forsberg et al 2012 huijbers et al 2015 pehrsson et al 2016 for instance forsberg et al 2012 implied that six args from two soil organisms most closely related to pseudomonas sp k94 23 could move to many pathogens including acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa via hgt recently klebsiella pneumoniae was identified as a key trafficker of args e g carbapenem resistance genes bla kpc bla oxa 48 and bla ndm 1 between environmental microorganism and human pathogens wyres and holt 2018 despite numerous studies identifying potential hosts of args forsberg et al 2012 johnson et al 2016 ju et al 2019 li et al 2015 pehrsson et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 the microbial hosts of eargs remain poorly defined here for the first time we applied metagenomic sequencing to comprehensively assess eargs in activated sludge the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to evaluate the diversity and abundance of eargs 2 to determine the co occurrence patterns and the mobility of eargs 3 to identify the microbial hosts of eargs and 4 to distinguish the distribution mobility and the microbial hosts of eargs and iargs our findings might shed light on the fate of the previously neglected source of args i e eargs in activated sludge thus are helpful to bridge the critical knowledge gaps regarding wwtps to disseminate args 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection activated sludge samples were collected from five full scale wwtps including three municipal wwtps with anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o mbr process abbreviated as m mbr1 m mbr2 and m mbr3 one municipal wwtp with a2 o process abbreviated as m and one wwtp treating swine manure wastewater with a2 o mbr process abbreviated as s mbr in china in may 2018 samples were taken at the mbr in the a2 o mbr process based wwtps or the aeration tank in the a2 o process based wwtp in duplicate we focused on samples from mbrs process based wwtps for the following reasons 1 mbr technology is now actively being pursued in water treatment or reuse for instance the total treatment capacity of large scale mbrs 10 000 m3 per day is expected to increase from 1 0 to 10 0 million m3 per day by 2017 meng et al 2017 whereas their potential risk in increasing antibiotic resistance remains largely unknown 2 compared with conventional activated sludge process based wwtps the horizontal exchange of iargs or eargs in mbrs might occur more frequently because of the high microbial density and diversity in these systems munck et al 2015 yang et al 2013 and 3 mbr systems can substantially reduce iargs via efficient retention of antibiotic resistant bacteria munir et al 2011 but whether they can also remove eargs is still unclear the information on the five wwtps is summarized in table s1 all activated sludge samples were transported to the laboratory on ice for immediate extracellular dna edna and intracellular dna idna extraction 2 2 extraction and purification of edna and idna for metagenomic sequencing all edna and idna samples in activated sludge was extracted according to mao et al 2014 which was confirmed to be effective and favorable for extracting edna and idna from biological samples without cross contamination as indicated by the quantitative quality control including limit of quantification and extraction recovery using a reliable internal standard method dong et al 2019 guo et al 2018 mao et al 2014 briefly approximately 0 02 g volatile suspended solids of samples were incubated with 4 ml nah2po4 0 12 m ph 8 0 and 0 1 g of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone and was shaken at 250 rpm for 10 min at 25 c following centrifugation 10 000 g 4 c 10 min ct15rt tianmei scientific instrument co shanghai china and filtration 0 22 μm pore size pvdf millipore bedford ma usa another 4 ml nah2po4 0 12 m ph 8 0 was added to the pellets which was subjected to the same extraction for three times all filtrates were collected and combined the edna in the filtrate was precipitated using 1 w v cetyltrimethylammonium bromide sigma aldrich according to a previous protocol corinaldesi et al 2005 after edna extraction idna in the pellets was extracted by the sds based method zhou et al 1996 both of edna and idna were purified using a phenol chloroform method corinaldesi et al 2005 the purity and concentrations of the edna and idna was determined using a spectrophotometer nanodrop 1000 thermo scientific wilmington de usa the absorbance ratios of od260 280 and od260 230 were required to be above 1 8 and 2 0 respectively 2 3 metagenomic sequencing and gene prediction a detailed flowchart for the metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic analysis is shown in fig s1 using an index pe150 strategy paired end sequencing 150 bp reads and 8 bp index sequence the sequencing was conducted on an illumina hiseq 3000 4000 platform novegene beijing china the metagenomic library construction cluster generation and data processing are detailed in si s1 an average of 51 million of clean reads was generated for each dna sample resulting in a total of 153 74 gbp of clean data table s2 we next assembled the trimmed clean reads into 8 31 million contigs of 500 bp in length with n50 length of 919 1515 bp and read mapping rate of 30 6 62 4 table s2 then we predicted the open reading frames orfs within the assembled contigs using metagenemark zhu et al 2010 which can also determine the orfs arrangements i e location and direction finally we used cd hit to remove the redundant orfs by pair wise comparison using a criterion of 95 identity over 90 of the shorter orf length fu et al 2012 qin et al 2010 and obtained a non redundant gene catalogue containing 5 46 million orfs with an average length of 633 bp 2 4 metagenomic sequence annotation 2 4 1 args annotation to identify putative args we aligned the protein sequences predicted from the non redundant gene catalogue against the widely used the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card https card mcmaster ca gibson et al 2015 jia et al 2017a pehrsson et al 2016 using the basic local alignment search tool for proteins blastp with e value 10 50 gibson et al 2015 an orf was annotated as an arg if the best blastp hit showed at least 80 identity over a query coverage of 85 gibson et al 2015 this threshold was confirmed to be perfect precision 100 and high recall 99 0 02 for args identification by precision recall assessment gibson et al 2015 we then manually sorted the identified arg like orfs into various arg types e g tetracycline resistance genes and subtypes e g teta according to the card 2 4 2 mges annotation to explore the distribution of mges including integrons iss and plasmids we used a nucleotide blast blastn to align the trimmed clean reads for the diversity and abundance of mges and assembled contigs for the arrangements of mges against the databases downloaded from integrall moura et al 2009 isfinder siguier et al 2015 and the national center for biotechnology information ncbi refseq database respectively fig s2 a read or contig was annotated as an integron or is sequence if the best blastn e value 10 5 hit had a nucleotide sequence identity 90 over an alignment length of at least 75 bp kristiansson et al 2011 plasmid like sequences were identified if the best blastn e value 10 5 hit had a nucleotide sequence identity 95 over an alignment length of at least 90 bp chen et al 2013 2016 hu et al 2016a 2 4 3 taxonomic annotation to determine the taxonomic affiliations of the predicted orfs we aligned the non redundant gene catalogue to the ncbi integrated non redundant database using blastp with an e value 10 5 qin et al 2010 we then retained the blastp alignment hits using cutoffs of bit score 50 and 10 of the top 50 hits chen et al 2016 yang et al 2014 and determined the taxonomic rank of each orf by the lowest common ancestor lca based algorithm using megan huson et al 2011 the widely used lca based approach is expected to be conservative i e high number of unspecific assignments but accurate i e low rate of false positive assignments port et al 2012 qin et al 2010 finally we retrieved the taxonomic annotations of args orfs to track their potential microbial hosts 2 5 analysis of args clusters and args mobility to determine the genetic co occurrence of args we first sorted the args clusters i e multiple args co localized on the same contig referred to as arg arg based on the identities of arg orfs we then retrieved the arrangement of these arg clusters via the aforementioned orf prediction for analysis of the args mobility a contig was considered of interest if it simultaneously contained an arg orf and putative mge referred to as arg mge to identify the arg mge clusters we applied a script https github com zs402606665 arg mge clusters to compare the annotation of the args and mges the arrangement of arg arg and arg mge clusters was visualized using scalable vector graphics 1 2 2 6 determination of the relative abundance of args and mges the relative abundance of arg orfs was determined as previously described hu et al 2013 qin et al 2012 using the following equation 1 ab args i n i l i i 1 n n i l i where ab args i is the relative abundance of arg orfs i n i is the number of the clean reads mapped to the arg orf i l i is the length of arg orf i bp the relative abundance of each arg type or subtype was calculated by summing the relative abundance of all the arg orfs belonging to the same type or subtypes the relative abundance of mge sequences was calculated according to previous studies bengtsson palme et al 2016 lekunberri et al 2018 using the following equation 2 ab mges i n i l reads l i j 1 n n j l reads l j where ab mges i is the relative abundance of mge sequence i copy of mge per copy of 16s rrna gene n i is the number of the clean reads mapped to an mge reference sequence l i is the length of mge reference sequence bp n j is the number of the clean reads mapped to a 16s rrna gene in the silva rrna database version ssu ref nr 128 blastn

reference sequences and l reads is the length of metagenomic sequencing reads i e 150 bp 2 7 statistical analysis based on the number of randomly sampling reads that map 95 identity and 95 coverage to the unique arg and mge the rarefaction curves were plotted using the r package vegan oksanen et al 2015 kruskal wallis test was conducted using spss 19 0 spss inc chicago il usa to analyze differences in the abundance of eargs among the samples differences between eargs and iargs were revealed using paired t test and the linear discriminate analysis lda effect size lefse method segata et al 2011 a p value of 0 05 and lda score 3 0 niederdorfer et al 2016 was considered statistically significant with the number of earg subtypes the venn diagram was plotted using venndiagram 1 6 17 in r project chen and boutros 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 diversity abundance and co occurrence of eargs as an environmental args diagnostic approach metagenomic analysis permits broad spectrum profiling of args therefore we performed metagenomic analysis to investigate the diversity and abundance of eargs our rarefaction curve analysis showed that the majority of the eargs in the wwtps were identified fig s3 overall we identified a total of 11 915 unique earg orfs in the ten edna samples table s3 these eargs which comprised 234 subtypes 112 163 in each sample conferred resistance to 24 groups of antibiotics 21 24 in each sample fig 1 a and encompassed all major antibiotic resistance mechanisms fig s4 and si s2 the total relative abundance of eargs in each sample ranged from 9 5 10 6 to 1 3 10 4 fig 1a elfamycin resistance genes were the most abundant earg type in all samples followed by genes encoding dual resistance and aminoglycoside resistance with these three earg types accounting for 70 2 of the total eargs abundance fig 1b and fig s5 accordingly ef tu ropb and rpsl mutants were the predominant earg subtypes fig 1c ef tu can encode the most abundant protein in the bacterial cell and is required for peptide elongation in bacterial protein synthesis prezioso et al 2017 the mutation of ef tu confers resistance to elfamycin in total we identified five ef tu earg subtypes with the escherichia coli ef tu mutants conferring resistance to kirromycin as the dominating subtype fig s5 the presence of ef tu mutants in activated sludge was firstly reported by mccall and xagoraraki 2018 recently ef tu mutants was also found to be the dominant args in wwtps effluent and its receiving water body bondarczuk and piotrowska seget 2019 it should be noted that the putative arg subtypes including ef tu ropb rpsl gyra gyrb katg rpoc and pare are caused by specific mutations e g amino acids substitutions which deserves further validation in the future we also compared the distribution of eargs across the wwtps samples in addition to their similar diversity we observed no significant differences in the total abundance of eargs among the municipal samples i e m mbr1 m mbr2 m mbr3 and m kruskal wallis test p 0 05 fig 1a despite their different processing characteristics and spatial patterns table s1 this is somewhat unexpected as we hypothesized that the abundance of eargs would be higher in the mbr sample than those in the non mbr sample because of the higher potential for hgt of the args due to the frequent cell to cell contact endowed by the dense biomass munck et al 2015 yang et al 2013 and the high extracellular matrix production resulting from the vigorous aeration in mbr meng et al 2008 this suggests that other factors such as bacterial phylogeny jia et al 2017b ju et al 2019 luo et al 2017 munck et al 2015 and selective pressure including antibiotics and heavy metals gao et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 may structure the eargs content in contrast the eargs abundance in the swine wwtp samples i e s mbr was up to 1 1 5 times higher than those in the municipal samples regardless of the treatment process i e mbr or non mbr fig 1a indicating the high potential of swine waste to facilitate the propagation of args johnson et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 in particular a large fraction of tetracycline resistance genes 20 3 was identified in the swine sample whereas such genes only occupied 4 3 5 6 of the total eargs abundance in the municipal samples fig 1b and c the enrichment of tetracycline resistance genes in swine wwtp might be correlated with the abuse of tetracycline zhu et al 2013 or numerous mges johnson et al 2016 furthermore we found that 75 of the 234 earg subtypes fig 2 a which accounted for 88 9 91 2 91 1 86 4 and 83 8 of the total relative abundance of eargs in m mbr1 m mbr2 m mbr3 m and s mbr respectively fig 2b were shared among the five samples reflecting the high compositional similarity of the eargs the shared eargs were dominated by ef tu ropb and rpsl mutants fig 2b in addition we observed multiple genetic co occurrences of eargs on the same contig accounting for 2 0 6 1 of the earg carrying contigs table s3 for example ef tu mutant was detected together with rpsj mutant or rpsl mutant on one assembled contig from all ten samples fig 3 and fig s6 co occurring arg clusters have also been reported in previous studies bengtsson palme et al 2016 ma et al 2015 ng et al 2017 pehrsson et al 2016 for instance bengtsson palme et al 2016 demonstrated that beta lactamase resistance genes bla oxa 2 and bla oxa 10 were located together with sul1 in the total dna from activated sludge samples the co location of eargs may be enriched from co selection agents e g antibiotic and heavy metal and hgt i e clustering different eargs subtypes by mges mediated hgt johnson et al 2016 ju et al 2016 3 2 mobility of eargs the role of mges in the movement and proliferation of iargs has been widely elucidated elsewhere chen et al 2016 johnson et al 2016 ju et al 2019 ng et al 2017 pehrsson et al 2016 therefore we investigated the distribution of emges and their co location pattern with the eargs in the activated sludge samples to explore the mobility of eargs our rarefaction curve indicated that the sequencing depth is sufficient to characterize the emges profiles fig s3 in total we annotated 289 359 integrons 697 1021 iss and 1350 1427 plasmids with the total abundance of 0 3539 0 5422 copy per copy of 16s rrna gene 0 5543 0 7498 copy per copy of 16s rrna gene 0 0407 0 1170 copy per copy of 16s rrna gene respectively fig 4 after further classification we found that inti1 was the most abundant integron type accounting for 84 2 87 2 of the total integron abundance tn3 is256 is5 and is3 were the dominant iss families totally occupying 26 4 51 9 of the total iss abundance fig 4 in fact these integrons and iss have been found to be prevalent in activated sludge and are correlated with various args ng et al 2017 tian et al 2016 wang et al 2013 although no dominating types of plasmid were observed among the ten samples we identified some args carried plasmids e g pbi136 containing ermf fig s7 to further ascertain the role of emges in the potential mobility of eargs we examined the flanking genetic sequences in the assembled contigs that contained eargs in all 2 4 17 4 of the eargs carrying contigs was identified as being flanked by more than one emge table s3 specifically the numerous co location of eargs and emges e g sul1 3 cs tnas3 sul2 inti1 isvsa3 and tetx p63039 was observed in all samples fig 5 and fig s8 reflecting the high mobility of sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes in the environment previous studies have shown that the relative abundances of sul1 sul2 and tetx were correlated with that of inti1 and genetically co localized with inti1 bengtsson palme et al 2016 pehrsson et al 2016 wang et al 2016 indeed these args subtypes are typically located beside the 3 conservative region of inti1 wang et al 2016 we also found that two multidrug resistance genes oprj and mexd belonging to the efflux pump families embedded in plasmids fig 5 exacerbating the main public health concern of wwtps notably the number of contigs carrying earg emge in the swine sample was much higher than that in the municipal samples table s3 suggesting a relatively high rate of eargs mobilization in swine wwtp however it should be noted that the identification of earg emge may largely depend on the assembly efficiency of metagenomic sequencing table s2 and table s3 which means that adapted assembly approaches are needed to better understand the co location patterns of earg emge bengtsson palme et al 2016 mobilization has been confirmed as the main barrier to args spread forsberg et al 2014 munck et al 2015 that is once mobilized args can be found outside the local environment and even in clinical pathogens forsberg et al 2014 munck et al 2015 to date the presence of arg mge clusters has been broadly reported in wwtps chen et al 2016 munck et al 2015 pehrsson et al 2016 soil forsberg et al 2012 sediment bengtsson palme et al 2014 chen et al 2016 feces chen et al 2016 johnson et al 2016 ma et al 2015 and human pathogen forsberg et al 2012 here the eargs especially multidrug resistance determinants were firstly found to co localize with the emges underlining their potential to shuttle between the wwtps and clinic 3 3 microbial hosts of eargs microbial hosts tracking might be used to search for the link within environmental stains or between environmental and clinical bacteria huijbers et al 2015 therefore we retrieved the taxonomical assignment of earg orfs based on a combination of blastp alignment and lca based algorithm to comprehensively track the hosts of eargs overall the percentages of taxonomical annotation of args at the genus 35 1 and species 31 6 levels were relatively low which impeded a comprehensive identification of earg hosts fig 6 a this limitation is common in taxonomical annotation based on metagenomic data primarily because of the conservative nature i e high rate of unspecific assignments of lca approach port et al 2012 qin et al 2010 and a limited knowledge of the microbial sources of args in the environmental samples albertsen et al 2013 despite this we annotated 4179 earg orfs at the genus level these orfs may be derived from 375 genera with the majority identified as mycobacterium 6 7 nitrosomonas 5 3 steroidobacter 5 3 nitrospira 5 2 and pseudomonas 5 1 fig 6b indeed these genera have been recognized as the hosts of numerous args in previous studies for instance mycobacterium was found to carry tetv zhao et al 2019 and aac 2 i ma et al 2019 ng et al 2019 while nitrosomonas may harbored pena oqxbgb vanhac2 vanr f and dfrk guo et al 2017 as the most abundant earg subtypes ef tu mutant mainly originated from nitrospira nitrosomonas and hyphomicrobium fig 6c as the genetic vector of eargs edna was previously confirmed to be mainly belonging to the ammonium oxidizing nitrosomonas and the nitrite oxidizing nitrospira by combining staining with fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques dominiak et al 2011 these results suggest bacterial communities participating in the nitrogen cycle may act as the hosts of args based on the genus defined earg orfs we further explored the differences in the hosts of the eargs among the five wwtps our analysis showed that the composition of eargs hosts among municipal wwtps were similar which differed sharply from those of the swine wwtp earg orfs from municipal wwtps are mainly from mycobacterium nitrosomonas steroidobacter nitrospira and pseudomonas in contrast the hosts of eargs in swine wwtp are dominated by pseudomonas and clostridium fig 6d both of which were frequently identified as the candidates harboring the args in the animal gut fang et al 2014 hu et al 2016b li et al 2015 and livestock breeding wastewater jia et al 2017b 3 4 difference in the distribution mobility and microbial hosts between eargs and iargs since the two forms of args eargs and iargs possess substantial differences in their dissemination and propagation pathways mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 it is vital to distinguish their characteristics distribution mobility and microbial hosts generally the diversity and abundance between eargs and iargs was similar in m mbr1 and s mbr fig 7 a recently dong et al 2019 reported that the relative abundance of all the detected eargs were usually 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of iargs in activated sludge from municipal and pharmaceutical industry wwtps these findings corroborated that activated sludge is an important reservoir of eargs when compared with well known iargs pools we further examine the statistical differences between eargs and iargs using lefse method segata et al 2011 as shown in fig 7b and c 10 args categories at type level and 15 args categories at subtype level were found to be significantly different between the two forms of args specifically elfamycin ef tu mutant and tetracycline tet36 resistance genes were more abundant for iargs when compared with those for eargs on the contrary the abundance of genes resistant to peptide liar and rpoc mutants aminocoumarin pary mutant rifamycin rpob and rpoc mutants polymine emba embc and inia mutants fluoroquinolone pare mutant and dual drug gyra parc and mtra mutants were found to be significantly higher for eargs than these for iargs fig 7b and c to date there is no consensus for the differences between relative abundance of specific eargs and iargs types or subtypes for instance zhang et al 2013 found that the relative abundance of sul1 teto and tetx in the extracellular form was significantly lower than that of its intracellular counterpart in livestock waste sludge paired t test p 0 05 while the relative abundance of sul2 and tetq was comparable in both args forms the discrimination of eargs and iargs may correlate with the type of surrounding physical and genetic i e chromosomes or plasmids borne environment for args mao et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 and might be shaped by the conversion between iargs and eargs accompanied by their proliferation and degradation dong et al 2019 we next explored the difference in the mobility between eargs and iargs no significant differences inthe relative abundances of emges was observed paired t test p 0 05 fig 8 despite this we found the relative abundance of int1 the typical marker for args pollution dong et al 2019 johnson et al 2016 was significantly lower in eargs than that in iargs paired t test p 0 05 fig s9 this was consistent with the results of dong et al 2019 who have quantified the abundance of inti1 by qpcr our findings demonstrated that even free from the bacteria cell eargs can maintain their mobility finally we compared the microbial hosts of the eargs and iargs we found no significant difference in their composition from municipal wwtps both of which are dominated by nitrosomonas steroidobacter nitrospira and pseudomonas fig 9 a suggesting that most of the eargs may originate from the nonspecific lysis of microbial cells dominiak et al 2011 wu and xi 2009 for the swine wwtp the hosts of eargs and iargs are both mainly from pseudomonas and clostridium some differentially enriched genera in the microbial host of iargs versus that of eargs within the swine wwtp were identified fig 9a in particular a large fraction of nitrospira was presented in the hosts of iargs whereas such genus was nearly undetectable in the hosts of eargs fig 9a notably significantly higher proportion of mycobacterium was found in the host of eargs than in iargs host paired t test p 0 05 fig 9a which is further supported by the lefse analysis fig 9b 4 conclusions to our best knowledge this is the first documentation for broad spectrum profiling of eargs in activated sludge from wwtps using a metagenomic approach our study confirmed the existence of eargs reservoir in activated sludge our characterization of the distribution mobility and microbial sources of eargs in wwtps could clarify their potential to the spread of args in the environment and thus is critical for addressing the conflicting strategies aimed at water sustainability and public health goals the major conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the total eargs abundance in activated sludge from five wwtps ranging from 9 5 10 6 to 1 3 10 4 multiple shared earg subtypes e g ef tu ropb and rpsl mutants and some co localized eargs e g ef tu rpsj and ef tu rpsl among the wwtps samples were identified 2 289 359 integrons 697 1021 iss and 1350 1427 plasmids were annotated in the edna samples with the total abundance of 0 3539 0 5422 copy per copy of 16s rrna gene 0 5543 0 7498 copy per copy of 16s rrna gene 0 0407 0 1170 copy per copy of 16s rrna gene respectively in addition 2 4 17 4 of the unique eargs especially sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes carrying contigs was flanked by more than one emge e g sul1 3 cs tnas3 sul2 inti1 isvsa3 and tetx p63039 3 eargs from municipal wwtps are mainly derived from mycobacterium nitrosomonas steroidobacter nitrospira and pseudomonas whereas the hosts of eargs in swine wwtp are dominated by pseudomonas and clostridium 4 eargs and iargs showed the similar diversity abundance and mobility no significant difference in their host composition from municipal wwtps both dominated by nitrosomonas steroidobacter nitrospira and pseudomonas while some differentially enriched genera particularly nitrospira in the hosts of iargs compared with those of eargs in the swine wwtp were identified although our results preliminary revealed the eargs reservoir in the activated sludge examining more spatial and temporal samples for eargs profiling identifying the key operational parameters and environmental factors that contribute to the dynamic and release of eargs and exploring the degree of true transformation of eargs and the pathways for eargs transforming to clinic are merited in the future study declaration of

18718,phosphorus p is the main nutrient that causes eutrophication in fresh waters the majority of p in lake ecosystems is usually stored in the bottom sediment hence p cycling from the sediment into the water column can significantly and negatively impact water quality however sediment nutrients are not taken into account for instance in the ecological status assessment determined by the european water framework directive this encourages lake managers to improve the water quality at the expense of the sediment for example chemical inactivation of p has been applied to the sediment in numerous lakes for rapid water quality improvement while this may generate immediate results inactivation of sediment p may in fact delay the long term recovery of lake ecosystems and inhibit the re use of nutrients in some specific cases these rapid restoration efforts that compromise sediment quality are justified nevertheless we should aim for a general strategy that can promote permanent recovery of lake ecosystems including their sediments the support for such restoration activities may be difficult to find since the tangible outcome is realized only after long periods of time graphical abstract image 1 keywords lakes ecological status assessment phosphorus sediment restoration 1 introduction phosphorus p is the main nutrient that controls the productivity of fresh waters thus excessive external loading of p causes eutrophication problems schindler 2012 the majority of p in lake ecosystems is usually stored in the bottom sediment which can be recycled into the water column by various mechanisms pettersson 1998 søndergaard et al 2003 while large scale removal of sediment is one way to reduce external p loading for lake restoration it is rarely possible due to the high cost and difficulties attributed to the large disposal areas needed for the removed sediment peterson 1982 cooke et al 2005 therefore instead of nutrient removal most lake restoration methods aim to simply diminish the flux of p from the sediment to the water for instance chemical inactivation of p has been used as a restoration tool in a large number of eutrophic lakes cooke et al 2005 huser et al 2016 the chemical methods use an inactivation agent e g aluminum al or iron fe salt or lanthanum la amended clay which is added to the lake in order to bind p to the sediment this decreases the p concentration in the water and increases the sorption capacity of the sediment thus decreasing the overall recycling of sediment p to the water column søndergaard et al 2003 cooke et al 2005 similarly other frequently used restoration methods such as artificial aeration and oxygenation also often aim to diminish the flux of p from the sediment to the water as p is sorbed to fe under oxidized conditions and can hence be retained in the sediment beutel and horne 1999 bormans et al 2016 on the other hand both fe and sorbed p return into solution under anoxic conditions e g søndergaard et al 2003 this article aims to highlight why future research efforts should focus on developing restoration methods that target the removal of p from lakes and facilitate the re use of p rather than aiming to retain p in the sediment 2 sediment nutrients ecological status assessment and pressure for restoration inactivation of p through chemical methods has been applied to lake restoration for decades e g cooke et al 2005 yet the interest in such methods still continues to increase indeed chemical lake restoration methods are being applied all over the world including africa asia australia europe new zealand and north america liu et al 2009 egemose et al 2010 zamparas and zacharias 2014 xue and lu 2015 huser et al 2016 this may indicate the improvement of treatment chemicals but also reflects the desire for rapid water quality improvement and requirements set by public authorities a good example is the european water framework directive wfd according to the wfd set in 2000 all waters within the european union eu were required to be in good ecological status by 2015 with extensions by 2021 or 2027 as a result rapidly acting chemical methods are being used to achieve this wfd water quality criteria on schedule egemose et al 2010 zamparas and zacharias 2014 according to the wfd the ecological status of lakes is determined through hydro morphological conditions physical chemical water quality as well as through phytoplankton zoobenthos macrophyte and fish communities with criteria determined separately for various lake types søndergaard et al 2005 however nutrients in the sediment are not taken into account in spite of the ample studies that have confirmed the strong effect of sediment nutrients on the water quality and thus the biotic communities of lakes nürnberg 1991 2009 søndergaard et al 2003 tammeorg et al 2017 while some fractions of p in the sediment are permanently buried others are mobile exchangeable and can recycle back into the water column for instance by diffusion e g carignan and flett 1981 rydin 2000 loosely sorbed organic and inorganic fractions of p fe bound p as well as organic p in the non reactive naoh extractable p fraction are considered mobile and can amount to a large percentage of the total p in the sediment carignan and flett 1981 rydin 2000 søndergaard et al 2003 reitzel et al 2005 internal p cycling that reduces the water quality and delays the recovery of eutrophicated lakes originates from the mobile p pool søndergaard et al 2003 therefore some authors have reinforced the perspective that sediments are an essential part of aquatic ecosystems and should therefore be given a stronger role in the wfd classification system brils 2008 3 downside of rapid lake restoration classification criteria always include compromises and it is not possible to include all regulatory factors costs of monitoring the chosen parameters must also be taken into account importantly when sediment p is ignored it is possible that the ecological status of a lake can be classified as high i e indicating minimum anthropogenic impact when in fact the sediment represents a very different status therefore it is possible to conclude that the use of chemical p inactivation accelerates the recovery of lakes from eutrophication reitzel et al 2005 consequently the view that the sediment p can be isolated from the rest of the lake ecosystem inevitably encourages lake managers to improve the water quality at the expense of the sediment egemose et al 2010 nevertheless carpenter et al 2001 stated that if the concentration of sediment p in relation to water p is high enough the system will always move back to the turbid water state thus by enriching the sediment with p the water quality may be immediately improved at the expense of water quality in the future accordingly in most cases the effects of chemical treatments are temporary although the effects can last for decades usually the longevity is much shorter cooke et al 2005 huser et al 2016 the difficulties to inhibit the internal p loading from the sediment are reflected also in the weak effects of artificial aeration despite the often insignificant effects on surface water quality aeration is used frequently due to its functional versatility and seemingly unproblematic applicability salmi et al 2014 kuha et al 2016 schönach et al 2017 overall most attempts to restore eutrophic lakes only produce temporary effects and few lakes have been successfully restored to the clear water state after turning turbid osgood 2000 carpenter et al 2001 søndergaard et al 2007 however the major goal in restoration is that the restored ecosystem does not require further interventions to be sustainable suding and gross 2006 additionally p is a valuable natural resource with a decreasing availability hence there is a growing concern about the scarcity of mineable p resources for crop production elser and bennett 2011 neset and cordell 2012 to prevent the exhaustion of the reserves of phosphate rock there is a clear need to ensure the efficient recycling of p dawson and hilton 2011 this aspect also argues against the strategy of enriching lake sediments with p and serves as a reminder that burying p into sediment layers is not sustainable zamparas and zacharias 2014 4 time scales of restoration each lake must be studied separately indeed there are cases where rapid restoration efforts that compromise sediment quality are justified continuous management efforts with short lived results can be the best strategy for instance in drinking water supply lakes and reservoirs and in landscapes where there are only a few lakes in good condition cooke and kennedy 2001 hanson et al 2017 on a larger scale however we should aim for a strategy that can lead to permanent improvement in the status of lake ecosystems including their sediments for example methods that could potentially be used to remove and recycle p accumulated in lake sediments include hypolimnetic withdrawal nürnberg 2007 www helsinki fi en researchgroups lake ecosystem dynamics this method involves pumping or siphoning p rich water from the anoxic deep water of a eutrophic lake and trapping p before leading the water downstream or back into the lake as reminded by nürnberg 1991 internal p load from the sediment into the water is a self purification process thus more effort should be put towards developing methods that would use this internal flux for removing p from the ecosystem instead of methods that aim to inhibit the flux other inadequately studied methods for removing p include novel sediment removal techniques https seabasedmeasures eu pilots and removal of organisms that exploit sediment p such as macrophytes asaeda et al 2000 james et al 2002 benthivorous fish drenner et al 1996 bernes et al 2015 and algae xie et al 2003 brandenburg et al 2008 most of the methods based on p removal do not improve the water quality as rapidly as those methods that enrich the sediment with p this creates a perception problem since the temporal scales of ecosystem responses can exceed the scales over which humans are willing to understand power 1999 moreover there are also societal and political dimensions to be considered in restoration and management hence support for restoration activities may be difficult to find when their outcome is expected after decades even though it is unrealistic to assume that disturbances caused by decades of environmental stress e g eutrophication can be corrected in a much shorter time keller et al 1999 power 1999 indeed restoration often takes a much longer time than the time of degradation moreno mateos et al 2012 lake 2013 therefore long term restoration methods and projects should be encouraged and sediment nutrients should be taken into account when assessing the ecological status of lakes this would likely alter the ecological status classification of many lakes but would also give a more realistic overview about the situation in these lakes and the time scales needed for their restoration 5 conclusions most methods that are frequently used in the restoration of eutrophicated lakes aim to retain p in the sediment enriching the sediments with p is unsustainable because it can delay the long term recovery of lake ecosystems and inhibits the re use of p the current demands for rapid improvement of water quality encourage restoration of lakes at the expense of the sediment quality an example of such a demand is the classification system of the ecological state of lakes in the eu long term restoration methods and projects should be encouraged and sediment nutrients should be taken into account when assessing the status of lakes declaration of interests the authors declare that

the water column can significantly and negatively impact water quality however sediment nutrients are not taken into account for instance in the ecological status assessment determined by the european water framework directive this encourages lake managers to improve the water quality at the expense of the sediment for example chemical inactivation of p has been applied to the sediment in numerous lakes for rapid water quality improvement while this may generate immediate results inactivation of sediment p may in fact delay the long term recovery of lake ecosystems and inhibit the re use of nutrients in some specific cases these rapid restoration efforts that compromise sediment quality are justified nevertheless we should aim for a general strategy that can promote permanent recovery of lake ecosystems including their sediments the support for such restoration activities may be difficult to find since the tangible outcome is realized only after long periods of time graphical abstract image 1 keywords lakes ecological status assessment phosphorus sediment restoration 1 introduction phosphorus p is the main nutrient that controls the productivity of fresh waters thus excessive external loading of p causes eutrophication problems schindler 2012 the majority of p in lake ecosystems is usually stored in the bottom sediment which can be recycled into the water column by various mechanisms pettersson 1998 søndergaard et al 2003 while large scale removal of sediment is one way to reduce external p loading for lake restoration it is rarely possible due to the high cost and difficulties attributed to the large disposal areas needed for the removed sediment peterson 1982 cooke et al 2005 therefore instead of nutrient removal most lake restoration methods aim to simply diminish the flux of p from the sediment to the water for instance chemical inactivation of p has been used as a restoration tool in a large number of eutrophic lakes cooke et al 2005 huser et al 2016 the chemical methods use an inactivation agent e g aluminum al or iron fe salt or lanthanum la amended clay which is added to the lake in order to bind p to the sediment this decreases the p concentration in the water and increases the sorption capacity of the sediment thus decreasing the overall recycling of sediment p to the water column søndergaard et al 2003 cooke et al 2005 similarly other frequently used restoration methods such as artificial aeration and oxygenation also often aim to diminish the flux of p from the sediment to the water as p is sorbed to fe under oxidized conditions and can hence be retained in the sediment beutel and horne 1999 bormans et al 2016 on the other hand both fe and sorbed p return into solution under anoxic conditions e g søndergaard et al 2003 this article aims to highlight why future research efforts should focus on developing restoration methods that target the removal of p from lakes and facilitate the re use of p rather than aiming to retain p in the sediment 2 sediment nutrients ecological status assessment and pressure for restoration inactivation of p through chemical methods has been applied to lake restoration for decades e g cooke et al 2005 yet the interest in such methods still continues to increase indeed chemical lake restoration methods are being applied all over the world including africa asia australia europe new zealand and north america liu et al 2009 egemose et al 2010 zamparas and zacharias 2014 xue and lu 2015 huser et al 2016 this may indicate the improvement of treatment chemicals but also reflects the desire for rapid water quality improvement and requirements set by public authorities a good example is the european water framework directive wfd according to the wfd set in 2000 all waters within the european union eu were required to be in good ecological status by 2015 with extensions by 2021 or 2027 as a result rapidly acting chemical methods are being used to achieve this wfd water quality criteria on schedule egemose et al 2010 zamparas and zacharias 2014 according to the wfd the ecological status of lakes is determined through hydro morphological conditions physical chemical water quality as well as through phytoplankton zoobenthos macrophyte and fish communities with criteria determined separately for various lake types søndergaard et al 2005 however nutrients in the sediment are not taken into account in spite of the ample studies that have confirmed the strong effect of sediment nutrients on the water quality and thus the biotic communities of lakes nürnberg 1991 2009 søndergaard et al 2003 tammeorg et al 2017 while some fractions of p in the sediment are permanently buried others are mobile exchangeable and can recycle back into the water column for instance by diffusion e g carignan and flett 1981 rydin 2000 loosely sorbed organic and inorganic fractions of p fe bound p as well as organic p in the non reactive naoh extractable p fraction are considered mobile and can amount to a large percentage of the total p in the sediment carignan and flett 1981 rydin 2000 søndergaard et al 2003 reitzel et al 2005 internal p cycling that reduces the water quality and delays the recovery of eutrophicated lakes originates from the mobile p pool søndergaard et al 2003 therefore some authors have reinforced the perspective that sediments are an essential part of aquatic ecosystems and should therefore be given a stronger role in the wfd classification system brils 2008 3 downside of rapid lake restoration classification criteria always include compromises and it is not possible to include all regulatory factors costs of monitoring the chosen parameters must also be taken into account importantly when sediment p is ignored it is possible that the ecological status of a lake can be classified as high i e indicating minimum anthropogenic impact when in fact the sediment represents a very different status therefore it is possible to conclude that the use of chemical p inactivation accelerates the recovery of lakes from eutrophication reitzel et al 2005 consequently the view that the sediment p can be isolated from the rest of the lake ecosystem inevitably encourages lake managers to improve the water quality at the expense of the sediment egemose et al 2010 nevertheless carpenter et al 2001 stated that if the concentration of sediment p in relation to water p is high enough the system will always move back to the turbid water state thus by enriching the sediment with p the water quality may be immediately improved at the expense of water quality in the future accordingly in most cases the effects of chemical treatments are temporary although the effects can last for decades usually the longevity is much shorter cooke et al 2005 huser et al 2016 the difficulties to inhibit the internal p loading from the sediment are reflected also in the weak effects of artificial aeration despite the often insignificant effects on surface water quality aeration is used frequently due to its functional versatility and seemingly unproblematic applicability salmi et al 2014 kuha et al 2016 schönach et al 2017 overall most attempts to restore eutrophic lakes only produce temporary effects and few lakes have been successfully restored to the clear water state after turning turbid osgood 2000 carpenter et al 2001 søndergaard et al 2007 however the major goal in restoration is that the restored ecosystem does not require further interventions to be sustainable suding and gross 2006 additionally p is a valuable natural resource with a decreasing availability hence there is a growing concern about the scarcity of mineable p resources for crop production elser and bennett 2011 neset and cordell 2012 to prevent the exhaustion of the reserves of phosphate rock there is a clear need to ensure the efficient recycling of p dawson and hilton 2011 this aspect also argues against the strategy of enriching lake sediments with p and serves as a reminder that burying p into sediment layers is not sustainable zamparas and zacharias 2014 4 time scales of restoration each lake must be studied separately indeed there are cases where rapid restoration efforts that compromise sediment quality are justified continuous management efforts with short lived results can be the best strategy for instance in drinking water supply lakes and reservoirs and in landscapes where there are only a few lakes in good condition cooke and kennedy 2001 hanson et al 2017 on a larger scale however we should aim for a strategy that can lead to permanent improvement in the status of lake ecosystems including their sediments for example methods that could potentially be used to remove and recycle p accumulated in lake sediments include hypolimnetic withdrawal nürnberg 2007 www helsinki fi en researchgroups lake ecosystem dynamics this method involves pumping or siphoning p rich water from the anoxic deep water of a eutrophic lake and trapping p before leading the water downstream or back into the lake as reminded by nürnberg 1991 internal p load from the sediment into the water is a self purification process thus more effort should be put towards developing methods that would use this internal flux for removing p from the ecosystem instead of methods that aim to inhibit the flux other inadequately studied methods for removing p include novel sediment removal techniques https seabasedmeasures eu pilots and removal of organisms that exploit sediment p such as macrophytes asaeda et al 2000 james et al 2002 benthivorous fish drenner et al 1996 bernes et al 2015 and algae xie et al 2003 brandenburg et al 2008 most of the methods based on p removal do not improve the water quality as rapidly as those methods that enrich the sediment with p this creates a perception problem since the temporal scales of ecosystem responses can exceed the scales over which humans are willing to understand power 1999 moreover there are also societal and political dimensions to be considered in restoration and management hence support for restoration activities may be difficult to find when their outcome is expected after decades even though it is unrealistic to assume that disturbances caused by decades of environmental stress e g eutrophication can be corrected in a much shorter time keller et al 1999 power 1999 indeed restoration often takes a much longer time than the time of degradation moreno mateos et al 2012 lake 2013 therefore long term restoration methods and projects should be encouraged and sediment nutrients should be taken into account when assessing the ecological status of lakes this would likely alter the ecological status classification of many lakes but would also give a more realistic overview about the situation in these lakes and the time scales needed for their restoration 5 conclusions most methods that are frequently used in the restoration of eutrophicated lakes aim to retain p in the sediment enriching the sediments with p is unsustainable because it can delay the long term recovery of lake ecosystems and inhibits the re use of p the current demands for rapid improvement of water quality encourage restoration of lakes at the expense of the sediment quality an example of such a demand is the classification system of the ecological state of lakes in the eu long term restoration methods and projects should be encouraged and sediment nutrients should be taken into account when assessing the status of lakes declaration of interests the authors declare that

18719,the influence of diel temperature variations dtvs on nitrogen removal and bacterial communities was investigated in two parallel anammox reactors i e control and dtv reactors the control reactor was operated at a constant temperature of 30 c whereas the dtv reactor was operated in a temperature fluctuation mode with a cycle of 12 12 h of high low temperatures nine water temperature variations for the day night periods were set from 30 30 c i e δ0 c to 38 22 c i e δ16 c an increase in dtvs from δ8 c 34 26 c to δ16 c 38 22 c caused a significant decline in reactor performance and a shift in bacterial diversity compared to the control reactor for instance nitrogen removal efficiency decreased p 0 05 when temperature fluctuations exceeded δ8 c in the dtv reactor with a decreasing δno3 δnh4 ratio from 0 21 0 15 to 0 16 0 04 the results of 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that the initial disturbance of temperature variations led to increased levels of bacterial diversity i e alpha diversity and decreased community levels of anammox consortia whereas they slightly recovered at the end of each dtv phase notably candidatus jettenia was more sensitive to strong water temperature fluctuations with the lower relative abundance at δ14 c 17 11 5 01 and δ16 c 17 83 7 22 than at δ4 c 39 82 0 01 in contrast ca brocadia and ca kuenenia had higher relative abundance at δ14 c i e 0 24 0 07 and 0 09 0 02 respectively and δ16 c i e 0 28 0 05 and 0 12 0 03 respectively compared to that at δ4 c i e 0 15 0 04 and 0 04 0 01 respectively nitrifiers i e unidentified nitrospiraceae and nitrosomonas and denitrifiers i e denitratisoma were also capable of tolerating high temperature perturbations overall this study furthers our knowledge of responses of the microbial ecology of anammox bacteria to dtvs in anammox processes which could aid us in optimizing anammox related wastewater treatment systems and in understanding the nitrogen cycles of natural ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox nitrogen removal community composition bacterial diversity diel temperature perturbation 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is known as an important

processes have been applied for mainstream wastewater treatment ma et al 2016 because of their potential contributions to achieving energy neutral or positive sewage treatment however anammox bacteria are sensitive to ambient conditions such as ph dissolved oxygen do salinity and temperature levels jin et al 2012 thus resulting in operating problems although anammox bacteria have been found at extreme temperatures as high as 60 80 c e g hot springs and as low as 5 4 c byrne et al 2009 jaeschke et al 2009 li et al 2010 associated activity and community structures are largely impacted by temperature isanta et al 2015 lotti et al 2015 additionally seasonal temperature variations have been found to substantially impact bacterial communities in anammox reactors agrawal et al 2017 fernandes et al 2018 for instance agrawal et al 2017 found the shift from the summer season 20 c to the winter season 10 c led to the enrichment of a cold tolerant anammox species i e ca kuenenia furthermore fernandes et al 2018 found that a decrease in temperature from 35 c to 20 c changed microbial community structures and diversity levels in an anammox reactor a recent study focusing on sewage sludge reported on the dominance of ca brocadia in the spring roughly 20 c and 23 c and summer roughly 28 c and 31 c and the dominance of ca jettenia in the autumn roughly 15 c and 16 c xu et al 2017 ca brocadia dominance was also found in the summer in both the eutrophic dianchi lake and mesotrophic erhai lake yang et al 2017 although these previousstudies cannot be used to reach an agreement on the linkages between the anammox genus and ambient temperatures likely due to differing experimental systems involved they clearly imply the significance of temperature in determining both the activity and genus or species of anammox bacteria in fact as part of a half closed engineered system anammox reactors are normally subjected to more intense levels of temperature variability e g diel temperature variations or dtvs than seasonal temperature variations in some inland areas such as the city of hohhot china teheran iran and khartum sudan diel temperature variations can reach up to 25 30 c in the summer season furthermore human activities can lead to a high level of temporal and spatial thermal variability e g industrial heat emissions and the change of climate suggest that many regions may experience more variable temperatures in the future coulter et al 2015 easterling et al 2000 milly et al 2002 schar et al 2004 for all averaging periods and seasons the water temperature and surface air temperature correlations are generally high indicating the high level of thermal communication at the interface erickson and stefan 2000 jaswal et al 2012 wang et al 2011 which inevitably results in dtvs in the water of engineered systems and natural ecosystems recently it has been documented that diel fluctuations of water temperatures can cause sex reversal in fathead minnows by affecting the expression of thermoresponsive genes coulter et al 2015 thus considering the temperature dependence of the abundance and activity of anammox species we hypothesized that diel temperature shifts could potentially impact the anammox process including nitrogen removal processes and bacterial community structures it can be expected that species specific responses to temperature would finally regulate the community structures of anammox consortia in this study therefore two parallel anammox reactors i e control and dtv reactors with the same seeding sludge were operated for a long period around 466 d to explore the consequences of press dtvs in the context of ecosystem functioning and microbial diversity nitrogen removal was fully investigated in different periods with increasing dtvs i e δ0 δ2 δ4 δ6 δ8 δ10 δ12 δ14 and δ16 c microbiota compositions were monitored over time to correlate their dynamics with reactor performance overall our results can

obtained from a lab scale up flow column anammox reactor operated at 37 c meng et al 2014 initial biomass concentrations in the reactors were measured at 1 4 g volatile suspended solids vss per liter based on a 1 l reactor volume the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactors was set to roughly 10 h no additional sludge was discharged from the reactor except for the sampling that is the reactor was operated at a prolonged solid retention time srt the nutrient medium consisted of nh4 2so4 112 mg n l nano2 120 mg n l nahco3 420 mg l kh2po4 44 mg l and 2 ml l of trace element solution van de graaf aa et al 1996 the ph was maintained at 7 5 0 3 the control reactor was operated at a constant temperature of 30 c in a water bath the dtv reactor was operated in a temperature fluctuation mode with a cycle of 12 h of high temperatures and 12 h of low temperatures using circulating water jackets huber german nine water temperature variations for the day night periods were set from 30 30 c i e δ0 c to 38 22 c i e δ16 c so that 30 c of the mean diel temperature was designed to be the same as the control increasing or decreasing temperatures in the dtv reactor were facilitated gently for roughly 2 h to eliminate the effects of sudden temperature shocks on reactor performance and bacterial activity 2 2 sample collection each dtv phase was operated for approximately 50 d in total 45 anammox sludge samples were collected from five phases i e δ0 δ4 δ10 δ14 and δ16 c triplicate samples of the control reactor were collected in each phase in addition triplicate samples of the dtv reactor were obtained in the initial and the terminal period of each dtv table s1 to maintain the homogeneity of biofilm samples the biomass was washed from non woven fabrics of the reactors these samples were mixed and then washed with pre chilled phosphate buffered saline buffer pbs buffer 10 mm ph 7 5 three times all the samples were subsequently frozen under sub zero temperatures 80 c for microbial community analysis 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing samples for dna extraction were employed using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentration and quality of the dna extraction were determined with a micro spectrophotometric technique using a nanodrop

agilent bioanalyzer 2100 system the library was sequenced on an illumina hiseq2500 platform and 250 bp paired end reads were produced 2 4 community structure and biodiversity analysis the raw data were processed to remove low quality bases phred quality scores of less than 20 with trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 then sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with usearch software version 8 0 http drive5 com uparse using the usparse algorithm edgar 2013 with a 0 03 dissimilarity cutoff after singletons were removed the otu representative sequences were classified against the silva database pruesse et al 2007 otus classified as unknown chloroplast mitochondria and eukaryota were removed prior to subsequent analysis to accurately compare the 45 samples at the same sequencing depth 46402 sequences were normalized from each sample for subsequent bioinformatics analyses to accurately compare bacterial diversities responding differently to the dtv treatments we calculated chao1 ace shannon simpson and coverage values to reflect the diversity and richness of the metacommunities of the different samples kemp and aller 2004 to compute alpha diversity values the pairwise community similarity of the weighted unifrac wu lozupone and knight 2005 and morisita horn mh indices were computed in qiime using the alpha diversity py script to ascertain temporal and spatial dynamics of bacterial community composition for the same dtv phase and between dtvs a principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the bray curtis distance metric was employed at the otu level an analysis of similarity anosim and permutational multivariate analysis of variance adonis was performed based on bray curtis dissimilarity distance matrices of the otu level the pcoa was carried out using r package vegan oksanen et al 2010 and was plotted using the ggplot2 package wickham 2010 within the r environment for statistical computing http www r project org 2 5 chemical analyses the water quality of influents and effluents of the anammox biofilm reactors was monitored periodically ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n and total nitrogen tn concentrations were determined according to standard methods apha 1995 ph and do values were monitored using a ph meter inolab 7310 wtw germany and do meter cellox 3310i wtw germany respectively 2 6 sequence accession number sequence reads were deposited in the sequence read archive sra under accession number sub4153415 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of dtvs on reactor performance fig 1 illustrates that a satisfactory level of nitrogen removal efficiency e g 88 68 2 68 97 25 3 44 and 83 49 4 27 for nh4 n no2 n and tn respectively was achieved in the dtv reactor with limited water temperature fluctuations i e δ0 δ6 c which was approximately similar to that at the control reactor p 0 05 however the nitrogen removal efficiency decreased when water temperature fluctuations exceeded δ8 c fig 1d e g the nitrogen removal rate nrr declined by 10 30 13 65 p 0 05 in the dtv reactor exposed to high water temperature fluctuations i e δ10 δ16 c numerous studies have documented that temperature declines i e from 29 to 12 5 c laureni et al 2015 and seasonal variations i e from 20 c in the summer to 10 c in the winter agrawal et al 2017 led to decreased nitrogen removal rates of anammox processes unlike what was found in these previous studies anammox bacteria in the dtv reactor were subject to diel temperature shifts with an average temperature of 30 c therefore the present study and previous findings imply that the temperature shock occurring at seasonal or diel levels can lead to diminished or poor nitrogen removal performance furthermore ratios of δno2 δnh4 and δno3 δnh4 are often used as operation indicators for anammox reactors zhu et al 2018 in the present study δno2 δnh4 and δno3 δnh4 ratios at low temperature fluctuations were measured at 1 23 0 08 and 0 23 0 03 fig 1c respectively which are both lower than the stoichiometric ratios 1 32 and 0 26 determined by strous et al 1998 but higher than those 1 15 and 0 16 given by lotti et al 2014 the stoichiometric ratio often deviates from the theoretical value under conditions of environmental stress in contrast to those at the low temperature fluctuations observed the mean stoichiometric coefficients of δno2 δnh4 and δno3 δnh4 consumption at δ8 δ16 c were lower i e 1 12 0 16 and 0 21 0 15 for δ8 c and 1 13 0 18 and 0 16 0 04 for δ16 c respectively the decreased δno2 δnh4 ratio observed is attributable to the susceptibility of anammox bacteria or to the adaptability of aob bacteria to temperature shocks congruent with chamchoi and nitisoravut 2007 the decreased δno3 δnh4 ratio observed occurred due to the superior adaptability of denitrifying bacteria to temperature shocks relative to other bacteria see fig 4 in section 3 4 the decreased nitrate concentrations from 21 32 3 68 mg l 1 at δ10 c to 11 56 3 47 mg l 1 at δ16 c in the effluent of the dtv reactor with increasing temperature fluctuations further corroborate our speculation of the satisfactory activity of denitrifying bacteria fig 1c the above phenomena can be further confirmed from the 16s rrna sequencing results of our study section 3 5 3 2 effects of dtvs on bacterial diversity a total of 3 826 836 high quality amplicon reads were obtained at an average read depth of 83 021 sequences sample with sequence statistics of 48 635 95 334 81 000 10 220 min max median s d respectively and a total of 5729 operational taxonomic units otus 97 sequence similarity according to the average neighbor method in fig 2 the increase in dtvs from δ0 c to δ16 c led to significant fluctuations in taxonomic diversity as revealed by richness estimators ace and chao1 and diversity indices shannon and simpson fig 2 table s2 we found that ace and chao1 did not show significant differences at a constant temperature between the control and dtv reactors at high temperature fluctuations in the present study both ace and chao1 indices were higher in the initial periods of δ10 c p 0 05 δ14 c p 0 01 and δ16 c p 0 05 relative to the control reactor in contrast the two indices recovered to similar levels as the control at the end of each dtv phase after roughly 20 d normally bacterial biofilms or aggregates respond to environmental stresses via biodiversity effects parijs and steenackers 2018 i e the more complex the environments the higher species diversity palmer et al 2002 in addition the environment shock can inevitably lead to the death of some bacteria the lysis products from these dead cells can serve as nutrients for other bacteria thus leading to a high diversity of species isanta et al 2015 therefore the environment shock induced by the initial dtv shifts resulted in increased biodiversity in our current study however the bacteria community would gradually adapt to the imposed stress during the long term exposure as exemplified by the partial recovery of the abundance of anammox bacteria see fig 5 in section 3 5 it led to a decreased or recovered biodiversity in our study on the other hand the shannon index of the dtv reactor which can denote the richness of a bacterial community underwent changes similar to those of the ace and chao1 estimators throughout the operation however the simpson index as an indicator of to the evenness of a community did not show significant responses to the sudden onset of dtv stresses the richness and evenness of bacterial species shaped by disturbances should be a cumulative result of the different responses of various species to perturbation some species that can tolerate such disturbance can survive whereas others may disappear sagar et al 2003 griffiths et al 2000 have also shown that microbial functions are initially depressed by stress and recover over time and that such resilience is negatively affected when biodiversity declines according to the insurance hypothesis yachi and loreau 1999 species richness can positively impact ecosystem productivity through a buffering effect against disturbances and thus a performance enhancing effect these results suggest that alpha diversity is a very sensitive indicator of disturbance and especially in regions where external factors such as seasonal droughts or temperature cycles fluctuate significantly lynch et al 2004 moreover a higher level of microbial diversity in a system can create more resistance to persistent stress than lower levels of microbial diversity griffiths et al 2000 overall the data of these indices suggest that shifts in dtvs resulted in decreased levels of diversity and richness in anammox consortia both of which partially recovered during long term exposure to dtvs the dtv induced decline of bacterial diversity and richness created instability in anammox reactors 3 3 effects of dtvs on dynamic changes in bacterial communities to better evaluate the dynamics of community composition a pcoa plot based on bray curtis distance using log transformed counts was created fig 3 note that the samples of constant temperature including samples from the control reactor at 30 c and from the dtv reactor at δ0 c clustered very closely indicating that a stable community established in the dtv reactor before temperature fluctuation treatments however significant changes in the dtv samples as a function of increasing temperature fluctuations i e δ4 δ10 δ14 and δ16 c p 0 001 took place along principal coordinate 1 pc1 37 1 of the total variability and were clearly separate from the constant temperature samples this indicates the importance of dtvs to dynamics of the microbial community structures of anammox reactors previously temperature variations at the seasonal scale were also documented to be one of the main factors leading to microbial dynamics of suspended and biofilm communities in drinking water microbiomes ling et al 2016 pinto et al 2014 global anosim results further presented strong and significant variations in metacommunities across all dtv operating phases r 0 78 p 0 001 table s3 in particular there were different communities between low i e δ0 and δ4 c and high i e δ10 δ14 and δ16 c dtvs pairwise ecological dissimilarities of composition and relatedness can indicate changes in microbial community composition across all samples vuono et al 2015 additionally significant time decay values were obtained from the dtv system at δ14 and δ16 c fig s2a indicating that the community suffered dynamic succession with the addition and replacement of new community members phylogenetic relatedness results wu fig s2b also reveal similar patterns to those of the mh index between dtvs suggesting that phylogenetically related organisms can reestablish either regrowth e g dormant or recolonization immigration from a source community by organisms at the end of each dtv phase vuono et al 2015 overall these results denote the vulnerability of some organisms with dtvs and the adaptability of some organisms after long term exposure to dtvs 3 4 effects of dtvs on community composition fig 4a presents averaged abundances of the major phyla top 10 in control and of the dtv reactor planctomycetes were the most abundant phylum accounted for 50 44 64 91 under low dtvs by contrast a remarkable decrease in planctomycetes averaged at 29 89 was observed when the dtv reactor was exposed to strong water temperature fluctuations e g δ10 δ14 and δ16 c suggesting the vulnerability of planctomycetes to high dtvs note that the abundance of the phylum planctomycetes slightly increased after long term exposure to dtvs relative to that of the initial period this phenomenon mainly occurred because relative to other genera the dominant genus ca jettenia of planctomycetes adapted to the dtvs more readily after long term exposure to dtvs see fig 5 of section 3 5 other subdominant phyla including proteobacteria chloroflexi ignavibacteriae and chlorobi accounted for 4 57 46 19 of all bacterial sequences which have also been frequently found in full and lab scale anammox reactors gonzalez martinez et al 2015 pereira et al 2014 a recent study suggest that in addition to planctomycetes chloroflexi was also susceptive to temperatures in a partial nitrification anammox system wu et al 2016a the phylum chloroflexi in anammox consortia can take up the cell material of decaying anammox bacteria kindaichi et al 2012 thus decreasing levels of planctomycetes were accompanied by increasing levels of chloroflexi from 6 10 1 95 at δ0 c to 19 99 8 91 at δ16 c interestingly the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased considerably from 20 06 to 34 91 with increasing dtvs e g from δ10 to δ16 c implying the better adaptability of this phylum to high dtvs relative to other phyla wu et al 2017 also reported an increasing abundance of proteobacteria from 22 9 to 29 3 when the temperature of a partial nitrification anammox reactor decreased from 35 c to 21 c at the genus level more than 664 bacterial taxa were detected among them a total of 516 genera were commonly shared by the two reactors fig s3 accounting for 82 16 99 21 in otus moreover 86 and 228 genera were identified as maximum unique otus in the control and dtv reactors respectively these results further verify the richness of bacterial taxa in samples collected from dtv reactors the ten most abundant genera in the 45 samples were analyzed a total of 27 genera fig 4b among which eight genera were the most abundant in the shared samples including ca jettenia sm1a02 denitratisoma unidentified sja 28 ignavibacterium unidentified anaerolineaceae unidentified fimbriimonadales and pseudomonas all of these were found to be abundant genera in anammox ecosystems allegue et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2018a additionally it is interesting to find that nine genera were exclusively abundant in the control and or dtv reactor i e unidentified opb56 lanchnospiraceae nk4a136 group staphylococcus bacteroides and enterococcus were abundant in the control reactor and lactobacillus paludibaculum alistipes and unidentified nitrospiraceae were abundant in the dtv reactor indicating their susceptibility or tolerance to dtv perturbations according to ma et al 2013 temperature variations trigger strong changes in bacterial compositions i e the dominant genus at high temperature was zoogloea whereas actinobacteria haliscomenobacter and thiothrix were dominant genera at low temperature moreover the relative abundance of sm1a02 i e from 6 68 0 78 at δ0 c to 1 37 0 53 at δ16 c decreased with increasing dtvs whereas strong temperature fluctuations could stimulate the relative abundance of denitratisoma i e from 5 06 0 57 at δ0 c to 15 76 2 95 at δ16 c increase or decrease in temperatures displayed a great influence on the microorganisms leading to a distinct microbial community fernandes et al 2018 isanta et al 2015 wu et al 2017 for instance similar dynamic patterns of microbial communities were also reported by dang et al 2009 in which dramatic change in the microbial communities was observed under diel temperature oscillations 11 16 c and 16 5 21 0 c in stream microcosms however different from the anammox bacteria the diel temperature fluctuations 30 20 c and 33 17 c had a marginal impact on the community structures of activated sludge zhang et al 2018b overall the results of the present study indicate that the anammox bacteria were more heavily affected by the dtvs whereas denitrifying betaproteobacterium i e denitratisoma was found to be well adapted to dtvs in accordance with the traditional niche based theory pholchan et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 there is a strong relationship between taxon traits and environments community dynamics of anammox consortia are closely linked to nitrogen removal and numerous populations are synchronized with different dtv stresses suggesting niche specialization in the current study succession from a planctomycetes phylum and genus to a proteobacteria phylum and genus dominated communities during dtv treatments from δ4 to δ16 c suggesting that diel temperature changes created specific niches for the anammox consortia this microbial community alternation in turn led to the formation of an unstable anammox bioreactor system consistent with this finding it has previously been observed that temperature strongly influenced the composition of anammox niches oshiki et al 2011 persson et al 2014 therefore in the further practical applications providing the stability of anammox ecological niches is important for the operation of anammox based wastewater treatment plants 3 5 susceptibility of functional bacteria to dtvs functional bacterial groups such as the anammox nob aob and denitrifiers guilds were dominated by known genera including ca jettenia unidentified nitrospiraceae nitrosomonas and denitratisoma respectively see fig 5 in addition to ca jettenia ca kuenenia ca brocadia and ca anammoximicrobium were also detected at the genus level fig 5 note that the abundance of ca jettenia was decreased under strong water temperature fluctuations i e from 50 90 4 21 at δ0 c to 17 83 7 22 at δ16 c correspondingly the poor reactor performance at δ14 and δ16 c might be attributed to the fact that the dominant anammox bacteria are less adept at utilizing the substrates at the temperature fluctuations according to lin et al 2018 ca jettenia showed strong changes in the proteome at low temperatures 15 c relative to ca kuenenia and ca brocadia demonstrating that ca jettenia is more sensitive to unsuitable temperatures in this study the relative abundance of ca kuenenia slightly increased at δ14 c 0 09 0 02 and δ16 c 0 12 0 03 compared to that at δ4 c 0 04 0 01 in contrast the relative abundance of ca brocadia increased with increasing water temperature fluctuations from 0 15 0 02 at δ0 c to 0 28 0 05 at δ16 c suggesting that the anammox bacteria adapted well to strong temperature perturbations gonzalez martinez et al 2016 reported that ca brocadia was dominant genera at high temperatures 35 c while ca anammoxoglobus was the predominant genus at low temperatures 15 c ca brocadia is commonly found in wastewater treatment systems castro barros et al 2017 suggesting this genus offers broad ecophysiology competitiveness and capacities for adaptation wu et al 2016b a previous study has reported that decreasing temperature led to production of toxic nitrogen compounds and or reactive oxygen species in the anammox consortia lin et al 2018 thus we conjecture that the decreased abundance of dominant anammox bacteria at strong water temperature fluctuations is indicative of not only a shift away of anammox activity but also the production of toxic compounds overall these findings support the hypothesis that these anammox genera show differing levels of resilience to diel temperature stresses this has numerous implications for the operation of anammox reactors in practical applications in addition the partial resilience of anammox genera e g ca jettenia in our study after long term exposure to each dtv suggests that long term acclimatization can improve the adaptability of anammox bacteria to temperature shocks or even to low temperatures dosta et al 2008 hendrickx et al 2012 hu et al 2013 the dominant nob shared by the samples belonged to unidentified nitrospiraceae with a higher proportion in δ14 c 1 59 0 24 and δ16 c 1 06 0 22 than in δ0 c 0 19 0 04 nitrosomonas was the only aob genus detected in the present study with an increase in abundance from 0 08 to 2 86 with increasing water temperature fluctuations furthermore the most dominant denitrifying bacteria observed belonged to the denitratisoma genus 3 29 20 23 importantly the relative abundance of denitratisoma increased under strong temperature fluctuations e g δ10 δ14 and δ16 c which was accompanied by decreasing nitrate concentrations in reactor effluent indicating their tolerance to diel temperature fluctuations and the potential enhancement of denitrification fernandes et al 2018 demonstrated that denitratisoma adapts well to a wide range of temperature variations 25 35 c this finding could explain the lower stoichiometric coefficient for δno3 δnh4 consumption observed under diel temperature variations than under constant temperatures therefore in practical operations it is essential to avoid denitrification during the anammox process as denitrifying bacteria can compete with anammox bacteria for nitrite tang et al 2010 pathak et al 2007 also reported that anammox bacteria are less competitive than denitrifying bacteria overall exposure to dtvs resulted in a decreasing abundance of anammox and an increasing abundance of aob nob and denitirfication bacteria ultimately altering nitrogen removal pathways in the anammox reactors 3 6 implications of this work anammox bacteria play an important role in the nitrogen cycles of natural environments and in nitrogen removal in engineered systems temperature as an important parameter directly influences the reaction rate and kinetics of anammox processes and determines community dynamics and metabolic pathways however previous studies have mainly focused on the roles of constant temperature or seasonally varied temperature in anammox performance and yet the roles of naturally occurring diel temperature variations i e dtvs in anammox performance have not been given sufficient attention thus in this study the influence of dtvs on biological processes and microbial communities was explored our findings demonstrate that low magnitude water temperature fluctuations δ8 c had marginal effects on the removal of nitrogen species whereas strong water temperature fluctuations i e δ14 and δ16 c decreased nitrogen removal efficiency indicating the inadequate nitrogen removal capabilities of anammox communities for the treatment of fluctuating temperature modes of inland regions with strong diel temperature variations interestingly nitrifiers i e unidentified nitrospiraceae and nitrosomonas and denitrifiers i e denitratisoma were able to adapt to high temperature perturbations after long periods of operation this phenomenon can most likely be attributed to their low susceptibility to temperature perturbations and or to their intrinsic adaptation strategies li et al 2018 in comparison the dominant anammox bacteria i e ca jettenia were significantly influenced by high dtvs leading to poor nitrogen removal performance these results imply that dtvs should have fewer impacts on nitrogen removal in conventionally activated sludge processes than in anammox processes on the other hand it is quite necessary to maintain relatively stable temperatures during the operation of anammox processes this is also central to the role of temperature variation modes e g seasonal temperature variations and dtvs in anammox processes in addition future studies must explore responses of bacteria activity to temperature variations based on transcriptomics and metabolomics overall our results can not only further our knowledge of the influence of diel temperature variations on anammox systems but they are also expected to serve as useful information for optimizing the operation of other wastewater treatment systems nonetheless the actual ecosystems are highly dynamic likely due to the complexity and instability of the environments the experimental design is too idealistic to the water temperature variations in the present study as such use of actual temperature variations for further experiment is suggested in order to obtain more practical results 4 conclusion in this study the effects of water temperature fluctuations occurring during the day night on anammox reactor performance and population succession were investigated the following conclusions are drawn 1 weak water temperature fluctuations i e δ0 δ2 δ4 and δ6 c had marginal effects on nitrogen removal performance whereas strong water temperature fluctuations i e δ14 and δ16 c significantly diminished reactor performance 2 higher levels of bacterial diversity alpha diversity and decreased levels of community abundance were observed in initial patterns of dtv stresses but these values recovered at the end of each dtv phase 3 functional bacteria for nitrogen removal responded differently to water temperature fluctuations ca jettenia levels decreased under strong water temperature fluctuations δ10 c whereas ca brocadia ca kuenenia and ca anammoximicrobium adapted well to strong temperature perturbations in addition the nitrifiers i e unidentified nitrospiraceae and nitrosomonas and denitrifiers i e denitratisoma tolerated dtv perturbations relatively well supplementary materials

18719,the influence of diel temperature variations dtvs on nitrogen removal and bacterial communities was investigated in two parallel anammox reactors i e control and dtv reactors the control reactor was operated at a constant temperature of 30 c whereas the dtv reactor was operated in a temperature fluctuation mode with a cycle of 12 12 h of high low temperatures nine water temperature variations for the day night periods were set from 30 30 c i e δ0 c to 38 22 c i e δ16 c an increase in dtvs from δ8 c 34 26 c to δ16 c 38 22 c caused a significant decline in reactor performance and a shift in bacterial diversity compared to the control reactor for instance nitrogen removal efficiency decreased p 0 05 when temperature fluctuations exceeded δ8 c in the dtv reactor with a decreasing δno3 δnh4 ratio from 0 21 0 15 to 0 16 0 04 the results of 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that the initial disturbance of temperature variations led to increased levels of bacterial diversity i e alpha diversity and decreased community levels of anammox consortia whereas they slightly recovered at the end of each dtv phase notably candidatus jettenia was more sensitive to strong water temperature fluctuations with the lower relative abundance at δ14 c 17 11 5 01 and δ16 c 17 83 7 22 than at δ4 c 39 82 0 01 in contrast ca brocadia and ca kuenenia had higher relative abundance at δ14 c i e 0 24 0 07 and 0 09 0 02 respectively and δ16 c i e 0 28 0 05 and 0 12 0 03 respectively compared to that at δ4 c i e 0 15 0 04 and 0 04 0 01 respectively nitrifiers i e unidentified nitrospiraceae and nitrosomonas and denitrifiers i e denitratisoma were also capable of tolerating high temperature perturbations overall this study furthers our knowledge of responses of the microbial ecology of anammox bacteria to dtvs in anammox processes which could aid us in optimizing anammox related wastewater treatment systems and in understanding the nitrogen cycles of natural ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox nitrogen removal community composition bacterial diversity diel temperature perturbation 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is known as an important process contributing nitrogen cycling in natural environments hsu et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 and nitrogen removal in engineered systems joss et al 2009 van der star et al 2007 recently anammox based processes have been applied for mainstream wastewater treatment ma et al 2016 because of their potential contributions to achieving energy neutral or positive sewage treatment however anammox bacteria are sensitive to ambient conditions such as ph dissolved oxygen do salinity and temperature levels jin et al 2012 thus resulting in operating problems although anammox bacteria have been found at extreme temperatures as high as 60 80 c e g hot springs and as low as 5 4 c byrne et al 2009 jaeschke et al 2009 li et al 2010 associated activity and community structures are largely impacted by temperature isanta et al 2015 lotti et al 2015 additionally seasonal temperature variations have been found to substantially impact bacterial communities in anammox reactors agrawal et al 2017 fernandes et al 2018 for instance agrawal et al 2017 found the shift from the summer season 20 c to the winter season 10 c led to the enrichment of a cold tolerant anammox species i e ca kuenenia furthermore fernandes et al 2018 found that a decrease in temperature from 35 c to 20 c changed microbial community structures and diversity levels in an anammox reactor a recent study focusing on sewage sludge reported on the dominance of ca brocadia in the spring roughly 20 c and 23 c and summer roughly 28 c and 31 c and the dominance of ca jettenia in the autumn roughly 15 c and 16 c xu et al 2017 ca brocadia dominance was also found in the summer in both the eutrophic dianchi lake and mesotrophic erhai lake yang et al 2017 although these previousstudies cannot be used to reach an agreement on the linkages between the anammox genus and ambient temperatures likely due to differing experimental systems involved they clearly imply the significance of temperature in determining both the activity and genus or species of anammox bacteria in fact as part of a half closed engineered system anammox reactors are normally subjected to more intense levels of temperature variability e g diel temperature variations or dtvs than seasonal temperature variations in some inland areas such as the city of hohhot china teheran iran and khartum sudan diel temperature variations can reach up to 25 30 c in the summer season furthermore human activities can lead to a high level of temporal and spatial thermal variability e g industrial heat emissions and the change of climate suggest that many regions may experience more variable temperatures in the future coulter et al 2015 easterling et al 2000 milly et al 2002 schar et al 2004 for all averaging periods and seasons the water temperature and surface air temperature correlations are generally high indicating the high level of thermal communication at the interface erickson and stefan 2000 jaswal et al 2012 wang et al 2011 which inevitably results in dtvs in the water of engineered systems and natural ecosystems recently it has been documented that diel fluctuations of water temperatures can cause sex reversal in fathead minnows by affecting the expression of thermoresponsive genes coulter et al 2015 thus considering the temperature dependence of the abundance and activity of anammox species we hypothesized that diel temperature shifts could potentially impact the anammox process including nitrogen removal processes and bacterial community structures it can be expected that species specific responses to temperature would finally regulate the community structures of anammox consortia in this study therefore two parallel anammox reactors i e control and dtv reactors with the same seeding sludge were operated for a long period around 466 d to explore the consequences of press dtvs in the context of ecosystem functioning and microbial diversity nitrogen removal was fully investigated in different periods with increasing dtvs i e δ0 δ2 δ4 δ6 δ8 δ10 δ12 δ14 and δ16 c microbiota compositions were monitored over time to correlate their dynamics with reactor performance overall our results can further our knowledge of the roles of dtvs in anammox systems thus aiding in optimizing the operation of anammox based wastewater treatment plants 2 methods and materials 2 1 reactor set up and operation two parallel anammox biofilm reactors with a working volume of 1 l were set up and continuously operated for 466 d fig s1 equiponderous non woven fabrics 1 1 cm were used as carriers 27 g for each reactor to help anammox bacteria grow the two reactors were fully shaded with a light proof black cloth to prevent algae growth van hulle et al 2010 the inoculum in each reactor 25 v v was obtained from a lab scale up flow column anammox reactor operated at 37 c meng et al 2014 initial biomass concentrations in the reactors were measured at 1 4 g volatile suspended solids vss per liter based on a 1 l reactor volume the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactors was set to roughly 10 h no additional sludge was discharged from the reactor except for the sampling that is the reactor was operated at a prolonged solid retention time srt the nutrient medium consisted of nh4 2so4 112 mg n l nano2 120 mg n l nahco3 420 mg l kh2po4 44 mg l and 2 ml l of trace element solution van de graaf aa et al 1996 the ph was maintained at 7 5 0 3 the control reactor was operated at a constant temperature of 30 c in a water bath the dtv reactor was operated in a temperature fluctuation mode with a cycle of 12 h of high temperatures and 12 h of low temperatures using circulating water jackets huber german nine water temperature variations for the day night periods were set from 30 30 c i e δ0 c to 38 22 c i e δ16 c so that 30 c of the mean diel temperature was designed to be the same as the control increasing or decreasing temperatures in the dtv reactor were facilitated gently for roughly 2 h to eliminate the effects of sudden temperature shocks on reactor performance and bacterial activity 2 2 sample collection each dtv phase was operated for approximately 50 d in total 45 anammox sludge samples were collected from five phases i e δ0 δ4 δ10 δ14 and δ16 c triplicate samples of the control reactor were collected in each phase in addition triplicate samples of the dtv reactor were obtained in the initial and the terminal period of each dtv table s1 to maintain the homogeneity of biofilm samples the biomass was washed from non woven fabrics of the reactors these samples were mixed and then washed with pre chilled phosphate buffered saline buffer pbs buffer 10 mm ph 7 5 three times all the samples were subsequently frozen under sub zero temperatures 80 c for microbial community analysis 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing samples for dna extraction were employed using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentration and quality of the dna extraction were determined with a micro spectrophotometric technique using a nanodrop

agilent bioanalyzer 2100 system the library was sequenced on an illumina hiseq2500 platform and 250 bp paired end reads were produced 2 4 community structure and biodiversity analysis the raw data were processed to remove low quality bases phred quality scores of less than 20 with trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 then sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with usearch software version 8 0 http drive5 com uparse using the usparse algorithm edgar 2013 with a 0 03 dissimilarity cutoff after singletons were removed the otu representative sequences were classified against the silva database pruesse et al 2007 otus classified as unknown chloroplast mitochondria and eukaryota were removed prior to subsequent analysis to accurately compare the 45 samples at the same sequencing depth 46402 sequences were normalized from each sample for subsequent bioinformatics analyses to accurately compare bacterial diversities responding differently to the dtv treatments we calculated chao1 ace shannon simpson and coverage values to reflect the diversity and richness of the metacommunities of the different samples kemp and aller 2004 to compute alpha diversity values the pairwise community similarity of the weighted unifrac wu lozupone and knight 2005 and morisita horn mh indices were computed in qiime using the alpha diversity py script to ascertain temporal and spatial dynamics of bacterial community composition for the same dtv phase and between dtvs a principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the bray curtis distance metric was employed at the otu level an analysis of similarity anosim and permutational multivariate analysis of variance adonis was performed based on bray curtis dissimilarity distance matrices of the otu level the pcoa was carried out using r package vegan oksanen et al 2010 and was plotted using the ggplot2 package wickham 2010 within the r environment for statistical computing http www r project org 2 5 chemical analyses the water quality of influents and effluents of the anammox biofilm reactors was monitored periodically ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n and total nitrogen tn concentrations were determined according to standard methods apha 1995 ph and do values were monitored using a ph meter inolab 7310 wtw germany and do meter cellox 3310i wtw germany respectively 2 6 sequence accession number sequence reads were deposited in the sequence read archive sra under accession number sub4153415 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of dtvs on reactor performance fig 1 illustrates that a satisfactory level of nitrogen removal efficiency e g 88 68 2 68 97 25 3 44 and 83 49 4 27 for nh4 n no2 n and tn respectively was achieved in the dtv reactor with limited water temperature fluctuations i e δ0 δ6 c which was approximately similar to that at the control reactor p 0 05 however the nitrogen removal efficiency decreased when water temperature fluctuations exceeded δ8 c fig 1d e g the nitrogen removal rate nrr declined by 10 30 13 65 p 0 05 in the dtv reactor exposed to high water temperature fluctuations i e δ10 δ16 c numerous studies have documented that temperature declines i e from 29 to 12 5 c laureni et al 2015 and seasonal variations i e from 20 c in the summer to 10 c in the winter agrawal et al 2017 led to decreased nitrogen removal rates of anammox processes unlike what was found in these previous studies anammox bacteria in the dtv reactor were subject to diel temperature shifts with an average temperature of 30 c therefore the present study and previous findings imply that the temperature shock occurring at seasonal or diel levels can lead to diminished or poor nitrogen removal performance furthermore ratios of δno2 δnh4 and δno3 δnh4 are often used as operation indicators for anammox reactors zhu et al 2018 in the present study δno2 δnh4 and δno3 δnh4 ratios at low temperature fluctuations were measured at 1 23 0 08 and 0 23 0 03 fig 1c respectively which are both lower than the stoichiometric ratios 1 32 and 0 26 determined by strous et al 1998 but higher than those 1 15 and 0 16 given by lotti et al 2014 the stoichiometric ratio often deviates from the theoretical value under conditions of environmental stress in contrast to those at the low temperature fluctuations observed the mean stoichiometric coefficients of δno2 δnh4 and δno3 δnh4 consumption at δ8 δ16 c were lower i e 1 12 0 16 and 0 21 0 15 for δ8 c and 1 13 0 18 and 0 16 0 04 for δ16 c respectively the decreased δno2 δnh4 ratio observed is attributable to the susceptibility of anammox bacteria or to the adaptability of aob bacteria to temperature shocks congruent with chamchoi and nitisoravut 2007 the decreased δno3 δnh4 ratio observed occurred due to the superior adaptability of denitrifying bacteria to temperature shocks relative to other bacteria see fig 4 in section 3 4 the decreased nitrate concentrations from 21 32 3 68 mg l 1 at δ10 c to 11 56 3 47 mg l 1 at δ16 c in the effluent of the dtv reactor with increasing temperature fluctuations further corroborate our speculation of the satisfactory activity of denitrifying bacteria fig 1c the above phenomena can be further confirmed from the 16s rrna sequencing results of our study section 3 5 3 2 effects of dtvs on bacterial diversity a total of 3 826 836 high quality amplicon reads were obtained at an average read depth of 83 021 sequences sample with sequence statistics of 48 635 95 334 81 000 10 220 min max median s d respectively and a total of 5729 operational taxonomic units otus 97 sequence similarity according to the average neighbor method in fig 2 the increase in dtvs from δ0 c to δ16 c led to significant fluctuations in taxonomic diversity as revealed by richness estimators ace and chao1 and diversity indices shannon and simpson fig 2 table s2 we found that ace and chao1 did not show significant differences at a constant temperature between the control and dtv reactors at high temperature fluctuations in the present study both ace and chao1 indices were higher in the initial periods of δ10 c p 0 05 δ14 c p 0 01 and δ16 c p 0 05 relative to the control reactor in contrast the two indices recovered to similar levels as the control at the end of each dtv phase after roughly 20 d normally bacterial biofilms or aggregates respond to environmental stresses via biodiversity effects parijs and steenackers 2018 i e the more complex the environments the higher species diversity palmer et al 2002 in addition the environment shock can inevitably lead to the death of some bacteria the lysis products from these dead cells can serve as nutrients for other bacteria thus leading to a high diversity of species isanta et al 2015 therefore the environment shock induced by the initial dtv shifts resulted in increased biodiversity in our current study however the bacteria community would gradually adapt to the imposed stress during the long term exposure as exemplified by the partial recovery of the abundance of anammox bacteria see fig 5 in section 3 5 it led to a decreased or recovered biodiversity in our study on the other hand the shannon index of the dtv reactor which can denote the richness of a bacterial community underwent changes similar to those of the ace and chao1 estimators throughout the operation however the simpson index as an indicator of to the evenness of a community did not show significant responses to the sudden onset of dtv stresses the richness and evenness of bacterial species shaped by disturbances should be a cumulative result of the different responses of various species to perturbation some species that can tolerate such disturbance can survive whereas others may disappear sagar et al 2003 griffiths et al 2000 have also shown that microbial functions are initially depressed by stress and recover over time and that such resilience is negatively affected when biodiversity declines according to the insurance hypothesis yachi and loreau 1999 species richness can positively impact ecosystem productivity through a buffering effect against disturbances and thus a performance enhancing effect these results suggest that alpha diversity is a very sensitive indicator of disturbance and especially in regions where external factors such as seasonal droughts or temperature cycles fluctuate significantly lynch et al 2004 moreover a higher level of microbial diversity in a system can create more resistance to persistent stress than lower levels of microbial diversity griffiths et al 2000 overall the data of these indices suggest that shifts in dtvs resulted in decreased levels of diversity and richness in anammox consortia both of which partially recovered during long term exposure to dtvs the dtv induced decline of bacterial diversity and richness created instability in anammox reactors 3 3 effects of dtvs on dynamic changes in bacterial communities to better evaluate the dynamics of community composition a pcoa plot based on bray curtis distance using log transformed counts was created fig 3 note that the samples of constant temperature including samples from the control reactor at 30 c and from the dtv reactor at δ0 c clustered very closely indicating that a stable community established in the dtv reactor before temperature fluctuation treatments however significant changes in the dtv samples as a function of increasing temperature fluctuations i e δ4 δ10 δ14 and δ16 c p 0 001 took place along principal coordinate 1 pc1 37 1 of the total variability and were clearly separate from the constant temperature samples this indicates the importance of dtvs to dynamics of the microbial community structures of anammox reactors previously temperature variations at the seasonal scale were also documented to be one of the main factors leading to microbial dynamics of suspended and biofilm communities in drinking water microbiomes ling et al 2016 pinto et al 2014 global anosim results further presented strong and significant variations in metacommunities across all dtv operating phases r 0 78 p 0 001 table s3 in particular there were different communities between low i e δ0 and δ4 c and high i e δ10 δ14 and δ16 c dtvs pairwise ecological dissimilarities of composition and relatedness can indicate changes in microbial community composition across all samples vuono et al 2015 additionally significant time decay values were obtained from the dtv system at δ14 and δ16 c fig s2a indicating that the community suffered dynamic succession with the addition and replacement of new community members phylogenetic relatedness results wu fig s2b also reveal similar patterns to those of the mh index between dtvs suggesting that phylogenetically related organisms can reestablish either regrowth e g dormant or recolonization immigration from a source community by organisms at the end of each dtv phase vuono et al 2015 overall these results denote the vulnerability of some organisms with dtvs and the adaptability of some organisms after long term exposure to dtvs 3 4 effects of dtvs on community composition fig 4a presents averaged abundances of the major phyla top 10 in control and of the dtv reactor planctomycetes were the most abundant phylum accounted for 50 44 64 91 under low dtvs by contrast a remarkable decrease in planctomycetes averaged at 29 89 was observed when the dtv reactor was exposed to strong water temperature fluctuations e g δ10 δ14 and δ16 c suggesting the vulnerability of planctomycetes to high dtvs note that the abundance of the phylum planctomycetes slightly increased after long term exposure to dtvs relative to that of the initial period this phenomenon mainly occurred because relative to other genera the dominant genus ca jettenia of planctomycetes adapted to the dtvs more readily after long term exposure to dtvs see fig 5 of section 3 5 other subdominant phyla including proteobacteria chloroflexi ignavibacteriae and chlorobi accounted for 4 57 46 19 of all bacterial sequences which have also been frequently found in full and lab scale anammox reactors gonzalez martinez et al 2015 pereira et al 2014 a recent study suggest that in addition to planctomycetes chloroflexi was also susceptive to temperatures in a partial nitrification anammox system wu et al 2016a the phylum chloroflexi in anammox consortia can take up the cell material of decaying anammox bacteria kindaichi et al 2012 thus decreasing levels of planctomycetes were accompanied by increasing levels of chloroflexi from 6 10 1 95 at δ0 c to 19 99 8 91 at δ16 c interestingly the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased considerably from 20 06 to 34 91 with increasing dtvs e g from δ10 to δ16 c implying the better adaptability of this phylum to high dtvs relative to other phyla wu et al 2017 also reported an increasing abundance of proteobacteria from 22 9 to 29 3 when the temperature of a partial nitrification anammox reactor decreased from 35 c to 21 c at the genus level more than 664 bacterial taxa were detected among them a total of 516 genera were commonly shared by the two reactors fig s3 accounting for 82 16 99 21 in otus moreover 86 and 228 genera were identified as maximum unique otus in the control and dtv reactors respectively these results further verify the richness of bacterial taxa in samples collected from dtv reactors the ten most abundant genera in the 45 samples were analyzed a total of 27 genera fig 4b among which eight genera were the most abundant in the shared samples including ca jettenia sm1a02 denitratisoma unidentified sja 28 ignavibacterium unidentified anaerolineaceae unidentified fimbriimonadales and pseudomonas all of these were found to be abundant genera in anammox ecosystems allegue et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2018a additionally it is interesting to find that nine genera were exclusively abundant in the control and or dtv reactor i e unidentified opb56 lanchnospiraceae nk4a136 group staphylococcus bacteroides and enterococcus were abundant in the control reactor and lactobacillus paludibaculum alistipes and unidentified nitrospiraceae were abundant in the dtv reactor indicating their susceptibility or tolerance to dtv perturbations according to ma et al 2013 temperature variations trigger strong changes in bacterial compositions i e the dominant genus at high temperature was zoogloea whereas actinobacteria haliscomenobacter and thiothrix were dominant genera at low temperature moreover the relative abundance of sm1a02 i e from 6 68 0 78 at δ0 c to 1 37 0 53 at δ16 c decreased with increasing dtvs whereas strong temperature fluctuations could stimulate the relative abundance of denitratisoma i e from 5 06 0 57 at δ0 c to 15 76 2 95 at δ16 c increase or decrease in temperatures displayed a great influence on the microorganisms leading to a distinct microbial community fernandes et al 2018 isanta et al 2015 wu et al 2017 for instance similar dynamic patterns of microbial communities were also reported by dang et al 2009 in which dramatic change in the microbial communities was observed under diel temperature oscillations 11 16 c and 16 5 21 0 c in stream microcosms however different from the anammox bacteria the diel temperature fluctuations 30 20 c and 33 17 c had a marginal impact on the community structures of activated sludge zhang et al 2018b overall the results of the present study indicate that the anammox bacteria were more heavily affected by the dtvs whereas denitrifying betaproteobacterium i e denitratisoma was found to be well adapted to dtvs in accordance with the traditional niche based theory pholchan et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 there is a strong relationship between taxon traits and environments community dynamics of anammox consortia are closely linked to nitrogen removal and numerous populations are synchronized with different dtv stresses suggesting niche specialization in the current study succession from a planctomycetes phylum and genus to a proteobacteria phylum and genus dominated communities during dtv treatments from δ4 to δ16 c suggesting that diel temperature changes created specific niches for the anammox consortia this microbial community alternation in turn led to the formation of an unstable anammox bioreactor system consistent with this finding it has previously been observed that temperature strongly influenced the composition of anammox niches oshiki et al 2011 persson et al 2014 therefore in the further practical applications providing the stability of anammox ecological niches is important for the operation of anammox based wastewater treatment plants 3 5 susceptibility of functional bacteria to dtvs functional bacterial groups such as the anammox nob aob and denitrifiers guilds were dominated by known genera including ca jettenia unidentified nitrospiraceae nitrosomonas and denitratisoma respectively see fig 5 in addition to ca jettenia ca kuenenia ca brocadia and ca anammoximicrobium were also detected at the genus level fig 5 note that the abundance of ca jettenia was decreased under strong water temperature fluctuations i e from 50 90 4 21 at δ0 c to 17 83 7 22 at δ16 c correspondingly the poor reactor performance at δ14 and δ16 c might be attributed to the fact that the dominant anammox bacteria are less adept at utilizing the substrates at the temperature fluctuations according to lin et al 2018 ca jettenia showed strong changes in the proteome at low temperatures 15 c relative to ca kuenenia and ca brocadia demonstrating that ca jettenia is more sensitive to unsuitable temperatures in this study the relative abundance of ca kuenenia slightly increased at δ14 c 0 09 0 02 and δ16 c 0 12 0 03 compared to that at δ4 c 0 04 0 01 in contrast the relative abundance of ca brocadia increased with increasing water temperature fluctuations from 0 15 0 02 at δ0 c to 0 28 0 05 at δ16 c suggesting that the anammox bacteria adapted well to strong temperature perturbations gonzalez martinez et al 2016 reported that ca brocadia was dominant genera at high temperatures 35 c while ca anammoxoglobus was the predominant genus at low temperatures 15 c ca brocadia is commonly found in wastewater treatment systems castro barros et al 2017 suggesting this genus offers broad ecophysiology competitiveness and capacities for adaptation wu et al 2016b a previous study has reported that decreasing temperature led to production of toxic nitrogen compounds and or reactive oxygen species in the anammox consortia lin et al 2018 thus we conjecture that the decreased abundance of dominant anammox bacteria at strong water temperature fluctuations is indicative of not only a shift away of anammox activity but also the production of toxic compounds overall these findings support the hypothesis that these anammox genera show differing levels of resilience to diel temperature stresses this has numerous implications for the operation of anammox reactors in practical applications in addition the partial resilience of anammox genera e g ca jettenia in our study after long term exposure to each dtv suggests that long term acclimatization can improve the adaptability of anammox bacteria to temperature shocks or even to low temperatures dosta et al 2008 hendrickx et al 2012 hu et al 2013 the dominant nob shared by the samples belonged to unidentified nitrospiraceae with a higher proportion in δ14 c 1 59 0 24 and δ16 c 1 06 0 22 than in δ0 c 0 19 0 04 nitrosomonas was the only aob genus detected in the present study with an increase in abundance from 0 08 to 2 86 with increasing water temperature fluctuations furthermore the most dominant denitrifying bacteria observed belonged to the denitratisoma genus 3 29 20 23 importantly the relative abundance of denitratisoma increased under strong temperature fluctuations e g δ10 δ14 and δ16 c which was accompanied by decreasing nitrate concentrations in reactor effluent indicating their tolerance to diel temperature fluctuations and the potential enhancement of denitrification fernandes et al 2018 demonstrated that denitratisoma adapts well to a wide range of temperature variations 25 35 c this finding could explain the lower stoichiometric coefficient for δno3 δnh4 consumption observed under diel temperature variations than under constant temperatures therefore in practical operations it is essential to avoid denitrification during the anammox process as denitrifying bacteria can compete with anammox bacteria for nitrite tang et al 2010 pathak et al 2007 also reported that anammox bacteria are less competitive than denitrifying bacteria overall exposure to dtvs resulted in a decreasing abundance of anammox and an increasing abundance of aob nob and denitirfication bacteria ultimately altering nitrogen removal pathways in the anammox reactors 3 6 implications of this work anammox bacteria play an important role in the nitrogen cycles of natural environments and in nitrogen removal in engineered systems temperature as an important parameter directly influences the reaction rate and kinetics of anammox processes and determines community dynamics and metabolic pathways however previous studies have mainly focused on the roles of constant temperature or seasonally varied temperature in anammox performance and yet the roles of naturally occurring diel temperature variations i e dtvs in anammox performance have not been given sufficient attention thus in this study the influence of dtvs on biological processes and microbial communities was explored our findings demonstrate that low magnitude water temperature fluctuations δ8 c had marginal effects on the removal of nitrogen species whereas strong water temperature fluctuations i e δ14 and δ16 c decreased nitrogen removal efficiency indicating the inadequate nitrogen removal capabilities of anammox communities for the treatment of fluctuating temperature modes of inland regions with strong diel temperature variations interestingly nitrifiers i e unidentified nitrospiraceae and nitrosomonas and denitrifiers i e denitratisoma were able to adapt to high temperature perturbations after long periods of operation this phenomenon can most likely be attributed to their low susceptibility to temperature perturbations and or to their intrinsic adaptation strategies li et al 2018 in comparison the dominant anammox bacteria i e ca jettenia were significantly influenced by high dtvs leading to poor nitrogen removal performance these results imply that dtvs should have fewer impacts on nitrogen removal in conventionally activated sludge processes than in anammox processes on the other hand it is quite necessary to maintain relatively stable temperatures during the operation of anammox processes this is also central to the role of temperature variation modes e g seasonal temperature variations and dtvs in anammox processes in addition future studies must explore responses of bacteria activity to temperature variations based on transcriptomics and metabolomics overall our results can not only further our knowledge of the influence of diel temperature variations on anammox systems but they are also expected to serve as useful information for optimizing the operation of other wastewater treatment systems nonetheless the actual ecosystems are highly dynamic likely due to the complexity and instability of the environments the experimental design is too idealistic to the water temperature variations in the present study as such use of actual temperature variations for further experiment is suggested in order to obtain more practical results 4 conclusion in this study the effects of water temperature fluctuations occurring during the day night on anammox reactor performance and population succession were investigated the following conclusions are drawn 1 weak water temperature fluctuations i e δ0 δ2 δ4 and δ6 c had marginal effects on nitrogen removal performance whereas strong water temperature fluctuations i e δ14 and δ16 c significantly diminished reactor performance 2 higher levels of bacterial diversity alpha diversity and decreased levels of community abundance were observed in initial patterns of dtv stresses but these values recovered at the end of each dtv phase 3 functional bacteria for nitrogen removal responded differently to water temperature fluctuations ca jettenia levels decreased under strong water temperature fluctuations δ10 c whereas ca brocadia ca kuenenia and ca anammoximicrobium adapted well to strong temperature perturbations in addition the nitrifiers i e unidentified nitrospiraceae and nitrosomonas and denitrifiers i e denitratisoma tolerated dtv perturbations relatively well supplementary materials
