19190,the searches for suitable substrates with high capacity for phosphorus p removal and promoting denitrification for enhancing nitrogen n removal have been a key work in constructed wetlands cws research in the past several decades but few substrates enhancing simultaneous long term n and p removal in cws have been found before in this study two subsurface flow pilot scale wetlands using natural pyrite and limestone as substrates were constructed after 3 year of operation we found that pyrite had no negative effects on growth of reeds removals of chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n but enhanced long term total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp removals in constructed wetland in the three years the average tp and tn removals of pyrite constructed wetland pcw were 87 7 14 2 with 0 25 0 20 mg l of average effluent tp and 69 4 21 4 with 4 0 3 2 mg l of average effluent tn respectively the main p form in the pcw was fe al bound p the mechanisms of the pcw with enhanced simultaneous long term n and p removals were anaerobic and aerobic oxidations of pyrite the main bacteria were anaeromyxobacter 4 9 ramlibacter 4 8 defluviicoccus 4 2 azoarcus 3 7 geobacter 3 4 and they were highly related to anaerobic and aerobic oxidation of pyrite in the pcw graphical abstract image 1 keywords long term nutrients removal phosphorus forms in constructed wetland pilot study pyrite subsurface flow constructed wetland 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws can remove many kinds of pollutants from wastewater through natural processes involving in substrates macrophytes and microorganisms and the substrates play a critical role fountoulakis et al 2009 vymazal 2007 cws often exhibit poor nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal rates brix et al 2001 ju et al 2014 tanner et al 2002 for lack of organic carbon saeed and sun 2012 and p binding capacity arias et al 2001 in order to enhance n and p removals of cws most researches paid attentions to the substrates johansson 2006 vohla et al 2011 for they are the most amenable to control drizo et al 1999 the search for suitable substrates with high capacity for p removal has been a key work in cws research in the past several decades the substrates studied for p removal included natural minerals such as limestone debusk et al 2004 apatite bellier et al 2006 shale forbes et al 2005 etc industrial byproducts such as steel slag drizo et al 2006 fly ash sheng bing et al 2007 etc and man made products such as alunite ozacar 2006 lightweight vohla et al 2005 etc as using them in cws the p removal efficiencies are often high initially and then significantly decrease after a 3 5 years period application for saturation of p removal capacity arias et al 2001 substrates such as heated opoka brogowski and renman 2004 and blast furnace slag mann and bavor 1993 which can release ions to form insoluble p precipitates often have higher p retention capacity and long term p removal therefore in order to sustain a long term p removal in cws substrates promoting precipitation reactions of insoluble p precipitates should be selected del et al 2003 comparing with so many substrates studied for enhancing p removal in cws only a few substrates have been studied for enhancing n removal by promoting denitrification most researchers used solid organic materials such wood mulch saeed and sun 2011 and rice husk tee et al 2012 as substrates in cws to enhance heterotrophic denitrification however using solid organic materials as substrate of cws has the risk of potential chemical oxygen demand cod secondary pollution wu et al 2014 whereas very few studies have investigated elemental sulfur bezbaruah and zhang 2003 park et al 2015 as substrate in cws to enhance autotrophic denitrification in which autotrophic denitrifiers use inorganic carbon compounds as carbon sources and use elemental sulfur as the electron donor to reduce nitrate no3 to nitrogen gas n2 with low cost and without residual organic problems zhang and lampe 2015 therefore sulfur is a promising substrate in cws for enhancing n removal from wastewater without enough biodegradable organic matter bezbaruah and zhang 2003 however among all substrates studied for enhancing p removal or n removal in cws none has the performance of simultaneously enhancing both n and p removal pyrite fes2 iron disulfide is the most abundant and widespread mineral of the earth s sulfide minerals chandra and gerson 2010 and widely applied for wastewater treatment yang et al 2017a 2017b autotrophic denitrifiers also can use pyrite as the electron donor to reduce no3 to n2 pauwels et al 2010 schwientek et al 2008 torrentó et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 and metabolites are ferrous ion fe2 ferric ion fe3 and ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 which are widely used to remove phosphate po4 3 from wastewater parsons and smith 2008 ruihua et al 2011 wei et al 2008 therefore it was assumed that as pyrite was used as the substrate in cws the cws would simultaneously enhance simultaneous no3 and po4 3 removal from wastewater in the absence of easily biodegradable organic matter through pyrite driven autotrophic denitrification pdad to date few cws with pyrite as the substrate have been reported pilot cws were constructed with the natural pyrite and limestone as the substrates in the present study the objectives of this study are to present long term data obtained from experiments with the innovative pyrite cw and to evaluate the feasibility and performance of using natural pyrite as substrate in the cw for wastewater treatment with particular emphasis on long term simultaneous n and p removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates pyrite and limestone were obtained from yunfu guandong province and zhenjiang jiangsu province china respectively pyrite and limestone were analyzed with x ray diffraction and x ray fluorescence spectrometer arl 9800xp switzerland the fes2 and caco3 accounted for 89 2 and 98 7 in the pyrite and limestone respectively table s1 xrd spectra show that they are pyrite and limestone mineral phases figs s1 and s2 the particle size of all substrates was between 5 and 20 mm 2 2 subsurface flow constructed wetlands two horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands limestone constructed wetland lcw and pyrite constructed wetland pcw located by the local stream 32 07 56 n 118 56 56 e were constructed with brick and cement with the same configuration 5640 mm 1480 mm 1200 mm l w h fig 1 the cws were mainly made up of influent area substrate area and effluent area in the influent area two limestone zones were set up for removing suspended solids from the influent in the substrate area the substrate layer of 3000 mm 1000 mm 700 mm l w h was covered with a soil layer of 3000 mm 1000 mm 200 mm for plant growth the substrates in the lcw and pcw were limestone 5 20 mm mixture of pyrite 5 20 mm and limestone 5 20 mm 1 1 of volume ratio respectively the lcw was used as the control of pcw in order to investigate variations of water quality inner substrate layer of the two cws 18 perforated pvc pipes 1340 mm long and 20 mm diameter were horizontally and parallel laid in the substrate layer and water samples were able to be collected from the 18 pipes on a side wall the pipes were labeled as pxy with x 1 2 6 for horizontal distance of 0 600 1200 1800 2400 and 3000 mm and y 1 2 3 for 50 300 and 600 mm high respectively fig 1 2 3 operation sampling and analysis common reeds p australis were planted in the two cws with 8 individual plants per square meter in august of the pre operation year 2012 from then on wastewater which was prepared with the river water and kno3 1 0 mg l no3 n needs 7 2 mg l kno3 and kh2po4 1 0 mg l po4 3 p needs 4 4 mg l kh2po4 for suitable influent no3 n and phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p concentrations was pumped into the two cws with peristaltic pump continuously between august and december of the pre operation year they were operated for reed growth and optimal hydraulic retention time hrt the hrt reported here is the contact time porosity substrate volume flow rate of the wastewater finally the optimal hrt was 72 h and during the following operation of cws the hrt was always kept at 72 h by the end of each year reeds in the two cws were harvested after the pre operation year the two cws were formally operated for 3 years in the 1st year height and density of reeds in 1 m2 in the middle of the two cws were measured monthly to investigate the effects of pyrite on reed growth influent and effluent were collected 1 or 2 times a week water samples were collected from the 18 pipes as needed water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters and stored at 4 c until analysis cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp were analyzed using spectrophotometric measurement an uv vis spectrophotometer a6 pgeneral beijing and sulfate so4 2 was analyzed using ion chromatograph ics 1000 ion chromatography system dionex america the ph was measured with portable acidity meter phb 4 leici shanghai dissolved oxygen do was measured with portable dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa the residual heavy metal ion concentrations were determined with icp optima 5300dv perkinelmer usa in summer of the 3rd year substrate samples around p12 p22 p32 p42 p52 p62 were obtained with a sampling scoop for analyses of tp in the substrate followed literature forbes et al 2004 and two substrate samples between p32 and p42 of lcw and pcw were collected for microbial community analyses 2 4 microbial community analysis substrate samples for microbial community analysis were fixed with 100 ethanol immediately at a ratio of 1 1 v v and stored at 20 c before dna extraction total genomic dna were extracted using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s following the manufacturer s instructions to determine the final dna concentration and purification nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa was used and dna quality was checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis then pcr was conducted and high throughput sequencing was finished on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa the detailed steps are described in si 3 results 3 1 performances of cod and nh4 n removal for the two cws both cod and nh4 n removals in spring and winter were lower than those in summer and autumn in each year of operation fig 2 which was due to lower microbial activity at lower temperature during the 1st 2nd and 3rd year the average influent cod were 36 9 9 3 55 9 12 5 and 11 3 3 1 mg l mean s d respectively and accordingly cod removals were 53 3 8 9 56 2 6 4 53 1 11 4 for lcw and 51 8 9 2 53 2 5 8 49 7 8 9 for pcw respectively fig 2a a worldwide survey puigagut et al 2007 demonstrated that cod removals of subsurface flow cws for municipal sewage treatment varied from 64 to 82 which was higher than these cod removals of our cws during the 1st 2nd and 3rd year the average influent nh4 n were 4 7 2 3 7 4 4 4 0 3 0 2 mg l respectively and nh4 n removals were 85 8 17 4 68 7 6 4 30 0 15 5 for lcw and 83 0 19 7 67 2 8 5 38 4 14 8 for pcw respectively fig 2b the nh4 n removals of our cws were in the range of the nh4 n removal of typical subsurface flow cws ranging from 17 to 86 as municipal wastewater or secondary wastewater were treated zhang et al 2014 the differences of cod and nh4 n removal between lcw and pcw were not significant p 0 05 it indicated that pyrite had no negative effects on both cod and nh4 n removal in cws 3 2 performances of tn and tp removal fig 3 a shows that tn removals were relatively higher in summer and autumn and lower in spring and winter for the two cws which were similar to those variations of cod and nh4 n removals with season shown in fig 2 however tp removal fig 3b was basically stable and not subject to change of season during 1st 2nd and 3rd year the average influent tn were 10 0 4 9 19 6 5 1 8 9 1 4 mg l respectively and tn removals were 75 2 30 8 48 3 15 2 56 5 18 7 for lcw and 78 9 25 1 59 7 14 5 69 7 20 4 for pcw respectively fig 3a in the 1st year the difference of tn removal between lcw and pcw was not significant p 0 05 but in 2nd and 3rd years average tn removal of pcw was much higher than that of lcw the tn removal of conventional cws was 41 68 zhao et al 2010 contrastively in the whole operation of three years the average tn removal of pcw was 69 4 21 4 with 4 0 3 2 mg l of average effluent tn during 1st 2nd and 3rd year the average influent tp were 1 74 0 86 4 58 0 62 1 51 0 84 mg l respectively tp removals were 61 5 27 8 3 9 6 4 7 9 52 1 for lcw and 97 4 2 1 89 3 2 8 75 1 19 7 for pcw respectively with effluent tp of 0 62 0 57 4 41 0 68 1 08 0 64 mg l for lcw and 0 04 0 02 0 48 0 06 0 23 0 10 mg l for pcw respectively fig 3b in the 1st year the difference of tp removal between lcw and pcw was just significant p 0 05 but in 2nd and 3rd year their differences were highly significant p 0 001 tp removals of pcw were much more than those of lcw tp removal decreased abruptly in lcw after the 1st year but very slowly in pcw the tp removal of conventional cws was 35 71 zhao et al 2010 on the contrast the average tp removal of pcw in the whole operation of three years was 87 7 14 2 with 0 25 0 20 mg l of average effluent tp 3 3 changes of water quality in the substrate layer in summer of the 1st year water samples were collected from the 18 pipes and analyzed for cod nh4 n tn tp to investigate their changes in the substrate layer which were shown in fig s4 along the horizontal direction of both lcw and pcw cod nh4 n tn and tp decreased and the reductions of them were bigger in the upper substrate layer h600 than those in the median and lower substrate layer h300 and h50 respectively in the lcw tn and tp were gradually removed along the horizontal direction in the whole substrate layer but in the pcw they were basically completely removed in the front substrate layer 0 1200 mm it shows that nutrients removal rates were higher in the pcw than those in the lcw in summer of the 2nd year water samples were collected from p12 p22 p32 p42 p52 p62 and analyzed for tp nh4 n no3 n and do fig 4 fig 4 shows that in lcw tp increased a little in the substrate layer of 0 1800 mm and then kept stable basically in the following substrate layer which was quite different from those in the 1st year fig s4g but tp in pcw decreased quickly in the substrate layer of 0 1200 mm and slowly in the following substrate layer and was below 0 5 mg l in the effluent which were similar to those in the 1st year fig s4h it shows that p removal in lcw reached saturation in the 2nd year so tp removals of lcw were only 3 9 6 4 and 7 9 52 1 in the 2nd and 3rd year respectively fig 4b shows that no3 n in the lcw and pcw increased a little in the substrate layer of 0 600 mm which was related to nitrification and then decreased in the substrate layer of 600 3000 mm because of denitrification but no3 n removed in the pcw was more than that in the lcw changes of nh4 n fig 4c and do fig 4d were very similar in the lcw and pcw both nh4 n and do decreased quickly in the substrate later of 0 600 mm and then decreased slowly in the following substrate layer but fig 4d shows that do in lcw were higher than those in pcw p 0 01 and nh4 n in lcw were lower than those in pcw in the same position of substrate layer p 0 05 3 4 phosphorus contents and forms in the substrates fig 5 shows that in the substrate of lcw tp contents were very stably around 5 mg g in the whole substrate layer but in the substrate of pcw tp contents decreased quickly from 8 5 mg g to 1 mg g with horizontal distance increasing from 0 to 1800 mm and decreased slowly to 0 5 mg g in the following substrate layer in the lcw the ca mg bound p and fe al bound p were very stable and around 70 and 12 respectively in the whole substrate layer but in the pcw the fe al bound p and ca mg bound p in the substrate layer of 0 1200 mm were about 40 and 20 respectively and then decreased to about 20 and below 5 respectively in the substrate layer of 1200 3000 mm though in pcw the volume of pyrite and limestone was the same p retained still was mainly in form of fe al bound p 3 5 microbial communities fig s5 shows bacterial communities on phylum level in the lcw and pcw proteobacteria acidobacteria and bacteroidetes were the largest three which account for 66 8 7 8 7 6 and 73 3 7 6 4 9 in the lcw and pcw respectively it indicated that the microbial community structures of lcw and pcw are basically similar on phylum level fig 6 shows the relative abundances of bacterial community on genus level in the lcw and pcw thirty six genera whose reads were more than 5 of total reads are shown five largest genera in lcw were pseudomonas 3 6 defluviicoccus 3 4 propionivibrio 3 2 sphingomonas 2 4 ramlibacter 2 1 and those in pcw were anaeromyxobacter 4 9 ramlibacter 4 8 defluviicoccus 4 2 azoarcus 3 7 geobacter 3 4 it indicated that pyrite changed the microbial community structure of cw on genus level anaeromyxobacter he and sanford 2003 and geobacter leang et al 2003 are iron reducing bacteria with organic matter as electron donor whose proportion in pcw 4 9 and 3 4 respectively were both much more than those in lcw 0 8 and 1 0 respectively it indicated that much more reactions about iron oxidation and reduction occurred in the pcw than in the lcw and they have contributions to cod removal abundances of pseudomonas and azoarcus were 3 6 and 0 9 in lcw and 1 1 and 3 7 in pcw respectively pseudomonas ji et al 2014 and azoarcus morgansagastume et al 2008 played important roles in heterotrophic denitrification and contributed to both cod and tn removal besides heterotrophic denitrification autotrophic denitrification also existed in the pcw and the lcw main autotrophic denitrification bacteria in the two cws was thiobacillus claus and kutzner 1985 the abundances of thiobacillus not shown in fig 6 were small in both the pcw and lcw 1 2 and 0 4 respectively but the difference between the pcw and lcw was big thiobacillus played an important role in pyrite driven autotrophic denitrification equation 5 in the discussion therefore more autotrophic denitrification happened in pcw than in lcw other main chemoheterotrophic bacteria more than 1 in lcw were defluviicoccus 3 4 wong and liu 2007 propionivibrio 3 2 brune et al 2002 sphingomonas 2 4 white et al 1996 bradyrhizobium 1 5 berkum 1987 rubrivivax 1 2 chv et al 2006 dechloromonas 1 1 chakraborty and coates 2005 besides pseudomonas 3 6 and those in pcw were defluviicoccus 4 2 propionivibrio 2 8 massilia 2 4 wang et al 2016 bradyrhizobium 1 9 rubrivivax 1 8 sphingomonas 1 7 clostridium sensu stricto 1 1 4 li et al 2017 besides pseudomonas and azoarcus all of them contributed to cod removal in the pcw and lcw it is notable that clostridium sensu stricto 1 whose abundance 1 4 in pcw was much more than that 0 1 in lcw is a kind of strict anaerobic bacillus it implied that there was better anaerobic condition in pcw than in lcw 4 discussion as the most abundant and widespread iron sulfide in the earth pyrite oxidation by aerobic bacteria singer and stumm 1970 has deeply been studied and considered as the main cause of acid mine drainage amd which could be used to remove p in the wastewater ruihua et al 2011 pyrite aerobic oxidation paeo can be expressed as follows 1 2 f e s 2 2 h 2 o 7 o 2 4 s o 4 2 2 f e 2 4 h 2 4 f e 2 2 h 2 o o 2 4 f e 3 4 o h 3 f e 3 3 h 2 o f e o h 3 3 h the general equation akcil and koldas 2006 4 4 f e s 2 14 h 2 o 15 o 2 8 s o 4 2 4 f e o h 3 16 h a lot of field studies demonstrated the occurrence of pyrite driven autotrophic denitrification pdad and it was the dominant pathway of nitrate removal from ground water pauwels et al 2010 schwientek et al 2008 torrentó et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 pdad can be expressed as follows jørgensen et al 2009 5 6 n o 3 2 f e s 2 4 h 2 o 3 n 2 4 s o 4 2 2 f e o h 3 2 h in the three year s operation of pcw the heavy metal ion concentrations in effluent were not exceeding the standard and the so4 2 in the influent and effluent were below 100 mg l and between 600 and 800 mg l respectively but tn in the influent was no more than 20 mg l fig 3 thus so4 2 arising from equation 5 could not be more than 100 mg l therefore it was deduced that most of so4 2 produced in pcw resulted from equation 4 and accordingly there were many h produced limestone in the pcw neutralized the produced h and kept ph of wastewater closed to 7 therefore pyrite used as substrate in the pcw had no negative effects on the reed growth fig s3 in cws cod can be removed aerobically and anaerobically and the major mechanism of tn removal is microbial denitrification after transformation of ammonification and nitrification fleming singer and horne 2002 and the principal mechanisms of p removal are adsorption and precipitation of substrates hu and shan 2009 in the pcw equations 4 and 5 consumed do and no3 respectively and both of them produced fe oh 3 or intermediates fe2 and fe3 therefore equations 4 and 5 played very important role in cod removal ammonification nitrification and denitrification and adsorption and precipitation of p in the pcw because of equation 4 do in the substrate layer of the pcw was lower than that of the lcw fig 4d which was supported by much more strict anaerobic clostridium sensu stricto 1 in the pcw than in the lcw lower do was not beneficial to nitrification so nh4 n in the middle substrate layer of the pcw was higher than that of the lcw fig 4c however in the pcw and lcw most of nh4 n was removed in the upper and the front substrate layer figs s4 c and d where enough do was supplied from air influent and plan root and nitrification difference arising from equation 4 did not show significant effects on the whole nh4 n removal in the pcw and lcw thus in the three year s operation nh4 n removal did not show significant difference between the pcw and lcw usually most organics in domestic wastewater are labile and easily biodegradable vymazal 2009 but river water mainly contains recalcitrant organic matter the lower cod removal of the pcw and lcw could be attributed to the lower biodegradability of river water higher do was beneficial to aerobic cod removal but not beneficial to anaerobic cod removal arising from heterotrophic denitrification or iron reduction therefore cod removal between the pcw and lcw did not show significant difference in the three year s operation as some unconventional mineral substrates such as shale coal slag zeolite etc were used in cws the removals of cod and nh4 n varied from 23 to 84 and from 26 to 100 respectively saeed and sun 2012 those cws using unconventional mineral substrates had not special performance of both cod and nh4 n removal too tn can be removed by heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification and the former is faster than the latter in this study the average cod tn ratios of influent were 3 7 2 8 and 1 2 in 1st 2nd and 3rd year respectively as the cod tn ratio was higher tn was mainly removed by heterotrophic denitrification thus the difference of tn removal between pcw and lcw was not significant such as tn removal of the 1st year fig 3a as the cod tn ratio was lower tn removed by heterotrophic denitrification became small and the autotrophic denitrification arising from equation 5 became significant then the difference of tn removal between pcw and lcw was highly significant such as tn removals of the 2nd and 3rd year fig 3a in the substrate layer of 0 1200 mm of pcw do was basically used up gradually fig 4d therefore fe2 fe3 fe oh 3 were mainly produced in that area which were described in equations 1 4 po4 3 removed by fe2 fe3 fe oh 3 through precipitation or adsorption deposited in the substrate layer of 0 1800 mm figs 4a and s4h thus tp contents of substrate sample decreased quickly from 8 5 mg g to 1 mg g with horizontal distance increasing from 0 to 1800 mm fig 5a and the fe al bound p was the main p form around 40 in the substrate layer of 0 1200 mm and 20 in the following substrate layer fig 5b in the substrate sample limestone neutralized the produced h and many ca2 produced which also contributed to p removal therefore ca mg bound p in the substrate sample of pcw could not be ignored around 20 in the substrate layer of 0 1200 mm and below 5 in the following substrate layer in the pcw equations 4 and 5 produced fe2 fe3 fe oh 3 continuously therefore p removal was kept very high 87 in the three year s operation fig 3b and will lasted till pyrite was depleted however in the lcw p was removed mainly through adsorption on the limestone and ca mg bound p was the dominant fig 5b because of p adsorption saturation after the 1st year tp in the whole substrate layer did not have any removal and even there was tp released in the substrate layer of 0 1800 mm fig 4a that tp contents in the whole substrate layer were stable fig 5a also shows the p adsorption saturation of limestone therefore tp removal was very small and even there was tp released from the lcw fig 3b in the 2nd and 3rd years in the 2nd and 3rd years the small amount of tp removed in lcw should be attributed to plant uptake of p limestone as substrate in cws was considered as a promising solution in developing a cost effective environmental friendly and sustainable technology for phosphorus removal because the average tp removal of 61 7 was achieved during trial period of 20 months in study of dina et al mateus et al 2012 which was consistent with the average removal of lcw in the 1st year but in the 2nd and 3rd year the average tp removal of lcw decreased abruptly to below 10 the same conditions happened to the cws filled with ca mg and fe rich sand vohla et al 2007 in which the tp removal was about 71 in the first 4 months of operation but subsequently decreased to 10 20 therefore the use of limestone as substrate in cw could not achieve long term and higher tp removal because of saturation of p adsorption in the pcw pyrite enhanced n and p removal through anaerobic and aerobic oxidations of pyrite and theoretically those performances would last till pyrite was depleted so natural pyrite made the pcw possess enhanced long term n and p removal there were no heavy metal ions released in the effluent the so4 2 was too high in the effluent of pcw for too much aerobic oxidation of pyrite therefore pyrite should be put in the bottom and rear of substrate layer where the do would be low and aerobic oxidation of pyrite can be reduced pyrite is ubiquitous in most mines of metal sulfur and coal and usually abandoned as tailings or gangue as oxidation of pyrite is the cause of acid mine drainage pyrite is usually considered as bad mineral to water environment however in this research the pcw had no negative effects on growth of the reeds and removals of cod and nh4 n in the whole operation of three years the average tn and tp removal of the pcw were 69 4 21 4 with 4 0 3 2 mg l of average effluent tn and 87 7 14 2 with 0 25 0 20 mg l of average effluent tp respectively the pcw had higher and more lasting tn and tp removal than the lcw the pyrite became good mineral to water environment as it was used as substrate in cws 5 conclusion pcw was constructed with the natural pyrite and limestone 1 1 of volume ratio as the substrates and operated for 3 years which proved that pyrite had no negative effects on growth of reeds removals of cod and nh4 n but enhanced long term tn and tp removal in constructed wetland conversely lcw can not achieve long term and higher tp removal the average cod nh4 n tp and tn removal of pcw over three years were 51 6 7 8 63 7 23 2 87 7 14 2 and 69 4 21 4 respectively the main mechanisms responsible for enhanced simultaneous long term nitrogen and phosphorus removal was anaerobic and aerobic oxidations of pyrite and p retained in the pcw was mainly in form of fe al bound p the main bacteria in pcw were anaeromyxobacter 4 9 ramlibacter 4 8 defluviicoccus 4 2 azoarcus 3 7 geobacter 3 4 and the microbial communities were highly related to anaerobic and aerobic oxidation of pyrite in terms of application pyrite is suggested putting in the bottom and rear of cws thus the aerobic oxidation of pyrite can be reduced and so4 2 in the effluent will not be so much declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by the major science and technology program for water pollution control and treatment

2014 tanner et al 2002 for lack of organic carbon saeed and sun 2012 and p binding capacity arias et al 2001 in order to enhance n and p removals of cws most researches paid attentions to the substrates johansson 2006 vohla et al 2011 for they are the most amenable to control drizo et al 1999 the search for suitable substrates with high capacity for p removal has been a key work in cws research in the past several decades the substrates studied for p removal included natural minerals such as limestone debusk et al 2004 apatite bellier et al 2006 shale forbes et al 2005 etc industrial byproducts such as steel slag drizo et al 2006 fly ash sheng bing et al 2007 etc and man made products such as alunite ozacar 2006 lightweight vohla et al 2005 etc as using them in cws the p removal efficiencies are often high initially and then significantly decrease after a 3 5 years period application for saturation of p removal capacity arias et al 2001 substrates such as heated opoka brogowski and renman 2004 and blast furnace slag mann and bavor 1993 which can release ions to form insoluble p precipitates often have higher p retention capacity and long term p removal therefore in order to sustain a long term p removal in cws substrates promoting precipitation reactions of insoluble p precipitates should be selected del et al 2003 comparing with so many substrates studied for enhancing p removal in cws only a few substrates have been studied for enhancing n removal by promoting denitrification most researchers used solid organic materials such wood mulch saeed and sun 2011 and rice husk tee et al 2012 as substrates in cws to enhance heterotrophic denitrification however using solid organic materials as substrate of cws has the risk of potential chemical oxygen demand cod secondary pollution wu et al 2014 whereas very few studies have investigated elemental sulfur bezbaruah and zhang 2003 park et al 2015 as substrate in cws to enhance autotrophic denitrification in which autotrophic denitrifiers use inorganic carbon compounds as carbon sources and use elemental sulfur as the electron donor to reduce nitrate no3 to nitrogen gas n2 with low cost and without residual organic problems zhang and lampe 2015 therefore sulfur is a promising substrate in cws for enhancing n removal from wastewater without enough biodegradable organic matter bezbaruah and zhang 2003 however among all substrates studied for enhancing p removal or n removal in cws none has the performance of simultaneously enhancing both n and p removal pyrite fes2 iron disulfide is the most abundant and widespread mineral of the earth s sulfide minerals chandra and gerson 2010 and widely applied for wastewater treatment yang et al 2017a 2017b autotrophic denitrifiers also can use pyrite as the electron donor to reduce no3 to n2 pauwels et al 2010 schwientek et al 2008 torrentó et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 and metabolites are ferrous ion fe2 ferric ion fe3 and ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 which are widely used to remove phosphate po4 3 from wastewater parsons and smith 2008 ruihua et al 2011 wei et al 2008 therefore it was assumed that as pyrite was used as the substrate in cws the cws would simultaneously enhance simultaneous no3 and po4 3 removal from wastewater in the absence of easily biodegradable organic matter through pyrite driven autotrophic denitrification pdad to date few cws with pyrite as the substrate have been reported pilot cws were constructed with the natural pyrite and limestone as the substrates in the present study the objectives of this study are to present long term data obtained from experiments with the innovative pyrite cw and to evaluate the feasibility and performance of using natural pyrite as substrate in the cw for wastewater treatment with particular emphasis on long term simultaneous n and p removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates pyrite and limestone were obtained from yunfu guandong province and zhenjiang jiangsu province china respectively pyrite and limestone were analyzed with x ray diffraction and x ray fluorescence spectrometer arl 9800xp switzerland the fes2 and caco3 accounted for 89 2 and 98 7 in the pyrite and limestone respectively table s1 xrd spectra show that they are pyrite and limestone mineral phases figs s1 and s2 the particle size of all substrates was between 5 and 20 mm 2 2 subsurface flow constructed wetlands two horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands limestone constructed wetland lcw and pyrite constructed wetland pcw located by the local stream 32 07 56 n 118 56 56 e were constructed with brick and cement with the same configuration 5640 mm 1480 mm 1200 mm l w h fig 1 the cws were mainly made up of influent area substrate area and effluent area in the influent area two limestone zones were set up for removing suspended solids from the influent in the substrate area the substrate layer of 3000 mm 1000 mm 700 mm l w h was covered with a soil layer of 3000 mm 1000 mm 200 mm for plant growth the substrates in the lcw and pcw were limestone 5 20 mm mixture of pyrite 5 20 mm and limestone 5 20 mm 1 1 of volume ratio respectively the lcw was used as the control of pcw in order to investigate variations of water quality inner substrate layer of the two cws 18 perforated pvc pipes 1340 mm long and 20 mm diameter were horizontally and parallel laid in the substrate layer and water samples were able to be collected from the 18 pipes on a side wall the pipes were labeled as pxy with x 1 2 6 for horizontal distance of 0 600 1200 1800 2400 and 3000 mm and y 1 2 3 for 50 300 and 600 mm high respectively fig 1 2 3 operation sampling and analysis common reeds p australis were planted in the two cws with 8 individual plants per square meter in august of the pre operation year 2012 from then on wastewater which was prepared with the river water and kno3 1 0 mg l no3 n needs 7 2 mg l kno3 and kh2po4 1 0 mg l po4 3 p needs 4 4 mg l kh2po4 for suitable influent no3 n and phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p concentrations was pumped into the two cws with peristaltic pump continuously between august and december of the pre operation year they were operated for reed growth and optimal hydraulic retention time hrt the hrt reported here is the contact time porosity substrate volume flow rate of the wastewater finally the optimal hrt was 72 h and during the following operation of cws the hrt was always kept at 72 h by the end of each year reeds in the two cws were harvested after the pre operation year the two cws were formally operated for 3 years in the 1st year height and density of reeds in 1 m2 in the middle of the two cws were measured monthly to investigate the effects of pyrite on reed growth influent and effluent were collected 1 or 2 times a week water samples were collected from the 18 pipes as needed water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters and stored at 4 c until analysis cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp were analyzed using spectrophotometric measurement an uv vis spectrophotometer a6 pgeneral beijing and sulfate so4 2 was analyzed using ion chromatograph ics 1000 ion chromatography system dionex america the ph was measured with portable acidity meter phb 4 leici shanghai dissolved oxygen do was measured with portable dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa the residual heavy metal ion concentrations were determined with icp optima 5300dv perkinelmer usa in summer of the 3rd year substrate samples around p12 p22 p32 p42 p52 p62 were obtained with a sampling scoop for analyses of tp in the substrate followed literature forbes et al 2004 and two substrate samples between p32 and p42 of lcw and pcw were collected for microbial community analyses 2 4 microbial community analysis substrate samples for microbial community analysis were fixed with 100 ethanol immediately at a ratio of 1 1 v v and stored at 20 c before dna extraction total genomic dna were extracted using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s following the manufacturer s instructions to determine the final dna concentration and purification nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa was used and dna quality was checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis then pcr was conducted and high throughput sequencing was finished on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa the detailed steps are described in si 3 results 3 1 performances of cod and nh4 n removal for the two cws both cod and nh4 n removals in spring and winter were lower than those in summer and autumn in each year of operation fig 2 which was due to lower microbial activity at lower temperature during the 1st 2nd and 3rd year the average influent cod were 36 9 9 3 55 9 12 5 and 11 3 3 1 mg l mean s d respectively and accordingly cod removals were 53 3 8 9 56 2 6 4 53 1 11 4 for lcw and 51 8 9 2 53 2 5 8 49 7 8 9 for pcw respectively fig 2a a worldwide survey puigagut et al 2007 demonstrated that cod removals of subsurface flow cws for municipal sewage treatment varied from 64 to 82 which was higher than these cod removals of our cws during the 1st 2nd and 3rd year the average influent nh4 n were 4 7 2 3 7 4 4 4 0 3 0 2 mg l respectively and nh4 n removals were 85 8 17 4 68 7 6 4 30 0 15 5 for lcw and 83 0 19 7 67 2 8 5 38 4 14 8 for pcw respectively fig 2b the nh4 n removals of our cws were in the range of the nh4 n removal of typical subsurface flow cws ranging from 17 to 86 as municipal wastewater or secondary wastewater were treated zhang et al 2014 the differences of cod and nh4 n removal between lcw and pcw were not significant p 0 05 it indicated that pyrite had no negative effects on both cod and nh4 n removal in cws 3 2 performances of tn and tp removal fig 3 a shows that tn removals were relatively higher in summer and autumn and lower in spring and winter for the two cws which were similar to those variations of cod and nh4 n removals with season shown in fig 2 however tp removal fig 3b was basically stable and not subject to change of season during 1st 2nd and 3rd year the average influent tn were 10 0 4 9 19 6 5 1 8 9 1 4 mg l respectively and tn removals were 75 2 30 8 48 3 15 2 56 5 18 7 for lcw and 78 9 25 1 59 7 14 5 69 7 20 4 for pcw respectively fig 3a in the 1st year the difference of tn removal between lcw and pcw was not significant p 0 05 but in 2nd and 3rd years average tn removal of pcw was much higher than that of lcw the tn removal of conventional cws was 41 68 zhao et al 2010 contrastively in the whole operation of three years the average tn removal of pcw was 69 4 21 4 with 4 0 3 2 mg l of average effluent tn during 1st 2nd and 3rd year the average influent tp were 1 74 0 86 4 58 0 62 1 51 0 84 mg l respectively tp removals were 61 5 27 8 3 9 6 4 7 9 52 1 for lcw and 97 4 2 1 89 3 2 8 75 1 19 7 for pcw respectively with effluent tp of 0 62 0 57 4 41 0 68 1 08 0 64 mg l for lcw and 0 04 0 02 0 48 0 06 0 23 0 10 mg l for pcw respectively fig 3b in the 1st year the difference of tp removal between lcw and pcw was just significant p 0 05 but in 2nd and 3rd year their differences were highly significant p 0 001 tp removals of pcw were much more than those of lcw tp removal decreased abruptly in lcw after the 1st year but very slowly in pcw the tp removal of conventional cws was 35 71 zhao et al 2010 on the contrast the average tp removal of pcw in the whole operation of three years was 87 7 14 2 with 0 25 0 20 mg l of average effluent tp 3 3 changes of water quality in the substrate layer in summer of the 1st year water samples were collected from the 18 pipes and analyzed for cod nh4 n tn tp to investigate their changes in the substrate layer which were shown in fig s4 along the horizontal direction of both lcw and pcw cod nh4 n tn and tp decreased and the reductions of them were bigger in the upper substrate layer h600 than those in the median and lower substrate layer h300 and h50 respectively in the lcw tn and tp were gradually removed along the horizontal direction in the whole substrate layer but in the pcw they were basically completely removed in the front substrate layer 0 1200 mm it shows that nutrients removal rates were higher in the pcw than those in the lcw in summer of the 2nd year water samples were collected from p12 p22 p32 p42 p52 p62 and analyzed for tp nh4 n no3 n and do fig 4 fig 4 shows that in lcw tp increased a little in the substrate layer of 0 1800 mm and then kept stable basically in the following substrate layer which was quite different from those in the 1st year fig s4g but tp in pcw decreased quickly in the substrate layer of 0 1200 mm and slowly in the following substrate layer and was below 0 5 mg l in the effluent which were similar to those in the 1st year fig s4h it shows that p removal in lcw reached saturation in the 2nd year so tp removals of lcw were only 3 9 6 4 and 7 9 52 1 in the 2nd and 3rd year respectively fig 4b shows that no3 n in the lcw and pcw increased a little in the substrate layer of 0 600 mm which was related to nitrification and then decreased in the substrate layer of 600 3000 mm because of denitrification but no3 n removed in the pcw was more than that in the lcw changes of nh4 n fig 4c and do fig 4d were very similar in the lcw and pcw both nh4 n and do decreased quickly in the substrate later of 0 600 mm and then decreased slowly in the following substrate layer but fig 4d shows that do in lcw were higher than those in pcw p 0 01 and nh4 n in lcw were lower than those in pcw in the same position of substrate layer p 0 05 3 4 phosphorus contents and forms in the substrates fig 5 shows that in the substrate of lcw tp contents were very stably around 5 mg g in the whole substrate layer but in the substrate of pcw tp contents decreased quickly from 8 5 mg g to 1 mg g with horizontal distance increasing from 0 to 1800 mm and decreased slowly to 0 5 mg g in the following substrate layer in the lcw the ca mg bound p and fe al bound p were very stable and around 70 and 12 respectively in the whole substrate layer but in the pcw the fe al bound p and ca mg bound p in the substrate layer of 0 1200 mm were about 40 and 20 respectively and then decreased to about 20 and below 5 respectively in the substrate layer of 1200 3000 mm though in pcw the volume of pyrite and limestone was the same p retained still was mainly in form of fe al bound p 3 5 microbial communities fig s5 shows bacterial communities on phylum level in the lcw and pcw proteobacteria acidobacteria and bacteroidetes were the largest three which account for 66 8 7 8 7 6 and 73 3 7 6 4 9 in the lcw and pcw respectively it indicated that the microbial community structures of lcw and pcw are basically similar on phylum level fig 6 shows the relative abundances of bacterial community on genus level in the lcw and pcw thirty six genera whose reads were more than 5 of total reads are shown five largest genera in lcw were pseudomonas 3 6 defluviicoccus 3 4 propionivibrio 3 2 sphingomonas 2 4 ramlibacter 2 1 and those in pcw were anaeromyxobacter 4 9 ramlibacter 4 8 defluviicoccus 4 2 azoarcus 3 7 geobacter 3 4 it indicated that pyrite changed the microbial community structure of cw on genus level anaeromyxobacter he and sanford 2003 and geobacter leang et al 2003 are iron reducing bacteria with organic matter as electron donor whose proportion in pcw 4 9 and 3 4 respectively were both much more than those in lcw 0 8 and 1 0 respectively it indicated that much more reactions about iron oxidation and reduction occurred in the pcw than in the lcw and they have contributions to cod removal abundances of pseudomonas and azoarcus were 3 6 and 0 9 in lcw and 1 1 and 3 7 in pcw respectively pseudomonas ji et al 2014 and azoarcus morgansagastume et al 2008 played important roles in heterotrophic denitrification and contributed to both cod and tn removal besides heterotrophic denitrification autotrophic denitrification also existed in the pcw and the lcw main autotrophic denitrification bacteria in the two cws was thiobacillus claus and kutzner 1985 the abundances of thiobacillus not shown in fig 6 were small in both the pcw and lcw 1 2 and 0 4 respectively but the difference between the pcw and lcw was big thiobacillus played an important role in pyrite driven autotrophic denitrification equation 5 in the discussion therefore more autotrophic denitrification happened in pcw than in lcw other main chemoheterotrophic bacteria more than 1 in lcw were defluviicoccus 3 4 wong and liu 2007 propionivibrio 3 2 brune et al 2002 sphingomonas 2 4 white et al 1996 bradyrhizobium 1 5 berkum 1987 rubrivivax 1 2 chv et al 2006 dechloromonas 1 1 chakraborty and coates 2005 besides pseudomonas 3 6 and those in pcw were defluviicoccus 4 2 propionivibrio 2 8 massilia 2 4 wang et al 2016 bradyrhizobium 1 9 rubrivivax 1 8 sphingomonas 1 7 clostridium sensu stricto 1 1 4 li et al 2017 besides pseudomonas and azoarcus all of them contributed to cod removal in the pcw and lcw it is notable that clostridium sensu stricto 1 whose abundance 1 4 in pcw was much more than that 0 1 in lcw is a kind of strict anaerobic bacillus it implied that there was better anaerobic condition in pcw than in lcw 4 discussion as the most abundant and widespread iron sulfide in the earth pyrite oxidation by aerobic bacteria singer and stumm 1970 has deeply been studied and considered as the main cause of acid mine drainage amd which could be used to remove p in the wastewater ruihua et al 2011 pyrite aerobic oxidation paeo can be expressed as follows 1 2 f e s 2 2 h 2 o

field studies demonstrated the occurrence of pyrite driven autotrophic denitrification pdad and it was the dominant pathway of nitrate removal from ground water pauwels et al 2010 schwientek et al 2008 torrentó et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 pdad can be expressed as follows jørgensen et al 2009 5 6 n o 3 2 f e s 2 4 h 2 o 3 n 2 4 s o 4 2 2 f e o h 3 2 h in the three year s operation of pcw the heavy metal ion concentrations in effluent were not exceeding the standard and the so4 2 in the influent and effluent were below 100 mg l and between 600 and 800 mg l respectively but tn in the influent was no more than 20 mg l fig 3 thus so4 2 arising from equation 5 could not be more than 100 mg l therefore it was deduced that most of so4 2 produced in pcw resulted from equation 4 and accordingly there were many h produced limestone in the pcw neutralized the produced h and kept ph of wastewater closed to 7 therefore pyrite used as substrate in the pcw had no negative effects on the reed growth fig s3 in cws cod can be removed aerobically and anaerobically and the major mechanism of tn removal is microbial denitrification after transformation of ammonification and nitrification fleming singer and horne 2002 and the principal mechanisms of p removal are adsorption and precipitation of substrates hu and shan 2009 in the pcw equations 4 and 5 consumed do and no3 respectively and both of them produced fe oh 3 or intermediates fe2 and fe3 therefore equations 4 and 5 played very important role in cod removal ammonification nitrification and denitrification and adsorption and precipitation of p in the pcw because of equation 4 do in the substrate layer of the pcw was lower than that of the lcw fig 4d which was supported by much more strict anaerobic clostridium sensu stricto 1 in the pcw than in the lcw lower do was not beneficial to nitrification so nh4 n in the middle substrate layer of the pcw was higher than that of the lcw fig 4c however in the pcw and lcw most of nh4 n was removed in the upper and the front substrate layer figs s4 c and d where enough do was supplied from air influent and plan root and nitrification difference arising from equation 4 did not show significant effects on the whole nh4 n removal in the pcw and lcw thus in the three year s operation nh4 n removal did not show significant difference between the pcw and lcw usually most organics in domestic wastewater are labile and easily biodegradable vymazal 2009 but river water mainly contains recalcitrant organic matter the lower cod removal of the pcw and lcw could be attributed to the lower biodegradability of river water higher do was beneficial to aerobic cod removal but not beneficial to anaerobic cod removal arising from heterotrophic denitrification or iron reduction therefore cod removal between the pcw and lcw did not show significant difference in the three year s operation as some unconventional mineral substrates such as shale coal slag zeolite etc were used in cws the removals of cod and nh4 n varied from 23 to 84 and from 26 to 100 respectively saeed and sun 2012 those cws using unconventional mineral substrates had not special performance of both cod and nh4 n removal too tn can be removed by heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification and the former is faster than the latter in this study the average cod tn ratios of influent were 3 7 2 8 and 1 2 in 1st 2nd and 3rd year respectively as the cod tn ratio was higher tn was mainly removed by heterotrophic denitrification thus the difference of tn removal between pcw and lcw was not significant such as tn removal of the 1st year fig 3a as the cod tn ratio was lower tn removed by heterotrophic denitrification became small and the autotrophic denitrification arising from equation 5 became significant then the difference of tn removal between pcw and lcw was highly significant such as tn removals of the 2nd and 3rd year fig 3a in the substrate layer of 0 1200 mm of pcw do was basically used up gradually fig 4d therefore fe2 fe3 fe oh 3 were mainly produced in that area which were described in equations 1 4 po4 3 removed by fe2 fe3 fe oh 3 through precipitation or adsorption deposited in the substrate layer of 0 1800 mm figs 4a and s4h thus tp contents of substrate sample decreased quickly from 8 5 mg g to 1 mg g with horizontal distance increasing from 0 to 1800 mm fig 5a and the fe al bound p was the main p form around 40 in the substrate layer of 0 1200 mm and 20 in the following substrate layer fig 5b in the substrate sample limestone neutralized the produced h and many ca2 produced which also contributed to p removal therefore ca mg bound p in the substrate sample of pcw could not be ignored around 20 in the substrate layer of 0 1200 mm and below 5 in the following substrate layer in the pcw equations 4 and 5 produced fe2 fe3 fe oh 3 continuously therefore p removal was kept very high 87 in the three year s operation fig 3b and will lasted till pyrite was depleted however in the lcw p was removed mainly through adsorption on the limestone and ca mg bound p was the dominant fig 5b because of p adsorption saturation after the 1st year tp in the whole substrate layer did not have any removal and even there was tp released in the substrate layer of 0 1800 mm fig 4a that tp contents in the whole substrate layer were stable fig 5a also shows the p adsorption saturation of limestone therefore tp removal was very small and even there was tp released from the lcw fig 3b in the 2nd and 3rd years in the 2nd and 3rd years the small amount of tp removed in lcw should be attributed to plant uptake of p limestone as substrate in cws was considered as a promising solution in developing a cost effective environmental friendly and sustainable technology for phosphorus removal because the average tp removal of 61 7 was achieved during trial period of 20 months in study of dina et al mateus et al 2012 which was consistent with the average removal of lcw in the 1st year but in the 2nd and 3rd year the average tp removal of lcw decreased abruptly to below 10 the same conditions happened to the cws filled with ca mg and fe rich sand vohla et al 2007 in which the tp removal was about 71 in the first 4 months of operation but subsequently decreased to 10 20 therefore the use of limestone as substrate in cw could not achieve long term and higher tp removal because of saturation of p adsorption in the pcw pyrite enhanced n and p removal through anaerobic and aerobic oxidations of pyrite and theoretically those performances would last till pyrite was depleted so natural pyrite made the pcw possess enhanced long term n and p removal there were no heavy metal ions released in the effluent the so4 2 was too high in the effluent of pcw for too much aerobic oxidation of pyrite therefore pyrite should be put in the bottom and rear of substrate layer where the do would be low and aerobic oxidation of pyrite can be reduced pyrite is ubiquitous in most mines of metal sulfur and coal and usually abandoned as tailings or gangue as oxidation of pyrite is the cause of acid mine drainage pyrite is usually considered as bad mineral to water environment however in this research the pcw had no negative effects on growth of the reeds and removals of cod and nh4 n in the whole operation of three years the average tn and tp removal of the pcw were 69 4 21 4 with 4 0 3 2 mg l of average effluent tn and 87 7 14 2 with 0 25 0 20 mg l of average effluent tp respectively the pcw had higher and more lasting tn and tp removal than the lcw the pyrite became good mineral to water environment as it was used as substrate in cws 5 conclusion pcw was constructed with the natural pyrite and limestone 1 1 of volume ratio as the substrates and operated for 3 years which proved that pyrite had no negative effects on growth of reeds removals of cod and nh4 n but enhanced long term tn and tp removal in constructed wetland conversely lcw can not achieve long term and higher tp removal the average cod nh4 n tp and tn removal of pcw over three years were 51 6 7 8 63 7 23 2 87 7 14 2 and 69 4 21 4 respectively the main mechanisms responsible for enhanced simultaneous long term nitrogen and phosphorus removal was anaerobic and aerobic oxidations of pyrite and p retained in the pcw was mainly in form of fe al bound p the main bacteria in pcw were anaeromyxobacter 4 9 ramlibacter 4 8 defluviicoccus 4 2 azoarcus 3 7 geobacter 3 4 and the microbial communities were highly related to anaerobic and aerobic oxidation of pyrite in terms of application pyrite is suggested putting in the bottom and rear of cws thus the aerobic oxidation of pyrite can be reduced and so4 2 in the effluent will not be so much declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by the major science and technology program for water pollution control and treatment

19191,hydrological control of lakes has been increasingly practiced in many parts of the world however the long term ecological impact of hydrological regulation and their dependence on lake impoundment intensity has been rarely examined we combined a spatial survey of surface sediments with sediment core analyses to quantify the limnological changes over the last two centuries for an oligo mesotrophic lake which was dammed in 1957 and reinforced during 1987 1990 respectively a water depth inference model constructed from surface sediment clay components was applied to a well dated sediment core for water level reconstruction the inferred water depth increased from 6 2 0 9 m to 8 7 1 7 m after dam construction and further to 13 6 2 6 m after dam enforcement resulting in an increase in the magnitude of water level fluctuation wlf accordingly bulk sediment c n ratio and median grain size spiked in 1957 and 1990 respectively reflecting a large input of terrestrial sources due to impoundment with a consistent loss of littoral zone and benthic diatoms over time a significant decrease in c n ratio and an abrupt depletion of carbon isotopic signal suggested a shift of carbon transfer towards a pelagic pathway after 1990 while there was a significant increase in algal production since 1990 the accumulation rate of carbon and nitrogen burial displayed an accelerating drop since 1957 reflecting a diluting effect derived from expanding water storage furthermore there was a significant increase in both the ratio between inorganic and organic carbon fluxes and sediment burial of inorganic carbon reflecting enhanced degradation and low storage of aquatic organic carbon in stratified deep waters since 1990 hydro morphological variables were found to exert strong impact on diatom communities with an increasing interplay with nutrient and climate variables over time while there existed a significant shift of diatom composition in 1960 species richness and community dissimilarity showed a significant decrease when water depth was raised to above 10 m or the magnitude of wfl was above 2 m thus our sediment surveys provide evidence on the significant impact of lake regulation on hydro morphology carbon burial and ecological shift over time as well as its stronger interaction with other forcing with increased impoundment intensity graphical

kominoski et al 2017 however limnological succession and ecological processes can differ significantly between dammed rivers and regulated lakes hall et al 1999 thus far understanding the environmental and ecological consequences of lake impoundment is often constrained by insufficient monitoring data that can cover the pre damming period despite that few sediment based studies have shown that water quality and community organization could be strongly altered with lake damming rühland et al 2010 elchyshyn et al 2018 the long term role of lake regulation and their dependence on impoundment intensity have been rarely assessed from an integrated perspective on key ecological processes hydrological regulation is known to alter lake hydro morphology and habitat availability with significant ecological consequences leira and cantonati 2008 anthropogenic conversion of a shallow lake into a deep system directly altered the morphology and typology of lake basin which determine key limnological processes such as thermocline and habitat availability wetzel 2001 wantzen et al 2008 an increase in water depth can shift the thermal regime from a mixed one to a stratified one or enhance the stability of thermocline with a prolonged stratification nowlin et al 2004 habitat quantity and quality often vary with basin morphometry generally showing a loss of littoral habitats and benthic producers with a shift towards a deeper system hellsten et al 1996 coops et al 2003 water level increase can further decrease both light penetration in deeper water and the proportion of sediment exposed to resuspension loiselle et al 2005 posing a negative impact on benthic producers a sustained increase in water level may adversely affect aquatic vegetation which predominantly colonize littoral zones howard williams et al 1995 middelboe and markager 1997 and can cause a shift towards a phytoplankton dominated state due to the diminishing of macrophytes kong et al 2017 therefore the increase in water depth beyond an threshold level can favor the pelagic pathway of trophic flow through decreasing habitat and resource availability for benthic producers devlin et al 2013 dam induced lake level increase can also strongly modulate biogeochemical processes and carbon cycling through enhancing nutrient retention dilution effect and bottom release forsberg et al 1988 zhao et al 2013 anthropogenic regulation can often increase water residential time and nutrient retention leading to a reduction in their transfer to downstream environment erwin et al 2011 it was estimated that 10 of global river nutrients i e total phosphorus was trapped in reservoirs in 2000 maavara et al 2015 the lake water nutrient concentration may also increase with higher water levels due to enhanced release of bottom sediment nutrients tang et al 2015 however an simultaneously increased water volume can also lead to the dilution of soluble nutrients yang and yang 2014 meanwhile the pattern of organic matter accumulation and carbon burial often varies significantly depending on lake size and typology chen et al 2012 with the rate of organic carbon oc burial being greater in shallow water bodies of similar trophic status downing 2010 it has been revealed that oc burial rate was six times higher in reservoirs than that in lakes over a global scale mendonça et al 2017 furthermore co2 efflux from reservoirs was around twice the magnitude of that from natural lakes predominantly via the release from inorganic carbon storage cole et al 2007 however certainty in estimating reservoir carbon fluxes has been largely constrained by the scarcity of time series data derived from dammed lakes or reservoirs therefore it is crucial to refine the temporal shift in carbon burial in response to lake impoundment in the upscaling of reservoir oc burial for estimating regional carbon cycling the variability of water level fluctuation wlf often dampened after damming when compared to the natural variability in non regulated lakes can play a significant role in altering ecological processes and ecosystem structure winter 2004 mehran et al 2017 the wlf can impact the sedimentation processes and biogeochemical cycling through altering sediment transportation and accumulation håkanson 1977 furey et al 2004 an increase in the wlf magnitude in deep lakes may significantly impact deep water renewal and oxic conditions kaden et al 2010 the magnitude of wlf was also found to affect the source of organic matter om in seasonally flooded shallow lakes with larger wlfs leading to increased om input of allochthonous sources liang et al 2016 meanwhile spatial surveys showed that both seasonal and long term wlfs were significant in regulating community assembly in natural lakes casanova 1994 baastrup spohr et al 2016 while the impact of wlf on lake biota was often restricted to littoral zones depending on the amplitude and frequency of wlf scheffer and jeppesen 2007 evtimova and donohue 2016 field experiments showed that the wlf magnitude of 1 m could significantly structure benthic producers evtimova and donohue 2014 community diversity may also vary with the magnitude of wlf along an extended gradient of water depth aroviita and hamalainen 2008 aquatic biodiversity was often found to vary depending on the magnitude of wlf with higher species diversity under a moderate range of wlf white et al 2008 but with a loss of diversity under amplified wlf keddy and reznicek 1986 aroviita and hamalainen 2008 furthermore the field survey revealed the strong interaction of lake depth and wlf in regulating the production and assemblages of lake biota evtimova and donohue 2016 vertical mixing at the intermediate magnitude of wlf was also found to play an important role in structuring phytoplankton elliott et al 2001 therefore it is essential to assess the long term role of wlf in regulating ecosystem structure and diversity along an extended water depth gradient in the case of insufficient lake monitoring data sediment records have been widely applied to track the history of lake level and ecological changes last and smol 2001 for example there could exist a strong mechanistic link between water depth and grain size component as recorded in surface sediments which can be applied in sediment sequences to quantify lake level changes over time xiao et al 2015 haixi lake an alpine rift lake located in southwest china experienced damming in 1957 and dam reinforcement in 1987 1990 respectively showing a clear trend of increased water depth over the last few decades wabd 2012 here we combined the spatial and temporal surveys of lake sediments to reconstruct the variation in lake hydrology and to assess their role in altering limnological processes over the last two centuries specifically we aim to i quantity the long term trajectory in water levels and the wlf magnitude across different hydrological stages ii identify the temporal shifts of habitat availability carbon cycling and algal production and iii evaluate the role of hydrological regulation in driving diatom community shift and diversity patterns as well as their dependence on impoundment intensity 2 material and methods 2 1 study area haixi lake locally called haixihai an alpine rift lake by origin with the altitude of 2130 m a s l is located

catchment with a small village of baitayi located to the north of the lake with a population size of 700 yang 1996 haixi lake is currently an oligo mesotrophic deep system due to its remote location and moderate catchment development it was characterized by a secchi disc depth lake water total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations of 2 7 m 10 7 μg l 1 and 328 μg l 1 respectively as

winter with a water column temperature of 12 c fig s2 haixi lake was documented to experience pronounced lake regulation and drastic water level fluctuations since the 1950s fig s3 the water levels were naturally constrained until a sluice was built on the outflow river with a height of 1 68 m in 1954 and a dam of 9 5 m height was built in 1957 with water level rising to 6 m during 1958 1960 yang 1996 in 1990 haixi lake became a middle sized reservoir due to the installation of an enforced dam with a height of 21 m and three electric water pumping stations wabd 2012 2 2 lake surveys and sediment sampling limnological surveys of haixi lake were conducted in september 2013 and december 2015 respectively three sampling sites were selected for water chemistry sampling and limnological

surface water 0 1 m per site was collected for water chemistry analysis following standard methods sepa 2002 within 24 h after sampling furthermore the landsat images were collated and analyzed to extract the time series of lake surface area and catchment land use during 1987 2013 following the standard methods used in this study region wu et al 2016 surface sediment samples 0 1 cm were collected with a renberg gravity corer from 27 sites across the lake fig 1 parallel sediment cores were also collected from the deep basin of haixi lake in september 2013 a 37 5 cm long core hxh gc2 used in this study for multi proxy analyses was sectioned immediately in field at 0 5 cm intervals for the top 5 cm and at 1 cm intervals for the depth below 5 cm respectively the samples of the above core were stored at 4 c for lab processing before the samples were freeze dried and stored in the dark to minimize degradation for pigment analysis 2 3 sediment analyses the chronology profile of the short core was obtained by measuring 210pbex and 137cs radionuclide activities of sediment samples using the canberra well detector gamma spectrometer gcw3023 sediment chronology sequence was established with the stratigraphic profile of unsupported 210pbex activities through applying the constant rate of supply crs model the stratigraphic profile of 137cs was independently used to verify the crs model inferred chronological sequence particle size spectra of sediment samples including both surface and down core sediment samples were measured using an automated laser optical particle size analyser mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments limited malvern uk briefly 0 3 g freeze dried and disaggregated sediment for each sample was pre treated with 10 20 ml of 10 h2o2 to remove organic matter around 10 ml of 10 hcl was then added and boiled to remove carbonates around 100 ml of deionized water was added and the sample solution was kept for 24 h to rinse acidic ions the sample

method heiri et al 2001 sedimentary chlorophyll a chl a concentration of the freeze dried sediment samples was measured by the visible reflectance spectroscopy method through a foss nir system model 6500 rapid content analyser michelutti et al 2010 the chlorophyll a chl a concentration was calculated with a unit of μg g 1 per organic weight for each sample pretreatment of the sediment samples were applied for carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic analyses following standard methods meyers et al 2001 for the measurement of total organic carbon toc and isotopic signals of organic matters samples were acidified to remove inorganic carbon with high purity hcl 10 by volume until co2 release was invisible and then were re dried and rinsed until ph was 7 approximately 10 mg of homogenized bulk sediment or organic sample in a tin capsule was combusted at 960 c and measured using an elemental analyser flash 2000 linked to a continuous flow mass spectrometer mat 253 thermo

for elemental data respectively relative contents of c and n dry mass and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen c n were measured with the deviation of toc from total carbon tc calculated as total inorganic carbon tic for each sediment sample samples for diatom analysis were pretreated with hcl 10 and h2o2 30 to remove carbonate and organic materials which can impede taxonomic identification before being washed and mounted in naphrax brunel microscopes ltd wiltshire uk following the standard methods battarbee et al 2001 diatom identification and counting were performed under oil immersion at 1000 magnification with phase contrast using a leica microscope dm 2500 a minimum of 400 valves was counted for each sample along random transects the diatom community data were expressed as percent abundance of the total sum in each sample diatom species were categorized into planktonic and benthic groups according to their habitat preferences round et al 2007 2 4 numerical analysis to infer the past lake water depth we firstly developed a linear regression model between the clay components of 27 surface sediment samples and their water depths fig 3 the performance of the water depth inference model was then evaluated through comparing the predicted values for sediment samples with the observed water depths n 13 based on the water depth profile inferred for the sediment sequence we defined the underwater area with water depth 5 m as littoral zone a threshold level for macrophyte growth as observed in field surveys of lakes from this study region li 1980 chu et al 2014 their percentage proportion of the total lake surface area were further calculated hellsten et al 1996 through the application of arcmap 10 0 esri usa using the high resolution lake bathymetry fig 3a prior to statistical analyses environmental variables were log transformed and diatom percentage data were square root transformed for normality respectively borcard et al 2011 student t test was used to test for the difference among samples from different time windows and pearson correlation or regression analysis was applied to examine the relationship between limnological variables the method of constrained incremental sum of squares coniss was applied to identify the significant biostratigraphic zones for diatom data with a broken stick model grimm 1987 bennett 1996 we conducted ordination analyses to define the temporal trajectories of diatom changes in sediment core samples the detrended correspondence analysis dca of diatom assemblages revealed a gradient length of 1 98 sd indicating that the majority of the species displayed a linear response model along the latent environmental gradients and therefore linear methods are appropriate for ordination analyses of diatom data ter braak and prentice 1988 principal components analysis pca was applied to extract the major direction in diatom compositional changes furthermore partial redundancy analysis prda and variation partitioning analysis vpa were conducted to identify the significant drivers for diatom community borcard et al 2011 with z score transformation applied for environmental variables to take into account their different units to reflect the regional climate gradient tree ring inferred temperature data for the last two centuries from this study region li et al 2012a were included in the above analyses due to their significant correlation with regional meteorological data p 0 001 fig s1 we also applied regression models to explore the temporal variation of diatom species richness and community turnover i e jaccard s dissimilarity along the gradients of water depth and wlf amplitude respectively break point analysis using a two segment piecewise linear regression were applied to estimate the timing of largest change in diatom diversity data along the depth gradient muggeo 2003 all statistical analyses were performed in the packages of vegan rioja and segmented in r software rdct 2011 3 results 3 1 spatial surveys of surface sediments the basin wide survey of surface sediments displayed a spatial pattern of grain size distribution over the gradient of water depth fig 2 the sediment silt and sand components generally showed a stable distribution with a median size of around 5 μm in deep waters i e zmax 10 m both silt and sand percentages increased gradually and spiked along the littoral zones or near the mouth of inflowing river with increasing water depth the clay component increased significantly from 8 7 to 33 9 the bulk sediment δ13c signal varied between 26 and 14 with a clear trend of depletion towards the deeper water r 0 74 p 0 001 fig 2 while the δ15n signal of bulk sediments showed no clear correlation with water depth littoral sites were generally more enriched in δ15n signal than pelagic ones the bulk sediment c n ratio mean 1sd 15 0 2 3 showed a decreasing trend with the increased water depth r 0 33 p 0 01 3 2 construction of water level inference models the surface sediment clay components displayed a clear concentric spatial pattern fig 3a showing a significant relationship with the water depth across the 27 sites r 0 72 p 0

observed water depth r 0 93 p 0 001 n 13 fig 3c therefore we applied this clay inferred depth model into sediment samples for water depth reconstruction covering the whole core sequence fig 4 a 3 3 history of water level and littoral zone changes excessive 210pb activities showed an exponential decline over the sediment sequence r2 0 64 p 0 001 fig s4a allowing for the construction of the crs age model fig s4b the sediment bottom sample was estimated as 1810 fig s4c two peaks of 137cs at the sediment depths of 14 5 and 8 5 cm with a crs estimated age of 1965 5 3 0 and 1984 3 3 0 ad respectively corresponded well with the widespread peaks of artificial radionuclide fallouts in 1963 and 1986 ad appleby 2001 corroborating the reliability of our crs model for haixi lake the depth age model showed a mean sedimentation rate of 0 28 0 10 cm year 1 with higher values occurring in 1957 and 1987 1990 ad respectively fig s4d the sediment grain size components recorded drastic hydrological changes over the last two centuries fig 4a during the pre 1900 period the grain size components modestly changed with a mean median size of 5 5 0 4 μm 1sd with the clay and silt components varying in the range of 14 1 17 0 mean 15 7 and 82 2 85 9 mean 84 2 respectively while the sand content remained consistently below 3 over the core the clay component showed a clear increasing trend since 1960 with a value above 20 with a synchronous decrease in the silt content the median size spiked around 1957 and 1987 1990 corresponding with the hydrological turbulent events due to lake damming and reservoir reinforcement respectively our clay inferred water levels displayed a clear trajectory of increasing depth with strong fluctuations over the past two centuries fig 5 a during 1800 1957 ad the water depth had a moderate fluctuation ranging between 4 5 and 7 5 m mean 1sd 6 2 0 9 m suggesting a frequently mixed shallow lake after 1957 there existed a dramatic increase of zmax with remarkable fluctuations 10 5 2 9 m more recently the mean water level was significantly elevated from 8 7 1 7 m during 1957 1990 to 13 6 2 6 m after the enforcement of lake dam completed in 1990 with elevated water levels there is a significant increase in the amplitude of wlf over the last two centuries r 0 53 p 0 001 simultaneously the percentage coverage of littoral zone

sedimentary profile of nutrient cycling and lake production the sediment tn content consistently remained at a level of 1 6 0 2 mg g 1 before showing a moderate enrichment 2 5 0 7 mg g 1 since 1930 fig 4a in particular there existed a clear increase in the bulk sediment tn 2 9 0 8 mg g 1 after 1990 tc content remained at a stable and low level of 22 3 2 5 mg g 1 during 1810 1930 followed by a higher level of 41 0 7 4 mg g 1 up until 1960 after a strongly fluctuating variation the tc level increased to a mean of 47 4 6 1 mg g 1 since 1987 specifically both toc and tic levels fluctuated with a low level in 1800 1920 and increased in 1920 1960 and 1980 1990 respectively fig 4a the decline in both toc and tic occurred shortly after 1960 and 1990 while the decline of toc after 1990 12 2 3 9 mg g 1 contrasted to an increase in tic towards a maximum over the core furthermore there existed a significant negative relationship between toc and inferred zmax since 1957 ad r 0 58 p 0 004 after taking into account the sedimentation rate the fluxes of both tn and toc displayed an increasing trend prior to 1957 ad reaching a maximum of 4 and 40 mg cm 2 a 1 respectively which were followed by a rapid decrease of both indicators to 1 mg cm 2 a 1 towards core top fig 5c and e the bulk sediment c n ratio fig 4a varied significantly within the range of 12 7 22 3 with peak values found around 1950 and 1987 with a strong decline occurring during the periods of around 1890 1930 1957 1975 and 1990 2013 respectively in comparison sediment pigment data showed that chl a concentration varied in a direction opposite to those of c n ratio and toc over time with an accelerating increase in algal production found after 1990 fig 5c furthermore the algal production showed a positive correlation with both sediment tn r 0 81 p 0 001 and inferred zmax r 0 87 p 0 001 but a negative relationship with toc r 0 31 p 0 046 and c n ratio r 0 53 p 0 001 the δ13c signal of bulk sediments δ13cbulk showed a general trajectory of depletion with strong fluctuations over time fig 4a there existed a trend of enrichment from 20 5 in 1810 to 17 3 in 1836 ad followed by a gradual decline to 20 7 in 1930 ad and then it moderately increased to 17 5 in 1996 before showing a unidirectional trend of depletion towards core top with a minimum value of 21 6 found in 2010 ad the δ13c signal of organic matters δ13corg displayed a consistently stable value mean 26 7 0 67 prior to 1957 ad and thereafter experienced a gradual decline mean 28 5 2 0 with an accelerating decrease towards 31 after 1990 our sedimentary δ13corg signature was significantly and negatively correlated with water depth r 0 77 p 0 001 sediment tn r 0 73 p 0 001 and chl a concentration r 0 86 p 0 001 respectively the bulk sediment and organic matter δ15n records showed a synchronous and moderate change over time r 0 466 p 0 002 with a decreasing trend during 1810 1904 followed by a period of slightly enriched signals during the last century fig 4a there also existed a moderate enrichment of δ15n after the interval of 1987 1990 when both proxies were obviously diluted 3 5 diatom compositional changes a total of 138 diatom taxa were identified over the sediment core including 60 taxa with a maximum abundance of 1 14 of which occurred with a relative abundance of 5 in at least one sample diatom assemblages were generally dominated by planktonic taxa over the core fig 4b such as cyclotella ocellata 16 9 84 2 fragilaria crotonensis 0 38 1 cyclostephanos dubius 0 25 5 c comta 1 7 9 0 benthic diatoms fluctuated within the range of 4 62 mainly including achnanthes minutissima 1 6 30 3 small fragilaria spp 0 9 15 9 navicula spp 1 3 8 9 and nizschia spp 1 2 6 7 diatom assemblages were characterized by strong fluctuations over the last two centuries with a significant community shift found in 1960 ad fig 4b during the period of 1810 1880 the community was mainly composed of planktonic taxa 56 1 8 6 with both c dubius and aulocoseira spp decreasing from 20 to 5 while c ocellata increased rapidly from 20 to 60 the benthic taxa showed moderate change 26 3 8 6 with a decrease of small fragilaria spp from 20 to 5 from 1880 to 1930 ad there was a strong community shift towards more planktonic taxa such as c ocellata and f crotonensis with a decimation of benthic taxa leading to a maximum in the planktonic benthic ratio over the core shortly afterwards planktonic taxa such as c ocellata decreased considerably in 1930 1957 when benthic taxa increased dramatically reaching a maximum of 50 from 1960 the community was characterized by frequent compositional shifts with a generally increased abundance of c ocellata f crotonensis and a minutissima during the damming stage of 1960 1990 there exist a gradual increase in f crotonensis followed by a sub dominance of a minutissima an increase in a granulata and a loss of c dubius and a formosa over the reinforcement stage of 1990 2013 the rapid increase in c ocellata was followed by a spike in f crotonensis which was replaced by a minutissima most recently principal component analysis pca of diatom data showed that the first two pca axes were statistically significant and accounted for 24 41 and 17 87 of the total variance respectively fig s5 the samples covering the pre 1957 ad period were predominantly located at the positive direction of axis 1 while the samples covering the stages of 1957 1990 and 1990 2013 ad were generally clustered at opposite directions along the axis 2 to the left side of axis 1 a minutissima and f crotonensis were strongly associated with axis 1 with planktonic species c ocellata located at the right side of this axis benthic species i e a lanceolata and a biasolettiana were strongly associated with axis 2 with planktonic species i e c ocellata and f crotonensis found at the opposite side of this axis 3 6 identifying limnological drivers for diatom changes the diatom pca axis scores were strongly correlated to environmental gradients related to lake hydrology habitat availability and nutrients table s1 the diatom pca axis 1 showed a significant correlation with water depth r 0 59 p 0 001 tn r 0 54 p 0 001 and chl a concentration r 0 53 p 0 003 respectively the diatom pca axis 2 showed a significant correlation with the proportion of benthic diatoms r 0 67 p 0 001 littoral habitant area r 0 34 p 0 05 and tc r 0 47 p 0 01 over the core respectively variation partitioning results further indicated that the nutrient gradient i e tn toc and c n ratio were found to be the most significant forcing of diatom changes explaining 34 7 of the total variance over the last two centuries hydrological variables clay inferred water depth and littoral area accounted for 20 9 of diatom changes and shared a variance of 8 5 with nutrients the climate gradient as indicated by tree ring reconstructed summer temperature accounted for 6 6 of the diatom changes and the interaction among the three gradients accounted for 6 4 of diatom variation across the three hydrological stages over time fig 6 both nutrients and climate independently played an increasing role with increased water depth while the largest role of lake hydrology in driving diatoms 35 5 was found in the stage of lake damming during 1957 1990 meanwhile the interaction between lake hydrology and nutrients showed a gradual increase from 3 0 to 10 4 and was also increasingly shared by the climate gradient both diatom species richness and community dissimilarity showed a significant change along the gradients of water depth and the wlf amplitude over the last two centuries respectively fig 7 a and b diatom species richness and community dissimilarity generally decreased at higher water levels with a threshold water depth levels existing for both indices as identified by break point analysis specifically along the water depth gradient species richness was decreased with a zmax 10 8 2 2 m to a lesser degree while there was an accelerating decrease in community heterogeneity with a zmax 9 0 1 7 m furthermore species richness and the degree of community dissimilarity were both higher with water level variation 1 5 m but decreased with a wlf amplitude 2 m fig 7c and d overall there existed a significant unimodal response of both diatom species richness and community dissimilarity along the gradient of wlf amplitude p 0 001 r2 0 86 and 0 69 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 hydrologic fluctuation and habitat changes the significant correlation between the documented water levels and the depth predicted through a spatial survey confirmed the reliability of our inference models in reconstructing water level history for the last two centuries fig 3 and fig s3 it has been recognized that the grain size distribution of clastic deposits in lakes can provide pivotal information on hydrological changes håkanson 1977 liu et al 2016 for example the water level fluctuation was well reflected by the silt and clay components of both surface and core sediments in lithological surveys punning et al 2006 despite that sub fossil indicators such as diatoms were widely applied to reconstruct the change of water depth within a lake or across lakes birks 2012 juggins and birks 2012 the interplay of multiple environmental stressors have been identified to impede the performance of water depth inference models in quantifying hydrological fluctuation due to their synergistic impact on lake biota telford and birks 2005 in comparison our application of sediment grain size is relatively straightforward in reflecting the lake level change due to the mechanistic link between hydrological fluctuation and sedimentation processes lópez et al 2016 the two century history of hydrological regime shifts reflected the conversion of a shallow lake to a deep water reservoir as a result of lake damming in the context of regional climate change the inferred mean water depth of haixi lake was consistently below 8 m with relatively limited variation 6 2 0 9 m when the lake was free flowing prior to 1957 wabd 2012 a decrease in median grain size and a moderate increase in clay inferred water depth fig 4a corresponded to a period of above average regional precipitation over the period of 1910 1940 fig s1 implying the impact of regional climate on natural hydrodynamics in this region chen et al 2004 while there existed a regional warming trajectory during the last six decades the occurrence of extreme drought around 2009 2013 led to a water level drop by 3 m in haixi synchronous with regional shrinkage of large lakes lü et al 2012 wu et al 2016 with the dam installment the mean water level 8 7 1 7 m increased significantly with a spike in the sand component shortly after 1957 this was further followed by higher water levels 13 6 2 6 m after the dam was enforced in 1990 wabd 2012 noticeably the initiation of dam construction and enforcement in 1957 and 1987 corresponded to a lower than average regional precipitation fig s1 respectively this may suggest that reduced water supply in the context of increasing catchment demand may have triggered hydrological regulation of lakes in this region as found in other areas hennig et al 2013 a strong variation in littoral habitats due to pronounced lake regulation can of be important ecological implication in structuring littoral communities schindler and scheuerell 2002 as the undulation of littoral area was strongly linked with the underwater morphometry dearing 1997 a consistent loss in littoral zones has been widely found in lakes that were converted to deeper reservoirs hellsten and riihimäki 1996 in haixi lake 90 of the modern macrophyte coverage was located in a water depth of 5 m and the littoral area i e water depth 5 m has displayed a significant loss with increased water depth fig s7 similarly an increase of water level by 1 7 m due to the installation of a sluice led to a swift drop of submerged vegetation coverage from 25 to 30 to 2 in a large shallow lake of eastern china kong et al 2017 conversely the water level drop after a sustained period of high waters may not lead to the recovery of submerged vegetation in shallow lakes havens et al 2005 4 2 biogeochemical cycling in response to hydrological regulation the artificially extended gradient of water depth in haixi lake has significantly impacted nutrient cycling over time the consistently low concentrations of tn fig 4 suggested that the lake was nutrient poor during the period of 1800 1957 reflecting low nutrient loadings from the catchment that were often found in this region ni and wang 2015 a moderate increase in sediment tn since the 1930s corresponded with an expanding population and agricultural development as recorded in other lakes of this study region li et al 2007 a further increase of bulk tn concentration occurred around the period of 1990 2013 fig 4a may be related to the moderate expansion of agricultural land and associated nutrient input since the 1980s fig s6 as well as a prolonged water residence time and reduced flow velocity after the construction of hydropower dams kawara et al 1998 in contrast the accumulation rate of sediment tn displayed a long term and significant decrease since 1957 possibly reflecting the dilution effect of increased water storage as there was a doubled increase in lake volume from 2 1 106 m3 in 1957 to 4 0 106 m3 for the last two decades fig s3 this dilution effect has clearly been found to exist in designing water level management for dammed lakes and reservoirs of north america christensen and maki 2015 lake level fluctuation is well documented to alter the carbon cycling and biogeochemical processes piovano et al 2004 woszczyk et al 2014 in consistent with the depth related spatial distribution across the lake basin fig 2 sediment toc concentration and c n ratio experienced a remarkable decrease with raised water levels over time fig 5 the lowest c n ratios in recent deposits reflect a greater contribution of algae derived organic matters that are high in nitrogen rich proteins and lipids as lake expansion was often associated with a decrease in c n ratio korosi et al 2017 the relatively large values of c n ratio and tic flux during 1840 1900 indicated a high input of catchment derived allochthonous materials fig 5e while the peak values in the c n ratio and carbon fluxes occurred around 1940 1957 when a minimum level of lake depth 5 m was found for the last two centuries fig 5e furthermore our results displayed that the burial and accumulation rate of oc are closely related to the gradient of water depth and associated limnological properties over time noticeably the accumulation rate of toc displayed a consistent decrease since the damming in 1957 with significantly lower fluxes observed for the dam enforcement stage than those during the pre damming stage fig 5d this temporal pattern contrasted strongly with an increasing rate of oc burial for northern lakes driven by regional warming and atmospheric deposition heathcote et al 2015 as well as a regional increase in toc storage in lakes across china due to intensifying land use wang et al 2015 our results may well reflect the role of lake depth in determining carbon burial processes as higher storage rates were often found in shallow lakes downing 2010 it has been estimated that the sediment oc burial could be more than doubled increased in reservoirs than that in natural lakes during the last few decades due to the consistent increase in the number of reservoirs cole et al 2007 while there existed an overall increase in sediment carbon burial rate after lake damming in 1957 fig 8 our results also showed that the toc flux was significantly reduced with higher water levels r 0 58 p 0 01 with a significant drop in the sediment carbon fluxes during the dam reinforcement stage simultaneously there was a significant decrease in both c n ratio and littoral habitats after 1990 reflecting the increased carbon utilization via aquatic carbon dioxide fixation baastrup spohr et al 2016 when compared to land derived oc these aquatic organic matters are characterized by high degradation rates and low sediment storage potentially causing stronger water atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases mendonça et al 2017 despite that the sediment content and flux of toc displayed a temporal trajectory that generally followed those of tic figs 4a and 5 the ratio between tic and toc fluxes was significantly elevated during the enforcement stage when compared to the previous two stages fig 8 this can partly be due to enhanced mineralization rate of oc and their transformation to inorganic carbon in stratified and anoxic waters with increasing water depth clayer et al 2016 as well as warmer climate during the last few decades gudasz et al 2010 as the various forms of inorganic carbon can easily release co2 bade 2009 the monitoring results have shown that greenhouse gas efflux to the atmosphere in reservoirs was about twice the magnitude of that in natural lakes st louis et al 2000 therefore the increased impoundment intensity and dominance of aquatic organic matters has significantly reduced sediment oc storage in our lake in the context of regional warming which more recently served as a new inorganic carbon source allowing for stronger greenhouse gas emission 4 3 temporal patterns of algal production and community shift the concurrent increase in chl a and tn concentrations suggested a greater lake production over time due to enhanced nutrient cycling and hydrological retention kaushal and binford 1999 meyers 2003 for example the algal production increased with rising water levels and expanded euphotic zone which was also reflected in a declining c n ratio the δ13corganic signal was significantly depleted with increasing impoundment intensity fig 4a inferring the increased input of autochthonous sources such as phytoplankton meyers and ishiwatari 1993 meanwhile there was a lack of significant link between sediment tn and chl a during 1810 1990 when lake level was below 10 m fig 5 this contrasting pattern in the nutrient biomass relationship among hydrological stages may well reflect the difference of hydrological processes such as mixing and flushing this was evident in a multi basin lake where sediment resuspension and nutrient release in shallow basins decoupled the nutrient biomass relationship zhang et al 2013 under the more nitrogen rich conditions as was the case for haixi lake table 1 moderate nutrient enrichment can enhance autochthonous om with enriched δ15n signal because of the dominance of non n2 fixing algae which discriminated against lighter isotopic signals meyers 1997 thus along the extended water depth gradient in haixi lake the stratigraphic changes in the δ13c and δ15n signals of om over the past two centuries may have been a result of increasing autochthonous om furey et al 2004 diatom community shift was well reflective of water level increase and enhanced thermal stratification during the pre disturbance stage of 1830 1930 the dominance of the small and planktonic cyclotella ocellata i e 50 suggested the existence of a turbulent and nutrient poor shallow system soylu et al 2007 with a continuous increase in water level from 1957 this species typically predated other sub dominant species during the temporal community succession confirming its high sensitivity to the change of thermal regime cremer and wagner 2003 padisák et al 2009 our modern surveys fig s1 showed the existence of thermal stratification in summer with raised water levels kling 1988 which would favor small fast growing planktonic diatoms such as cyclotella smol et al 2005 furthermore regional climate has warmed markedly in recent decades fig s1 often leading to a longer and stronger thermal stability wilhelm and adrian 2008 similarly the abundance of small cyclotella was strongly linked with mean air temperature r 0 58 p 0 007 for the last six decades in haixi lake diatom assemblages were also characterized by response to the damming related changes in nutrients benthic habitats and hydrological fluctuation fig 5 our sediment records revealed a synchronous change of f crotonensis with tn r 0 469 p 0 002 which was an indicator species in n rich waters macintyre et al 2009 similarly c comta displayed a gradual increase after 1980 with elevated tn as found in other studies chen et al 2012 the loss of littoral zones also likely played a role in structuring diatom assemblages leading to a gradual decrease in benthic diatoms fig 5b furthermore a moderate increase in a granulata was consistent with a significant increase in the magnitude of wlf since 1960 as this species is characterized by high sinking rates and competitive advantage in turbulent waters vieira et al 2008 noticeably a minutissima the subdominant benthic diatoms over the core was found to be more abundant after 1957 this species was known to grow favorably not only in the littoral zones laird et al 2011 but also can proliferate as epilithon over a long depth gradient i e up to 24 m in oligotrophic lakes with frequent water level fluctuation cantonati et al 2009 4 4 ecological shifts along the impoundment intensity gradient water depth and associated hydrological variables showed a stronger impact on diatom communities during the damming stage when compared to the pre disturbance and reinforcement stages fig 6 the loss in littoral habitats may have been triggered by lake damming geest et al 2005 li et al 2007 wang et al 2015 leading to a significant decrease in diatom species richness in haixi lake as found in spatial surveys of lake biota such as zooplankton gal et al 2013 and fish langer et al 2017 furthermore the break point analysis suggested a threshold depth of 10 8 m for diatom species richness which was consistent with the spatial surveys with a threshold depth of 9 0 m found in temperate lakes laird et al 2010 this water depth dependence of biodiversity patterns was also obvious in deeper lakes with stronger thermal resistance to water mixing longhi and beisner 2010 similarly there existed a significant decrease in community dissimilarity with the lake depth raised above 9 m fig 7b suggesting a higher degree of community stability and stronger ecological resistance to external stressors in this deep water environment wantzen et al 2008 accordingly a shift from benthic to planktonic pathway of energy flow was evidenced in the significant increase in algal production and a clear depletion of δ13corganic signals during the enforcement stage of this oligo mesotrophic lake fig 8 comparably this pattern was often found in shallow lakes with a regime shift to an algae dominated state with the loss of macrophytes due to eutrophication torres et al 2012 meanwhile there existed a significant decrease in the reconstructed littoral area 5 m depth that was strongly linked with macrophyte growth in response to expanding water depth over the last two centuries fig s7b while water level control has been found to enhance the role of nutrients in causing regime shifts in shallow lakes kong et al 2017 the expanded gradient of water depth alone may have shifted the ecological regime towards a phytoplankton dominated state in haixi lake after 1990 our results also revealed that wlfs can influence biodiversity under the theoretical framework of intermediate disturbance hypothesis modern surveys have shown that an intermediate level of hydrological disturbance could enhance the degree of community shift for aquatic biota such as macrophyte and phytoplankton elliott et al 2001 white et al 2008 li et al 2012b both diatom species richness and the degree of community shift was found to be higher under a moderate amplitude of water levels i e 2 m in haixi lake over time fig 7c and d corresponding well with experimental results casanova 1994 evtimova and donohue 2014 similarly an increased amplitude of wlf i e 2 m month in subtropical reservoirs played a negative impact on algal production yang et al 2016 and significantly affected phytoplankton structure yang et al 2017 while dam enforcement further deepened water levels and significantly altered limnological processes the amplitude of wlf after 1990 remained similar as that found for the damming stage fig 8 this may suggest an independent role of wlf magnitude in affecting community stability despite that the interaction between water depth and wlf may exist in shallow lakes evtimova and donohue 2016 while our sediment records were characterized by capturing an integrated signal of wlf and ecological changes beyond the seasonal variability long term monitoring data revealed that the annual mean variation in wlf was often greater than the monthly fluctuation evtimova and donohue 2016 therefore an implication for reservoir management derived from our study is that there may exist a threshold level for both water depth and the amplitude of wlf beyond which community stability and ecological state will be significantly altered over time with detrimental effects on biodiversity 5 conclusions in consistent with the documented events of hydrological regulation our sediment records revealed a two century history of a significant increase in lake levels with increasing impoundment intensity along an expanded gradient of lake depth a gradual loss of littoral zone and benthic diatoms over the last few decades was consistent with a significant depletion of δ13corganic signal suggesting a dominance of pelagic trophic pathway and autochthonous source in aquatic organic carbon transfer after 1990 despite that there was a significant increase in the algal production since 1990 the accumulation rate of toc displayed an accelerating decrease since 1957 reflecting a dilution effect derived from expanding water storage with a significant shift in lake ecological state after the dam enforcement the enhanced inorganic carbon burial coupled with strong degradation and low storage of aquatic organic matters can allow for stronger emission of greenhouse gases from this deep water reservoir while hydro morphological fluctuation impacted diatom community shift a further increase in water depth during the dam enforcement stage has significantly decreased diatom biodiversity and community heterogeneity when a threshold level in water depth or the wlf amplitude was reached meanwhile the nutrient and climate forcing showed an increasing interaction with hydrological variables in structuring diatom changes across the three hydrological stages therefore lake impoundment not only significantly regulated hydrological regime carbon cycling and algal shift over time but also enhanced the ecological role of nutrient and climate forcing with increasing impoundment intensity acknowledgement this work was supported by national key r d program of china 2017yfa0605202 ministry of education of china 213034a

19191,hydrological control of lakes has been increasingly practiced in many parts of the world however the long term ecological impact of hydrological regulation and their dependence on lake impoundment intensity has been rarely examined we combined a spatial survey of surface sediments with sediment core analyses to quantify the limnological changes over the last two centuries for an oligo mesotrophic lake which was dammed in 1957 and reinforced during 1987 1990 respectively a water depth inference model constructed from surface sediment clay components was applied to a well dated sediment core for water level reconstruction the inferred water depth increased from 6 2 0 9 m to 8 7 1 7 m after dam construction and further to 13 6 2 6 m after dam enforcement resulting in an increase in the magnitude of water level fluctuation wlf accordingly bulk sediment c n ratio and median grain size spiked in 1957 and 1990 respectively reflecting a large input of terrestrial sources due to impoundment with a consistent loss of littoral zone and benthic diatoms over time a significant decrease in c n ratio and an abrupt depletion of carbon isotopic signal suggested a shift of carbon transfer towards a pelagic pathway after 1990 while there was a significant increase in algal production since 1990 the accumulation rate of carbon and nitrogen burial displayed an accelerating drop since 1957 reflecting a diluting effect derived from expanding water storage furthermore there was a significant increase in both the ratio between inorganic and organic carbon fluxes and sediment burial of inorganic carbon reflecting enhanced degradation and low storage of aquatic organic carbon in stratified deep waters since 1990 hydro morphological variables were found to exert strong impact on diatom communities with an increasing interplay with nutrient and climate variables over time while there existed a significant shift of diatom composition in 1960 species richness and community dissimilarity showed a significant decrease when water depth was raised to above 10 m or the magnitude of wfl was above 2 m thus our sediment surveys provide evidence on the significant impact of lake regulation on hydro morphology carbon burial and ecological shift over time as well as its stronger interaction with other forcing with increased impoundment intensity graphical abstract image 1 keywords lake impoundment water level fluctuation carbon burial algae paleolimnology 1 introduction for the last few decades hydrological manipulation has been increasingly practiced for irrigation flood control municipal water supply and hydropower generation globally schleiss and boes 2011 for example 90 of the major river basins were strongly regulated across china with a total storage capacity of reservoirs currently about two times higher than that of lakes yang and lu 2014 meanwhile the number of natural lakes that are converted to reservoirs has spiked over the last few decades and is projected to continue in the coming decade zarfl et al 2015 at present around 40 of inland water organic carbon is annually buried and stored in reservoirs which serve as an important sink for global carbon cycling mendonça et al 2017 the environmental and ecological assessment of hydrological regulation has been predominantly derived from floodplain lakes and rivers van geest et al 2005 river flow regulation by dams has been widely found to alter the hydrological regime poff and schmidt 2016 timpe and kaplan 2017 nutrient cycling maavara et al 2015 and ecosystem structure kominoski et al 2017 however limnological succession and ecological processes can differ significantly between dammed rivers and regulated lakes hall et al 1999 thus far understanding the environmental and ecological consequences of lake impoundment is often constrained by insufficient monitoring data that can cover the pre damming period despite that few sediment based studies have shown that water quality and community organization could be strongly altered with lake damming rühland et al 2010 elchyshyn et al 2018 the long term role of lake regulation and their dependence on impoundment intensity have been rarely assessed from an integrated perspective on key ecological processes hydrological regulation is known to alter lake hydro morphology and habitat availability with significant ecological consequences leira and cantonati 2008 anthropogenic conversion of a shallow lake into a deep system directly altered the morphology and typology of lake basin which determine key limnological processes such as thermocline and habitat availability wetzel 2001 wantzen et al 2008 an increase in water depth can shift the thermal regime from a mixed one to a stratified one or enhance the stability of thermocline with a prolonged stratification nowlin et al 2004 habitat quantity and quality often vary with basin morphometry generally showing a loss of littoral habitats and benthic producers with a shift towards a deeper system hellsten et al 1996 coops et al 2003 water level increase can further decrease both light penetration in deeper water and the proportion of sediment exposed to resuspension loiselle et al 2005 posing a negative impact on benthic producers a sustained increase in water level may adversely affect aquatic vegetation which predominantly colonize littoral zones howard williams et al 1995 middelboe and markager 1997 and can cause a shift towards a phytoplankton dominated state due to the diminishing of macrophytes kong et al 2017 therefore the increase in water depth beyond an threshold level can favor the pelagic pathway of trophic flow through decreasing habitat and resource availability for benthic producers devlin et al 2013 dam induced lake level increase can also strongly modulate biogeochemical processes and carbon cycling through enhancing nutrient retention dilution effect and bottom release forsberg et al 1988 zhao et al 2013 anthropogenic regulation can often increase water residential time and nutrient retention leading to a reduction in their transfer to downstream environment erwin et al 2011 it was estimated that 10 of global river nutrients i e total phosphorus was trapped in reservoirs in 2000 maavara et al 2015 the lake water nutrient concentration may also increase with higher water levels due to enhanced release of bottom sediment nutrients tang et al 2015 however an simultaneously increased water volume can also lead to the dilution of soluble nutrients yang and yang 2014 meanwhile the pattern of organic matter accumulation and carbon burial often varies significantly depending on lake size and typology chen et al 2012 with the rate of organic carbon oc burial being greater in shallow water bodies of similar trophic status downing 2010 it has been revealed that oc burial rate was six times higher in reservoirs than that in lakes over a global scale mendonça et al 2017 furthermore co2 efflux from reservoirs was around twice the magnitude of that from natural lakes predominantly via the release from inorganic carbon storage cole et al 2007 however certainty in estimating reservoir carbon fluxes has been largely constrained by the scarcity of time series data derived from dammed lakes or reservoirs therefore it is crucial to refine the temporal shift in carbon burial in response to lake impoundment in the upscaling of reservoir oc burial for estimating regional carbon cycling the variability of water level fluctuation wlf often dampened after damming when compared to the natural variability in non regulated lakes can play a significant role in altering ecological processes and ecosystem structure winter 2004 mehran et al 2017 the wlf can impact the sedimentation processes and biogeochemical cycling through altering sediment transportation and accumulation håkanson 1977 furey et al 2004 an increase in the wlf magnitude in deep lakes may significantly impact deep water renewal and oxic conditions kaden et al 2010 the magnitude of wlf was also found to affect the source of organic matter om in seasonally flooded shallow lakes with larger wlfs leading to increased om input of allochthonous sources liang et al 2016 meanwhile spatial surveys showed that both seasonal and long term wlfs were significant in regulating community assembly in natural lakes casanova 1994 baastrup spohr et al 2016 while the impact of wlf on lake biota was often restricted to littoral zones depending on the amplitude and frequency of wlf scheffer and jeppesen 2007 evtimova and donohue 2016 field experiments showed that the wlf magnitude of 1 m could significantly structure benthic producers evtimova and donohue 2014 community diversity may also vary with the magnitude of wlf along an extended gradient of water depth aroviita and hamalainen 2008 aquatic biodiversity was often found to vary depending on the magnitude of wlf with higher species diversity under a moderate range of wlf white et al 2008 but with a loss of diversity under amplified wlf keddy and reznicek 1986 aroviita and hamalainen 2008 furthermore the field survey revealed the strong interaction of lake depth and wlf in regulating the production and assemblages of lake biota evtimova and donohue 2016 vertical mixing at the intermediate magnitude of wlf was also found to play an important role in structuring phytoplankton elliott et al 2001 therefore it is essential to assess the long term role of wlf in regulating ecosystem structure and diversity along an extended water depth gradient in the case of insufficient lake monitoring data sediment records have been widely applied to track the history of lake level and ecological changes last and smol 2001 for example there could exist a strong mechanistic link between water depth and grain size component as recorded in surface sediments which can be applied in sediment sequences to quantify lake level changes over time xiao et al 2015 haixi lake an alpine rift lake located in southwest china experienced damming in 1957 and dam reinforcement in 1987 1990 respectively showing a clear trend of increased water depth over the last few decades wabd 2012 here we combined the spatial and temporal surveys of lake sediments to reconstruct the variation in lake hydrology and to assess their role in altering limnological processes over the last two centuries specifically we aim to i quantity the long term trajectory in water levels and the wlf magnitude across different hydrological stages ii identify the temporal shifts of habitat availability carbon cycling and algal production and iii evaluate the role of hydrological regulation in driving diatom community shift and diversity patterns as well as their dependence on impoundment intensity 2 material and methods 2 1 study area haixi lake locally called haixihai an alpine rift lake by origin with the altitude of 2130 m a s l is located in northwest part of yunnan province southwest china fig 1 the lake is a currently a deep reservoir system with a maximum depth zmax of 18 5 m a surface area of 3 km2 and a watershed area of 23 km2 respectively table 1 the lake is in flown by a main river in the north and several streams from the west and south respectively dominated by the indian monsoon and influenced by eastern asian monsoon the regional climate is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons the annual mean precipitation is 1050 mm with more than 70 rainfall occurring during the summer months of june to august with an annual average temperature of about 15 c based on the monitoring data collected from the closest meteorological station of dali during 1951 2013 77 km southwest of haixi lake 1990 5 m a s l fig s1 the regional climate was characterized by a clear warming trend since the 1980s and an overall decrease in annual mean precipitation over the last century fig s1 the bedrock types in the watershed mainly include limestone sandstone and mudstone while the land use coverage is predominantly composed of forest and shrub lands fig 1 the forested coverage dominated by yunnan pine pinus yunnanensis is 42 9 while the brushwood dominated by rhododendron rhododendron coriaceum covered 25 of the watershed table 1 there is a limited coverage of agriculture and urban lands 8 9 and 5 9 respectively within the catchment with a small village of baitayi located to the north of the lake with a population size of 700 yang 1996 haixi lake is currently an oligo mesotrophic deep system due to its remote location and moderate catchment development it was characterized by a secchi disc depth lake water total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations of 2 7 m 10 7 μg l 1 and 328 μg l 1 respectively as measured in 2013 table 1 in this deep system with a mean depth zmean of 11 7 m thermal stratification occurred during the summer with a surface water temperature of 22 c and was totally mixed in winter with a water column temperature of 12 c fig s2 haixi lake was documented to experience pronounced lake regulation and drastic water level fluctuations since the 1950s fig s3 the water levels were naturally constrained until a sluice was built on the outflow river with a height of 1 68 m in 1954 and a dam of 9 5 m height was built in 1957 with water level rising to 6 m during 1958 1960 yang 1996 in 1990 haixi lake became a middle sized reservoir due to the installation of an enforced dam with a height of 21 m and three electric water pumping stations wabd 2012 2 2 lake surveys and sediment sampling limnological surveys of haixi lake were conducted in september 2013 and december 2015 respectively three sampling sites were selected for water chemistry sampling and limnological surveys lake water temperature turbidity dissolved oxygen do chlorophyll a and conductivity profiles were measured using a multi parameter water quality meter ysi 6600 v2 ysi co usa a total of 5 l surface water 0 1 m per site was collected for water chemistry analysis following standard methods sepa 2002 within 24 h after sampling furthermore the landsat images were collated and analyzed to extract the time series of lake surface area and catchment land use during 1987 2013 following the standard methods used in this study region wu et al 2016 surface sediment samples 0 1 cm were collected with a renberg gravity corer from 27 sites across the lake fig 1 parallel sediment cores were also collected from the deep basin of haixi lake in september 2013 a 37 5 cm long core hxh gc2 used in this study for multi proxy analyses was sectioned immediately in field at 0 5 cm intervals for the top 5 cm and at 1 cm intervals for the depth below 5 cm respectively the samples of the above core were stored at 4 c for lab processing before the samples were freeze dried and stored in the dark to minimize degradation for pigment analysis 2 3 sediment analyses the chronology profile of the short core was obtained by measuring 210pbex and 137cs radionuclide activities of sediment samples using the canberra well detector gamma spectrometer gcw3023 sediment chronology sequence was established with the stratigraphic profile of unsupported 210pbex activities through applying the constant rate of supply crs model the stratigraphic profile of 137cs was independently used to verify the crs model inferred chronological sequence particle size spectra of sediment samples including both surface and down core sediment samples were measured using an automated laser optical particle

63 μm and sand 63 μm respectively organic matter content was estimated for bulk sediments through the method of loss on ignition loi550 at 550 c for 3 h using a muffle furnace following the standard method heiri et al 2001 sedimentary chlorophyll a chl a concentration of the freeze dried sediment samples was measured by the visible reflectance spectroscopy method through a foss nir system model 6500 rapid content analyser michelutti et al 2010 the chlorophyll a chl a concentration was calculated with a unit of μg g 1 per organic weight for each sample pretreatment of the sediment samples were applied for carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic analyses following standard methods meyers et al 2001 for the measurement of total organic carbon toc and isotopic signals of organic matters samples were acidified to remove inorganic carbon with high purity hcl 10 by volume until co2 release was invisible and then were re dried and rinsed until ph was 7 approximately 10 mg of

abundance of the total sum in each sample diatom species were categorized into planktonic and benthic groups according to their habitat preferences round et al 2007 2 4 numerical analysis to infer the past lake water depth we firstly developed a linear regression model between the clay components of 27 surface sediment samples and their water depths fig 3 the performance of the water depth inference model was then evaluated through comparing the predicted values for sediment samples with the observed water depths n 13 based on the water depth profile inferred for the sediment sequence we defined the underwater area with water depth 5 m as littoral zone a threshold level for macrophyte growth as observed in field surveys of lakes from this study region li 1980 chu et al 2014 their percentage proportion of the total lake surface area were further calculated hellsten et al 1996 through the application of arcmap 10 0 esri usa using the high resolution lake bathymetry fig 3a prior to statistical analyses environmental variables were log transformed and diatom percentage data were square root transformed for normality respectively borcard et al 2011 student t test was used to test for the difference among samples from different time windows and pearson correlation or regression analysis was applied to examine the relationship between limnological variables the method of constrained incremental sum of squares coniss was applied to identify the significant biostratigraphic zones for diatom data with a broken stick model grimm 1987 bennett 1996 we conducted ordination analyses to define the temporal trajectories of diatom changes in sediment core samples the detrended correspondence analysis dca of diatom assemblages revealed a gradient length of 1 98 sd indicating that the majority of the species displayed a linear response model along the latent environmental gradients and therefore linear methods are appropriate for ordination analyses of diatom data ter braak and prentice 1988 principal components analysis pca was applied to extract the major direction in diatom compositional changes furthermore partial redundancy analysis prda and variation partitioning analysis vpa were conducted to identify the significant drivers for diatom community borcard et al 2011 with z score transformation applied for environmental variables to take into account their different units to reflect the regional climate gradient tree ring inferred temperature data for the last two centuries from this study region li et al 2012a were included in the above analyses due to their significant correlation with regional meteorological data p 0 001 fig s1 we also applied regression models to explore the temporal variation of diatom species richness and community turnover i e jaccard s dissimilarity along the gradients of water depth and wlf amplitude respectively break point analysis using a two segment piecewise linear regression were applied to estimate the timing of largest change in diatom diversity data along the depth gradient muggeo 2003 all statistical analyses were performed in the packages of vegan rioja and segmented in r software rdct 2011 3 results 3 1 spatial surveys of surface sediments the basin wide survey of surface sediments displayed a spatial pattern of grain size distribution over the gradient of water depth fig 2 the sediment silt and sand components generally showed a stable distribution with a median size of around 5 μm in deep waters i e zmax 10 m both silt and sand percentages increased gradually and spiked along the littoral zones or near the mouth of inflowing river with increasing water depth the clay component increased significantly from 8 7 to 33 9 the bulk sediment δ13c signal varied between 26 and 14 with a clear trend of depletion towards the deeper water r 0 74 p 0 001 fig 2 while the δ15n signal of bulk sediments showed no clear correlation with water depth littoral sites were generally more enriched in δ15n signal than pelagic ones the bulk sediment c n ratio mean 1sd 15 0 2 3 showed a decreasing trend with the increased water depth r 0 33 p 0 01 3 2 construction of water level inference models the surface sediment clay components displayed a clear concentric spatial pattern fig 3a showing a significant relationship with the water depth across the 27 sites r 0 72 p 0

observed water depth r 0 93 p 0 001 n 13 fig 3c therefore we applied this clay inferred depth model into sediment samples for water depth reconstruction covering the whole core sequence fig 4 a 3 3 history of water level and littoral zone changes excessive 210pb activities showed an exponential decline over the sediment sequence r2 0 64 p 0 001 fig s4a allowing for the construction of the crs age model fig s4b the sediment bottom sample was estimated as 1810 fig s4c two peaks of 137cs at the sediment depths of 14 5 and 8 5 cm with a crs estimated age of 1965 5 3 0 and 1984 3 3 0 ad respectively corresponded well with the widespread peaks of artificial radionuclide fallouts in 1963 and 1986 ad appleby 2001 corroborating the reliability of our crs model for haixi lake the depth age model showed a mean sedimentation rate of 0 28 0 10 cm year 1 with higher values occurring in 1957 and 1987 1990 ad respectively fig s4d the sediment grain size components recorded drastic hydrological changes over the last two centuries fig 4a during the pre 1900 period the grain size components modestly changed with a mean median size of 5 5 0 4 μm 1sd with the clay and silt components varying in the range of 14 1 17 0 mean 15 7 and 82 2 85 9 mean 84 2 respectively while the sand content remained consistently below 3 over the core the clay component showed a clear increasing trend since 1960 with a value above 20 with a synchronous decrease in the silt content the median size spiked around 1957 and 1987 1990 corresponding with the hydrological turbulent events due to lake damming and reservoir reinforcement respectively our clay inferred water levels displayed a clear trajectory of increasing depth with strong fluctuations over the past two centuries fig 5 a during 1800 1957 ad the water depth had a moderate fluctuation ranging between 4 5 and 7 5 m mean 1sd 6 2 0 9 m suggesting a frequently mixed shallow lake after 1957 there existed a dramatic increase of zmax with remarkable fluctuations 10 5 2 9 m more recently the mean water level was significantly elevated from 8 7 1 7 m during 1957 1990 to 13 6 2 6 m after the enforcement of lake dam completed in 1990 with elevated water levels there is a significant increase in the amplitude of wlf over the last two centuries r 0 53 p 0 001 simultaneously the percentage coverage of littoral zone i e water depth 5 m showed a shrinking trajectory fig 5b decreasing from 83 6 13 8 in 1800 1957 to 62 3 11 2 and a further lower value 44 8 9 2 during 1957 1990 and 1990 2013 respectively 3 4 sedimentary profile of nutrient cycling and lake production the sediment tn content consistently remained at a level of 1 6 0 2 mg g 1 before showing a moderate enrichment 2 5 0 7 mg g 1 since 1930 fig 4a in particular there existed a clear increase in the bulk sediment tn 2 9 0 8 mg g 1 after 1990 tc content remained at a stable and low level of 22 3 2 5 mg g 1 during 1810 1930 followed by a higher level of 41 0 7 4 mg g 1 up until 1960 after a strongly fluctuating variation the tc level increased to a mean of 47 4 6 1 mg g 1 since 1987 specifically both toc and tic levels fluctuated with a low level in 1800 1920 and increased in 1920 1960 and 1980 1990 respectively fig 4a the decline in both toc and tic occurred shortly after 1960 and 1990 while the decline of toc after 1990 12 2 3 9 mg g 1 contrasted to an increase in tic towards a maximum over the core furthermore there existed a significant negative relationship between toc and inferred zmax since 1957 ad r 0 58 p 0 004 after taking into account the sedimentation rate the fluxes of both tn and toc displayed an increasing trend prior to 1957 ad reaching a maximum of 4 and 40 mg cm 2 a 1 respectively which were followed by a rapid decrease of both indicators to 1 mg cm 2 a 1 towards core top fig 5c and e the bulk sediment c n ratio fig 4a varied significantly within the range of 12 7 22 3 with peak values found around 1950 and 1987 with a strong decline occurring during the periods of around 1890 1930 1957 1975 and 1990 2013 respectively in comparison sediment pigment data showed that chl a concentration varied in a direction opposite to those of c n ratio and toc over time with an accelerating increase in algal production found after 1990 fig 5c furthermore the algal production showed a positive correlation with both sediment tn r 0 81 p 0 001 and inferred zmax r 0 87 p 0 001 but a negative relationship with toc r 0 31 p 0 046 and c n ratio r 0 53 p 0 001 the δ13c signal of bulk sediments δ13cbulk showed a general trajectory of depletion with strong fluctuations over time fig 4a there existed a trend of enrichment from 20 5 in 1810 to 17 3 in 1836 ad followed by a gradual decline to 20 7 in 1930 ad and then it moderately increased to 17 5 in 1996 before showing a unidirectional trend of depletion towards core top with a minimum value of 21 6 found in 2010 ad the δ13c signal of organic matters δ13corg displayed a consistently stable value mean 26 7 0 67 prior to 1957 ad and thereafter experienced a gradual decline mean 28 5 2 0 with an accelerating decrease towards 31 after 1990 our sedimentary δ13corg signature was significantly and negatively correlated with water depth r 0 77 p 0 001 sediment tn r 0 73 p 0 001 and chl a concentration r 0 86 p 0 001 respectively the bulk sediment and organic matter δ15n records showed a synchronous and moderate change over time r 0 466 p 0 002 with a decreasing trend during 1810 1904 followed by a period of slightly enriched signals during the last century fig 4a there also existed a moderate enrichment of δ15n after the interval of 1987 1990 when both proxies were obviously diluted 3 5 diatom compositional changes a total of 138 diatom taxa were identified over the sediment core including 60 taxa with a maximum abundance of 1 14 of which occurred with a relative abundance of 5 in at least one sample diatom assemblages were generally dominated by planktonic taxa over the core fig 4b such as cyclotella ocellata 16 9 84 2 fragilaria crotonensis 0 38 1 cyclostephanos dubius 0 25 5 c comta 1 7 9 0 benthic diatoms fluctuated within the range of 4 62 mainly including achnanthes minutissima 1 6 30 3 small fragilaria spp 0 9 15 9 navicula spp 1 3 8 9 and nizschia spp 1 2 6 7 diatom assemblages were characterized by strong fluctuations over the last two centuries with a significant community shift found in 1960 ad fig 4b during the period of 1810 1880 the community was mainly composed of planktonic taxa 56 1 8 6 with both c dubius and aulocoseira spp decreasing from 20 to 5 while c ocellata increased rapidly from 20 to 60 the benthic taxa showed moderate change 26 3 8 6 with a decrease of small fragilaria spp from 20 to 5 from 1880 to 1930 ad there was a strong community shift towards more planktonic taxa such as c ocellata and f crotonensis with a decimation of benthic taxa leading to a maximum in the planktonic benthic ratio over the core shortly afterwards planktonic taxa such as c ocellata decreased considerably in 1930 1957 when benthic taxa increased dramatically reaching a maximum of 50 from 1960 the community was characterized by frequent compositional shifts with a generally increased abundance of c ocellata f crotonensis and a minutissima during the damming stage of 1960 1990 there exist a gradual increase in f crotonensis followed by a sub dominance of a minutissima an increase in a granulata and a loss of c dubius and a formosa over the reinforcement stage of 1990 2013 the rapid increase in c ocellata was followed by a spike in f crotonensis which was replaced by a minutissima most recently principal component analysis pca of diatom data showed that the first two pca axes were statistically significant and accounted for 24 41 and 17 87 of the total variance respectively fig s5 the samples covering the pre 1957 ad period were predominantly located at the positive direction of axis 1 while the samples covering the stages of 1957 1990 and 1990 2013 ad were generally clustered at opposite directions along the axis 2 to the left side of axis 1 a minutissima and f crotonensis were strongly associated with axis 1 with planktonic species c ocellata located at the right side of this axis benthic species i e a lanceolata and a biasolettiana were strongly associated with axis 2 with planktonic species i e c ocellata and f crotonensis found at the opposite side of this axis 3 6 identifying limnological drivers for diatom changes the diatom pca axis scores were strongly correlated to environmental gradients related to lake hydrology habitat availability and nutrients table s1 the diatom pca axis 1 showed a significant correlation with water depth r 0 59 p 0 001 tn r 0 54 p 0 001 and chl a concentration r 0 53 p 0 003 respectively the diatom pca axis 2 showed a significant correlation with the proportion of benthic diatoms r 0 67 p 0 001 littoral habitant area r 0 34 p 0 05 and tc r 0 47 p 0 01 over the core respectively variation partitioning results further indicated that the nutrient gradient i e tn toc and c n ratio were found to be the most significant forcing of diatom changes explaining 34 7 of the total variance over the last two centuries hydrological variables clay inferred water depth and littoral area accounted for 20 9 of diatom changes and shared a variance of 8 5 with nutrients the climate gradient as indicated by tree ring reconstructed summer temperature accounted for 6 6 of the diatom changes and the interaction among the three gradients accounted for 6 4 of diatom variation across the three hydrological stages over time fig 6 both nutrients and climate independently played an increasing role with increased water depth while the largest role of lake hydrology in driving diatoms 35 5 was found in the stage of lake damming during 1957 1990 meanwhile the interaction between lake hydrology and nutrients showed a gradual increase from 3 0 to 10 4 and was also increasingly shared by the climate gradient both diatom species richness and community dissimilarity showed a significant change along the gradients of water depth and the wlf amplitude over the last two centuries respectively fig 7 a and b diatom species richness and community dissimilarity generally decreased at higher water levels with a threshold water depth levels existing for both indices as identified by break point analysis specifically along the water depth gradient species richness was decreased with a zmax 10 8 2 2 m to a lesser degree while there was an accelerating decrease in community heterogeneity with a zmax 9 0 1 7 m furthermore species richness and the degree of community dissimilarity were both higher with water level variation 1 5 m but decreased with a wlf amplitude 2 m fig 7c and d overall there existed a significant unimodal response of both diatom species richness and community dissimilarity along the gradient of wlf amplitude p 0 001 r2 0 86 and 0 69 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 hydrologic fluctuation and habitat changes the significant correlation between the documented water levels and the depth predicted through a spatial survey confirmed the reliability of our inference models in reconstructing water level history for the last two centuries fig 3 and fig s3 it has been recognized that the grain size distribution of clastic deposits in lakes can provide pivotal information on hydrological changes håkanson 1977 liu et al 2016 for example the water level fluctuation was well reflected by the silt and clay components of both surface and core sediments in lithological surveys punning et al 2006 despite that sub fossil indicators such as diatoms were widely applied to reconstruct the change of water depth within a lake or across lakes birks 2012 juggins and birks 2012 the interplay of multiple environmental stressors have been identified to impede the performance of water depth inference models in quantifying hydrological fluctuation due to their synergistic impact on lake biota telford and birks 2005 in comparison our application of sediment grain size is relatively straightforward in reflecting the lake level change due to the mechanistic link between hydrological fluctuation and sedimentation processes lópez et al 2016 the two century history of hydrological regime shifts reflected the conversion of a shallow lake to a deep water reservoir as a result of lake damming in the context of regional climate change the inferred mean water depth of haixi lake was consistently below 8 m with relatively limited variation 6 2 0 9 m when the lake was free flowing prior to 1957 wabd 2012 a decrease in median grain size and a moderate increase in clay inferred water depth fig 4a corresponded to a period of above average regional precipitation over the period of 1910 1940 fig s1 implying the impact of regional climate on natural hydrodynamics in this region chen et al 2004 while there existed a regional warming trajectory during the last six decades the occurrence of extreme drought around 2009 2013 led to a water level drop by 3 m in haixi synchronous with regional shrinkage of large lakes lü et al 2012 wu et al 2016 with the dam installment the mean water level 8 7 1 7 m increased significantly with a spike in the sand component shortly after 1957 this was further followed by higher water levels 13 6 2 6 m after the dam was enforced in 1990 wabd 2012 noticeably the initiation of dam construction and enforcement in 1957 and 1987 corresponded to a lower than average regional precipitation fig s1 respectively this may suggest that reduced water supply in the context of increasing catchment demand may have triggered hydrological regulation of lakes in this region as found in other areas hennig et al 2013 a strong variation in littoral habitats due to pronounced lake regulation can of be important ecological implication in structuring littoral communities schindler and scheuerell 2002 as the undulation of littoral area was strongly linked with the underwater morphometry dearing 1997 a consistent loss in littoral zones has been widely found in lakes that were converted to deeper reservoirs hellsten and riihimäki 1996 in haixi lake 90 of the modern macrophyte coverage was located in a water depth of 5 m and the littoral area i e water depth 5 m has displayed a significant loss with increased water depth fig s7 similarly an increase of water level by 1 7 m due to the installation of a sluice led to a swift drop of submerged vegetation coverage from 25 to 30 to 2 in a large shallow lake of eastern china kong et al 2017 conversely the water level drop after a sustained period of high waters may not lead to the recovery of submerged vegetation in shallow lakes havens et al 2005 4 2 biogeochemical cycling in response to hydrological regulation the artificially extended gradient of water depth in haixi lake has significantly impacted nutrient cycling over time the consistently low concentrations of tn fig 4 suggested that the lake was nutrient poor during the period of 1800 1957 reflecting low nutrient loadings from the catchment that were often found in this region ni and wang 2015 a moderate increase in sediment tn since the 1930s corresponded with an expanding population and agricultural development as recorded in other lakes of this study region li et al 2007 a further increase of bulk tn concentration occurred around the period of 1990 2013 fig 4a may be related to the moderate expansion of agricultural land and associated nutrient input since the 1980s fig s6 as well as a prolonged water residence time and reduced flow velocity after the construction of hydropower dams kawara et al 1998 in contrast the accumulation rate of sediment tn displayed a long term and significant decrease since 1957 possibly reflecting the dilution effect of increased water storage as there was a doubled increase in lake volume from 2 1 106 m3 in 1957 to 4 0 106 m3 for the last two decades fig s3 this dilution effect has clearly been found to exist in designing water level management for dammed lakes and reservoirs of north america christensen and maki 2015 lake level fluctuation is well documented to alter the carbon cycling and biogeochemical processes piovano et al 2004 woszczyk et al 2014 in consistent with the depth related spatial distribution across the lake basin fig 2 sediment toc concentration and c n ratio experienced a remarkable decrease with raised water levels over time fig 5 the lowest c n ratios in recent deposits reflect a greater contribution of algae derived organic matters that are high in nitrogen rich proteins and lipids as lake expansion was often associated with a decrease in c n ratio korosi et al 2017 the relatively large values of c n ratio and tic flux during 1840 1900 indicated a high input of catchment derived allochthonous materials fig 5e while the peak values in the c n ratio and carbon fluxes occurred around 1940 1957 when a minimum level of lake depth 5 m was found for the last two centuries fig 5e furthermore our results displayed that the burial and accumulation rate of oc are closely related to the gradient of water depth and associated limnological properties over time noticeably the accumulation rate of toc displayed a consistent decrease since the damming in 1957 with significantly lower fluxes observed for the dam enforcement stage than those during the pre damming stage fig 5d this temporal pattern contrasted strongly with an increasing rate of oc burial for northern lakes driven by regional warming and atmospheric deposition heathcote et al 2015 as well as a regional increase in toc storage in lakes across china due to intensifying land use wang et al 2015 our results may well reflect the role of lake depth in determining carbon burial processes as higher storage rates were often found in shallow lakes downing 2010 it has been estimated that the sediment oc burial could be more than doubled increased in reservoirs than that in natural lakes during the last few decades due to the consistent increase in the number of reservoirs cole et al 2007 while there existed an overall increase in sediment carbon burial rate after lake damming in 1957 fig 8 our results also showed that the toc flux was significantly reduced with higher water levels r 0 58 p 0 01 with a significant drop in the sediment carbon fluxes during the dam reinforcement stage simultaneously there was a significant decrease in both c n ratio and littoral habitats after 1990 reflecting the increased carbon utilization via aquatic carbon dioxide fixation baastrup spohr et al 2016 when compared to land derived oc these aquatic organic matters are characterized by high degradation rates and low sediment storage potentially causing stronger water atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases mendonça et al 2017 despite that the sediment content and flux of toc displayed a temporal trajectory that generally followed those of tic figs 4a and 5 the ratio between tic and toc fluxes was significantly elevated during the enforcement stage when compared to the previous two stages fig 8 this can partly be due to enhanced mineralization rate of oc and their transformation to inorganic carbon in stratified and anoxic waters with increasing water depth clayer et al 2016 as well as warmer climate during the last few decades gudasz et al 2010 as the various forms of inorganic carbon can easily release co2 bade 2009 the monitoring results have shown that greenhouse gas efflux to the atmosphere in reservoirs was about twice the magnitude of that in natural lakes st louis et al 2000 therefore the increased impoundment intensity and dominance of aquatic organic matters has significantly reduced sediment oc storage in our lake in the context of regional warming which more recently served as a new inorganic carbon source allowing for stronger greenhouse gas emission 4 3 temporal patterns of algal production and community shift the concurrent increase in chl a and tn concentrations suggested a greater lake production over time due to enhanced nutrient cycling and hydrological retention kaushal and binford 1999 meyers 2003 for example the algal production increased with rising water levels and expanded euphotic zone which was also reflected in a declining c n ratio the δ13corganic signal was significantly depleted with increasing impoundment intensity fig 4a inferring the increased input of autochthonous sources such as phytoplankton meyers and ishiwatari 1993 meanwhile there was a lack of significant link between sediment tn and chl a during 1810 1990 when lake level was below 10 m fig 5 this contrasting pattern in the nutrient biomass relationship among hydrological stages may well reflect the difference of hydrological processes such as mixing and flushing this was evident in a multi basin lake where sediment resuspension and nutrient release in shallow basins decoupled the nutrient biomass relationship zhang et al 2013 under the more nitrogen rich conditions as was the case for haixi lake table 1 moderate nutrient enrichment can enhance autochthonous om with enriched δ15n signal because of the dominance of non n2 fixing algae which discriminated against lighter isotopic signals meyers 1997 thus along the extended water depth gradient in haixi lake the stratigraphic changes in the δ13c and δ15n signals of om over the past two centuries may have been a result of increasing autochthonous om furey et al 2004 diatom community shift was well reflective of water level increase and enhanced thermal stratification during the pre disturbance stage of 1830 1930 the dominance of the small and planktonic cyclotella ocellata i e 50 suggested the existence of a turbulent and nutrient poor shallow system soylu et al 2007 with a continuous increase in water level from 1957 this species typically predated other sub dominant species during the temporal community succession confirming its high sensitivity to the change of thermal regime cremer and wagner 2003 padisák et al 2009 our modern surveys fig s1 showed the existence of thermal stratification in summer with raised water levels kling 1988 which would favor small fast growing planktonic diatoms such as cyclotella smol et al 2005 furthermore regional climate has warmed markedly in recent decades fig s1 often leading to a longer and stronger thermal stability wilhelm and adrian 2008 similarly the abundance of small cyclotella was strongly linked with mean air temperature r 0 58 p 0 007 for the last six decades in haixi lake diatom assemblages were also characterized by response to the damming related changes in nutrients benthic habitats and hydrological fluctuation fig 5 our sediment records revealed a synchronous change of f crotonensis with tn r 0 469 p 0 002 which was an indicator species in n rich waters macintyre et al 2009 similarly c comta displayed a gradual increase after 1980 with elevated tn as found in other studies chen et al 2012 the loss of littoral zones also likely played a role in structuring diatom assemblages leading to a gradual decrease in benthic diatoms fig 5b furthermore a moderate increase in a granulata was consistent with a significant increase in the magnitude of wlf since 1960 as this species is characterized by high sinking rates and competitive advantage in turbulent waters vieira et al 2008 noticeably a minutissima the subdominant benthic diatoms over the core was found to be more abundant after 1957 this species was known to grow favorably not only in the littoral zones laird et al 2011 but also can proliferate as epilithon over a long depth gradient i e up to 24 m in oligotrophic lakes with frequent water level fluctuation cantonati et al 2009 4 4 ecological shifts along the impoundment intensity gradient water depth and associated hydrological variables showed a stronger impact on diatom communities during the damming stage when compared to the pre disturbance and reinforcement stages fig 6 the loss in littoral habitats may have been triggered by lake damming geest et al 2005 li et al 2007 wang et al 2015 leading to a significant decrease in diatom species richness in haixi lake as found in spatial surveys of lake biota such as zooplankton gal et al 2013 and fish langer et al 2017 furthermore the break point analysis suggested a threshold depth of 10 8 m for diatom species richness which was consistent with the spatial surveys with a threshold depth of 9 0 m found in temperate lakes laird et al 2010 this water depth dependence of biodiversity patterns was also obvious in deeper lakes with stronger thermal resistance to water mixing longhi and beisner 2010 similarly there existed a significant decrease in community dissimilarity with the lake depth raised above 9 m fig 7b suggesting a higher degree of community stability and stronger ecological resistance to external stressors in this deep water environment wantzen et al 2008 accordingly a shift from benthic to planktonic pathway of energy flow was evidenced in the significant increase in algal production and a clear depletion of δ13corganic signals during the enforcement stage of this oligo mesotrophic lake fig 8 comparably this pattern was often found in shallow lakes with a regime shift to an algae dominated state with the loss of macrophytes due to eutrophication torres et al 2012 meanwhile there existed a significant decrease in the reconstructed littoral area 5 m depth that was strongly linked with macrophyte growth in response to expanding water depth over the last two centuries fig s7b while water level control has been found to enhance the role of nutrients in causing regime shifts in shallow lakes kong et al 2017 the expanded gradient of water depth alone may have shifted the ecological regime towards a phytoplankton dominated state in haixi lake after 1990 our results also revealed that wlfs can influence biodiversity under the theoretical framework of intermediate disturbance hypothesis modern surveys have shown that an intermediate level of hydrological disturbance could enhance the degree of community shift for aquatic biota such as macrophyte and phytoplankton elliott et al 2001 white et al 2008 li et al 2012b both diatom species richness and the degree of community shift was found to be higher under a moderate amplitude of water levels i e 2 m in haixi lake over time fig 7c and d corresponding well with experimental results casanova 1994 evtimova and donohue 2014 similarly an increased amplitude of wlf i e 2 m month in subtropical reservoirs played a negative impact on algal production yang et al 2016 and significantly affected phytoplankton structure yang et al 2017 while dam enforcement further deepened water levels and significantly altered limnological processes the amplitude of wlf after 1990 remained similar as that found for the damming stage fig 8 this may suggest an independent role of wlf magnitude in affecting community stability despite that the interaction between water depth and wlf may exist in shallow lakes evtimova and donohue 2016 while our sediment records were characterized by capturing an integrated signal of wlf and ecological changes beyond the seasonal variability long term monitoring data revealed that the annual mean variation in wlf was often greater than the monthly fluctuation evtimova and donohue 2016 therefore an implication for reservoir management derived from our study is that there may exist a threshold level for both water depth and the amplitude of wlf beyond which community stability and ecological state will be significantly altered over time with detrimental effects on biodiversity 5 conclusions in consistent with the documented events of hydrological regulation our sediment records revealed a two century history of a significant increase in lake levels with increasing impoundment intensity along an expanded gradient of lake depth a gradual loss of littoral zone and benthic diatoms over the last few decades was consistent with a significant depletion of δ13corganic signal suggesting a dominance of pelagic trophic pathway and autochthonous source in aquatic organic carbon transfer after 1990 despite that there was a significant increase in the algal production since 1990 the accumulation rate of toc displayed an accelerating decrease since 1957 reflecting a dilution effect derived from expanding water storage with a significant shift in lake ecological state after the dam enforcement the enhanced inorganic carbon burial coupled with strong degradation and low storage of aquatic organic matters can allow for stronger emission of greenhouse gases from this deep water reservoir while hydro morphological fluctuation impacted diatom community shift a further increase in water depth during the dam enforcement stage has significantly decreased diatom biodiversity and community heterogeneity when a threshold level in water depth or the wlf amplitude was reached meanwhile the nutrient and climate forcing showed an increasing interaction with hydrological variables in structuring diatom changes across the three hydrological stages therefore lake impoundment not only significantly regulated hydrological regime carbon cycling and algal shift over time but also enhanced the ecological role of

19192,natural wetlands are green infrastructure systems that are energy efficient for wastewater treatment and can be found in diverse geo environmental settings around the world their structure and functions which defines the treatment efficiencies are highly varied wetlands over shallow bedrock and geological lineaments weak zones have been known to contribute to groundwater contamination however not many studies have been performed to understand the structure in different geological settings to identify the efficiency determining factors therefore it is important to investigate the geological suitability of the natural wetlands we examined wastewater fed natural wetlands in diverse geological settings aiming at studying the depth geo stability bio chemical interactions and hydrogeological attributes that improve the wastewater quality within the musi river basin india the integrated geophysical scans encompassing electrical resistivity tomography ert hydrogeological test bathymetric study and hydro chemical analysis were carried out to explore the physical structure and hydro dynamic processes in the wetlands ert investigations showed that the depth to bedrock up to 20 25 m devoid of geo fractures lineaments indicated the effective depth of saturated zone as a passable scope for potential bio chemical interactions implying the proportionality of the deep seated deep bedrock wetland to the pollutant removal efficiency the lower order of electrical resistivity range 10 35 ωm and hydraulic conductivity 2 938 md 1 acquired for saturated weathered zone were found catalyzing the bioremediation sedimentation adsorption redox reactions and ion exchange processes it caused the deep seated wetland removing nitrate 194 34 kgd 1 97 18 sulphate 333 75 kgd 1

river southern india 1 introduction natural as well as constructed wetlands have been widely utilized as an alternative to conventional wastewater treatment systems across the world epa 2000 babatunde et al 2008 saeed et al 2012 adrados et al 2014 these energy efficient and environmental friendly natural systems have been adopted by communities quite successfully vymazal 2002 becares 2006 kalbar et al 2012 crites et al 2014 matamoros et al 2015 wetlands also have a great potential to treat the municipal wastewater and if the global estimates of 330 km3yr 1 can be treated effectively the savings on valuable freshwater resources could be enormous mateo sagasta et al 2015 thebo et al 2017 the growing concerns over use of untreated wastewater is global and is a reality as documented under many studies asia ensink et al 2002 miller robbie et al 2017 africa abdul ghaniyu et al 2002 south america jimenez 2008 global raschid sally and jakody 2008 additionally in resource poor low and middle income countries inadequate funds for financing the wastewater treatment infrastructure results in low quality water being discharged into the environment with the inadequate infrastructure to treat the wastewater in the developing world wetlands offer a promising alternative for treating wastewater more sustainably wri 2015 many types of natural wetlands have been described in the literature these are water hyacinth ponds duckweed ponds waste stabilization ponds wsp ex natural wetlands lemna ponds oxidation ponds and lagoons fish ponds algal bacterial ponds and polishing ponds of wastewater treatment plants wwtps arceivala and asolekar 2013 of these the most common systems are the natural wetlands which accounted for nearly 73 of the cases amerasinghe et al 2015 with the advantage of up to 82 removal efficiency for emerging contaminants without any aquatic risk matamoros et al 2015 natural wetlands are energy efficient they use natural energy and require low maintenance costs lin et al 2002 ran et al 2004 which are also easy for management ouyang et al 2015 and can function well in various climatic conditions lazareva and pichler 2010 and geological settings a typical wastewater fed natural wetland fig 1 can be categorized under lentic lacustrine ecosystems where the vertical cross sections from top to bottom indicate aerobic facultative and anaerobic zones with their corresponding functions the sludge rich in kaolinite clay organic matter at the bottom will act as a confining layer thus maintaining the thermal stability below this layer the clay minerals and organic matter have negatively charged sites on their surfaces which adsorb and hold positively charged ions cations by electrostatic force parfitt et al 1995 the adaptation of natural wetlands using engineering interventions are referred to as constructed wetlands cw a concept that was first discussed in australia 1904 and became widespread in the usa during the early 1970s cole 1998 however the treatment capacity of cws can vary seasonally due to the passive processes and it is known that effective removal of nitrogen is affected brtalik et al 2015 at the same time the cws when compared with the natural wetlands have relatively higher energy use pumps and labour intensive the quantitative treatment capacity of cws is also small to tackle large volumes of wastewater furthermore due to the smaller land footprint the habitat creation potential of cws is less compared to the larger natural wetland systems natural wetlands are found in a variety of settings with differences in geology hydrogeology vegetation water quality topography soil climate among others the natural wetlands are currently estimated to occupy around 8 6 million km2 6 4 of the global land surface about 4 8 million km2 of which are found in the tropics and sub tropics shine and klemm 1999 the pollutants removal efficiency of natural wetlands depends primarily on the physical structure and functional parameters the physical structure of wetlands can be mapped and characterized by using high resolution geophysical tools such as electrical resistivity methods van dam 2012 it is one of the emerging techniques of subsurface characterization which captures the natural resistivity of individual litho units which is based on the degree of moisture content chemical composition and temperature which in turn influences the bulk resistivity kibria and hossain 2012 the geological medium offers a unique opportunity to study and understand the structure of the near surface they provide decisive data to make on the geometry and characteristics of a source at shallow depth cardarelli and donno 2017 several geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity gravity and magnetic electromagnetic seismic etc have been established so far to decipher the shallow subsurface however the electrical resistivity methods are predominantly applied for its contrast and high resolution for visualizing the near surface stummer et al 2004 among the electrical resistivity methods electrical resistivity tomography ert is a multi electrode resistivity imaging system uhlemann et al 2017 with efficient 2d 3d inversion schemes where relatively complex structures at shallow subsurface can be mapped with high resolution the most reported field applications of 2d imaging have been based on different configurations of the electrode spread the wenner schlumberger configuration tejero et al 2002 is widely applied to acquire the depth information about 300 m below the surface although a number of geophysical studies on wetlands have previously been carried out for various objectives but to the best of our knowledge no research studies have been carried out to decipher the structural and functional parameters of wetlands to determine its geological suitability and efficiency for treating the wastewater since the structure and functions of a natural wetland system defines the efficiency of wastewater treatment and ecological engineers need to be aware that the wetlands beset over geological lineaments weak zones have known to contribute to the groundwater contamination thus it is important to investigate the geological suitability of the natural wetlands to understand the subsurface conditions for wastewater treatment this paper attempts to characterize the natural wetlands by utilizing a number of methods of which the ert method is a key component further the hydraulic properties including flow velocity and flow through cross section area of subsurface wetlands were characterized using hydrogeological tests we also evaluated the function of several naturally occurring wetlands further this study will benefit the ecological engineers and decision makers to evaluate the wastewater treatment capacities of a particular natural wetland system 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study site description the study was carried out in an area downstream of the musi river in telangana india where wastewater irrigation is a common practice fig 2 the musi river passes through the city of hyderabad collecting around 1200 million m3 mcm per day of untreated and partially treated wastewater which is a major input source for the peri urban wetlands mahesh et al 2015 around 15 km downstream musi river is diverted via a series of weirs to provide the water for irrigation these canals run parallel to the river and end in a lake or a network of canals providing water to sites away from the floodplain the downstream peri urban area has pockets of wetlands that spread over the landscape two natural wetlands wt 1 and wt 2 in the kachiwani singaram ks 2 8 km2 micro watershed were studied to understand the pollutant and nutrient removal efficiencies different crops such as paddy rice paragrass urochloa mutica and all types of leafy vegetables irrigated with wastewater surrounded these two wetlands fig 2 jacobi et al 2009 sonkamble et al 2018 fig 3 also depicts the irrigation canal and the feeder canals supplying wastewater to the agriculture lands the arrows indicate the movement of water flows in and around the wetlands an inlet and outlet points were identified for water flow measurements the topographic elevation of study area varied from 485 m to 459 m above mean sea level amsl with a gentle slope towards the south water quality was tested at both inlet and outlet points of the wetlands discharge measurements were carried out at the outlet using two methods namely volumetric method and mean section method the wastewater fed natural wetlands situated in a granitic terrain of varying degrees of saturation were studied for two hydrological years fig 2 the natural wetlands wt 1 and wt 2 were characterized by varying depths of bedrock hydrogeologically confined layer fig 3 the wt 1 4 5 ha comprised of a standing water column of 16 295 m3 and harbored predominantly grasses urochloa mutica and typha capensis with a submerged biomass around 18 kg m2 and discharge q rate of 1812 m3 day measured at the outlet fig 3e and f the wt 2 0 44 ha having similar features was also studied for pollutant removal efficiency fig 3b 2 2 integrated assessments an integrated assessment comprising electrical resistivity tomography ert hydrogeological and hydro chemical analysis was carried out to characterize and understand the functions of the naturally occurring wetlands we assessed the hydraulic properties and functional parameters which are at the very core of the treatment process 2 2 1 geophysical scanning the ert profiles calibrated with lithological physicochemical and geophysical log data were used to characterize the subsurface structure of the natural wetlands a total of nine ert profiles were carried out at nine different sites fig 2 to delineate the profiles of subsurface layers and saturated thickness on both vertical and lateral scale in the study site fig 2 syscal junior switch multi node computer controlled imaging system iris make france was used with 48 electrodes connected to a multi core cable for ert data collection wenner schlumberger and dipole dipole configurations were opted to scan the subsurface profile of lengths ranging from 96 to 470 m based on the availability of space with unit electrode spacing of 2 0 m 5 0 m for a target depth up to 45 m below the ground level bgl a continuous ert profile line covering ert numbers 1 2 3 4 7 and 8 of 1620 m length was chosen to decipher the spatial variations of the weathered thickness and saturated zone from north to the south direction covering the wt 1 fig 2 the software program res2dmod loke 1999 was used to calculate the apparent resistivity using the finite difference method for the wenner schlumberger and dipole dipole arrays and the inverse model resistivity sections are generated using least square inversion loke et al 2003 method the electrical resistivity ranges acquired for different subsurface layers were validated with the existing litho units at the exploratory bore well and the resistivity ranges obtained from ert 9 were validated with the bore hole lithologs at the well site p4 fig 2 and fig 4 in ert 9 the resistivity ranges for the top loose soil were 10 34 ω m and highly saturated weathered granite with resistivity 50 200 ω m up to a depth of 6 m followed by semi weathered zone 110 350 ω m at the depth 6 20 m fractured zone 350 700 ω m at the depth 22 28 m and the bedrock 700 1000 ω m below 28 m depth fig 4 the resistivity range at ert 9 validated for corresponding litho unit at p4 well site was integrated with the other ert sites to derive the dispositions of different litho layers on lateral and vertical scales further to improve the contrast within the subsurface layers we applied 2d laterally constrained inversion 2d lci model auken et al 2005 which enabled a layered 2d inversion with sharp layer boundaries as compared to the traditional smooth inversion types for the continuous resistivity data fig 5 the resistivity range obtained for corresponding litho units were standardized and integrated for other ert sections and the inverse model resistivity section of ert profile line fig 5a and 5b was transformed into lithological models fig 6 and fig 7 to distinguish the lateral and vertical variations at different locations 2 2 2 hydrogeological studies hydrogeological studies included well inventory surveys exploratory well p sampling and aquifer tests to understand the water holding porosity and transmitting permeability capabilities of the subsurface formations aquifers perrin et al 2010 under the well inventory survey water sampling sites were selected to represent site specific hydrogeological and environmental conditions within the ks micro watershed fig 2 subsurface hydrogeologic features such as top soil weathered saturated zone fractured zone and depth to bedrock were assessed using four bore wells p that were drilled in the site adjacent to the wetland sites additionally groundwater water levels were monitored at the piezometers using water level sounder model epp 10 6 encardio rite make on a monthly basis for two years may 2012 to may 2014 measurements of groundwater level were referenced to mean sea level to understand the spatial hydraulic gradient and dynamic nature of aquifer systems neuzil 1986 exploratory wells or piezometers were drilled at 4 locations p1 p2 p3 and p4 fig 2 using down the hole hammer dth technique to validate the hydrogeological geophysical attributes depth wise soil samples were collected to prepare the vertical lithological sections of the piezometers further aquifer test pumping tests neuman 1975 were performed at these four bore wells to derive the hydraulic conductivity groundwater flow rate through porous medium and transmissivity flow through cross sections area using theis 1935 method the hydraulic conductivity was calculated using the contribution of groundwater to the wetland wt 1 applying darcy s 1856 flow and hydraulic retention time on the removal of pollutants toet et al 2005 the rate at which groundwater flows horizontally through the cross section of an aquifer is referred to as transmissivity t m2d 1 thus understanding the hydrogeological dynamics such as groundwater flow rate hydraulic conductivity k through a unit cross section area of an aquifer b is an important feature of any wetland system based on these factors the groundwater contribution as discharge q to the wetland wt 1 can be calculated using darcy s 1856 law eq 1 1 q k a h l where q is discharge m3d 1 k is hydraulic conductivity md 1 negative symbol indicates water flows from higher to lower gradient a is a unit cross section area m2 of an aquifer and h l is hydraulic gradient wetland bathymetry and vegetation mapping are two commonly used lines of evidence for assessing the hydrologic and ecologic status of wetlands usgs 2005 in view of this the studies on wetland bathymetry included measurements of standing water column biomass kg calculation of submerged and surface vegetation wetland surface area and wetland discharge rate at the outlet were carried out for wt 1 further based on the water quality testing performed at the inlet and outlet points of the wetlands the potential to remove pollutants in wetland wt 1 was determined 2 2 3 hydro chemical analysis water samples were collected for hydro chemical studies at the wastewater canal as wetland inlet and at the individual outlet points of wt 1 and wt 2 the samples were collected in three one liter high density polyethylene plastic bottles which were pre cleaned with double distilled water and then three times with sampling water as given in apha 2005 samples were transported to the laboratory on the same day and preserved at 4 c in the laboratory for chemical analysis the water samples from source wastewater canal individual outlet points of the two wetlands and piezometers were collected with replication during the pre and post monsoon periods for one hydrological year 2012 2013 and analyzed for nutrients no3 so4 2 po4 2 and microbiological sulphate reducing bacteria total plate counts

characterize the wetland structure 3 1 1 wetland wt 1 wetlands play a number of ecological functions in the environment and natural water purification is one of them in each wetland type the physical characteristics determine the physico chemical and biological processes and hydrogeological dynamics the ert investigations at wt 1 showed that there were major variations in the resistivity distribution in the north to south direction for example the ert profiles 1 2 and 3 comprised a higher resistivity range 700 3000 ωm indicating a shallow bedrock 5 8 m depth fig 5 in contrast ert profiles 4 7 and 8 showed a relatively deep up to 25 m depth bedrock with a significant overburden of regolith saprolite fig 5a the individual ert images when arranged and visualized laterally improved the interpretive ability fig 5b it indicated a gradual increase in depth to bedrock from north to south although the ert images in fig 5a and 5b showed resistivity variations the electrical resistivity contrast was not explicitly resolved in the least square inversion models in order to resolve the resistivity contrast and demarcate the distinct litho units an advanced version of laterally constrained inversion lci model was generated where a sharp distinction between the regolith and the bedrock can be achieved fig 5c the resistivity ranges were first calibrated with the lithologs of exploratory well p4 which were found to be complementary and integrated well with the wetland physical structure fig 4 the resistivity recorded for the vertical layers of the wetland wt 1 were varied the resistivity ranges of 5 35 ωm 20 30 ωm 50 200 ωm 110 350 ωm 350 700 ωm were observed for the soil profile vertical variations top loose soil clay mud highly weathered granite layer semi weathered granite layer and the fractured zone respectively fig 5c the depth to bedrock massive granite recorded with high resistivity range 700 1000 ωm and above is deciphered at 20 25 m in the wt 1 wetland fig 5c this suggests the potential for interactions of natural thick soil layers with pollutants while passing through the interstices the natural clay or sandy clay layers being chemically active show potentiality to bind oppositely charged species or pollutants and precipitate and or transform into non harmful species it indicates the proportional relationship between deep seated deep bedrock wetlands and pollutant removal efficiency a shallow base rock was noted towards the extreme south of the ert profile line which gives a bowl shape to the wetland wt 1 fig 7 thus the geo electrical resistivity model fig 5 of ert profile line was transformed into a lithological model fig 7 by geophysical integration method in order to improve the understanding of the wetland wt 1 physical structure further the massive bedrock at 25 m depth that underlies the wt 1 with the absence of any geological fractures implies that it is geologically stable and isolated hydrogeological system makes it suitable for wastewater treatment fig 7 3 1 2 wetland wt 2 the geophysical scanning ert 6 of wt 2 was transformed from geo electrical resistivity model fig 6a to a lithological model fig 6b by geophysical integration method it showed that the saturated overburden including semi weathered and fractured zone with resistivity varying from 5 ωm to 500 ωm up to 10 13 m depth fig 6a and b the depth to bedrock massive granite is met below 13 15 m with a resistivity of 700 ωm and above in comparison with wt 1 the wt 2 has shallow bedrock and holds relatively less scope for bio geochemical reactions and hydrogeological dynamics as evidenced by its pollutant removal efficiency further the shallow bedrock reduces its hydrogeological retention time and therefore is less efficient for pollutant removal 3 2 hydrogeological characterization of deep seated wetland the duration and frequency of saturation or inundation of a site vary according to hydrogeologic setting regional differences in physiography climate and antecedent moisture conditions wetlands are either the result of surface flooding or outcroppings of the water table which is also the top of the saturated zone where pore pressure equals atmospheric pressure freeze and cherry 1979 therefore hydrogeological dynamics bathymetry and mechanism of pollutant reduction are essential in order to characterize the wastewater fed wetlands 3 2 1 hydrogeological attributes and bathymetric studies for wt 1 the hydrogeological parameters were derived using an aquifer test at the exploratory well p2 fig 2 and consequently the discharge q gw groundwater contribution to the wetland the values obtained for k 2 9373 md 1 a 3500 m2 25 m depth x 140 m width h 55 m 485 430 m where 485 m is the piezometric head upstream and 430 m is the bedrock elevation l 1375 m length of the groundwater flow path fig 7 were applied to eq 1 to calculate the groundwater contribution q gw to the wetland wt 1 as follows q gw 2 9373 3500 55 1375 q gw 411 22 m3d 1 the outlet discharge q out of wt 1 was measured by bathymetric studies involving a volumetric method q 1728 09 m3d 1 fig 3e and mean section method q 1897 05 m3d 1 fig 3f dingman 1993 optimization resulted in the following q out as 1812 57 m3d 1 which includes wastewater q ww and groundwater q gw thus it can be written as 2 q o u t q w w q g w to derive wastewater contribution to the wt 1 we apply 3 q w w q o u t q g w q ww 1812 57 411 22 q ww 1401 35 m3d 1 considering the annual potential evapotranspiration pet loss at the rate of 20 cwc 2006 for the standing water v 16 295 m3 measured by standard bathymetric study is 8 92 m3d 1 in the wetland the distributed ratio of ep 8 92 to q ww and q gw are 6 89 m3 and 2 03 m3 respectively q ww 1401 35 pet thus adding the pet value 6 89 m3d 1 to q ww we get daily wastewater contribution to wt 1 as below q ww 1401 35 6 89 m3d 1 q ww 1408 24 m3d 1 now the derived volume of wastewater contribution q ww 1408 24 m3d 1 to wt 1 can be related to the quantity of pollutants load removed in the wetland wt 1 on a daily basis in view of water level dynamics the periodic monitoring of groundwater level from four piezometers p1 p2 p3 and p4 for the two year period may 2012 to may 2014 indicated that the p4 site was an isolated hydrogeological system with varying water levels fig s1 also there is a significant variations observed between the p2 near wt 2 and p3 near wt 1 indicating two isolated hydrogeological systems this implies that there is no hydraulic connectivity or no geological lineaments it confirms that the systems are hydrogeologically suitable geologically stable and fit for designating the wetlands as wastewater treatment systems since the wt 1 is situated over deep 25 m bedrock a higher fluctuation in water levels in p1 was recorded 1 2 4 0 m below ground level bgl during may 2013 to november 2013 period however the piezometer p2 indicated shallow water levels with low fluctuations up to 0 8 m fig s1 it implies that the deep seated wetland wt 1 is situated over an isolated aquifer system and has more scope for fluid circulation with elevated aquifer dynamics enabling enhanced wastewater treatment 3 3 pollution reduction in wetlands 3 3 1 dissolved oxygen bod and cod a significant gain up to 5 ppm in dissolved oxygen do was recorded in wt 1 area fig 8 c and 1 0 ppm in untreated wastewater from the canal which is a source of wastewater to both the wetlands in contrast to wt 1 the wt 2 is observed with maximum do up to 5 8 ppm on temporal scale the overall trend of do shows the considerable variations in both the wetlands however higher records of do and the mean value in wt 2 could be attributed to the shallow basement and thin column 1 m of standing water which promotes higher dissolution of oxygen with air water interactions the oxygen inputs to wetland occurs from two sources viz mass transfer of oxygen as air water interface and partly from oxygen co produced during algal photosynthesis the lab simulated studies by asolekar and langote 2004 shows that the flux of oxygen across the air water interface is koxy 1 10 5 ms 1 at 25 c temperature and may be sufficient to meet the full requirement further algae need excess co2 which can be met from the bacterial release of co2 during biodegradation of sediment organic matter and litter ouyang and guo 2016 thus there is symbiosis between algae and bacteria on a weight basis the oxygen production is 1 3 times the algal production eq 4 which could also be valuable in meeting the bod requirements of the wastewater arceivala and asolekar 2013 oxygen production occurs concurrently with algal production in accordance with the following equation 4 106 c o 2 16 n o 3 h p o 4 122 h 2 o 18 h c 106 h 263 o 110 n 16 p 1 138 o 2 algae 1 oxygen 1 3 considerable reduction in bod and cod up to 80 and 80 respectively in wt 1 and 74 58 and 73 33 respectively were observed in wt 2 fig 8a and b the significant reduction in bod and cod in wt 1 could be attributed to two stages in the aerobic process at shallow 3 m depth and anaerobic process at deeper zones below 3 0 m depth through gasification the microbes involved in methanogenesis help in the degradation of organic material and reduce bod levels especially when the temperatures are higher than 18 c arceivala and asolekar 2013 this indicates that when bod levels are high the bacteria in the deep wetlands continue to degrade the organic matter and lowering the levels of bod by 80 fig 8a the experimental studies indicate that efficiency of bod and cod reduction can be improved up to 90 by increasing the column height of a constructed wetland zurita et al 2009 at the shallow end of the wt 1 which consists of a variety of plant species with deep penetrating roots 150 180 cm delays the wastewater passage which in turn increases the retention time enhancing the pollutant removal efficiencies ponds with water columns of 3 5 m have advantages over shallow wetlands in terms of bod removal efficiency especially in warm climates tropical countries where the continuous existence of anaerobic layers at the lower levels which can promote significant bod reduction through gasification 3 3 2 nitrate nitrate contamination of water can lead to serious health and environmental consequences the denitrification processes were able to reduce the no3 concentrations from untreated wastewater indicating the removal efficiency of 97 18 wt 1 142 mg l to 4 mg l and 93 66 in wt 1 and wt 2 respectively table 1 the no3 removal capacity of the wt 1 is 194 34 kgd 1 table 1 as given in the literature bastviken 2006 kadlec 2012 crites et al 2014 the nitrate removal in natural wetlands may be as follows as in the top 1 m of the column there is nitrification of ammonium present leading to an increase in nitrate concentration but as there is depletion of oxygen in the subsequent depth of the column the denitrification of nitrates starts and thus at higher hydraulic loading rate nitrification and denitrification activities shifts deeper down in the aquifer column the deeper bedrock also offers greater stability in temperature for efficient bio chemical dynamics moreover the temperature stability on vertical scale of the wetland the ponds situated over deep bedrock deep seated ponds would exhibit greater temperature stability and more efficient for bio chemical dynamics 3 3 3 sulphate the sulphate reducing bacteria srb which is an anaerobe that uses sulphate as a terminal electron acceptor and gives off hydrogen sulphide h2s and co2 as waste product as shown in eq 5 5 c h 2 o 6 6 h 3 s o 4 2 s r b 3 h 2 s 6 h 2 o 6 c o 2 in the wt 1 removal efficiency of sulphate from wastewater was 77 70 305 mg l to 68 mg l whereas the wt 2 efficiency was at 35 73 table 1 the sulphate removal capacity of wt 1 with the wastewater discharge q ww 1408 24 m3 d was recorded as 398 89 kgd 1 the microbiological analysis results indicated that the presence of srb in wt 1 and its absence in wt 2 table 1 implying that there could be other processes involved in the sulphate removal in wt 2 since the srb grows in anaerobic conditions the deep seated wetlands benefit by their presence 3 3 4 phosphorous the phosphorus removal was noted more effective in vertical flows zurita et al 2009 and also reducing the substrate size which increases the contact surface and allows the wastewater to move slower through the finer media promoting the phosphorus removal by chemical adsorption in wt 1 case the phosphate reduction was from 8 30 mg l to 1 45 mg l with a removal capacity of 82 53 from the total wastewater q ww 1408 24 m3 d was 9 66 kgd 1 table 1 where the major reducing factor could be plant uptake as recorded by the field measurements of the biomass vegetation weighing 28 3 kgm 2 in the wt 1 fig 3a the rapid growth of vegetation in wetlands suggests that the phosphorous removal by plant uptake might be higher than the adsorption kadlec and knight 1996 the phosphorous removal efficiency in wt 1 was found to be 82 53 whereas for wt 2 it was recorded as 77 12 table 1 3 3 5 microorganisms the microbiological parameters including the total plate counts coliforms and faecal coliforms were reported in the untreated wastewater with their concentration values as 72 73 105 cfu ml 1 1 105 cfu ml and 1 6 103 per 100 ml respectively the deep wetlands hold greater potential for thermal stability increased detention time mixing pattern which enhances the bacterial die off rates through any antagonistic activity in wt 1 the pathogen removal was in the order of 99 56 99 99 whereas in the shallow wetland wt 2 removal efficiency was 96 90 99 62 table 1 3 4 strategies for designating the natural wetlands as treatments systems the study shows that hydro geophysical studies can be used to characterize the wetlands and when coupled with physio chemical analysis of water it helps to understand the overall treatment potential of a wetland therefore such studies can be useful in environmental impact assessments eia to decide if natural wetlands could be suitable for treatment of wastewater natural wetlands with the following characteristics can be useful for wastewater treatment a wetlands situated over deep bedrock or any hydrogeological confining layer such as clay compact sandstone or aquifuge devoid of any fractures or fissures or any other geological weak features to avoid any contaminant transport to longer distances are suitable for wastewater treatment b a single or isolated aquifer system characterized with a thick weathered zone low hydraulic conductivity and high retention time c specific capacity for hydraulic loading rates and pollutant removal efficiency d wetlands situated in flat or gentle topography and not on steep slopes seismic prone zones or close to the drinking water sources numerous natural wetlands exist along the musi river basin as well as other major river basins like the ganges and yamuna in northern india and several other cases across the globe which can be effectively utilized for wastewater treatment by adopting the criteria presented in the paper this novel approach can be utilized to characterize natural wetlands and to decipher its treatment potential 4 conclusions natural wetlands and their potential to treat polluted water have not been studied in depth as such the dynamics of physical chemical and biological attributes are poorly understood and under investigated nature provides a vast array of wetlands that are small such as those studied here and entire flood plains and large coastal wetlands that could be utilized for wastewater treatment in a systematic way for this each wetland has to be characterized against the anticipated treatment potential and this study shows a novel way to address it the integrated geophysical and hydrogeological scans of wastewater fed natural wetlands were useful to determine the structure and function and to establish the efficiency determining factors that enhance wastewater treatment the lower order of electrical resistivity ρ 10 35 ωm observed in the soil aquifer zone weathered zone with a hydraulic conductivity k of 2 938 md 1 shows that the pollutant removal efficiency is higher in deep seated wetlands the geophysical scans of the wetlands indicate that the wetlands studied were geologically stable with deep bedrock isolated hydrogeological systems and devoid of any geological lineaments such as fractures they catalyze the bio chemical interactions that enhance the wastewater treatment further the pollutant removal processes were determined as bioremediation sedimentation adsorption redox reactions and ion exchange reactions with removal efficiencies for nutrients up to 97 00 microbes up to 99 99 and organic content up to 80 00 in the deep seated wetland wt 1 the shallow wetland wt 2 had relatively reduced efficiency for pollutant removal owing to its shorter longitudinal section and lower hydraulic retention time this study shows that the natural wetlands have the potential to remove pollutants effectively however scientific studies are required to elucidate if such processes impact the groundwater system long term wastewater treatment can also bring about biotic changes that can impact treatment efficiency these changes can lead to the degradation of natural wetlands and restoration has to be part of the planning process the hydro geophysical parameters found in the natural wetlands can be used to design constructed wetlands to enhance pollutant removal capacity acknowledgements the study was a part of saph pani project www saphpani eu sponsored by the european union within the

19192,natural wetlands are green infrastructure systems that are energy efficient for wastewater treatment and can be found in diverse geo environmental settings around the world their structure and functions which defines the treatment efficiencies are highly varied wetlands over shallow bedrock and geological lineaments weak zones have been known to contribute to groundwater contamination however not many studies have been performed to understand the structure in different geological settings to identify the efficiency determining factors therefore it is important to investigate the geological suitability of the natural wetlands we examined wastewater fed natural wetlands in diverse geological settings aiming at studying the depth geo stability bio chemical interactions and hydrogeological attributes that improve the wastewater quality within the musi river basin india the integrated geophysical scans encompassing electrical resistivity tomography ert hydrogeological test bathymetric study and hydro chemical analysis were carried out to explore the physical structure and hydro dynamic processes in the wetlands ert investigations showed that the depth to bedrock up to 20 25 m devoid of geo fractures lineaments indicated the effective depth of saturated zone as a passable scope for potential bio chemical interactions implying the proportionality of the deep seated deep bedrock wetland to the pollutant removal efficiency the lower order of electrical resistivity range 10 35 ωm and hydraulic conductivity 2 938 md 1 acquired for saturated weathered zone were found catalyzing the bioremediation sedimentation adsorption redox reactions and ion exchange processes it caused the deep seated wetland removing nitrate 194 34 kgd 1 97 18 sulphate 333 75 kgd 1

river southern india 1 introduction natural as well as constructed wetlands have been widely utilized as an alternative to conventional wastewater treatment systems across the world epa 2000 babatunde et al 2008 saeed et al 2012 adrados et al 2014 these energy efficient and environmental friendly natural systems have been adopted by communities quite successfully vymazal 2002 becares 2006 kalbar et al 2012 crites et al 2014 matamoros et al 2015 wetlands also have a great potential to treat the municipal wastewater and if the global estimates of 330 km3yr 1 can be treated effectively the savings on valuable freshwater resources could be enormous mateo sagasta et al 2015 thebo et al 2017 the growing concerns over use of untreated wastewater is global and is a reality as documented under many studies asia ensink et al 2002 miller robbie et al 2017 africa abdul ghaniyu et al 2002 south america jimenez 2008 global raschid sally and jakody 2008 additionally in resource poor low and middle income countries inadequate funds for financing the wastewater treatment infrastructure results in low quality water being discharged into the environment with the inadequate infrastructure to treat the wastewater in the developing world wetlands offer a promising alternative for treating wastewater more sustainably wri 2015 many types of natural wetlands have been described in the literature these are water hyacinth ponds duckweed ponds waste stabilization ponds wsp ex natural wetlands lemna ponds oxidation ponds and lagoons fish ponds algal bacterial ponds and polishing ponds of wastewater treatment plants wwtps arceivala and asolekar 2013 of these the most common systems are the natural wetlands which accounted for nearly 73 of the cases amerasinghe et al 2015 with the advantage of up to 82 removal efficiency for emerging contaminants without any aquatic risk matamoros et al 2015 natural wetlands are energy efficient they use natural energy and require low maintenance costs lin et al 2002 ran et al 2004 which are also easy for management ouyang et al 2015 and can function well in various climatic conditions lazareva and pichler 2010 and geological settings a typical wastewater fed natural wetland fig 1 can be categorized under lentic lacustrine ecosystems where the vertical cross sections from top to bottom indicate aerobic facultative and anaerobic zones with their corresponding functions the sludge rich in kaolinite clay organic matter at the bottom will act as a confining layer thus maintaining the thermal stability below this layer the clay minerals and organic matter have negatively charged sites on their surfaces which adsorb and hold positively charged ions cations by electrostatic force parfitt et al 1995 the adaptation of natural wetlands using engineering interventions are referred to as constructed wetlands cw a concept that was first discussed in australia 1904 and became widespread in the usa during the early 1970s cole 1998 however the treatment capacity of cws can vary seasonally due to the passive processes and it is known that effective removal of nitrogen is affected brtalik et al 2015 at the same time the cws when compared with the natural wetlands have relatively higher energy use pumps and labour intensive the quantitative treatment capacity of cws is also small to tackle large volumes of wastewater furthermore due to the smaller land footprint the habitat creation potential of cws is less compared to the larger natural wetland systems natural wetlands are found in a variety of settings with differences in geology hydrogeology vegetation water quality topography soil climate among others the natural wetlands are currently estimated to occupy around 8 6 million km2 6 4 of the global land surface about 4 8 million km2 of which are found in the tropics and sub tropics shine and klemm 1999 the pollutants removal efficiency of natural wetlands depends primarily on the physical structure and functional parameters the physical structure of wetlands can be mapped and characterized by using high resolution geophysical tools such as electrical resistivity methods van dam 2012 it is one of the emerging techniques of subsurface characterization which captures the natural resistivity of individual litho units which is based on the degree of moisture content chemical composition and temperature which in turn influences the bulk resistivity kibria and hossain 2012 the geological medium offers a unique opportunity to study and understand the structure of the near surface they provide decisive data to make on the geometry and characteristics of a source at shallow depth cardarelli and donno 2017 several geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity gravity and magnetic electromagnetic seismic etc have been established so far to decipher the shallow subsurface however the electrical resistivity methods are predominantly applied for its contrast and high resolution for visualizing the near surface stummer et al 2004 among the electrical resistivity methods electrical resistivity tomography ert is a multi electrode resistivity imaging system uhlemann et al 2017 with efficient 2d 3d inversion schemes where relatively complex structures at shallow subsurface can be mapped with high resolution the most reported field applications of 2d imaging have been based on different configurations of the electrode spread the wenner schlumberger configuration tejero et al 2002 is widely applied to acquire the depth information about 300 m below the surface although a number of geophysical studies on wetlands have previously been carried out for various objectives but to the best of our knowledge no research studies have been carried out to decipher the structural and functional parameters of wetlands to determine its geological suitability and efficiency for treating the wastewater since the structure and functions of a natural wetland system defines the efficiency of wastewater treatment and ecological engineers need to be aware that the wetlands beset over geological lineaments weak zones have known to contribute to the groundwater contamination thus it is important to investigate the geological suitability of the natural wetlands to understand the subsurface conditions for wastewater treatment this paper attempts to characterize the natural wetlands by utilizing a number of methods of which the ert method is a key component further the hydraulic properties including flow velocity and flow through cross section area of subsurface wetlands were characterized using hydrogeological tests we also evaluated the function of several naturally occurring wetlands further this study will benefit the ecological engineers and decision makers to evaluate the wastewater treatment capacities of a particular natural wetland system 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study site description the study was carried out in an area downstream of the musi river in telangana india where wastewater irrigation is a common practice fig 2 the musi river passes through the city of hyderabad collecting around 1200 million m3 mcm per day of untreated and partially treated wastewater which is a major input source for the peri urban wetlands mahesh et al 2015 around 15 km downstream musi river is diverted via a series of weirs to provide the water for irrigation these canals run parallel to the river and end in a lake or a network of canals providing water to sites away from the floodplain the downstream peri urban area has pockets of wetlands that spread over the landscape two natural wetlands wt 1 and wt 2 in the kachiwani singaram ks 2 8 km2 micro watershed were studied to understand the pollutant and nutrient removal efficiencies different crops such as paddy rice paragrass urochloa mutica and all types of leafy vegetables irrigated with wastewater surrounded these two wetlands fig 2 jacobi et al 2009 sonkamble et al 2018 fig 3 also depicts the irrigation canal and the feeder canals supplying wastewater to the agriculture lands the arrows indicate the movement of water flows in and around the wetlands an inlet and outlet points were identified for water flow measurements the topographic elevation of study area varied from 485 m to 459 m above mean sea level amsl with a gentle slope towards the south water quality was tested at both inlet and outlet points of the wetlands discharge measurements were carried out at the outlet using two methods namely volumetric method and mean section method the wastewater fed natural wetlands situated in a granitic terrain of varying degrees of saturation were studied for two hydrological years fig 2 the natural wetlands wt 1 and wt 2 were characterized by varying depths of bedrock hydrogeologically confined layer fig 3 the wt 1 4 5 ha comprised of a standing water column of 16 295 m3 and harbored predominantly grasses urochloa mutica and typha capensis with a submerged biomass around 18 kg m2 and discharge q rate of 1812 m3 day measured at the outlet fig 3e and f the wt 2 0 44 ha having similar features was also studied for pollutant removal efficiency fig 3b 2 2 integrated assessments an integrated assessment comprising electrical resistivity tomography ert hydrogeological and hydro chemical analysis was carried out to characterize and understand the functions of the naturally occurring wetlands we assessed the hydraulic properties and functional parameters which are at the very core of the treatment process 2 2 1 geophysical scanning the ert profiles calibrated with lithological physicochemical and geophysical log data were used to characterize the subsurface structure of the natural wetlands a total of nine ert profiles were carried out at nine different sites fig 2 to delineate the profiles of subsurface layers and saturated thickness on both vertical and lateral scale in the study site fig 2 syscal junior switch multi node computer controlled imaging system iris make france was used with 48 electrodes connected to a multi core cable for ert data collection wenner schlumberger and dipole dipole configurations were opted to scan the subsurface profile of lengths ranging from 96 to 470 m based on the availability of space with unit electrode spacing of 2 0 m 5 0 m for a target depth up to 45 m below the ground level bgl a continuous ert profile line covering ert numbers 1 2 3 4 7 and 8 of 1620 m length was chosen to decipher the spatial variations of the weathered thickness and saturated zone from north to the south direction covering the wt 1 fig 2 the software program res2dmod loke 1999 was used to calculate the apparent resistivity using the finite difference method for the wenner schlumberger and dipole dipole arrays and the inverse model resistivity sections are generated using least square inversion loke et al 2003 method the electrical resistivity ranges acquired for different subsurface layers were validated with the existing litho units at the exploratory bore well and the resistivity ranges obtained from ert 9 were validated with the bore hole lithologs at the well site p4 fig 2 and fig 4 in ert 9 the resistivity ranges for the top loose soil were 10 34 ω m and highly saturated weathered granite with resistivity 50 200 ω m up to a depth of 6 m followed by semi weathered zone 110 350 ω m at the depth 6 20 m fractured zone 350 700 ω m at the depth 22 28 m and the bedrock 700 1000 ω m below 28 m depth fig 4 the resistivity range at ert 9 validated for corresponding litho unit at p4 well site was integrated with the other ert sites to derive the dispositions of different litho layers on lateral and vertical scales further to improve the contrast within the subsurface layers we applied 2d laterally constrained inversion 2d lci model auken et al 2005 which enabled a layered 2d inversion with sharp layer boundaries as compared to the traditional smooth inversion types for the continuous resistivity data fig 5 the resistivity range obtained for corresponding litho units were standardized and integrated for other ert sections and the inverse model resistivity section of ert profile line fig 5a and 5b was transformed into lithological models fig 6 and fig 7 to distinguish the lateral and vertical variations at different locations 2 2 2 hydrogeological studies hydrogeological studies included well inventory surveys exploratory well p sampling and aquifer tests to understand the water holding porosity and transmitting permeability capabilities of the subsurface formations aquifers perrin et al 2010 under the well inventory survey water sampling sites were selected to represent site specific hydrogeological and environmental conditions within the ks micro watershed fig 2 subsurface hydrogeologic features such as top soil weathered saturated zone fractured zone and depth to bedrock were assessed using four bore wells p that were drilled in the site adjacent to the wetland sites additionally groundwater water levels were monitored at the piezometers using water level sounder model epp 10 6 encardio rite make on a monthly basis for two years may 2012 to may 2014 measurements of groundwater level were referenced to mean sea level to understand the spatial hydraulic gradient and dynamic nature of aquifer systems neuzil 1986 exploratory wells or piezometers were drilled at 4 locations p1 p2 p3 and p4 fig 2 using down the hole hammer dth technique to validate the hydrogeological geophysical attributes depth wise soil samples were collected to prepare the vertical lithological sections of the piezometers further aquifer test pumping tests neuman 1975 were performed at these four bore wells to derive the hydraulic conductivity groundwater flow rate through porous medium and transmissivity flow through cross sections area using theis 1935 method the hydraulic conductivity was calculated using the contribution of groundwater to the wetland wt 1 applying darcy s 1856 flow and hydraulic retention time on the removal of pollutants toet et al 2005 the rate at which groundwater flows horizontally through the cross section of an aquifer is referred to as transmissivity t m2d 1 thus understanding the hydrogeological dynamics such as groundwater flow rate hydraulic conductivity k through a unit cross section area of an aquifer b is an important feature of any wetland system based on these factors the groundwater contribution as discharge q to the wetland wt 1 can be calculated using darcy s 1856 law eq 1 1 q k a h l where q is discharge m3d 1 k is hydraulic conductivity md 1 negative symbol indicates water flows from higher to lower gradient a is a unit cross section area m2 of an aquifer and h l is hydraulic gradient wetland bathymetry and vegetation mapping are two commonly used lines of evidence for assessing the hydrologic and ecologic status of wetlands usgs 2005 in view of this the studies on wetland bathymetry included measurements of standing water column biomass kg calculation of submerged and surface vegetation wetland surface area and wetland discharge rate at the outlet were carried out for wt 1 further based on the water quality testing performed at the inlet and outlet points of the wetlands the potential to remove pollutants in wetland wt 1 was determined 2 2 3 hydro chemical analysis water samples were collected for hydro chemical studies at the wastewater canal as wetland inlet and at the individual outlet points of wt 1 and wt 2 the samples were collected in three one liter high density polyethylene plastic bottles which were pre cleaned with double distilled water and then three times with sampling water as given in apha 2005 samples were transported to the laboratory on the same day and preserved at 4 c in the laboratory for chemical analysis the water samples from source wastewater canal individual outlet points of the two wetlands and piezometers were collected with replication during the pre and post monsoon periods for one hydrological year 2012 2013 and analyzed for nutrients no3 so4 2 po4 2 and microbiological sulphate reducing bacteria total plate counts

characterize the wetland structure 3 1 1 wetland wt 1 wetlands play a number of ecological functions in the environment and natural water purification is one of them in each wetland type the physical characteristics determine the physico chemical and biological processes and hydrogeological dynamics the ert investigations at wt 1 showed that there were major variations in the resistivity distribution in the north to south direction for example the ert profiles 1 2 and 3 comprised a higher resistivity range 700 3000 ωm indicating a shallow bedrock 5 8 m depth fig 5 in contrast ert profiles 4 7 and 8 showed a relatively deep up to 25 m depth bedrock with a significant overburden of regolith saprolite fig 5a the individual ert images when arranged and visualized laterally improved the interpretive ability fig 5b it indicated a gradual increase in depth to bedrock from north to south although the ert images in fig 5a and 5b showed resistivity variations the electrical resistivity contrast was not explicitly resolved in the least square inversion models in order to resolve the resistivity contrast and demarcate the distinct litho units an advanced version of laterally constrained inversion lci model was generated where a sharp distinction between the regolith and the bedrock can be achieved fig 5c the resistivity ranges were first calibrated with the lithologs of exploratory well p4 which were found to be complementary and integrated well with the wetland physical structure fig 4 the resistivity recorded for the vertical layers of the wetland wt 1 were varied the resistivity ranges of 5 35 ωm 20 30 ωm 50 200 ωm 110 350 ωm 350 700 ωm were observed for the soil profile vertical variations top loose soil clay mud highly weathered granite layer semi weathered granite layer and the fractured zone respectively fig 5c the depth to bedrock massive granite recorded with high resistivity range 700 1000 ωm and above is deciphered at 20 25 m in the wt 1 wetland fig 5c this suggests the potential for interactions of natural thick soil layers with pollutants while passing through the interstices the natural clay or sandy clay layers being chemically active show potentiality to bind oppositely charged species or pollutants and precipitate and or transform into non harmful species it indicates the proportional relationship between deep seated deep bedrock wetlands and pollutant removal efficiency a shallow base rock was noted towards the extreme south of the ert profile line which gives a bowl shape to the wetland wt 1 fig 7 thus the geo electrical resistivity model fig 5 of ert profile line was transformed into a lithological model fig 7 by geophysical integration method in order to improve the understanding of the wetland wt 1 physical structure further the massive bedrock at 25 m depth that underlies the wt 1 with the absence of any geological fractures implies that it is geologically stable and isolated hydrogeological system makes it suitable for wastewater treatment fig 7 3 1 2 wetland wt 2 the geophysical scanning ert 6 of wt 2 was transformed from geo electrical resistivity model fig 6a to a lithological model fig 6b by geophysical integration method it showed that the saturated overburden including semi weathered and fractured zone with resistivity varying from 5 ωm to 500 ωm up to 10 13 m depth fig 6a and b the depth to bedrock massive granite is met below 13 15 m with a resistivity of 700 ωm and above in comparison with wt 1 the wt 2 has shallow bedrock and holds relatively less scope for bio geochemical reactions and hydrogeological dynamics as evidenced by its pollutant removal efficiency further the shallow bedrock reduces its hydrogeological retention time and therefore is less efficient for pollutant removal 3 2 hydrogeological characterization of deep seated wetland the duration and frequency of saturation or inundation of a site vary according to hydrogeologic setting regional differences in physiography climate and antecedent moisture conditions wetlands are either the result of surface flooding or outcroppings of the water table which is also the top of the saturated zone where pore pressure equals atmospheric pressure freeze and cherry 1979 therefore hydrogeological dynamics bathymetry and mechanism of pollutant reduction are essential in order to characterize the wastewater fed wetlands 3 2 1 hydrogeological attributes and bathymetric studies for wt 1 the hydrogeological parameters were derived using an aquifer test at the exploratory well p2 fig 2 and consequently the discharge q gw groundwater contribution to the wetland the values obtained for k 2 9373 md 1 a 3500 m2 25 m depth x 140 m width h 55 m 485 430 m where 485 m is the piezometric head upstream and 430 m is the bedrock elevation l 1375 m length of the groundwater flow path fig 7 were applied to eq 1 to calculate the groundwater contribution q gw to the wetland wt 1 as follows q gw 2 9373 3500 55 1375 q gw 411 22 m3d 1 the outlet discharge q out of wt 1 was measured by bathymetric studies involving a volumetric method q 1728 09 m3d 1 fig 3e and mean section method q 1897 05 m3d 1 fig 3f dingman 1993 optimization resulted in the following q out as 1812 57 m3d 1 which includes wastewater q ww and groundwater q gw thus it can be written as 2 q o u t q w w q g w to derive wastewater contribution to the wt 1 we apply 3 q w w q o u t q g w q ww 1812 57 411 22 q ww 1401 35 m3d 1 considering the annual potential evapotranspiration pet loss at the rate of 20 cwc 2006 for the standing water v 16 295 m3 measured by standard bathymetric study is 8 92 m3d 1 in the wetland the distributed ratio of ep 8 92 to q ww and q gw are 6 89 m3 and 2 03 m3 respectively q ww 1401 35 pet thus adding the pet value 6 89 m3d 1 to q ww we get daily wastewater contribution to wt 1 as below q ww 1401 35 6 89 m3d 1 q ww 1408 24 m3d 1 now the derived volume of wastewater contribution q ww 1408 24 m3d 1 to wt 1 can be related to the quantity of pollutants load removed in the wetland wt 1 on a daily basis in view of water level dynamics the periodic monitoring of groundwater level from four piezometers p1 p2 p3 and p4 for the two year period may 2012 to may 2014 indicated that the p4 site was an isolated hydrogeological system with varying water levels fig s1 also there is a significant variations observed between the p2 near wt 2 and p3 near wt 1 indicating two isolated hydrogeological systems this implies that there is no hydraulic connectivity or no geological lineaments it confirms that the systems are hydrogeologically suitable geologically stable and fit for designating the wetlands as wastewater treatment systems since the wt 1 is situated over deep 25 m bedrock a higher fluctuation in water levels in p1 was recorded 1 2 4 0 m below ground level bgl during may 2013 to november 2013 period however the piezometer p2 indicated shallow water levels with low fluctuations up to 0 8 m fig s1 it implies that the deep seated wetland wt 1 is situated over an isolated aquifer system and has more scope for fluid circulation with elevated aquifer dynamics enabling enhanced wastewater treatment 3 3 pollution reduction in wetlands 3 3 1 dissolved oxygen bod and cod a significant gain up to 5 ppm in dissolved oxygen do was recorded in wt 1 area fig 8 c and 1 0 ppm in untreated wastewater from the canal which is a source of wastewater to both the wetlands in contrast to wt 1 the wt 2 is observed with maximum do up to 5 8 ppm on temporal scale the overall trend of do shows the considerable variations in both the wetlands however higher records of do and the mean value in wt 2 could be attributed to the shallow basement and thin column 1 m of standing water which promotes higher dissolution of oxygen with air water interactions the oxygen inputs to wetland occurs from two sources viz mass transfer of oxygen as air water interface and partly from oxygen co produced during algal photosynthesis the lab simulated studies by asolekar and langote 2004 shows that the flux of oxygen across the air water interface is koxy 1 10 5 ms 1 at 25 c temperature and may be sufficient to meet the full requirement further algae need excess co2 which can be met from the bacterial release of co2 during biodegradation of sediment organic matter and litter ouyang and guo 2016 thus there is symbiosis between algae and bacteria on a weight basis the oxygen production is 1 3 times the algal production eq 4 which could also be valuable in meeting the bod requirements of the wastewater arceivala and asolekar 2013 oxygen production occurs concurrently with algal production in accordance with the following equation 4 106 c o 2 16 n o 3 h p o 4 122 h 2 o 18 h c 106 h 263 o 110 n 16 p 1 138 o 2 algae 1 oxygen 1 3 considerable reduction in bod and cod up to 80 and 80 respectively in wt 1 and 74 58 and 73 33 respectively were observed in wt 2 fig 8a and b the significant reduction in bod and cod in wt 1 could be attributed to two stages in the aerobic process at shallow 3 m depth and anaerobic process at deeper zones below 3 0 m depth through gasification the microbes involved in methanogenesis help in the degradation of organic material and reduce bod levels especially when the temperatures are higher than 18 c arceivala and asolekar 2013 this indicates that when bod levels are high the bacteria in the deep wetlands continue to degrade the organic matter and lowering the levels of bod by 80 fig 8a the experimental studies indicate that efficiency of bod and cod reduction can be improved up to 90 by increasing the column height of a constructed wetland zurita et al 2009 at the shallow end of the wt 1 which consists of a variety of plant species with deep penetrating roots 150 180 cm delays the wastewater passage which in turn increases the retention time enhancing the pollutant removal efficiencies ponds with water columns of 3 5 m have advantages over shallow wetlands in terms of bod removal efficiency especially in warm climates tropical countries where the continuous existence of anaerobic layers at the lower levels which can promote significant bod reduction through gasification 3 3 2 nitrate nitrate contamination of water can lead to serious health and environmental consequences the denitrification processes were able to reduce the no3 concentrations from untreated wastewater indicating the removal efficiency of 97 18 wt 1 142 mg l to 4 mg l and 93 66 in wt 1 and wt 2 respectively table 1 the no3 removal capacity of the wt 1 is 194 34 kgd 1 table 1 as given in the literature bastviken 2006 kadlec 2012 crites et al 2014 the nitrate removal in natural wetlands may be as follows as in the top 1 m of the column there is nitrification of ammonium present leading to an increase in nitrate concentration but as there is depletion of oxygen in the subsequent depth of the column the denitrification of nitrates starts and thus at higher hydraulic loading rate nitrification and denitrification activities shifts deeper down in the aquifer column the deeper bedrock also offers greater stability in temperature for efficient bio chemical dynamics moreover the temperature stability on vertical scale of the wetland the ponds situated over deep bedrock deep seated ponds would exhibit greater temperature stability and more efficient for bio chemical dynamics 3 3 3 sulphate the sulphate reducing bacteria srb which is an anaerobe that uses sulphate as a terminal electron acceptor and gives off hydrogen sulphide h2s and co2 as waste product as shown in eq 5 5 c h 2 o 6 6 h 3 s o 4 2 s r b 3 h 2 s 6 h 2 o 6 c o 2 in the wt 1 removal efficiency of sulphate from wastewater was 77 70 305 mg l to 68 mg l whereas the wt 2 efficiency was at 35 73 table 1 the sulphate removal capacity of wt 1 with the wastewater discharge q ww 1408 24 m3 d was recorded as 398 89 kgd 1 the microbiological analysis results indicated that the presence of srb in wt 1 and its absence in wt 2 table 1 implying that there could be other processes involved in the sulphate removal in wt 2 since the srb grows in anaerobic conditions the deep seated wetlands benefit by their presence 3 3 4 phosphorous the phosphorus removal was noted more effective in vertical flows zurita et al 2009 and also reducing the substrate size which increases the contact surface and allows the wastewater to move slower through the finer media promoting the phosphorus removal by chemical adsorption in wt 1 case the phosphate reduction was from 8 30 mg l to 1 45 mg l with a removal capacity of 82 53 from the total wastewater q ww 1408 24 m3 d was 9 66 kgd 1 table 1 where the major reducing factor could be plant uptake as recorded by the field measurements of the biomass vegetation weighing 28 3 kgm 2 in the wt 1 fig 3a the rapid growth of vegetation in wetlands suggests that the phosphorous removal by plant uptake might be higher than the adsorption kadlec and knight 1996 the phosphorous removal efficiency in wt 1 was found to be 82 53 whereas for wt 2 it was recorded as 77 12 table 1 3 3 5 microorganisms the microbiological parameters including the total plate counts coliforms and faecal coliforms were reported in the untreated wastewater with their concentration values as 72 73 105 cfu ml 1 1 105 cfu ml and 1 6 103 per 100 ml respectively the deep wetlands hold greater potential for thermal stability increased detention time mixing pattern which enhances the bacterial die off rates through any antagonistic activity in wt 1 the pathogen removal was in the order of 99 56 99 99 whereas in the shallow wetland wt 2 removal efficiency was 96 90 99 62 table 1 3 4 strategies for designating the natural wetlands as treatments systems the study shows that hydro geophysical studies can be used to characterize the wetlands and when coupled with physio chemical analysis of water it helps to understand the overall treatment potential of a wetland therefore such studies can be useful in environmental impact assessments eia to decide if natural wetlands could be suitable for treatment of wastewater natural wetlands with the following characteristics can be useful for wastewater treatment a wetlands situated over deep bedrock or any hydrogeological confining layer such as clay compact sandstone or aquifuge devoid of any fractures or fissures or any other geological weak features to avoid any contaminant transport to longer distances are suitable for wastewater treatment b a single or isolated aquifer system characterized with a thick weathered zone low hydraulic conductivity and high retention time c specific capacity for hydraulic loading rates and pollutant removal efficiency d wetlands situated in flat or gentle topography and not on steep slopes seismic prone zones or close to the drinking water sources numerous natural wetlands exist along the musi river basin as well as other major river basins like the ganges and yamuna in northern india and several other cases across the globe which can be effectively utilized for wastewater treatment by adopting the criteria presented in the paper this novel approach can be utilized to characterize natural wetlands and to decipher its treatment potential 4 conclusions natural wetlands and their potential to treat polluted water have not been studied in depth as such the dynamics of physical chemical and biological attributes are poorly understood and under investigated nature provides a vast array of wetlands that are small such as those studied here and entire flood plains and large coastal wetlands that could be utilized for wastewater treatment in a systematic way for this each wetland has to be characterized against the anticipated treatment potential and this study shows a novel way to address it the integrated geophysical and hydrogeological scans of wastewater fed natural wetlands were useful to determine the structure and function and to establish the efficiency determining factors that enhance wastewater treatment the lower order of electrical resistivity ρ 10 35 ωm observed in the soil aquifer zone weathered zone with a hydraulic conductivity k of 2 938 md 1 shows that the pollutant removal efficiency is higher in deep seated wetlands the geophysical scans of the wetlands indicate that the wetlands studied were geologically stable with deep bedrock isolated hydrogeological systems and devoid of any geological lineaments such as fractures they catalyze the bio chemical interactions that enhance the wastewater treatment further the pollutant removal processes were determined as bioremediation sedimentation adsorption redox reactions and ion exchange reactions with removal efficiencies for nutrients up to 97 00 microbes up to 99 99 and organic content up to 80 00 in the deep seated wetland wt 1 the shallow wetland wt 2 had relatively reduced efficiency for pollutant removal owing to its shorter longitudinal section and lower hydraulic retention time this study shows that the natural wetlands have the potential to remove pollutants effectively however scientific studies are required to elucidate if such processes impact the groundwater system long term wastewater treatment can also bring about biotic changes that can impact treatment efficiency these changes can lead to the degradation of natural wetlands and restoration has to be part of the planning process the hydro geophysical parameters found in the natural wetlands can be used to design constructed wetlands to enhance pollutant removal capacity acknowledgements the study was a part of saph pani project www saphpani eu sponsored by the european union within the

19193,riparian zones can receive large amounts of nitrate potentially contributing to water pollution denitrification is a major pathway to remove nitrate previous research on riparian denitrification focused on natural factors but frequently neglected the roles of human activity such as pesticide accumulations here we combined field investigations and exposure experiments to reveal the responses of denitrification and n2o emission to chlorothalonil ctn a common pesticide in column experiments with riparian sediments in this study ctn inhibited denitrification and led to nitrate accumulation in sediments furthermore ctn significantly increased n2o emission by 208 377 and this response was regulated by n2o reductase nos activity rather than nosz abundance a mechanistic study indicated that the critical step glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphogylcerate catalyzed by glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase during microbial metabolism greatly influenced denitrification in ctn polluted sediments our data also revealed that ctn declined electron donor nadh electron transport system and denitrifying enzyme activities during denitrification such responses suggested that ctn deteriorated sediment denitrification by inhibiting electron production transport and consumption in denitrifiers additionally structure equation modeling indicated that nos was the key factor in predicting denitrification rate in ctn polluted sediments overall this is the first study to explore the effects of pesticide on denitrification and n2o emission in riparian zones at microbial metabolism level our results suggest that the safety threshold of ctn accumulation for inhibiting sediment denitrification is approximately 2 mg kg 1 and imply that the wide presence of pesticides in riparian zones could impact eutrophication control of aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords riparian zone denitrification nitrous oxide metabolic activity pesticide 1 introduction the

large amounts of reactive nitrogen n dwivedi et al 2018 kim et al 2016 nitrate no3 is one of the major reactive n and the elevated no3 loads in riparian sediments could cause a series of environmental and human health problems e g eutrophication and infant methaemoglobinaemia conley et al 2009 holloway et al 1998 vitousek et al 1997 xiong et al 2017 therefore no3 removal from riparian zones has raised widespread concerns dwivedi et al 2018 klatt et al 2017 trauth et al 2018 microbial denitrification is a mainstream dissimilatory pathway to permanently reduce no3 to nitrous oxide n2o and finally to n2 bettez and groffman 2012 dong et al 2009 in riparian zones fluctuating hydrological regime and intensive substance exchange between land and water provide an ideal condition for denitrification process seitzinger 1994 zhu et al 2013 however this process is easily affected by human activities such as agricultural practices and industrial pollutions and thus may result in no3 accumulation and potent greenhouse gas n2o emission in riparian zones hou et al 2015 seitzinger 2008 hence a better understanding of the responses of denitrification and n2o emission to anthropogenic influence in riparian zones is needed to protect aquatic ecosystem and mitigate global warming tian et al 2016 agricultural runoff containing large amounts of pesticide residues could be discharged into waters via riparian zone aguiar et al 2015 bicalho et al 2010 harris 1996 pavel et al 1999 riparian sediment and vegetation are considered as effective ecological filters that can reduce pesticide contamination of surface water but lead to pesticide accumulations in riparian zones aguiar et al 2015 mander et al 2017 it has been reported that the types of pesticide accumulated in riparian sediments include fungicide insecticide and herbicide with concentrations varying from 0 08 to 34 22 mg kg 1 bicalho et al 2010 sun et al 2013 the riparian pesticides have been reported to

dicarbonitrile ctn is the second popular broad spectrum fungicide and its annual application amounts have been nearly 5000 t in u s and over 8000 t in china zhang et al 2016 because of the high octanol water partition coefficient logkow 2 88 ctn is easily absorbed onto sediment surfaces reduker et al 1988 potentially influencing microbial activity and n cycle previous studies have documented that ctn decreased soil extracellular enzyme activity wu et al 2012 changed microbial community structure bending et al 2007 and inhibited nitric oxide no production rate from grassland soil kinney et al 2005 additionally ctn could also downregulate the functional gene abundances of n cycle in soil zhang et al 2016 nevertheless it is still unknown at present whether ctn accumulations in riparian zones result in negative effects on denitrification and n2o emission microbial denitrification needs to consume electrons produced by degrading extracellular organic matters to accomplish the reduction of no3 to n2 pan et al 2013 wan et al 2016 hence electron behaviors including production transport and consumption play an important role in denitrification process it has been documented that the electron donor for denitrification is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh and is generated through microbial metabolism i e glycolysis li et al 2016 zumft 1997 the produced nadh are then transferred to electron transport system a major place for electron production transport and consumption in this system nadh is catalyzed by nadh dehydrogenase to produce electrons which are sequentially delivered by quinone pool and electron transfer proteins wan et al 2016 zumft 1997 these electrons are eventually consumed by four key denitrifying enzymes no3 reductase nar no2 reductase nir no reductase nor and n2o reductase nos zheng et al 2014 in riparian zone ctn accumulations probably intervene microbial metabolism process and thus disrupt the stable function of electron behaviors potentially influencing denitrification and n2o emission in sediments unfortunately no studies were found about the influences of pesticides on electron production transport and consumption during denitrification process with these considerations we herein selected the riparian zones of the three gorges reservoir of china to investigate the effects of ctn on denitrification three gorges reservoir is the largest artificial reservoir in the world with 306 km2 of riparian zones tang et al 2016 approximately 38 of the area is used for traditional agriculture and pesticide applications reach 28 kg hm 2 xie 2014 large amounts of agricultural non point source pollutants and domestic sewage can be discharged into the reservoir via riparian zones deteriorating water quality and sediment health zhang et al 2017 thus it offers a good opportunity to investigate the potential effects of ctn on no3 removal and n2o emission in riparian sediments the specific aims of the study are to a investigate the impacts of ctn on sediment health and microbial activity b explore the effects of ctn on riparian denitrification process c reveal microbial metabolic responses of denitrifiers to ctn and d establish the predictive model between denitrifying enzyme activity and sediment denitrification this work could provide the possible mechanism for the impacts of ctn on denitrification and n2o emission and the mechanism makes it possible to seek suitable approaches to reduce the risk of pesticide to water eutrophication and global warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmental sample

sites after collection samples were brought back to lab on ice and analyzed for physicochemical characteristics table s1 thereafter the sediments from the four sites were mixed homogeneously and stored at 4 c until experiments physicochemical characteristics tn no3 no2 nh4 ph moisture and soil organic matters som of water and sediment samples were determined following the method of kim et al 2016 ye et al 2017 and hu et al 2018 2 2 ctn preparation and determination standardized substance of ctn cas no 1897 45 6 was purchased from j k scientific china ctn for exposure experiments 98 active ingredient was purchased from aladdin scientific china ctn in sediment was extracted and measured as described by chaves et al 2008 and hladik and kuivila 2008 briefly sediment samples were extracted with acetone hexane solution 1 1 v v by the ultrasonic method and then concentrated by rotary evaporation at 3 rpm for 2 5 h after filtering with anhydrous sodium sulfate column the solvent was filtered with 0 45 μm filters ctn was measured using gcms tq8040 shimadzu japan with db 5ms column 30 m length 0 25 mm i d 0 25 μm phase thickness the recovery rate was 82 3 92 9 detail measurements were listed in supplementary materials additionally the primary metabolite 4oh ctn was also measured and the detailed descriptions and methods were in supplementary materials 2 3 experimental set up in this study the effects of three levels 5 10 and 25 mg kg 1 of ctn on denitrification in riparian sediments were investigated specifically 5 mg kg 1 t5 treatment represents the background concentration of ctn although 10 and 25 mg kg 1 t10 and t25 treatments are significantly greater than those in sampling sites they are selected as the cumulative concentrations of ctn in the future riparian zones are the hotspots for receiving non point pollutions of agricultural runoff coffey 1997 kim et al 2016 riparian sediments are thus often exposed to pesticides and their accumulations over time in sediments are likely to be caused in form of chronic additions of pesticides therefore 10 and 25 mg kg 1 of ctn were selected in this study to represent pesticide accumulations which could potentially occur in the future sediment samples without ctn addition are used as control treatment 40 day incubation experiment the incubation experiment was conducted in the four glass boxes in detail 3 kg of sediment samples were exposed to the three concentrations of ctn which is evenly dissolved in milli q water before the experiment equal volume of distilled water was added to control treatment sediments were then mixed evenly and incubated in the dark at 28 2 c for 40 days during the exposure experiment sterile distilled water was sprayed to each treatment every 7 9 days to ensure water content at the end of the incubation 5 g of sediment from each treatment were taken to analyze ctn concentrations 60 h anaerobic exposure experiment after the 40 day incubation a subsequent 60 h anaerobic experiment was immediately conducted to further investigate the effects of ctn on denitrification in riparian sediments in detail the ctn treated samples as above mentioned were transferred to 150 ml serum bottles initial carbon and nitrogen sources were 5 mg g 1 glucose and 120 mg kg 1 no3 n all the solutions were purged with he purity 99 99 for 15 min to remove oxygen then the treatments were anaerobically incubated at 28 c in the dark for 60 h destructive sampling strategy was taken giving a total of 160 bottles for the incubation 4 treatments 5 quintuplicates 8 sampling

atp denitrifying gene abundance and microbial community structure were measured in addition sediment respiration rate basal respiration and substrate induced respiration rate and denitrification rate based on 15n pairing method were also measured specially basal respiration without glucose addition represents basal microbial activity in sediments and substrate induced respiration with glucose addition represents potential microbial activity in sediments detail methods about respiration rates and denitrification rate were provided in supplementary materials 2 4 enzyme activity assays key enzyme activities involved in microbial metabolism and denitrification process can reflect the pollutant induced potential effects schug et al 2014 wigginton et al 2010 and thus activities of glucokinase gk glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh no3 reductase nar no2 reductase nir no reductase nor and n2o reductase nos were determined briefly after 60 h experiment 5 g of sediment were washed thrice with 100 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 8 and then resuspended in the buffer at 4 c the suspensions were disrupted by sonication for 5 min at 4 c thereafter the supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at 16 000 rpm at 4 c for 10 min and were immediately used to measure enzyme activities protein concentrations of sediment samples were determined using total protein assay kit jiancheng institute of biological engineering nanjing china with bovine serum albumin as a standard gk activity was determined by measuring nadph formation at 340 nm dols et al 1997 zheng et

to start the reaction gapdh activity was determined by measuring nadh formation at 340 nm souza and radi 1998 the assay mixture 2 ml contained 0 01 m tris hcl buffer ph 8 5 0 02 m sodium arsenate 2 mm dl glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate 2 mm nad and 0 5 mm dithiothreitol then 1 ml of enzyme extract was injected to start the reaction and the absorbance was recorded every 30 s for 5 min the unit of gk and gapdh activity was expressed as nm min 1 mg 1 protein nar nir nor and nos activities were measured according to the literature kristjansson and hollocher 1980 zheng et al 2014 briefly the assay mixture 3 ml contained 10 mm pbs buffer ph 7 8 10 mm methyl viologen 5 mm na2s2o4 and 1 mm denitrifying electron acceptor no3 no2 no or n2o then enzyme extract 1 ml was injected to start the reaction all these denitrifying enzymes were assayed at 25 c under anaerobic conditions after 30 min of incubation the increased or decreased no2 concentration was determined at 540 nm to calculate nar and nir activities the produced or reduced n2o concentration was detected by the microsensor mmm meter unisense denmark to calculate nor and nos activities the unit of denitrifying enzyme activities was expressed as μmol n g 1 dry soil h 1 2 5 electron transport system ets activity nadh and atp assays after the 60 h experiment 5 g of sediment were taken and measured the ets activity by reducing 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride intc to formazan according to previous literature with minor modifications broberg 1985 wan et al 2016 absorbance of the formed orange like formazan was immediately recorded at 490 nm against a solvent blank 2 g of sediment were taken and measured nadh contents using enzymatic cycling assay as described in the literature san et al 2002 su et al 2015b the absorbance was recorded every 30 s at 570 nm for 10 min extraction of atp from 5 g of sediments was following the previous study martens 2001 20 ml of the trichloroacetic acid hpo4 2 were added to sediments to extract atp then immediate sonification for 2 min atp was measured using atp assay kit jiancheng institute of biological engineering nanjing china all the detail procedures were provided in supplementary materials 2 6 quantitative pcr and high throughput sequencing after the 60 h experiment samples 10 g were collected from control and t25 treatment and stored in 80 c until analysis details for dna extraction were given in our previous publication chen et al 2015 denitrifying functional genes narg nirk s norb and nosz were quantified by real time quantitative pcr abi 7500 information of the primers for the denitrifying functional genes were listed in supplementary materials table s2 microbial community structure in sediment was detected by using illumina miseq sequencing of the 16s rrna gene the details of pyrosequencing and analysis have been presented in our previous study hu et al 2018 2 7 statistical analysis all tests were conducted in quintuplicates and the data in this study were normally distributed statistical differences of results were determined by one way anova with the lsd post hoc test spss 22 0 results were considered significant when p value was below 0 05 direct and indirect effects of denitrifying enzyme activities on denitrification rate were identified by structure equation modeling amos 21 0 3 results 3 1 ctn residues in riparian sediments field investigations of water quality and sediment physicochemical characteristic from the 4 sampling sites were conducted and the detailed information was provided in supplementary materials table s1 background concentrations of ctn in sediments varied from 0 to 4 03 mg kg 1 table s1 table 1 showed the different accumulation behaviors of ctn in sediments among t5 t10 and t25 treatments in detail ctn residues after 40 days were 1 83 0 15 6 38 0 23 17 82 0 41 mg kg 1 in t5 t10 and t25 treatments respectively accumulation of ctn in t5 was less than 50 however ctn accumulations in t10 63 81 and t25 71 28 were far higher than that in t5 table 1 one way anova p 0 05 indicating that high contents of ctn were accumulated in t10 and t25 treatments in addition metabolite 4oh ctn was not measured in each ctn treated sediment after 40 d which suggested that the subsequent effects on sediment health and denitrification process during 60 h were mainly caused by ctn rather than 4oh ctn 3 2 sediment health and denitrification in the presence of ctn to further investigate the effects of ctn on sediment health and denitrification process a 60 h anaerobic experiment was conducted after 40 days soil respiration activity has often been reported to reflect soil health and microbial activity munoz leoz et al 2011 thus basal and substrate induced respiration rates in sediments were measured after 60 h fig 1 results showed that no significant differences were observed between control and t5 treatment one way anova p 0 05 regardless of basal and substrate induced respiration in t10 and t25 treatments however ctn remarkably declined basal and substrate induced respiration rates one way anova p 0 05 fig 1 indicating that high concentrations of ctn t10 and t25 posed the negative impacts on microbial activity in sediments fig 2 showed the responses of no3 n and no2 n concentrations n2o accumulation and denitrification rate to ctn in fig 2a no3 n and no2 n concentrations of control after 60 h were 3 93 and 1 92 mg kg 1 respectively significantly lower than those in t10 and t25 one way anova p 0 05 indicating that ctn inhibited no3 n and no2 n reductions after 60 h however ctn remarkably enhanced sediment n2o accumulation by 208 377 in t10 and t25 treatments one way anova p 0 05 fig 2b high concentrations of ctn also declined denitrification rate fig 2c in detail denitrification rate in control was 11 39 μmol 15n kg 1 dry soil h 1 1 38 and 1 79 fold higher than that in t10 and t25 respectively and had no significant difference with that in t5 treatment one way anova p 0 05 3 3 sediment microbial metabolism in response to ctn denitrifiers need to degrade carbon source to provide electrons for the complete reduction of no3 to n2 previous study showed that gk and gapdh were two important enzymes during glycolysis for catalyzing the critical step to produce electron donor for denitrification dols et al 1997 san et al 2002 su et al 2015b in this study therefore we analyzed the effects of ctn on microbial glycolysis including the steps catalyzed by the two enzymes in sediments and the metabolic pathways were shown in fig 3 a it can be found that gk catalyzing glucose to glucose 6 phosphate was not significantly inhibited in ctn treated sediments one way anova p 0 05 and the activities maintained at 0 137 0 144 nm min 1 mg 1 protein fig 3b however the critical step of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphogylcerate catalyzed by gapdh was remarkably suppressed by 41 9 in t10 and 51 1 in t25 one way anova p 0 05 fig 3c concentrations of the products during this step nadh electron carrier and atp energy source were thus decreased fig 3d and e on average the concentrations of nadh and atp were 66 6 and 73 5 lower in t25 versus control one way anova p 0 05 3 4 ets activity denitrifying enzyme activity gene abundance and denitrifiers in response to ctn functional stability of microbial denitrification mainly depends on the effective transport and consumption of electrons fig 4 a wan et al 2016 in the present study we found that ctn significantly decreased microbial electron transport system ets activities by 26 1 and 36 9 in t10 and t25 respectively one way anova p 0 05 fig 4f after transport these electrons are eventually consumed by four key denitrifying enzymes nar nir nor and nos which are mainly encoded by the gene narg nirs nirk norb and nosz li et al 2016 su et al 2015a fig 4b e showed that ctn accumulations t10 and t25 remarkably inhibited nar nir and nos activities one way anova p 0 05 but had no measurable influence on nor activity in detail activities of nar nir and nos in control were 0 138 1 195 and 7 343 μmol n g 1 dry soil h 1 higher than 0 095 0 505 and 2 459 μmol n g 1 dry soil h 1 in t25 one way anova p 0 05 relative abundances of narg and nirs in t25 were declined by 18 5 and 48 8 of control respectively whereas no significant variations were found in nirk norb and nosz abundances fig 4g indicating that the responses of denitrifying enzyme activities and the corresponding gene abundances to ctn were not well matched microbial community structures in control and t25 treatment were identified by high throughput sequencing and detailed information was listed in table s3 ctn altered sediment microbial community structures fig 5 at genera level 6 genera of potential denitrifiers pseudomonas thauera ensifer pedomicrobium streptomyces and candidatus xiphinematobacter were detectable 0 1 compared to control the relative abundances of pseudomonas thauera pedomicrobium and streptomyces were declined by 33 0 51 2 45 7 and 57 9 in t25 respectively fig 5 4 discussion our study provided the first experimental results that ctn inhibited denitrification but promoted n2o emission in riparian sediments however such response mechanism in the complete and realistic exposure experiments are still needed to be explored microbial denitrification is the four step reductions catalyzed by nar nir nor and nos which are mainly encoded by narg nirk s norb and nosz li et al 2016 these enzymes require to consume electrons produced by microbial metabolism to accomplish denitrification process consequently several questions arose a what is the response of electron behaviors to ctn in denitrification b which step and which denitrifying enzyme does ctn inhibit during denitrification c which is the major role in regulating n2o release enzyme or gene 4 1 ctn inhibited electron production transport and consumption during denitrification in sediments glycolysis is an important process during microbial denitrification su et al 2015b a pure cultural study has documented that ctn could suppress only gk catalyzing glucose to glucose 6 phosphate and gapdh catalyzing glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphogylcerate activities in glycolysis tillman et al 1981 in contrast our study has confirmed that ctn only inhibited gapdh activity but had no effects on gk activity fig 3b and c such different observations were probably attributed to the environmental and microbial community structure differences between complex ecosystem and pure cultural system during glycolysis the step of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphogylcerate catalyzed by gapdh is critical because it can generate electron donor nadh and energy source atp for biodenitrification fig 3a gerald 1996 in the present study ctn significantly inhibited the critical step resulting in the declined nadh concentrations by 44 3 66 6 fig 3d hence ctn accumulation decreased the capacity of electron production which might be one of the important reasons for the declined denitrification furthermore we found that gapdh activity was positively correlated with denitrification rate in ctn polluted sediments r2 0 866 p 0 001 fig 6 a and no significant correlation was observed between gk activity and denitrification rate r2 0 020 p 0 88 fig 6b this further confirmed that the critical step catalyzed by gapdh during microbial metabolism had a great influence on sediment denitrification under ctn accumulations microbial denitrification is commonly driven by a series of electron transports and consumptions which are conducted in ets zumft 1997 in this system electrons are produced by nadh dehydrogenase and then are transferred to denitrifying enzymes via quinone pools and cytochrome c fig 4a previous study has confirmed that ets activity in denitrifiers posed a great influence on denitrification performance wan et al 2016 in this study ets activity in control sediment of riparian zone was 0 14 μg o2 g 1 protein min 1 lower than other studies conducted in freshwater sediments 0 59 3 28 μg o2 g 1 protein min 1 broberg 1985 ets activity was significantly declined after high concentrations of ctn accumulations implying that ctn inhibited electron transport during denitrification this inhibitory effect could lead to a low electron transport efficiency and thus caused the accumulations of no3 and n2o in riparian sediments finally these electrons are utilized by nar nir nor and nos for catalyzing denitrification reactions fig 4a su et al 2015a zumft 1997 hence these denitrifying enzymes play an important role in electron consumption during denitrification in this study ctn significantly inhibited nar nir and nos activities resulting in a lower electron consumption efficiency however no significant inhibition was found for nor activity fig 4d in denitrifiers nar and nor are stably embedded in the membrane whereas nir and nos are freely distributed in periplasm zumft 1997 suggesting that activities of nir and nos are easily affected by ctn compared to nar and nor overall ctn inhibited electron production transport and consumption in denitrifiers which then deteriorated denitrification and increased n2o accumulation in sediments 4 2 nos activity was the major factor in regulating n2o emission and predicting denitrification rate in sediments our study showed that ctn promoted sediment n2o emission fig 2b it has been reported that n2o emission in sediments or soils was closely related to nosz abundance for example liu et al 2018 demonstrated that n2o release and accumulation were strongly correlated with nosz gene abundance after 10 mg l 1 of ag introduction to lake sediments furthermore petersen et al 2012 applied path analysis to show that n2o emission from boreal ecosystems was controlled by nosz and its abundance was a useful tool to predict n2o emission morales et al 2010 also documented that the abundance of nosz could be used as the proxy for determining soil n2o release clearly most research on n2o release and accumulation focused on its relationship with nosz gene abundance but frequently neglected the role of denitrifying enzyme activity in this study ctn significantly declined nos activity but had no directly effect on nosz abundance fig 4 this indicated that the elevated n2o emission from ctn polluted sediments could be directly governed by the declined nos activity rather than nosz abundance such different observations might be due to the differences of pollutants and soil properties which affect pesticide bioavailability and then alter n2o emission pattern in fact microbial denitrification reactions are enzyme mediated biochemical processes and denitrifying enzyme activity is the direct factor in regulating the biochemical reductions wallenstein et al 2006 xiong et al 2017 zheng et al 2014 our previous study has also confirmed that biochemical reactions were mainly controlled by enzyme activity protein level rather than gene abundance dna level chen and vymazal 2015 which might explain why nosz abundance did not match with the n2o release and accumulation pattern therefore our results unveiled that a new feature that nos activity gene expression level rather than nosz abundance gene level governed sediment n2o emission from riparian zones under ctn accumulations in the present study ctn remarkably inhibited denitrification rate in riparian sediments fig 2c for deeply understanding of which denitrifying enzyme ctn mainly suppressed to impact denitrification structure equation modeling was thus established to investigate the direct and indirect effects of denitrifying enzyme activities on denitrification rate in ctn polluted sediments structure equation modeling is often applied to assess the latent effects using one or more measured variables chen et al 2015 table 2 and fig 7 showed that nor had no significant effect on denitrification rate in contrast nos had the most significant effect total effect 0 938 on denitrification rate table 2 indicating that nos activity might be the most important factor for predicting denitrification rate in ctn polluted sediments nos controls the final step n2o to n2 in denitrification and its activity is critical for n2 production liu et al 2018 in this study denitrification rate was calculated by measuring 29n2 and 30n2 and thus nos activity presented a good linear relationship with denitrification rate moreover all denitrifying enzymes could compete for electrons from ets during denitrification their abilities of gaining electrons are directly related to denitrification process previous study has indicated that nos has the lower capacity to gain electrons than nar nir and nor pan et al 2013 which suggests that nos is more sensitive for influencing sediment denitrification rate additionally nar could directly or indirectly affect denitrification rate as well with total effects 0 848 table 2 but the effects were lower than those of nos hence our study indicated that ctn mainly inhibited nos activity governing n2o to n2 to impact sediment denitrification 4 3 environmental significance here we combined microbial metabolism and 15n isotope labeling method to investigate the effects of ctn on denitrification in riparian sediments denitrification process in riparian zones might be affected after ctn residues over 1 83 mg kg 1 actual concentration in t5 treatment after 40 d table 1 and no3 n accumulations could be enhanced by approximately 10 fold if ctn residues reach 17 82 mg kg 1 actual concentration in t25 treatment after 40 d table 1 the detrimental effect could probably lead to no3 n input to nearby aquatic environment when water table fluctuating kim et al 2016 potentially causing water eutrophication holloway et al 1998 additionally potent greenhouse gas n2o emission from riparian sediments could be promoted by approximately 5 fold after 17 82 mg kg 1 of ctn accumulation probably accelerating global warming and depleting atmospheric ozone riparian zones are the hot zones for element biogeochemical cycles which are usually controlled by microbial communities mcclain et al 2003 miao et al 2018 pesticide accumulations negatively impact on land water ecosystem health impairing microbe driven element cycles i e nitrogen sulfur or silicon cycle therefore the observed results highlight the importance of pesticide control in riparian zones for this we propose the two suggestions a source control decrease the pesticide abuse in agricultural practices and improve drainage systems to reduce agricultural runoff b terminal control plant grass lands or herbaceous plants to achieve phytoremediation and to reduce the impacts of pesticide on riparian zones 5 conclusion in our study t10 and t25 treatments significantly deteriorated sediment denitrification of riparian zones whereas t5 had no obvious inhibition ctn accumulations declined denitrification rate and elevated n2o emission by impacting electron production transport and consumption in denitrifiers denitrifying enzyme nos activity rather than nosz abundance regulated n2o release and accumulation and was also the important factor in predicting denitrification rate in riparian sediments furthermore we also observed that gapdh activity in microbial metabolism had the significant relationship with denitrification rate and no correlation was found between gk activity and denitrification rate overall this is the first study for exploring the responses of sediment denitrification and n2o emission to pesticide in riparian zones at microbial metabolism and isotope tracing level which provides a new insight for revealing the impacts of pollutants caused by human activities on n cycle in the transitional zone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems

19193,riparian zones can receive large amounts of nitrate potentially contributing to water pollution denitrification is a major pathway to remove nitrate previous research on riparian denitrification focused on natural factors but frequently neglected the roles of human activity such as pesticide accumulations here we combined field investigations and exposure experiments to reveal the responses of denitrification and n2o emission to chlorothalonil ctn a common pesticide in column experiments with riparian sediments in this study ctn inhibited denitrification and led to nitrate accumulation in sediments furthermore ctn significantly increased n2o emission by 208 377 and this response was regulated by n2o reductase nos activity rather than nosz abundance a mechanistic study indicated that the critical step glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphogylcerate catalyzed by glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase during microbial metabolism greatly influenced denitrification in ctn polluted sediments our data also revealed that ctn declined electron donor nadh electron transport system and denitrifying enzyme activities during denitrification such responses suggested that ctn deteriorated sediment denitrification by inhibiting electron production transport and consumption in denitrifiers additionally structure equation modeling indicated that nos was the key factor in predicting denitrification rate in ctn polluted sediments overall this is the first study to explore the effects of pesticide on denitrification and n2o emission in riparian zones at microbial metabolism level our results suggest that the safety threshold of ctn accumulation for inhibiting sediment denitrification is approximately 2 mg kg 1 and imply that the wide presence of pesticides in riparian zones could impact eutrophication control of aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords riparian zone denitrification nitrous oxide metabolic activity pesticide 1 introduction the

large amounts of reactive nitrogen n dwivedi et al 2018 kim et al 2016 nitrate no3 is one of the major reactive n and the elevated no3 loads in riparian sediments could cause a series of environmental and human health problems e g eutrophication and infant methaemoglobinaemia conley et al 2009 holloway et al 1998 vitousek et al 1997 xiong et al 2017 therefore no3 removal from riparian zones has raised widespread concerns dwivedi et al 2018 klatt et al 2017 trauth et al 2018 microbial denitrification is a mainstream dissimilatory pathway to permanently reduce no3 to nitrous oxide n2o and finally to n2 bettez and groffman 2012 dong et al 2009 in riparian zones fluctuating hydrological regime and intensive substance exchange between land and water provide an ideal condition for denitrification process seitzinger 1994 zhu et al 2013 however this process is easily affected by human activities such as agricultural practices and industrial pollutions and thus may result in no3 accumulation and potent greenhouse gas n2o emission in riparian zones hou et al 2015 seitzinger 2008 hence a better understanding of the responses of denitrification and n2o emission to anthropogenic influence in riparian zones is needed to protect aquatic ecosystem and mitigate global warming tian et al 2016 agricultural runoff containing large amounts of pesticide residues could be discharged into waters via riparian zone aguiar et al 2015 bicalho et al 2010 harris 1996 pavel et al 1999 riparian sediment and vegetation are considered as effective ecological filters that can reduce pesticide contamination of surface water but lead to pesticide accumulations in riparian zones aguiar et al 2015 mander et al 2017 it has been reported that the types of pesticide accumulated in riparian sediments include fungicide insecticide and herbicide with concentrations varying from 0 08 to 34 22 mg kg 1 bicalho et al 2010 sun et al 2013 the riparian pesticides have been reported to deteriorate sediment health aguiar et al 2015 alter greenhouse gas dynamics hefting et al 2003 and impact plant growth bicalho et al 2010 vidon 2010 chlorothalonil 2 4 5 6 tetrachlorobenzene 1 3 dicarbonitrile ctn is the second popular broad spectrum fungicide and its annual application amounts have been nearly 5000 t in u s and over 8000 t in china zhang et al 2016 because of the high octanol water partition coefficient logkow 2 88 ctn is easily absorbed onto sediment surfaces reduker et al 1988 potentially influencing microbial activity and n cycle previous studies have documented that ctn decreased soil extracellular enzyme activity wu et al 2012 changed microbial community structure bending et al 2007 and inhibited nitric oxide no production rate from grassland soil kinney et al 2005 additionally ctn could also downregulate the functional gene abundances of n cycle in soil zhang et al 2016 nevertheless it is still unknown at present whether ctn accumulations in riparian zones result in negative effects on denitrification and n2o emission microbial denitrification needs to consume electrons produced by degrading extracellular organic matters to accomplish the reduction of no3 to n2 pan et al 2013 wan et al 2016 hence electron behaviors including production transport and consumption play an important role in denitrification process it has been documented that the electron donor for denitrification is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh and is generated through microbial metabolism i e glycolysis li et al 2016 zumft 1997 the produced nadh are then transferred to electron transport system a major place for electron production transport and consumption in this system nadh is catalyzed by nadh dehydrogenase to produce electrons which are sequentially delivered by quinone pool and electron transfer proteins wan et al 2016 zumft 1997 these electrons are eventually consumed by four key denitrifying enzymes no3 reductase nar no2 reductase nir no reductase nor and n2o reductase nos zheng et al 2014 in riparian zone ctn accumulations probably intervene microbial metabolism process and thus disrupt the stable function of electron behaviors potentially influencing denitrification and n2o emission in sediments unfortunately no studies were found about the influences of pesticides on electron production transport and consumption during denitrification process with these considerations we herein selected the riparian zones of the three gorges reservoir of china to investigate the effects of ctn on denitrification three gorges reservoir is the largest artificial reservoir in the world with 306 km2 of riparian zones tang et al 2016 approximately 38 of the area is used for traditional agriculture and pesticide applications reach 28 kg hm 2 xie 2014 large amounts of agricultural non point source pollutants and domestic sewage can be discharged into the reservoir via riparian zones deteriorating water quality and sediment health zhang et al 2017 thus it offers a good opportunity to investigate the potential effects of ctn on no3 removal and n2o emission in riparian sediments the specific aims of the study are to a investigate the impacts of ctn on sediment health and microbial activity b explore the effects of ctn on riparian denitrification process c reveal microbial metabolic responses of denitrifiers to ctn and d establish the predictive model between denitrifying enzyme activity and sediment denitrification this work could provide the possible mechanism for the impacts of ctn on denitrification and n2o emission and the mechanism makes it possible to seek suitable approaches to reduce the risk of pesticide to water eutrophication and global warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmental sample

sites after collection samples were brought back to lab on ice and analyzed for physicochemical characteristics table s1 thereafter the sediments from the four sites were mixed homogeneously and stored at 4 c until experiments physicochemical characteristics tn no3 no2 nh4 ph moisture and soil organic matters som of water and sediment samples were determined following the method of kim et al 2016 ye et al 2017 and hu et al 2018 2 2 ctn preparation and determination standardized substance of ctn cas no 1897 45 6 was purchased from j k scientific china ctn for exposure experiments 98 active ingredient was purchased from aladdin scientific china ctn in sediment was extracted and measured as described by chaves et al 2008 and hladik and kuivila 2008 briefly sediment samples were extracted with acetone hexane solution 1 1 v v by the ultrasonic method and then concentrated by rotary evaporation at 3 rpm for 2 5 h after filtering with anhydrous sodium sulfate column the solvent was filtered with 0 45 μm filters ctn was measured using gcms tq8040 shimadzu japan with db 5ms column 30 m length 0 25 mm i d 0 25 μm phase thickness the recovery rate was 82 3 92 9 detail measurements were listed in supplementary materials additionally the primary metabolite 4oh ctn was also measured and the detailed descriptions and methods were in supplementary materials 2 3 experimental set up in this study the effects of three levels 5 10 and 25 mg kg 1 of ctn on denitrification in riparian sediments were investigated specifically 5 mg kg 1 t5 treatment represents the background concentration of ctn although 10 and 25 mg kg 1 t10 and t25 treatments are significantly greater than those in sampling sites they are selected as the cumulative concentrations of ctn in the future riparian zones are the hotspots for receiving non point pollutions of agricultural runoff coffey 1997 kim et al 2016 riparian sediments are thus often exposed to pesticides and their accumulations over time in sediments are likely to be caused in form of chronic additions of pesticides therefore 10 and 25 mg kg 1 of ctn were selected in this study to represent pesticide accumulations which could potentially occur in the future sediment samples without ctn addition are used as control treatment 40 day incubation experiment the incubation experiment was conducted in the four glass boxes in detail 3 kg of sediment samples were exposed to the three concentrations of ctn which is evenly dissolved in milli q water before the experiment equal volume of distilled water was added to control treatment sediments were then mixed evenly and incubated in the dark at 28 2 c for 40 days during the exposure experiment sterile distilled water was sprayed to each treatment every 7 9 days to ensure water content at the end of the incubation 5 g of sediment from each treatment were taken to analyze ctn concentrations 60 h anaerobic exposure experiment after the 40 day incubation a subsequent 60 h anaerobic experiment was immediately conducted to further investigate the effects of ctn on denitrification in riparian sediments in detail the ctn treated samples as above mentioned were transferred to 150 ml serum bottles initial carbon and nitrogen sources were 5 mg g 1 glucose and 120 mg kg 1 no3 n all the solutions were purged with he purity 99 99 for 15 min to remove oxygen then the treatments were anaerobically incubated at 28 c in the dark for 60 h destructive sampling strategy was taken giving a total of 160 bottles for the incubation 4 treatments 5 quintuplicates 8 sampling

atp denitrifying gene abundance and microbial community structure were measured in addition sediment respiration rate basal respiration and substrate induced respiration rate and denitrification rate based on 15n pairing method were also measured specially basal respiration without glucose addition represents basal microbial activity in sediments and substrate induced respiration with glucose addition represents potential microbial activity in sediments detail methods about respiration rates and denitrification rate were provided in supplementary materials 2 4 enzyme activity assays key enzyme activities involved in microbial metabolism and denitrification process can reflect the pollutant induced potential effects schug et al 2014 wigginton et al 2010 and thus activities of glucokinase gk glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh no3 reductase nar no2 reductase nir no reductase nor and n2o reductase nos were determined briefly after 60 h experiment 5 g of sediment were washed thrice with 100 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 8 and then resuspended in the buffer at 4 c the suspensions were disrupted by sonication for 5 min at 4 c thereafter the supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at 16 000 rpm at 4 c for 10 min and were immediately used to measure enzyme activities protein concentrations of sediment samples were determined using total protein assay kit jiancheng institute of biological engineering nanjing china with bovine serum albumin as a standard gk activity was determined by measuring nadph formation at 340 nm dols et al 1997 zheng et

dl glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate 2 mm nad and 0 5 mm dithiothreitol then 1 ml of enzyme extract was injected to start the reaction and the absorbance was recorded every 30 s for 5 min the unit of gk and gapdh activity was expressed as nm min 1 mg 1 protein nar nir nor and nos activities were measured according to the literature kristjansson and hollocher 1980 zheng et al 2014 briefly the assay mixture 3 ml contained 10 mm pbs buffer ph 7 8 10 mm methyl viologen 5 mm na2s2o4 and 1 mm denitrifying electron acceptor no3 no2 no or n2o then enzyme extract 1 ml was injected to start the reaction all these denitrifying enzymes were assayed at 25 c under anaerobic conditions after 30 min of incubation the increased or decreased no2 concentration was determined at 540 nm to calculate nar and nir activities the produced or reduced n2o concentration was detected by the microsensor mmm meter unisense denmark to calculate nor and nos activities the unit of denitrifying enzyme activities was expressed as μmol n g 1 dry soil h 1 2 5 electron transport system ets activity nadh and atp assays after the 60 h experiment 5 g of sediment were taken and measured the ets activity by reducing 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride intc to formazan according to previous literature with minor modifications broberg 1985 wan et al 2016 absorbance of the formed orange like formazan was immediately recorded at 490 nm against a solvent blank 2 g of sediment were taken and measured nadh contents using enzymatic cycling assay as described in the literature san et al 2002 su et al 2015b the absorbance was recorded every 30 s at 570 nm for 10 min extraction of atp from 5 g of sediments was following the previous study martens 2001 20 ml of the trichloroacetic acid hpo4 2 were added to sediments to extract atp then immediate sonification for 2 min atp was measured using atp assay kit jiancheng institute of biological engineering nanjing china all the detail procedures were provided in supplementary materials 2 6 quantitative pcr and high throughput sequencing after the 60 h experiment samples 10 g were collected from control and t25 treatment and stored in 80 c until analysis details for dna extraction were given in our previous publication chen et al 2015 denitrifying functional genes narg nirk s norb and nosz were quantified by real time quantitative pcr abi 7500 information of the primers for the denitrifying functional genes were listed in supplementary materials table s2 microbial community structure in sediment was detected by using illumina miseq sequencing of the 16s rrna gene the details of pyrosequencing and analysis have been presented in our previous study hu et al 2018 2 7 statistical analysis all tests were conducted in quintuplicates and the data in this study were normally distributed statistical differences of results were determined by one way anova with the lsd post hoc test spss 22 0 results were considered significant when p value was below 0 05 direct and indirect effects of denitrifying enzyme activities on denitrification rate were identified by structure equation modeling amos 21 0 3 results 3 1 ctn residues in riparian sediments field investigations of water quality and sediment physicochemical characteristic from the 4 sampling sites were conducted and the detailed information was provided in supplementary materials table s1 background concentrations of ctn in sediments varied from 0 to 4 03 mg kg 1 table s1 table 1 showed the different accumulation behaviors of ctn in sediments among t5 t10 and t25 treatments in detail ctn residues after 40 days were 1 83 0 15 6 38 0 23 17 82 0 41 mg kg 1 in t5 t10 and t25 treatments respectively accumulation of ctn in t5 was less than 50 however ctn accumulations in t10 63 81 and t25 71 28 were far higher than that in t5 table 1 one way anova p 0 05 indicating that high contents of ctn were accumulated in t10 and t25 treatments in addition metabolite 4oh ctn was not measured in each ctn treated sediment after 40 d which suggested that the subsequent effects on sediment health and denitrification process during 60 h were mainly caused by ctn rather than 4oh ctn 3 2 sediment health and denitrification in the presence of ctn to further investigate the effects of ctn on sediment health and denitrification process a 60 h anaerobic experiment was conducted after 40 days soil respiration activity has often been reported to reflect soil health and microbial activity munoz leoz et al 2011 thus basal and substrate induced respiration rates in sediments were measured after 60 h fig 1 results showed that no significant differences were observed between control and t5 treatment one way anova p 0 05 regardless of basal and substrate induced respiration in t10 and t25 treatments however ctn remarkably declined basal and substrate induced respiration rates one way anova p 0 05 fig 1 indicating that high concentrations of ctn t10 and t25 posed the negative impacts on microbial activity in sediments fig 2 showed the responses of no3 n and no2 n concentrations n2o accumulation and denitrification rate to ctn in fig 2a no3 n and no2 n concentrations of control after 60 h were 3 93 and 1 92 mg kg 1 respectively significantly lower than those in t10 and t25 one way anova p 0 05 indicating that ctn inhibited no3 n and no2 n reductions after 60 h however ctn remarkably enhanced sediment n2o accumulation by 208 377 in t10 and t25 treatments one way anova p 0 05 fig 2b high concentrations of ctn also declined denitrification rate fig 2c in detail denitrification rate in control was 11 39 μmol 15n kg 1 dry soil h 1 1 38 and 1 79 fold higher than that in t10 and t25 respectively and had no significant difference with that in t5 treatment one way anova p 0 05 3 3 sediment microbial metabolism in response to ctn denitrifiers need to degrade carbon source to provide electrons for the complete reduction of no3 to n2 previous study showed that gk and gapdh were two important enzymes during glycolysis for catalyzing the critical step to produce electron donor for denitrification dols et al 1997 san et al 2002 su et al 2015b in this study therefore we analyzed the effects of ctn on microbial glycolysis including the steps catalyzed by the two enzymes in sediments and the metabolic pathways were shown in fig 3 a it can be found that gk catalyzing glucose to glucose 6 phosphate was not significantly inhibited in ctn treated sediments one way anova p 0 05 and the activities maintained at 0 137 0 144 nm min 1 mg 1 protein fig 3b however the critical step of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphogylcerate catalyzed by gapdh was remarkably suppressed by 41 9 in t10 and 51 1 in t25 one way anova p 0 05 fig 3c concentrations of the products during this step nadh electron carrier and atp energy source were thus decreased fig 3d and e on average the concentrations of nadh and atp were 66 6 and 73 5 lower in t25 versus control one way anova p 0 05 3 4 ets activity denitrifying enzyme activity gene abundance and denitrifiers in response to ctn functional stability of microbial denitrification mainly depends on the effective transport and consumption of electrons fig 4 a wan et al 2016 in the present study we found that ctn significantly decreased microbial electron transport system ets activities by 26 1 and 36 9 in t10 and t25 respectively one way anova p 0 05 fig 4f after transport these electrons are eventually consumed by four key denitrifying enzymes nar nir nor and nos which are mainly encoded by the gene narg nirs nirk norb and nosz li et al 2016 su et al 2015a fig 4b e showed that ctn accumulations t10 and t25 remarkably inhibited nar nir and nos activities one way anova p 0 05 but had no measurable influence on nor activity in detail activities of nar nir and nos in control were 0 138 1 195 and 7 343 μmol n g 1 dry soil h 1 higher than 0 095 0 505 and 2 459 μmol n g 1 dry soil h 1 in t25 one way anova p 0 05 relative abundances of narg and nirs in t25 were declined by 18 5 and 48 8 of control respectively whereas no significant variations were found in nirk norb and nosz abundances fig 4g indicating that the responses of denitrifying enzyme activities and the corresponding gene abundances to ctn were not well matched microbial community structures in control and t25 treatment were identified by high throughput sequencing and detailed information was listed in table s3 ctn altered sediment microbial community structures fig 5 at genera level 6 genera of potential denitrifiers pseudomonas thauera ensifer pedomicrobium streptomyces and candidatus xiphinematobacter were detectable 0 1 compared to control the relative abundances of pseudomonas thauera pedomicrobium and streptomyces were declined by 33 0 51 2 45 7 and 57 9 in t25 respectively fig 5 4 discussion our study provided the first experimental results that ctn inhibited denitrification but promoted n2o emission in riparian sediments however such response mechanism in the complete and realistic exposure experiments are still needed to be explored microbial denitrification is the four step reductions catalyzed by nar nir nor and nos which are mainly encoded by narg nirk s norb and nosz li et al 2016 these enzymes require to consume electrons produced by microbial metabolism to accomplish denitrification process consequently several questions arose a what is the response of electron behaviors to ctn in denitrification b which step and which denitrifying enzyme does ctn inhibit during denitrification c which is the major role in regulating n2o release enzyme or gene 4 1 ctn inhibited electron production transport and consumption during denitrification in sediments glycolysis is an important process during microbial denitrification su et al 2015b a pure cultural study has documented that ctn could suppress only gk catalyzing glucose to glucose 6 phosphate and gapdh catalyzing glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphogylcerate activities in glycolysis tillman et al 1981 in contrast our study has confirmed that ctn only inhibited gapdh activity but had no effects on gk activity fig 3b and c such different observations were probably attributed to the environmental and microbial community structure differences between complex ecosystem and pure cultural system during glycolysis the step of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphogylcerate catalyzed by gapdh is critical because it can generate electron donor nadh and energy source atp for biodenitrification fig 3a gerald 1996 in the present study ctn significantly inhibited the critical step resulting in the declined nadh concentrations by 44 3 66 6 fig 3d hence ctn accumulation decreased the capacity of electron production which might be one of the important reasons for the declined denitrification furthermore we found that gapdh activity was positively correlated with denitrification rate in ctn polluted sediments r2 0 866 p 0 001 fig 6 a and no significant correlation was observed between gk activity and denitrification rate r2 0 020 p 0 88 fig 6b this further confirmed that the critical step catalyzed by gapdh during microbial metabolism had a great influence on sediment denitrification under ctn accumulations microbial denitrification is commonly driven by a series of electron transports and consumptions which are conducted in ets zumft 1997 in this system electrons are produced by nadh dehydrogenase and then are transferred to denitrifying enzymes via quinone pools and cytochrome c fig 4a previous study has confirmed that ets activity in denitrifiers posed a great influence on denitrification performance wan et al 2016 in this study ets activity in control sediment of riparian zone was 0 14 μg o2 g 1 protein min 1 lower than other studies conducted in freshwater sediments 0 59 3 28 μg o2 g 1 protein min 1 broberg 1985 ets activity was significantly declined after high concentrations of ctn accumulations implying that ctn inhibited electron transport during denitrification this inhibitory effect could lead to a low electron transport efficiency and thus caused the accumulations of no3 and n2o in riparian sediments finally these electrons are utilized by nar nir nor and nos for catalyzing denitrification reactions fig 4a su et al 2015a zumft 1997 hence these denitrifying enzymes play an important role in electron consumption during denitrification in this study ctn significantly inhibited nar nir and nos activities resulting in a lower electron consumption efficiency however no significant inhibition was found for nor activity fig 4d in denitrifiers nar and nor are stably embedded in the membrane whereas nir and nos are freely distributed in periplasm zumft 1997 suggesting that activities of nir and nos are easily affected by ctn compared to nar and nor overall ctn inhibited electron production transport and consumption in denitrifiers which then deteriorated denitrification and increased n2o accumulation in sediments 4 2 nos activity was the major factor in regulating n2o emission and predicting denitrification rate in sediments our study showed that ctn promoted sediment n2o emission fig 2b it has been reported that n2o emission in sediments or soils was closely related to nosz abundance for example liu et al 2018 demonstrated that n2o release and accumulation were strongly correlated with nosz gene abundance after 10 mg l 1 of ag introduction to lake sediments furthermore petersen et al 2012 applied path analysis to show that n2o emission from boreal ecosystems was controlled by nosz and its abundance was a useful tool to predict n2o emission morales et al 2010 also documented that the abundance of nosz could be used as the proxy for determining soil n2o release clearly most research on n2o release and accumulation focused on its relationship with nosz gene abundance but frequently neglected the role of denitrifying enzyme activity in this study ctn significantly declined nos activity but had no directly effect on nosz abundance fig 4 this indicated that the elevated n2o emission from ctn polluted sediments could be directly governed by the declined nos activity rather than nosz abundance such different observations might be due to the differences of pollutants and soil properties which affect pesticide bioavailability and then alter n2o emission pattern in fact microbial denitrification reactions are enzyme mediated biochemical processes and denitrifying enzyme activity is the direct factor in regulating the biochemical reductions wallenstein et al 2006 xiong et al 2017 zheng et al 2014 our previous study has also confirmed that biochemical reactions were mainly controlled by enzyme activity protein level rather than gene abundance dna level chen and vymazal 2015 which might explain why nosz abundance did not match with the n2o release and accumulation pattern therefore our results unveiled that a new feature that nos activity gene expression level rather than nosz abundance gene level governed sediment n2o emission from riparian zones under ctn accumulations in the present study ctn remarkably inhibited denitrification rate in riparian sediments fig 2c for deeply understanding of which denitrifying enzyme ctn mainly suppressed to impact denitrification structure equation modeling was thus established to investigate the direct and indirect effects of denitrifying enzyme activities on denitrification rate in ctn polluted sediments structure equation modeling is often applied to assess the latent effects using one or more measured variables chen et al 2015 table 2 and fig 7 showed that nor had no significant effect on denitrification rate in contrast nos had the most significant effect total effect 0 938 on denitrification rate table 2 indicating that nos activity might be the most important factor for predicting denitrification rate in ctn polluted sediments nos controls the final step n2o to n2 in denitrification and its activity is critical for n2 production liu et al 2018 in this study denitrification rate was calculated by measuring 29n2 and 30n2 and thus nos activity presented a good linear relationship with denitrification rate moreover all denitrifying enzymes could compete for electrons from ets during denitrification their abilities of gaining electrons are directly related to denitrification process previous study has indicated that nos has the lower capacity to gain electrons than nar nir and nor pan et al 2013 which suggests that nos is more sensitive for influencing sediment denitrification rate additionally nar could directly or indirectly affect denitrification rate as well with total effects 0 848 table 2 but the effects were lower than those of nos hence our study indicated that ctn mainly inhibited nos activity governing n2o to n2 to impact sediment denitrification 4 3 environmental significance here we combined microbial metabolism and 15n isotope labeling method to investigate the effects of ctn on denitrification in riparian sediments denitrification process in riparian zones might be affected after ctn residues over 1 83 mg kg 1 actual concentration in t5 treatment after 40 d table 1 and no3 n accumulations could be enhanced by approximately 10 fold if ctn residues reach 17 82 mg kg 1 actual concentration in t25 treatment after 40 d table 1 the detrimental effect could probably lead to no3 n input to nearby aquatic environment when water table fluctuating kim et al 2016 potentially causing water eutrophication holloway et al 1998 additionally potent greenhouse gas n2o emission from riparian sediments could be promoted by approximately 5 fold after 17 82 mg kg 1 of ctn accumulation probably accelerating global warming and depleting atmospheric ozone riparian zones are the hot zones for element biogeochemical cycles which are usually controlled by microbial communities mcclain et al 2003 miao et al 2018 pesticide accumulations negatively impact on land water ecosystem health impairing microbe driven element cycles i e nitrogen sulfur or silicon cycle therefore the observed results highlight the importance of pesticide control in riparian zones for this we propose the two suggestions a source control decrease the pesticide abuse in agricultural practices and improve drainage systems to reduce agricultural runoff b terminal control plant grass lands or herbaceous plants to achieve phytoremediation and to reduce the impacts of pesticide on riparian zones 5 conclusion in our study t10 and t25 treatments significantly deteriorated sediment denitrification of riparian zones whereas t5 had no obvious inhibition ctn accumulations declined denitrification rate and elevated n2o emission by impacting electron production transport and consumption in denitrifiers denitrifying enzyme nos activity rather than nosz abundance regulated n2o release and accumulation and was also the important factor in predicting denitrification rate in riparian sediments furthermore we also observed that gapdh activity in microbial metabolism had the significant relationship with denitrification rate and no correlation was found between gk activity and denitrification rate overall this is the first study for exploring the responses of sediment denitrification and n2o emission to pesticide in riparian zones at microbial metabolism and isotope tracing level which provides a new insight for revealing the impacts of pollutants caused by human activities on n cycle in the transitional zone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems

19194,a recently discovered bisulfite hso3 permanganate mno4 system was reported to produce highly reactive free mn iii that can oxidize organic compounds in milliseconds however this characteristic reactivity was not found in all other known reaction systems that can also produce free mn iii why can mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 be so active here we found nahso3 and o2 acted as catalysts for the reaction between mn iii and organic compounds without o2 0 of organic compounds were oxidized in nahso3 kmno4 indicating the absence of o2 inactivated mn iii reactivity when the reaction between nahso3 and kmno4 was monitored in air mn iii catalyzed rapid oxidation of nahso3 by o2 then the mn iii that could oxidize organic compounds was found to be the ones involved in the catalytic reaction between nahso3 and o2 thus the link between o2 and mn iii reactivity was established finally nahso3 o2 can be viewed as catalysts for the reaction between mn iii and organic compounds because 1 when mn iii was involved in oxidizing organic compounds it stopped being the catalyst for the reaction between nahso3 and o2 so that they were consumed to a much smaller extent and 2 without nahso3 and o2 mn iii lost its oxidation ability to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on catalytic role exchange where mn iii is the catalyst for nahso3 o2 reaction while nahso3 o2 are the catalysts for mn iii organic compounds reaction understanding the critical role of oxygen in nahso3 kmno4 will enable us to apply this technology more efficiently toward contaminant removal graphical abstract

used as oxidants for oxidation purposes such as oxidative degradation of contaminants in wastewater gao et al 2018 jiang et al 2009 2010 nowack and stone 2002 the preparation of mn iii ligands is routinely through adding ligands prior to starting the reaction that can generate free mn iii davies 1969 jiang et al 2010 klewicki and morgan 1998 examples of such reactions can be easily found in literature including 1 oxidation of mn2 such as s2o8 2 mn2 cr2o7 2 mn2 and mno4 mn2 davies 1969 gupta and ghosh 1958 jiang et al 2010 and 2 reduction of mno4 or mno2 e g oxalic acid mno2 mn2 mno4 and h2o2 mno4 chen et al 2013 davies 1969 jiang et al 2010 taube 1947 recently a newly discovered system hso3 mno4 was also found to produce free mn iii eq 1 gao et al 2017 hu et al 2017 sun et al 2015 2016 but it can oxidize organic compounds in milliseconds eq 2 this millisecond reaction has triggered substantial interest in the advanced oxidation community because the system is very simple practical and fast in addition to oxidizing organic compounds some mn iii undergoes disproportionation to form mn2 and mno2 eq 3 moreover nahso3 can compete with organic compounds for mn iii eq 4 1 2h 2hso3 mno4 mn iii 2h2o 2so4 2 2 mn iii organic compound products mn2 3 2mn iii 2h2o mn2 mno2 4h 4 hso3 2mn iii h2o 2mn2 so4 2 3h these findings are inspiring in that there is no need to complex free mn iii with ligands as stable oxidants anymore because free mn iii itself can now oxidize organic compounds however if free mn iii itself is so active 1 why has this high reactivity not been discovered for many decades especially when reactions that can readily produce free mn iii are widely available as mentioned above 2 why does mn iii have to be complexed with ligands rather than directly used as oxidants in previous systems 3 is this high reactivity of mn iii unique for nahso3 kmno4 to address these questions preliminary experiments were conducted to produce free mn iii based on two known reactions without adding ligands but in the presence of organic compounds table s1 in the supporting information si indicated that unlike the high reactivity of mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 mn iii in oxalic acid mno2 or kmno4 mn2 could not oxidize organic compounds phenol as a probe in milliseconds in fact chen et al were only able to use the mn iii in oxalic acid mno2 to catalyze carbadox reduction by oxalic acid mn iii was also reported to catalyze atrazine de alkylation chen et al 2013 hu et al 2017 while jiang et al had to complex the mn iii in kmno4 mn2 with ligands to oxidize bisphenol a jiang et al 2009 2010 these results indicate that 1 the high reactivity of mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 is unique and not found in other systems which makes it understandable why mn iii has been complexed with ligands as a routine way for further applications and 2 the high reactivity of mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 cannot be seen as a common property for mn iii and mn iii itself cannot be directly used as an oxidant due to its facile disproportionation meanwhile these results raised a new question why can mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 be so active this question is exactly what this study aims to address here we found the high reactivity of mn iii was due to the catalytic effect of nahso3 and o2 the importance of o2 on the reactivity of mn iii was first investigated in an oxygen free glove box then the time courses of h and dissolved oxygen do during reaction were monitored to understand the reaction rates of nahso3 and o2 next mno2 formation in the presence of a large amount of nahso3 was measured by uv visible spectrometry uv vis to confirm the catalytic role of mn iii in the reaction between nahso3 and o2 with phenol as the probe compound for mn iii oxidative reactivity the relationship between the catalytic role of mn iii for nahso3 o2 reaction and the oxidant role of mn iii for organic compounds oxidation was also investigated finally a new reaction mechanism was proposed for nahso3 kmno4 and then verified by interpreting the effects of nahso3 kmno4 ratio do concentration kmno4 amount and phenol initial concentration results of this work will allow more cost

batch reactors were used rather than stop flow reactors because we did not intend to monitor the reaction kinetics of organic compounds the reaction kinetics of this system as well as the mn iii concentration measurements have been carefully investigated already sun et al 2015 hence we focused on the oxidation efficiency of this system that is the overall conversion of organic compounds at the reaction time of up to 10 seconds because the reaction was reported to complete in milliseconds sun et al 2015 and fig s1 shows that 10 seconds were enough for the reaction to finish the batch reactors were open to air referred to as in air hereafter unless otherwise specified for typical nahso3 kmno4 systems 20 μm phenol was first mixed with 250 μm nahso3 solution using a magnetic stirrer then 50 μm kmno4 was added into the above mixture the total volume of solution was 50 ml after reaction in 5 10 seconds 500 μl samples were taken and immediately quenched by 10 μl of 1 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride to be analyzed by an agilent 1260 high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a diode array detector most experiments were conducted with phenol as the probe compound because it is known to be easily oxidizable to test if the observed oxygen effect is not unique to phenol caffeine an organic compound that is known to be hardily oxidizable sun et al 2015 was also examined in some experiments for the oxalic acid mno2 system chen et al 2013 200 μm or 10 μm mno2 colloids were prepared by reacting mnso4 h2o with kmno4 at the 2 5 1 molar ratio for 2 h in solution 40 μm phenol was first mixed with 10 mm or 250 μm oxalic acid and then the mixture was added into the above mno2 colloids after all the mno2 was completely dissolved 500 μl samples were taken and immediately quenched by 10 μl of 1 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride for hplc analysis for the kmno4 mn2 system jiang et al 2009 2010 40 μm phenol was first mixed with 300 μm mn2 and 60 μm kmno4 was then added after the color of kmno4 had disappeared 500 μl samples were also taken and also immediately quenched by hydroxylamine hydrochloride all oxidation experiments were conducted in duplicates for hplc analysis 20 μl samples were injected and separated by an agilent zorbax rx c18 column 150 4 6 mm particle size 5 μm maintained at 40 c with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the mobile phase was composed of methanol and water 60 40 v v the wavelength for phenol and caffeine was set at 270 nm and 273 nm respectively the percentage of conversion of the organic compounds was calculated from the following equation conversion c 0 organics initial ct organics left c 0 organics initial 100 2 3 effect of do on mn iii reactivity to ensure a strict oxygen free environment all anoxic experiments were conducted in a coy glove box 2 5 h2 in n2 equipped with pd catalysts to ensure all o2 to be reduced by h2 to water such an environment is referred to as in nitrogen hereafter the same procedure as above in air was followed in the glove box for the investigation of the effects of dissolved oxygen do on phenol oxidation 40 μm phenol was first mixed with 250 μm nahso3 the solution was then bubbled with helium gas at different flow rates to achieve different do contents the do contents were measured by an accumet xl40 do detector after the do meter reading became stable 50 μm kmno4 was added after seconds samples were taken to be analyzed by hplc 2 4 analysis of nahso3 h and do contents for the reaction of nahso3 with either kmno4 or mn2 in the absence of phenol in nitrogen or in air 10 μm kmno4 or mnso4 was mixed with 250 μm nahso3 after 1 min of reaction in air samples were taken to be immediately analyzed by uv vis for the reaction in nitrogen samples were taken and sealed with parafilm before removing from the glovebox to protect them from oxidation by air and then immediately analyzed by uv vis the details for nahso3 detection by uv vis are in si text s1 in the reactions of nahso3 with either kmno4 or mn2 in air or in nitrogen an okaton ph 150 probe and or an accumet xl40 do probe was first immersed into 250 μm nahso3 solution in the reactions of nahso3 with mno2 mno2 colloids were first prepared as described in section 2 2 and the solution ph was adjusted by naoh addition to 4 77 to ensure the same initial ph as in 250 μm nahso3 when the reaction proceeded in the presence of phenol different amounts of phenol were first mixed with 250 μm nahso3 and then the ph do probes were immersed into the solution to minimize lag time in the measurements all ph and do measurements were conducted under constant stirring after the ph do readings became stable in the initial solutions 10 μm kmno4 or mn2 was added into the above solution and the ph do change was recorded with time additional details for ph and do analysis are in text s2 because the reaction was very fast a video camera was used to record the ph do changes and played at a slow motion afterward for the readings to ensure the accuracy of the data all experiments were conducted in duplicates the h and do consumptions were calculated by the following equations h consumption h initial h left do consumption do initial do left 2 5 uv vis analysis for mno2 formation for mno2 formation various amounts of organic compounds kmno4 and nahso3 were used depending on different purposes typically 250 μm nahso3 and 50 μm kmno4 reacted in the presence or absence of a certain amount of phenol after 20 s the solution was analyzed by uv vis the broad peak at 300 500 nm was attributed to the presence of mno2 colloids soldatova et al 2017 sun et al 2015 although the formed mno2 colloids were not soluble in water they can form relative stable suspension due to their small initial sizes hence mno2 formation could be analyzed by uv vis giving a broad peak at 300 500 nm the intensity of the mno2 peaks was used to qualitatively analyze mno2 colloid concentrations the higher the intensity was the higher the concentration of mno2 3 results and discussion 3 1 the o2 effect on mn iii reactivity to investigate the o2 effect on the oxidation ability of the nahso3 kmno4 system a series of reactions were separately conducted in nitrogen and in air fig 1 a shows that in nitrogen no organic compounds were oxidized at the time scale of seconds 0 conversion for all reactions while in air 18 85 of the organic compounds were converted under different conditions these differences obviously resulted from the availability of o2 as the absence of o2 led to the inactivation of nahso3 kmno4 toward organic compounds oxidation such inactivation was not specific to ratios of nahso3 kmno4 2 1 vs 5 1 initial ph phin 4 77 vs 3 5 or organic species phenol vs caffeine and amounts 20 μm vs 40 μm to exclude the potential interference of h2 in glove box to the observed oxygen effects two different levels of h2 2 5 and 1 0 were first controlled in the glovebox and the results in table s2 indicate that the nahso3 kmno4 system remained inactive in oxidizing phenol in both cases then he and h2 were used separately to bubble the solution to maintain the same do content 1 85 mg l the results in table s2 showed that the same amount of phenol was oxidized under both conditions indicating the oxidation activity of nahso3 kmno4 was not affected by the h2 in the glove box to identify the reason for this inactivation we first tested if mn iii can form in nitrogen because mn iii has been well demonstrated to be the origin of the oxidation ability of nahso3 kmno4 sun et al 2015 two methods were used to detect mn iii based on the formation of mno2 and mn iii pp complexes where the later one is a well accepted method to detect mn iii sun et al 2015 because mno2 formation has been proven to be due to mn iii disproportionation its presence can also be used as an indicator for mn iii formation sun et al 2015 2018 we conducted nahso3 kmno4 2 1 ratio reaction in nitrogen based on the stoichiometry in eq 1 to observe if there was mno2 without pp presence or mn iii pp complex with pp presence formed it should be noted that we used 2 1 ratio of nahso3 kmno4 rather than 5 1 because in nitrogen excess nahso3 can further react with mn iii pp to affect its detection fig s3 clearly showed mno2 formation if pp was not present and mn iii pp complex formation when pp was added indicating that mn iii still formed in nitrogen and its formation was not affected by the absence of o2 this finding thus excludes the possibility that the inactivity of nahso3 kmno4 in nitrogen was due to the lack of mn iii formation meanwhile this result also indicates that the formed mn iii in kmno4 nahso3 did not oxidize the organic compounds in nitrogen fig 1a but disproportionated to mno2 and mn2 instead fig s2 this inactivity of mn iii toward organic compounds in nitrogen is very similar to that in the kmno4 mn2 system observed in the preliminary test table s1 however the mn iii in kmno4 mn2 was inactive in the presence of o2 while for mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 it became extremely reactive toward organic compounds in the presence of o2 fig 1a in air hence to unveil how o2 drastically changed the behavior of mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 it became critical to understand why mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 can be so active very recently sun et al also noticed a similar promoting effect of o2 when the removal efficiency of phenol increased with increasing do from 1 0 to 8 0 mg l sun et al 2018 we also observed a similar trend fig 1b however different from our observation that there was 0 conversion in nitrogen they observed minor oxidation of organic compounds with 0 mg l do this difference should be due to the different methods used to control the o2 contents while they used a sealed reactor and flushed the reaction mixture with n2 which may lead to a trace amount of do remaining or leaking in solution our reaction setup in a coy glove box ensured a strict oxygen free environment they explained this o2 effect in that nahso3 reacted with kmno4 to produce so3 radicals which could compete with the organic compounds for mn iii with an increasing amount of do so3 radicals were increasingly consumed by do thus leading to more mn iii to react with the organic compounds sun et al 2018 however there was still mn iii formed in nitrogen as showed above fig s3 the above proposed mechanism cannot explain why this mn iii could not oxidize organic compounds fig 1 hence the o2 effect should be further investigated and reinterpreted 3 2 the reaction between nahso3 and o2 as the bridge to link o2 and mn iii the key to understanding the o2 effect on mn iii reactivity toward organic compounds would be to link the reactivity of mn iii to o2 we started by investigating the reaction between nahso3 and o2 because this reaction can be easily catalyzed by metal ions such as fe2 fe3 and mn2 berglund and elding 1995 berglund et al 1993 connick and zhang 1996 zhang et al 2018 given the formation of mn iii ions during the reaction of nahso3 kmno4 it is likely that mn iii also acted as a catalyst for the reaction between nahso3 and o2 hence we examined if the reaction between nahso3 and o2 can be affected when nahso3 reacted with kmno4 the reaction between nahso3 and o2 is shown in eq 5 based on which the production of h and consumption of o2 and hso3 would indicate the reaction occurred 5 2hso3 o2 2h 2so4 2 without adding kmno4 nahso3 was relatively stable in air in 1 min because there was negligible production of h and negligible consumption of o2 and hso3 even in the presence of 10 μm mn2 as the catalyst fig 2 however after adding 10 μm kmno4 the color of kmno4 disappeared immediately due to its reduction by nahso3 eq 1 followed by fast h production and o2 and hso3 consumption in a short period fig 2 h formation as an indicator for nahso3 consumption because it is from nahso3 oxidation as shown in eq 5 these results strongly indicate that eq 5 proceeded at a fast rate for comparison if the reaction in eq 5 did not occur the reaction between nahso3 and kmno4 would consume h rather than produce h as shown in eq 6 here mn2 is the final product because nahso3 250 μm was in large excess and could reduce all kmno4 10 μm to mn3 and finally to mn2 additional evidence in si text s3 6 5hso3 2mno4 h 5so4 2 2mn2 3h2o also shown in fig 2a h concentration decreased when the same reaction was conducted in nitrogen that is the reaction in eq 5 did not occur another evidence for the fast reaction in eq 5 is the amount of nahso3 consumed based on the stoichiometry in eq 6 only 25 μm nahso3 can be consumed by 10 μm kmno4 at most as observed in nitrogen while in air over 230 μm nahso3 was consumed fig 2c the much larger amount of nahso3 consumed can only be explained by the additional reaction with o2 however as mentioned above the reaction between nahso3 and o2 could not proceed so fast even in the presence of mn2 as the catalyst thus there must be new species acting as a much more efficient catalyst than mn2 for the reaction in eq 5 before concluding mn iii is the catalyst however we should first exclude all other possible species 3 3 mn iii as the catalyst for the reaction between nahso3 and o2 the candidates for the catalyst for eq 5 included mn iii mn iv o2 mn v mn vi and mno4 upon mixing nahso3 with kmno4 in air h started to form at 130 ms fig 2a inset note that although the ph reading had not stabilized within 130 ms it had started to respond to the rapid change in solution ph in 130 ms so the h release should have started before 130 ms this was earlier than the reported time for mno2 appearance 200 ms sun et al 2015 which implies that the catalytic effect already existed before mno2 formation this result can exclude mno2 as the catalyst mn v and mn vi species preferred to form in basic media ladbury and cullis 1958 while the initial solution was acidic phin 4 77 and h continued to form through eq 5 thus leading to a more acidic environment moreover previous research did not observe their uv vis absorbance at 660 and 610 nm hassan and belal 2002 simandi et al 1984 respectively during the reaction between nahso3 and kmno4 sun et al 2015 therefore mn v and mn vi species were also excluded as the catalyst to exclude mno4 as the catalyst and to support the above conclusions that mn iv o2 mn v and mn vi were not the catalyst the mno2 nahso3 system was investigated because it also showed fast oxidation ability for organic compounds and mn iii was also believed to be responsible for this reactivity sun et al 2015 the results are shown in fig 2 similar to nahso3 kmno4 the catalytic effect for eq 5 i e generation of h and consumption of nahso3 and o2 was also observed in mno2 nahso3 but at slower rates if mno2 were the catalyst the reaction rates of h nahso3 and o2 should be comparable or smaller in nahso3 kmno4 than in nahso3 mno2 because of the smaller amount of mno2 formed in the former therefore mno2 can be indeed excluded as the catalyst in addition there is no mno4 mn vi or mn v in mno2 nahso3 so they can be excluded as the catalyst as well because mn2 did not show any catalytic effect for eq 5 within the time scale of seconds fig 2 the only possible species left in mno2 nahso3 is mn iii moreover we excluded the possibility of kmno4 and mno2 as the catalyst for hso3 o2 reaction based on theoretical analysis si text s4 the slower production rate of h in mno2 nahso3 was mainly attributed to the slower generation rate of mn iii in mno2 nahso3 than in kmno4 nahso3 sun et al 2015 this was reflected in the slower oxidation of organic compounds by mno2 nahso3 than by kmno4 nahso3 although still significantly faster than many conventional oxidants sun et al 2015 in other words such differences in the catalytic reaction rates did not result from different catalytic species but from the generation rates of the catalyst i e mn iii moreover the catalytic role of mn iii can be well supported by previous research where even a trace amount of mn iii 4 10 8 m could significantly catalyze hso3 o2 reaction berglund et al 1993 connick and zhang 1996 fronaeus et al 1998 this was believed to be because mn iii participated in the rate limiting chain initiation reaction to form so3 radicals so the radical chain reactions in hso3 o2 are largely enhanced berglund et al 1993 another evidence for the mn iii catalyst role in eq 5 is the observed mno2 formation in the presence of a large excess of nahso3 based on eq 6 when the ratio of nahso3 kmno4 is greater than 2 5 1 where nahso3 is in large excess all kmno4 should be reduce to mn2 so no mno2 would form indeed when 5 1 ratio of nahso3 and kmno4 reacted in nitrogen no mno2 formed fig 3 a however when the same reaction proceeded in air mno2 formed even when there was only 20 μm kmno4 versus 250 μm nahso3 and the mno2 amount increased with kmno4 concentration fig 3b this can be well explained by mn iii acting as a catalyst for eq 5 thus not consumed so that nahso3 was catalytically oxidized by o2 once all nahso3 had been oxidized by o2 the mn iii then disproportionated to mn2 and mno2 in other words even though nahso3 was used in large excess as long as mn iii acted as a catalyst for eq 5 mno2 would always form with the above evidence we have established the catalytic role of mn iii for eq 5 scheme 1 and eq 7 for the trend in h change with time fig 2a it can be obviously divided into two stages the first stage shows a sharp increase milliseconds fig 2a inset and the next shows a much slower increase in previous research mno2 appeared to form at about 200 ms due to mn iii disproportionation sun et al 2015 2018 indicating mn iii can only exist transiently in a short period hence the sharp increase in h in the initial reaction time was due to the fast oxidation of nahso3 by o2 with mn iii as the catalyst once mn iii started to disproportionate the catalytic reaction between nahso3 and o2 became much slower therefore increase in h became slower in the second stage 3 4 nahso3 and o2 as catalysts for the reaction between mn iii and phenol after the mn iii catalytic role for eq 7 has been established scheme 1 we can see that when o2 is not present the reaction in eq 7 cannot occur so mn iii cannot act as a catalyst while with o2 mn iii acts as a catalyst this characteristic is very similar to the observed o2 dependent oxidation ability of mn iii toward organic compounds i e without o2 mn iii lost its oxidation ability while with o2 its oxidation ability resumed based on this we proposed that only the mn iii with this catalytic role can exhibit oxidation activity toward organic compounds to prove this hypothesis we investigated the effect of phenol concentration on both the mn iii catalytic role and its oxidant role and found mn iii that could oxidize organic compounds was indeed catalytically involved in eq 7 as shown in fig s4 with an increase in phenol concentration there was an increasing amount of phenol consumed as a result of more mn iii reaction with phenol less mn iii was available to catalyze eq 7 so there is a decreasing amount of h released fig 4 a this h change may also come from the reaction between mn iii and phenol but because the amount of phenol consumed was small 6 μm in fig s4 we believe the major source of h is eq 7 moreover the same decreasing trend was observed in do consumption with increasing phenol fig 4b confirming eq 7 was inhibited these results strongly indicate that 1 the mn iii with the catalytic role for eq 7 was the oxidant for phenol and 2 mn iii was the catalyst for eq 7 because the more it was consumed by phenol the less the catalytic effect became why can mn iii with this catalytic role oxidize organic compounds to address this question we have to first recognize that when mn iii is involved in eq 7 as the catalyst it obtained two characteristics 1 it is protected from being reduced by nahso3 because catalysts are not consumed in the same reaction and 2 its disproportionation to mn2 and mno2 is somehow inhibited so it can react transiently in an unknown way the specific catalytic process is yet unknown it is likely that in the catalytic process mn iii is stabilized by some sulfur based species transiently thus showing the millisecond oxidation ability toward organic compounds this is very similar to the cases when mn iii was stabilized by ligands to oxidize organic compounds as mentioned in introduction anderson and kochi 1970 gao et al 2018 jiang et al 2009 gao et al also proved the feasibility of mn iii to form reactive complexes with reduced sulfur species gao et al 2017 the specific mn iii species formed in the catalytic process however remains unknown and should be further investigated for now the attempts to identify such transient intermediates failed due to their highly unstable nature based on these results we can establish the relationship between mn iii s catalytic role for eq 7 and its oxidant role for organic compounds as shown in scheme 2 a and eq 8 in short the mn iii that can oxidize organic compounds is the one involved catalytically in eq 7 on the other hand fig 4 suggests that it is reasonable to see nahso3 o2 as a catalyst for the reaction between mn iii and organic compounds because 1 nahso3 and o2 were originally consumed in the mn iii catalyzed reaction in milliseconds fig 2a inset but they were decreasingly consumed once mn iii had reacted with phenol fig 4 2 without o2 to oxidize nahso3 mn iii could not oxidize phenol fig 1a these two features fit well to the catalyst definition as catalysts are not consumed in one reaction but without them the reaction cannot proceed or proceeds very slowly based on the above results a new reaction mechanism was proposed in scheme 2b where nahso3 and o2 act as catalysts for the reaction between mn iii and organic compounds when comparing scheme 2a vs 2b one interesting phenomenon is that there exists a catalytic role exchange phenomenon between mn iii and nahso3 o2 where mn iii acted as the catalyst for eq 7 in the absence of organic compounds while nahso3 and o2 acted as the catalyst for eq 8 in the presence of organic compounds 3 5 possible species that can complex with or activate mn iii based on the new mechanism mn iii is only involved catalytically in nahso3 o2 reaction and it can oxidize organic compounds using nahso3 o2 as the catalyst we also proposed that during the reaction of nahso3 o2 some species might form to have the ability to stabilize mn iii transiently these species are most likely sulfur based species in the reaction of kmno4 nahso3 o2 sun et al have investigated this reaction in detail and reported that so3 can directly form from hso3 oxidation by mno4 and then be further oxidized by o2 to so5 sun et al 2018 the obtained so5 can react with hso3 to produce hso5 and so3 while hso5 can react with hso3 to produce so4 2 and so4 das 2001 sun et al 2015 based on recent research sun et al 2018 the possible sulfur species include both stable ones hso3 so4 2 hso5 and unstable radicals so5 so4 and so3 because of the observed do effect the species that may complex activate mn iii should be the ones that are generated when o2 is involved thus so3 can be first excluded because it can be directly produced by the reaction between hso3 and kmno4 which is independent of o2 so4 2 also can be excluded because in nitrogen so4 2 was also produced as the final oxidation product of hso3 the remaining possible species include so5 so4 hso3 and hso5 although we had excluded the possibility of hso3 mn iii as the oxidant as proposed gao et al 2017 it is still possible that the ternary system hso3 mn iii o2 acted as the oxidant in the same way the ternary system so4 2 mn iii o2 may also be the reactive species to check this possibility we used kmno4 to react with mn2 to produce free mn iii in the presence of so4 2 in air in this way free mn iii so4 2 and o2 co existed to form a so4 2 mn iii o2 ternary system however we did not observe any phenol oxidation in a short period table s2 thus excluding this possibility the ternary nahso3 mn iii o2 system however cannot be verified in the same way because hso3 can react with kmno4 hso5 is a strong oxidant and its oxidation of organic compounds can be catalyzed by metal ions anipsitakis et al 2006 we did not test this possibility because the results would be unreliable also it is difficult to verify the possibility of so5 and so4 due to their highly unstable nature for the potential contribution of these radicals to direct phenol oxidization sun et al had excluded this possibility by using mn2 to catalyze the reaction of nahso3 and o2 in the presence of phenol sun et al 2015 because a significant amount of radicals was detected yet no phenol was degraded the authors believed that the radicals in nahso3 o2 reaction had no direct contribution to phenol oxidation given the complexity of this system further research is needed to elucidate the more detailed mechanism of the mno4 hso3 o2 system 3 6 validation of the new mechanism to validate a new mechanism one needs to address all the well interpreted phenomena by previous mechanisms but more importantly to resolve the phenomena that cannot be reasonably interpreted by previous mechanisms here the effects of four factors including nahso3 kmno4 ratio kmno4 amount phenol concentration and do level were investigated as shown in fig 5 the phenomena that cannot be well explained by the previous mechanisms include the effects of nahso3 kmno4 ratio and do for the ratio effect the original mechanism eqs 1 4 implied that the highest conversion of organic compounds should be at the 2 1 ratio of nahso3 kmno4 eq 1 because no nahso3 would be left to compete with the organic compounds for mn iii eq 4 sun et al 2015 this is however not consistent with the experimental results where the highest phenol conversion was obtained at the ratio of 6 5 1 fig 5a although an updated mechanism was recently proposed by sun et al based on the findings about the promoting effect of o2 it still cannot effectively explain this ratio effect specifically with an increasing ratio of nahso3 kmno4 the mechanism would predict more so3 radicals produced because the radicals would compete with the organic compounds for mn iii it would decrease the oxidation efficiency which is clearly contradictory to the experimental observations to explain this ratio effect gao et al proposed that mn iii needed extra hso3 to form complexes as the oxidant gao et al 2017 but this hypothesis cannot explain the oxygen effect fig 1 based on our new mechanism nahso3 is part of the catalysts for mn iii organics oxidation with its concentration increasing ratio 2 1 to 6 5 1 phenol conversion should increase as indeed observed fig 5a further increase in nahso3 concentration 6 5 1 to 16 1 would lead to mn iii loss by eq 4 thus leading to decreased phenol conversion 85 40 fig 5a note that the decreased phenol conversion at higher ratios is not due to do having been exhausted fig s5 on the other hand mno2 formation decreased gradually with increasing ratio fig 5b because additional mn iii had been consumed by reacting either with phenol at the ratio 2 1 to 6 5 1 or with nahso3 at the ratio 6 5 1 to 16 1 at the higher ratios of 6 5 1 to 16 1 the mn iii was mainly reduced by excess nahso3 because 1 the decreasing amounts of mno2 formed indicate less mn iii had disproportionated and 2 the mn iii that did not disproportionate did not oxidize phenol either as shown by the decreased phenol conversion at higher ratios fig 5a for the o2 effects the previous mechanisms proposed by both sun et al and gao et al cannot effectively explain them as discussed above however based on our mechanism when o2 was first introduced into the anoxic system mn iii started to assume the catalytic role for eq 7 thus phenol started to be oxidized fig 1b with increasing do content 0 7 mg l the reaction in eq 7 would proceed increasingly faster so that more mn iii was catalytically involved in eq 7 leading to increased phenol conversion fig 1b from the catalyst point of view because o2 is part of the catalysts for the reaction between mn iii and organic compounds it is anticipated and observed that the increased concentration of do led to enhanced phenol conversion fig 1b moreover this enhancing effect of o2 would eventually level off because the reaction rate is also limited by the fixed amount of nahso3 as observed when do concentration increased from 7 0 to 9 66 mg l fig 1b for the phenomena that had been well explained by the previous mechanisms our proposed mechanism also can well explain them first for the effect of phenol concentration an increasing amount of phenol was oxidized with increasing phenol initial concentration while the amount of mno2 formed decreased fig 5c and d increasing phenol would increase the reaction rate of eq 8 so there was an increasing amount of phenol oxidized and hence more mn iii consumed also the amount of mno2 formed gradually decreasing is expected based on less mn iii remain to undergo disproportionation second when kmno4 amount was increased phenol conversion first increased due to the increasing amount of mn iii formed but then leveled off because of the limited amount of nahso3 available as the catalyst fig 5e the effect of nahso3 availability is shown in fig 5a where at 50 μm kmno4 increasing nahso3 amount led to higher phenol conversion the amount of mno2 formed also gradually increased with increasing kmno4 fig 5f due to increasing amounts of mn iii formed when comparing fig 5f to 3b it is obvious that there was more mno2 formed in the absence of phenol therefore the addition of phenol effectively suppressed mno2 formation because the mno2 precursor i e mn iii had been consumed by phenol this observation has also been reported previously sun et al 2015 4 conclusions in conclusion this study revealed why mn iii in the nahso3 kmno4 system was so active in oxidizing organic compounds this is mainly because of mn iii s catalytic role for the reaction between nahso3 and o2 in the catalytic cycle mn iii became very reactive in oxidizing organic compounds in milliseconds and also disproportionated to mn2 and mno2 in the absence of o2 however mn iii lost this catalytic role due to the lack of the reaction between nahso3 and o2 thus mn iii only disproportionated the facile disproportionation of mn iii is common for mn iii in other systems that can generate mn iii as an intermediate while the millisecond oxidation of organic compound is unique for nahso3 kmno4 hence in most cases the traditional way of using mn iii i e complexing with ligands still holds however in nahso3 kmno4 the specific process of how mn iii catalyzed the reaction between nahso3 and o2 and how such mn iii oxidized organic compounds still remain unknown which warrant further research this is also the first case about catalytic role exchange between mn iii catalyst for the reaction between nahso3 and o2 in the absence of organic compounds and nahso3 o2 catalyst for the reaction between mn iii and organic compounds in the presence of organic compounds discovering the critical role of oxygen in nahso3 kmno4 and having a correct understanding of the reaction mechanism will enable us to design more cost effective systems based on this new exciting technology for engineering applications such as water and wastewater treatment

19194,a recently discovered bisulfite hso3 permanganate mno4 system was reported to produce highly reactive free mn iii that can oxidize organic compounds in milliseconds however this characteristic reactivity was not found in all other known reaction systems that can also produce free mn iii why can mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 be so active here we found nahso3 and o2 acted as catalysts for the reaction between mn iii and organic compounds without o2 0 of organic compounds were oxidized in nahso3 kmno4 indicating the absence of o2 inactivated mn iii reactivity when the reaction between nahso3 and kmno4 was monitored in air mn iii catalyzed rapid oxidation of nahso3 by o2 then the mn iii that could oxidize organic compounds was found to be the ones involved in the catalytic reaction between nahso3 and o2 thus the link between o2 and mn iii reactivity was established finally nahso3 o2 can be viewed as catalysts for the reaction between mn iii and organic compounds because 1 when mn iii was involved in oxidizing organic compounds it stopped being the catalyst for the reaction between nahso3 and o2 so that they were consumed to a much smaller extent and 2 without nahso3 and o2 mn iii lost its oxidation ability to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on catalytic role exchange where mn iii is the catalyst for nahso3 o2 reaction while nahso3 o2 are the catalysts for mn iii organic compounds reaction understanding the critical role of oxygen in nahso3 kmno4 will enable us to apply this technology more efficiently toward contaminant removal graphical abstract

strong oxidant due to its high reduction potential e0 1 51v kostka et al 1995 but it is very unstable in aqueous solution because of its fast disproportionation to mn2 and mno2 anderson and kochi 1970 ladbury and cullis 1958 however this disproportionation reaction can be effectively prevented by some ligands e g pyrophosphate pp oxalate citrate and siderophores through forming stable mn iii ligand

used as oxidants for oxidation purposes such as oxidative degradation of contaminants in wastewater gao et al 2018 jiang et al 2009 2010 nowack and stone 2002 the preparation of mn iii ligands is routinely through adding ligands prior to starting the reaction that can generate free mn iii davies 1969 jiang et al 2010 klewicki and morgan 1998 examples of such reactions can be easily found in literature including 1 oxidation of mn2 such as s2o8 2 mn2 cr2o7 2 mn2 and mno4 mn2 davies 1969 gupta and ghosh 1958 jiang et al 2010 and 2 reduction of mno4 or mno2 e g oxalic acid mno2 mn2 mno4 and h2o2 mno4 chen et al 2013 davies 1969 jiang et al 2010 taube 1947 recently a newly discovered system hso3 mno4 was also found to produce free mn iii eq 1 gao et al 2017 hu et al 2017 sun et al 2015 2016 but it can oxidize organic compounds in milliseconds eq 2 this millisecond reaction has triggered substantial interest in the advanced oxidation community because the system is very simple practical and fast in addition to oxidizing organic compounds some mn iii undergoes disproportionation to form mn2 and mno2 eq 3 moreover nahso3 can compete with organic compounds for mn iii eq 4 1 2h 2hso3 mno4 mn iii 2h2o 2so4 2 2 mn iii organic compound products mn2 3 2mn iii 2h2o mn2 mno2 4h 4 hso3 2mn iii h2o 2mn2 so4 2 3h these findings are inspiring in that there is no need to complex free mn iii with ligands as stable oxidants anymore because free mn iii itself can now oxidize organic compounds however if free mn iii itself is so active 1 why has this high reactivity not been discovered for many decades especially when reactions that can readily produce free mn iii are widely available as mentioned above 2 why does mn iii have to be complexed with ligands rather than directly used as oxidants in previous systems 3 is this high reactivity of mn iii unique for nahso3 kmno4 to address these questions preliminary experiments were conducted to produce free mn iii based on two known reactions without adding ligands but in the presence of organic compounds table s1 in the supporting information si indicated that unlike the high reactivity of mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 mn iii in oxalic acid mno2 or kmno4 mn2 could not oxidize organic compounds phenol as a probe in milliseconds in fact chen et al were only able to use the mn iii in oxalic acid mno2 to catalyze carbadox reduction by oxalic acid mn iii was also reported to catalyze atrazine de alkylation chen et al 2013 hu et al 2017 while jiang et al had to complex the mn iii in kmno4 mn2 with ligands to oxidize bisphenol a jiang et al 2009 2010 these results indicate that 1 the high reactivity of mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 is unique and not found in other systems which makes it understandable why mn iii has been complexed with ligands as a routine way for further applications and 2 the high reactivity of mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 cannot be seen as a common property for mn iii and mn iii itself cannot be directly used as an oxidant due to its facile disproportionation meanwhile these results raised a new question why can mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 be so active this question is exactly what this study aims to address here we found the high reactivity of mn iii was due to the catalytic effect of nahso3 and o2 the importance of o2 on the reactivity of mn iii was first investigated in an oxygen free glove box then the time courses of h and dissolved oxygen do during reaction were monitored to understand the reaction rates of nahso3 and o2 next mno2 formation in the presence of a large amount of nahso3 was measured by uv visible spectrometry uv vis to confirm the catalytic role of mn iii in the reaction between nahso3 and o2 with phenol as the probe compound for mn iii oxidative reactivity the relationship between the catalytic role of mn iii for nahso3 o2 reaction and the oxidant role of mn iii for organic compounds oxidation was also investigated finally a new reaction mechanism was proposed for nahso3 kmno4 and then verified by interpreting the effects of nahso3 kmno4 ratio do concentration kmno4 amount and phenol initial concentration results of this work will allow more cost

batch reactors were used rather than stop flow reactors because we did not intend to monitor the reaction kinetics of organic compounds the reaction kinetics of this system as well as the mn iii concentration measurements have been carefully investigated already sun et al 2015 hence we focused on the oxidation efficiency of this system that is the overall conversion of organic compounds at the reaction time of up to 10 seconds because the reaction was reported to complete in milliseconds sun et al 2015 and fig s1 shows that 10 seconds were enough for the reaction to finish the batch reactors were open to air referred to as in air hereafter unless otherwise specified for typical nahso3 kmno4 systems 20 μm phenol was first mixed with 250 μm nahso3 solution using a magnetic stirrer then 50 μm kmno4 was added into the above mixture the total volume of solution was 50 ml after reaction in 5 10 seconds 500 μl samples were taken and immediately quenched by 10 μl of 1 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride to be analyzed by an agilent 1260 high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a diode array detector most experiments were conducted with phenol as the probe compound because it is known to be easily oxidizable to test if the observed oxygen effect is not unique to phenol caffeine an organic compound that is known to be hardily oxidizable sun et al 2015 was also examined in some experiments for the oxalic acid mno2 system chen et al 2013 200 μm or 10 μm mno2 colloids were prepared by reacting mnso4 h2o with kmno4 at the 2 5 1 molar ratio for 2 h in solution 40 μm phenol was first mixed with 10 mm or 250 μm oxalic acid and then the mixture was added into the above mno2 colloids after all the mno2 was completely dissolved 500 μl samples were taken and immediately quenched by 10 μl of 1 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride for hplc analysis for the kmno4 mn2 system jiang et al 2009 2010 40 μm phenol was first mixed with 300 μm mn2 and 60 μm kmno4 was then added after the color of kmno4 had disappeared 500 μl samples were also taken and also immediately quenched by hydroxylamine hydrochloride all oxidation experiments were conducted in duplicates for hplc analysis 20 μl samples were injected and separated by an agilent zorbax rx c18 column 150 4 6 mm particle size 5 μm maintained at 40 c with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the mobile phase was composed of methanol and water 60 40 v v the wavelength for phenol and caffeine was set at 270 nm and 273 nm respectively the percentage of conversion of the organic compounds was calculated from the following equation conversion c 0 organics initial ct organics left c 0 organics initial 100 2 3 effect of do on mn iii reactivity to ensure a strict oxygen free environment all anoxic experiments were conducted in a coy glove box 2 5 h2 in n2 equipped with pd catalysts to ensure all o2 to be reduced by h2 to water such an environment is referred to as in nitrogen hereafter the same procedure as above in air was followed in the glove box for the investigation of the effects of dissolved oxygen do on phenol oxidation 40 μm phenol was first mixed with 250 μm nahso3 the solution was then bubbled with helium gas at different flow rates to achieve different do contents the do contents were measured by an accumet xl40 do detector after the do meter reading became stable 50 μm kmno4 was added after seconds samples were taken to be analyzed by hplc 2 4 analysis of nahso3 h and do contents for the reaction of nahso3 with either kmno4 or mn2 in the absence of phenol in nitrogen or in air 10 μm kmno4 or mnso4 was mixed with 250 μm nahso3 after 1 min of reaction in air samples were taken to be immediately analyzed by uv vis for the reaction in nitrogen samples were taken and sealed with parafilm before removing from the glovebox to protect them from oxidation by air and then immediately analyzed by uv vis the details for nahso3 detection by uv vis are in si text s1 in the reactions of nahso3 with either kmno4 or mn2 in air or in nitrogen an okaton ph 150 probe and or an accumet xl40 do probe was first immersed into 250 μm nahso3 solution in the reactions of nahso3 with mno2 mno2 colloids were first prepared as described in section 2 2 and the solution ph was adjusted by naoh addition to 4 77 to ensure the same initial ph as in 250 μm nahso3 when the reaction proceeded in the presence of phenol different amounts of phenol were first mixed with 250 μm nahso3 and then the ph do probes were immersed into the solution to minimize lag time in the measurements all ph and do measurements were conducted under constant stirring after the ph do readings became stable in the initial solutions 10 μm kmno4 or mn2 was added into the above solution and the ph do change was recorded with time additional details for ph and do analysis are in text s2 because the reaction was very fast a video camera was used to record the ph do changes and played at a slow motion afterward for the readings to ensure the accuracy of the data all experiments were conducted in duplicates the h and do consumptions were calculated by the following equations h consumption h initial h left do consumption do initial do left 2 5 uv vis analysis for mno2 formation for mno2 formation various amounts of organic compounds kmno4 and nahso3 were used depending on different purposes typically 250 μm nahso3 and 50 μm kmno4 reacted in the presence or absence of a certain amount of phenol after 20 s the solution was analyzed by uv vis the broad peak at 300 500 nm was attributed to the presence of mno2 colloids soldatova et al 2017 sun et al 2015 although the formed mno2 colloids were not soluble in water they can form relative stable suspension due to their small initial sizes hence mno2 formation could be analyzed by uv vis giving a broad peak at 300 500 nm the intensity of the mno2 peaks was used to qualitatively analyze mno2 colloid concentrations the higher the intensity was the higher the concentration of mno2 3 results and discussion 3 1 the o2 effect on mn iii reactivity to investigate the o2 effect on the oxidation ability of the nahso3 kmno4 system a series of reactions were separately conducted in nitrogen and in air fig 1 a shows that in nitrogen no organic compounds were oxidized at the time scale of seconds 0 conversion for all reactions while in air 18 85 of the organic compounds were converted under different conditions these differences obviously resulted from the availability of o2 as the absence of o2 led to the inactivation of nahso3 kmno4 toward organic compounds oxidation such inactivation was not specific to ratios of nahso3 kmno4 2 1 vs 5 1 initial ph phin 4 77 vs 3 5 or organic species phenol vs caffeine and amounts 20 μm vs 40 μm to exclude the potential interference of h2 in glove box to the observed oxygen effects two different levels of h2 2 5 and 1 0 were first controlled in the glovebox and the results in table s2 indicate that the nahso3 kmno4 system remained inactive in oxidizing phenol in both cases then he and h2 were used separately to bubble the solution to maintain the same do content 1 85 mg l the results in table s2 showed that the same amount of phenol was oxidized under both conditions indicating the oxidation activity of nahso3 kmno4 was not affected by the h2 in the glove box to identify the reason for this inactivation we first tested if mn iii can form in nitrogen because mn iii has been well demonstrated to be the origin of the oxidation ability of nahso3 kmno4 sun et al 2015 two methods were used to detect mn iii based on the formation of mno2 and mn iii pp complexes where the later one is a well accepted method to detect mn iii sun et al 2015 because mno2 formation has been proven to be due to mn iii disproportionation its presence can also be used as an indicator for mn iii formation sun et al 2015 2018 we conducted nahso3 kmno4 2 1 ratio reaction in nitrogen based on the stoichiometry in eq 1 to observe if there was mno2 without pp presence or mn iii pp complex with pp presence formed it should be noted that we used 2 1 ratio of nahso3 kmno4 rather than 5 1 because in nitrogen excess nahso3 can further react with mn iii pp to affect its detection fig s3 clearly showed mno2 formation if pp was not present and mn iii pp complex formation when pp was added indicating that mn iii still formed in nitrogen and its formation was not affected by the absence of o2 this finding thus excludes the possibility that the inactivity of nahso3 kmno4 in nitrogen was due to the lack of mn iii formation meanwhile this result also indicates that the formed mn iii in kmno4 nahso3 did not oxidize the organic compounds in nitrogen fig 1a but disproportionated to mno2 and mn2 instead fig s2 this inactivity of mn iii toward organic compounds in nitrogen is very similar to that in the kmno4 mn2 system observed in the preliminary test table s1 however the mn iii in kmno4 mn2 was inactive in the presence of o2 while for mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 it became extremely reactive toward organic compounds in the presence of o2 fig 1a in air hence to unveil how o2 drastically changed the behavior of mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 it became critical to understand why mn iii in nahso3 kmno4 can be so active very recently sun et al also noticed a similar promoting effect of o2 when the removal efficiency of phenol increased with increasing do from 1 0 to 8 0 mg l sun et al 2018 we also observed a similar trend fig 1b however different from our observation that there was 0 conversion in nitrogen they observed minor oxidation of organic compounds with 0 mg l do this difference should be due to the different methods used to control the o2 contents while they used a sealed reactor and flushed the reaction mixture with n2 which may lead to a trace amount of do remaining or leaking in solution our reaction setup in a coy glove box ensured a strict oxygen free environment they explained this o2 effect in that nahso3 reacted with kmno4 to produce so3 radicals which could compete with the organic compounds for mn iii with an increasing amount of do so3 radicals were increasingly consumed by do thus leading to more mn iii to react with the organic compounds sun et al 2018 however there was still mn iii formed in nitrogen as showed above fig s3 the above proposed mechanism cannot explain why this mn iii could not oxidize organic compounds fig 1 hence the o2 effect should be further investigated and reinterpreted 3 2 the reaction between nahso3 and o2 as the bridge to link o2 and mn iii the key to understanding the o2 effect on mn iii reactivity toward organic compounds would be to link the reactivity of mn iii to o2 we started by investigating the reaction between nahso3 and o2 because this reaction can be easily catalyzed by metal ions such as fe2 fe3 and mn2 berglund and elding 1995 berglund et al 1993 connick and zhang 1996 zhang et al 2018 given the formation of mn iii ions during the reaction of nahso3 kmno4 it is likely that mn iii also acted as a catalyst for the reaction between nahso3 and o2 hence we examined if the reaction between nahso3 and o2 can be affected when nahso3 reacted with kmno4 the reaction between nahso3 and o2 is shown in eq 5 based on which the production of h and consumption of o2 and hso3 would indicate the reaction occurred 5 2hso3 o2 2h 2so4 2 without adding kmno4 nahso3 was relatively stable in air in 1 min because there was negligible production of h and negligible consumption of o2 and hso3 even in the presence of 10 μm mn2 as the catalyst fig 2 however after adding 10 μm kmno4 the color of kmno4 disappeared immediately due to its reduction by nahso3 eq 1 followed by fast h production and o2 and hso3 consumption in a short period fig 2 h formation as an indicator for nahso3 consumption because it is from nahso3 oxidation as shown in eq 5 these results strongly indicate that eq 5 proceeded at a fast rate for comparison if the reaction in eq 5 did not occur the reaction between nahso3 and kmno4 would consume h rather than produce h as shown in eq 6 here mn2 is the final product because nahso3 250 μm was in large excess and could reduce all kmno4 10 μm to mn3 and finally to mn2 additional evidence in si text s3 6 5hso3 2mno4 h 5so4 2 2mn2 3h2o also shown in fig 2a h concentration decreased when the same reaction was conducted in nitrogen that is the reaction in eq 5 did not occur another evidence for the fast reaction in eq 5 is the amount of nahso3 consumed based on the stoichiometry in eq 6 only 25 μm nahso3 can be consumed by 10 μm kmno4 at most as observed in nitrogen while in air over 230 μm nahso3 was consumed fig 2c the much larger amount of nahso3 consumed can only be explained by the additional reaction with o2 however as mentioned above the reaction between nahso3 and o2 could not proceed so fast even in the presence of mn2 as the catalyst thus there must be new species acting as a much more efficient catalyst than mn2 for the reaction in eq 5 before concluding mn iii is the catalyst however we should first exclude all other possible species 3 3 mn iii as the catalyst for the reaction between nahso3 and o2 the candidates for the catalyst for eq 5 included mn iii mn iv o2 mn v mn vi and mno4 upon mixing nahso3 with kmno4 in air h started to form at 130 ms fig 2a inset note that although the ph reading had not stabilized within 130 ms it had started to respond to the rapid change in solution ph in 130 ms so the h release should have started before 130 ms this was earlier than the reported time for mno2 appearance 200 ms sun et al 2015 which implies that the catalytic effect already existed before mno2 formation this result can exclude mno2 as the catalyst mn v and mn vi species preferred to form in basic media ladbury and cullis 1958 while the initial solution was acidic phin 4 77 and h continued to form through eq 5 thus leading to a more acidic environment moreover previous research did not observe their uv vis absorbance at 660 and 610 nm hassan and belal 2002 simandi et al 1984 respectively during the reaction between nahso3 and kmno4 sun et al 2015 therefore mn v and mn vi species were also excluded as the catalyst to exclude mno4 as the catalyst and to support the above conclusions that mn iv o2 mn v and mn vi were not the catalyst the mno2 nahso3 system was investigated because it also showed fast oxidation ability for organic compounds and mn iii was also believed to be responsible for this reactivity sun et al 2015 the results are shown in fig 2 similar to nahso3 kmno4 the catalytic effect for eq 5 i e generation of h and consumption of nahso3 and o2 was also observed in mno2 nahso3 but at slower rates if mno2 were the catalyst the reaction rates of h nahso3 and o2 should be comparable or smaller in nahso3 kmno4 than in nahso3 mno2 because of the smaller amount of mno2 formed in the former therefore mno2 can be indeed excluded as the catalyst in addition there is no mno4 mn vi or mn v in mno2 nahso3 so they can be excluded as the catalyst as well because mn2 did not show any catalytic effect for eq 5 within the time scale of seconds fig 2 the only possible species left in mno2 nahso3 is mn iii moreover we excluded the possibility of kmno4 and mno2 as the catalyst for hso3 o2 reaction based on theoretical analysis si text s4 the slower production rate of h in mno2 nahso3 was mainly attributed to the slower generation rate of mn iii in mno2 nahso3 than in kmno4 nahso3 sun et al 2015 this was reflected in the slower oxidation of organic compounds by mno2 nahso3 than by kmno4 nahso3 although still significantly faster than many conventional oxidants sun et al 2015 in other words such differences in the catalytic reaction rates did not result from different catalytic species but from the generation rates of the catalyst i e mn iii moreover the catalytic role of mn iii can be well supported by previous research where even a trace amount of mn iii 4 10 8 m could significantly catalyze hso3 o2 reaction berglund et al 1993 connick and zhang 1996 fronaeus et al 1998 this was believed to be because mn iii participated in the rate limiting chain initiation reaction to form so3 radicals so the radical chain reactions in hso3 o2 are largely enhanced berglund et al 1993 another evidence for the mn iii catalyst role in eq 5 is the observed mno2 formation in the presence of a large excess of nahso3 based on eq 6 when the ratio of nahso3 kmno4 is greater than 2 5 1 where nahso3 is in large excess all kmno4 should be reduce to mn2 so no mno2 would form indeed when 5 1 ratio of nahso3 and kmno4 reacted in nitrogen no mno2 formed fig 3 a however when the same reaction proceeded in air mno2 formed even when there was only 20 μm kmno4 versus 250 μm nahso3 and the mno2 amount increased with kmno4 concentration fig 3b this can be well explained by mn iii acting as a catalyst for eq 5 thus not consumed so that nahso3 was catalytically oxidized by o2 once all nahso3 had been oxidized by o2 the mn iii then disproportionated to mn2 and mno2 in other words even though nahso3 was used in large excess as long as mn iii acted as a catalyst for eq 5 mno2 would always form with the above evidence we have established the catalytic role of mn iii for eq 5 scheme 1 and eq 7 for the trend in h change with time fig 2a it can be obviously divided into two stages the first stage shows a sharp increase milliseconds fig 2a inset and the next shows a much slower increase in previous research mno2 appeared to form at about 200 ms due to mn iii disproportionation sun et al 2015 2018 indicating mn iii can only exist transiently in a short period hence the sharp increase in h in the initial reaction time was due to the fast oxidation of nahso3 by o2 with mn iii as the catalyst once mn iii started to disproportionate the catalytic reaction between nahso3 and o2 became much slower therefore increase in h became slower in the second stage 3 4 nahso3 and o2 as catalysts for the reaction between mn iii and phenol after the mn iii catalytic role for eq 7 has been established scheme 1 we can see that when o2 is not present the reaction in eq 7 cannot occur so mn iii cannot act as a catalyst while with o2 mn iii acts as a catalyst this characteristic is very similar to the observed o2 dependent oxidation ability of mn iii toward organic compounds i e without o2 mn iii lost its oxidation ability while with o2 its oxidation ability resumed based on this we proposed that only the mn iii with this catalytic role can exhibit oxidation activity toward organic compounds to prove this hypothesis we investigated the effect of phenol concentration on both the mn iii catalytic role and its oxidant role and found mn iii that could oxidize organic compounds was indeed catalytically involved in eq 7 as shown in fig s4 with an increase in phenol concentration there was an increasing amount of phenol consumed as a result of more mn iii reaction with phenol less mn iii was available to catalyze eq 7 so there is a decreasing amount of h released fig 4 a this h change may also come from the reaction between mn iii and phenol but because the amount of phenol consumed was small 6 μm in fig s4 we believe the major source of h is eq 7 moreover the same decreasing trend was observed in do consumption with increasing phenol fig 4b confirming eq 7 was inhibited these results strongly indicate that 1 the mn iii with the catalytic role for eq 7 was the oxidant for phenol and 2 mn iii was the catalyst for eq 7 because the more it was consumed by phenol the less the catalytic effect became why can mn iii with this catalytic role oxidize organic compounds to address this question we have to first recognize that when mn iii is involved in eq 7 as the catalyst it obtained two characteristics 1 it is protected from being reduced by nahso3 because catalysts are not consumed in the same reaction and 2 its disproportionation to mn2 and mno2 is somehow inhibited so it can react transiently in an unknown way the specific catalytic process is yet unknown it is likely that in the catalytic process mn iii is stabilized by some sulfur based species transiently thus showing the millisecond oxidation ability toward organic compounds this is very similar to the cases when mn iii was stabilized by ligands to oxidize organic compounds as mentioned in introduction anderson and kochi 1970 gao et al 2018 jiang et al 2009 gao et al also proved the feasibility of mn iii to form reactive complexes with reduced sulfur species gao et al 2017 the specific mn iii species formed in the catalytic process however remains unknown and should be further investigated for now the attempts to identify such transient intermediates failed due to their highly unstable nature based on these results we can establish the relationship between mn iii s catalytic role for eq 7 and its oxidant role for organic compounds as shown in scheme 2 a and eq 8 in short the mn iii that can oxidize organic compounds is the one involved catalytically in eq 7 on the other hand fig 4 suggests that it is reasonable to see nahso3 o2 as a catalyst for the reaction between mn iii and organic compounds because 1 nahso3 and o2 were originally consumed in the mn iii catalyzed reaction in milliseconds fig 2a inset but they were decreasingly consumed once mn iii had reacted with phenol fig 4 2 without o2 to oxidize nahso3 mn iii could not oxidize phenol fig 1a these two features fit well to the catalyst definition as catalysts are not consumed in one reaction but without them the reaction cannot proceed or proceeds very slowly based on the above results a new reaction mechanism was proposed in scheme 2b where nahso3 and o2 act as catalysts for the reaction between mn iii and organic compounds when comparing scheme 2a vs 2b one interesting phenomenon is that there exists a catalytic role exchange phenomenon between mn iii and nahso3 o2 where mn iii acted as the catalyst for eq 7 in the absence of organic compounds while nahso3 and o2 acted as the catalyst for eq 8 in the presence of organic compounds 3 5 possible species that can complex with or activate mn iii based on the new mechanism mn iii is only involved catalytically in nahso3 o2 reaction and it can oxidize organic compounds using nahso3 o2 as the catalyst we also proposed that during the reaction of nahso3 o2 some species might form to have the ability to stabilize mn iii transiently these species are most likely sulfur based species in the reaction of kmno4 nahso3 o2 sun et al have investigated this reaction in detail and reported that so3 can directly form from hso3 oxidation by mno4 and then be further oxidized by o2 to so5 sun et al 2018 the obtained so5 can react with hso3 to produce hso5 and so3 while hso5 can react with hso3 to produce so4 2 and so4 das 2001 sun et al 2015 based on recent research sun et al 2018 the possible sulfur species include both stable ones hso3 so4 2 hso5 and unstable radicals so5 so4 and so3 because of the observed do effect the species that may complex activate mn iii should be the ones that are generated when o2 is involved thus so3 can be first excluded because it can be directly produced by the reaction between hso3 and kmno4 which is independent of o2 so4 2 also can be excluded because in nitrogen so4 2 was also produced as the final oxidation product of hso3 the remaining possible species include so5 so4 hso3 and hso5 although we had excluded the possibility of hso3 mn iii as the oxidant as proposed gao et al 2017 it is still possible that the ternary system hso3 mn iii o2 acted as the oxidant in the same way the ternary system so4 2 mn iii o2 may also be the reactive species to check this possibility we used kmno4 to react with mn2 to produce free mn iii in the presence of so4 2 in air in this way free mn iii so4 2 and o2 co existed to form a so4 2 mn iii o2 ternary system however we did not observe any phenol oxidation in a short period table s2 thus excluding this possibility the ternary nahso3 mn iii o2 system however cannot be verified in the same way because hso3 can react with kmno4 hso5 is a strong oxidant and its oxidation of organic compounds can be catalyzed by metal ions anipsitakis et al 2006 we did not test this possibility because the results would be unreliable also it is difficult to verify the possibility of so5 and so4 due to their highly unstable nature for the potential contribution of these radicals to direct phenol oxidization sun et al had excluded this possibility by using mn2 to catalyze the reaction of nahso3 and o2 in the presence of phenol sun et al 2015 because a significant amount of radicals was detected yet no phenol was degraded the authors believed that the radicals in nahso3 o2 reaction had no direct contribution to phenol oxidation given the complexity of this system further research is needed to elucidate the more detailed mechanism of the mno4 hso3 o2 system 3 6 validation of the new mechanism to validate a new mechanism one needs to address all the well interpreted phenomena by previous mechanisms but more importantly to resolve the phenomena that cannot be reasonably interpreted by previous mechanisms here the effects of four factors including nahso3 kmno4 ratio kmno4 amount phenol concentration and do level were investigated as shown in fig 5 the phenomena that cannot be well explained by the previous mechanisms include the effects of nahso3 kmno4 ratio and do for the ratio effect the original mechanism eqs 1 4 implied that the highest conversion of organic compounds should be at the 2 1 ratio of nahso3 kmno4 eq 1 because no nahso3 would be left to compete with the organic compounds for mn iii eq 4 sun et al 2015 this is however not consistent with the experimental results where the highest phenol conversion was obtained at the ratio of 6 5 1 fig 5a although an updated mechanism was recently proposed by sun et al based on the findings about the promoting effect of o2 it still cannot effectively explain this ratio effect specifically with an increasing ratio of nahso3 kmno4 the mechanism would predict more so3 radicals produced because the radicals would compete with the organic compounds for mn iii it would decrease the oxidation efficiency which is clearly contradictory to the experimental observations to explain this ratio effect gao et al proposed that mn iii needed extra hso3 to form complexes as the oxidant gao et al 2017 but this hypothesis cannot explain the oxygen effect fig 1 based on our new mechanism nahso3 is part of the catalysts for mn iii organics oxidation with its concentration increasing ratio 2 1 to 6 5 1 phenol conversion should increase as indeed observed fig 5a further increase in nahso3 concentration 6 5 1 to 16 1 would lead to mn iii loss by eq 4 thus leading to decreased phenol conversion 85 40 fig 5a note that the decreased phenol conversion at higher ratios is not due to do having been exhausted fig s5 on the other hand mno2 formation decreased gradually with increasing ratio fig 5b because additional mn iii had been consumed by reacting either with phenol at the ratio 2 1 to 6 5 1 or with nahso3 at the ratio 6 5 1 to 16 1 at the higher ratios of 6 5 1 to 16 1 the mn iii was mainly reduced by excess nahso3 because 1 the decreasing amounts of mno2 formed indicate less mn iii had disproportionated and 2 the mn iii that did not disproportionate did not oxidize phenol either as shown by the decreased phenol conversion at higher ratios fig 5a for the o2 effects the previous mechanisms proposed by both sun et al and gao et al cannot effectively explain them as discussed above however based on our mechanism when o2 was first introduced into the anoxic system mn iii started to assume the catalytic role for eq 7 thus phenol started to be oxidized fig 1b with increasing do content 0 7 mg l the reaction in eq 7 would proceed increasingly faster so that more mn iii was catalytically involved in eq 7 leading to increased phenol conversion fig 1b from the catalyst point of view because o2 is part of the catalysts for the reaction between mn iii and organic compounds it is anticipated and observed that the increased concentration of do led to enhanced phenol conversion fig 1b moreover this enhancing effect of o2 would eventually level off because the reaction rate is also limited by the fixed amount of nahso3 as observed when do concentration increased from 7 0 to 9 66 mg l fig 1b for the phenomena that had been well explained by the previous mechanisms our proposed mechanism also can well explain them first for the effect of phenol concentration an increasing amount of phenol was oxidized with increasing phenol initial concentration while the amount of mno2 formed decreased fig 5c and d increasing phenol would increase the reaction rate of eq 8 so there was an increasing amount of phenol oxidized and hence more mn iii consumed also the amount of mno2 formed gradually decreasing is expected based on less mn iii remain to undergo disproportionation second when kmno4 amount was increased phenol conversion first increased due to the increasing amount of mn iii formed but then leveled off because of the limited amount of nahso3 available as the catalyst fig 5e the effect of nahso3 availability is shown in fig 5a where at 50 μm kmno4 increasing nahso3 amount led to higher phenol conversion the amount of mno2 formed also gradually increased with increasing kmno4 fig 5f due to increasing amounts of mn iii formed when comparing fig 5f to 3b it is obvious that there was more mno2 formed in the absence of phenol therefore the addition of phenol effectively suppressed mno2 formation because the mno2 precursor i e mn iii had been consumed by phenol this observation has also been reported previously sun et al 2015 4 conclusions in conclusion this study revealed why mn iii in the nahso3 kmno4 system was so active in oxidizing organic compounds this is mainly because of mn iii s catalytic role for the reaction between nahso3 and o2 in the catalytic cycle mn iii became very reactive in oxidizing organic compounds in milliseconds and also disproportionated to mn2 and mno2 in the absence of o2 however mn iii lost this catalytic role due to the lack of the reaction between nahso3 and o2 thus mn iii only disproportionated the facile disproportionation of mn iii is common for mn iii in other systems that can generate mn iii as an intermediate while the millisecond oxidation of organic compound is unique for nahso3 kmno4 hence in most cases the traditional way of using mn iii i e complexing with ligands still holds however in nahso3 kmno4 the specific process of how mn iii catalyzed the reaction between nahso3 and o2 and how such mn iii oxidized organic compounds still remain unknown which warrant further research this is also the first case about catalytic role exchange between mn iii catalyst for the reaction between nahso3 and o2 in the absence of organic compounds and nahso3 o2 catalyst for the reaction between mn iii and organic compounds in the presence of organic compounds discovering the critical role of oxygen in nahso3 kmno4 and having a correct understanding of the reaction mechanism will enable us to design more cost effective systems based on this new exciting technology for engineering applications such as water and wastewater treatment
