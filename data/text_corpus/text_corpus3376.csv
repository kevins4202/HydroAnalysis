16880,light energy and oxygen drive photo oxidation of dissolved organic carbon doc the longer the wavelength the greater its depth of penetration into water changing the spectral environment with depth we asked how oxygen concentration and light spectral composition might affect photo oxidation processes in doc outdoor experiments compared responses of fluorescence and absorbance indices to photo oxidation of filtered 0 45 µm rio negro water amazon basin under near anoxia normoxia and hyperoxia exposed to natural sunlight or reduced sunlight 340 reduced uvr near anoxia decreased all absorbance and fluorescence indices absorbance changed across the spectrum 250 nm even under reduced uvr provided that oxygen was present this phenomenon maintains broader photo oxidation and the release of co2 at depth slope350 400 was responsive to changes in the irradiance field but not to oxygen concentration while slope275 295 responded to both thus larger molecules are broken down near the water s surface and medium to smaller molecules continue to be processed at depth the production of fulvic acid like fluorescence required both uvb and oxygen restricting its production to surface waters the relatively small increase in r254 365 compared with the loss of suva254 under near anoxia indicated a slower breakdown of larger doc molecules as oxygen becomes limiting breakdown of larger molecules which absorb in the 350 400 nm range appears to involve two steps one by radiant energy and another involving oxygen the study results reflect the dynamic gradients in photo oxidation with

line of no effect image graphical abstract keywords areal photo oxidation fluorescence absorbance amazon rio negro 1 introduction photo oxidation is the breakdown of molecular compounds by the energy contained in light both ultraviolet radiation uvr uva 320 400 nm and uvb 280 320 nm wavelengths and photosynthetically active radiation par 400 700 nm wavelengths contribute to the photo oxidation of dissolved organic carbon doc each wavelength carries a specific level of energy which is an inverse function of wavelength the shorter the wavelength the higher the energy content in terms of co2 production in natural waters uva and par are equally important 37 44 while ubv is less important 15 17 granéli et al 1998 zhang and xie 2015 the proportionate contribution will vary with doc composition for instance wang et al 2009 using suwannee river humic acid alone found a ratio of 31 8 32 6 to 25 6 for ubv uva par these data indicate that uvb may be particularly important in breaking down the larger humic molecules the contribution of uvr and par to photo oxidation will change with depth the depth of penetration of radiant light energy into water is a function of radiation intensity and wavelength the longer the wavelength the greater the depth of potential penetration kirk 1994 penetration is attenuated by the processes of absorbance and scattering in an approximately exponentially manner kirk 1994 absorbance reduces the intensity of radiation plankton dissolved organic and inorganic matter and water absorb uvr and par kirk 1994 scattering decreases the downward intensity by redirecting light above and lateral to the line of descent scattering is a function of colloidal and particle density size and shape kirk 1994 due to the nature of light and these processes gradients in photon concentration and radiant energy are established in the water column higher photon concentrations particularly of the more energetic uvb occur near the surface lower photon concentrations mainly of the lower energy par occur at depth we know that the rate of complete photo oxidation production of co2 decreases with depth e g granéli et al 1996 johannsson et al 2020 we might expect that the greater loss of uvr with depth also affects the processes of photo oxidation of doc photo oxidation of doc usually involves the incorporation of oxygen lindell and rai 1994 amon and brenner 1996 patel sorrentino et al 2004 xie et al 2004 cory et al 2014 unsaturated carbon bonds of aromatic compounds are broken by radiant energy either directly or through the production and activity of reactive oxygen species ros and excited electrons with the incorporation of oxygen and hydrogen vähätalo et al 1999 gonsior et al 2009 cory et al 2010 ward and cory 2016 mckay 2020 most of the incorporated oxygen comes directly from the environment cory et al 2010 oxygen is one of a number of variables that influences the rates of photo oxidation and how doc is degraded gao and zepp 1998 lou et al 2006 helms et al 2008 gonsior et al 2009 zhang and xie 2015 the total amount of oxygen consumed by photo oxidation is not negligible but approximates the amount released as co2 e g amon and benner 1996 xie et al 2004 the present study extends this work by examining the relationship between oxygen concentration and structural degradation of doc with particular emphasis on how this relationship changes with changes in the radiation field with depth the question is not trivial low oxygen concentrations in surface waters are common in freshwater and nearshore environments wu 2002 smith et al 2006 diaz and breitburg 2009 they can occur both naturally and due to anthropogenic activities e g daniel et al 2002 in the amazon basin where this study was undertaken oxygen concentrations are typically greater than 3 mg o2 l 1 richey et al 1990 rasera et al 2013 johannsson et al 2017 however oxygen levels between 0 8 and 2 6 mg o2 l 1 have been observed in surface waters during the day at various times during the year amaral et al 2019 supplementary table s1 in the jutaí and purus rivers minimum values of 1 9 and 1 3 mg o2 l 1 were observed during falling waters in the jutaí juruá and purus rivers minimum values ranged from 1 9 to 2 4 mg o2 l 1 during rising waters richey et al 1990 in the rio negro near barcelos oxygen levels of 1 5 to 2 6 mg

near river lakes during falling water val and almeida val 1995 photo oxidation of doc comprises numerous chemical reactions involving the breakdown of molecules with the incorporation of oxygen and increase in unsaturated bonds until eventually co2 and co are produced we hypothesize that these various chemical reactions will be differentially affected by oxygen concentration and radiant energy species uvb uva par and that these variables of oxygen and radiation may interact likely through the movement of excited electrons and ros given these thoughts and the opportunity for photo oxidation of doc to occur under conditions ranging from hypoxic anoxic to hyperoxic and under complete surface and reduced at depth radiation fields the objective of the present study was to determine the relationships between oxygen concentration radiation field and photo oxidation we monitored the changes in doc structure under full spectrum natural light and under reduced uvr exposure no uvb at three oxygen exposures near anoxia normoxia and hyperoxia using absorbance and fluorescence spectrophotometry 2 methods experiments with rio negro water were conducted outdoors at the instituto nacional de pesquisas da amazônia inpa in brazil in december 2015 and october 2018 experimental water was collected from the center of the river channel upstream of manaus 56 km above the confluence of the solimões and rio negro rivers which form the amazon river the same location used by johannsson et al 2020 water was filtered through 0 45 µm polyethersulfone or cellulose acetate filters and stored at 4 c the experimental protocols of johannsson et al 2020 were followed and are briefly described in supplementary materials only information specific to this study is presented here conditions during each experiment are found in table 1 2 1 light complete and partial light exposures were obtained by using two different experimental vessels quartz tubes and flint bottles transmission of uvr and par through 1 5 mm thick quartz glass is 92 techinical glass products 2020 http www technicalglass com fused quartz transmission html uvr transmission through flint quartz was reduced increasing from 0 at 300 nm to 82 for wavelengths 350 nm fig 12 in dias et al 2010 the quartz tubes were 1 8 cm in diameter with a volume of 35 ml the flint bottles were 5 cm in diameter with a volume of 120 ml uvr reaching the center of the quartz tubes was 56 of subsurface radiation while that of the flint bottles was 31 the estimates were based on beer lambert absorbance decay of sample initial absorbance values and assumed equal quantities of photons at all wavelengths 2 2 oxygen treatments filtered water was warmed to experimental temperature 30 c oxygen content was adjusted by bubbling with nitrogen air or oxygen oxygen concentration was measured using a microx tx3 presens precision sensing gmbh regensburg germany www presens de 2018 or a ysi 55 dissolved oxygen probe ysi xylem rye brook ny usa 2015 water was siphoned into each quartz tube or bottle until overflowing in order to maintain the oxygen concentration three oxygen treatments were run near anoxia 0 3 mgo2 l

recommended standards and ultrapure water blanks were run at the same time in 2015 absorbance profiles were collected from 250 to 550 nm at 10 nm intervals on a spectramax plus 384 spectrophotometer molecular devices sunnyvale ca 94 089 usa using a 1 cm pathlength quartz cuvette fluorescence emission profiles were measured from 250 to 550 nm at 10 nm intervals using four excitation wavelengths 250 300 325 and 370 nm using the spectramax plus 384 spectrophotometer and fluorescence software in 2018 fluorescence and absorbance data were measured similarly using a horiba aqualog horiba ltd kyoto japan ultrapure water blanks were run each day for all spectrophotometric work spectrophotometric indices were used to follow changes in doc composition table 2 two measures track the decrease in aromatic hydrocarbons suva254 the absorbance at 254 nm normalized to doc is correlated with total aromaticity and molecular weight abbt braun et al 2004 chowdhury 2013 sac340 the absorbance

al 1996 johannsson et al 2017 degradation of larger molecules into smaller molecules is captured in the slope indices absorbance data plotted against wavelength decline in a roughly exponential function the natural log of the absorbance data is basically straight over narrow ranges the slope of the linear regression of the ln data calculated over the wavelength range 275 295 nm slope275 295 correlates with mean molecular weight changes in this slope and slope350 400 reflect shifts in the proportion of smaller to larger molecules in these portions of the curve helms et al 2008 during photo oxidation slope275 295 becomes steeper and slope350 400 flattens helms et al 2008 two fluorescence metrics captured major portions of the humic acid like ha and fulvic acid like fa moieties table 3 consistently in rio negro waters johannsson et al 2020 the metrics sum the emission profiles across specific segments of each of the four excitation wavelengths measured table 3 these summed metrics can be compared across treatments in order to characterize changes in the doc composition and structure the loss of fluorescence can be due to either destruction of the fluorophore and or change in its redox state photo oxidation pushes fluorophores towards a more oxidized state which has a diminished fluorescence and shifts the location of the maximum emission toward smaller wavelengths cory and mcknight 2005 therefore changes in location of the maximum emission were noted 2 4 data analysis for all indices the light exposed values were subtracted from the average dark value for each treatment to determine the change due to photo oxidation δvalues each treatment had equal numbers of light and dark replicates thus positive δvalues are a loss or decrease in the index and negative δvalues are a gain or increase in the index the use of parametric or non parametric tests was determined by normality shapiro wilk normality test and equality of variance bartlet s test tests parametric tests included one way analysis of variance followed by tukey s multiple comparisons test or a student s t test if only two treatments were compared non parametric tests included the kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance followed by dunn s multiple comparison test or the mann whitney u test when two treatments were compared the significance level of 0 05 was accepted means are reported 1 sem n unless otherwise noted all analyses were carried out in graphpad prism 7 or 8 graphpad software inc ca usa www graphpad com scientific software prism 3 results significant changes in absorbance were observed at all wavelengths and treatments with the exception of reduced uvr near anoxia in that treatment dark control and light exposed absorbances were not statistically different at wavelengths 290 nm and 340 nm based on one tailed t tests 3 1 absorbance indices oxygen limitation of photo oxidative breakdown of doc was evident under near anoxia in all absorbance indices suva254 sac340 sacka310 and r254 365 fig 1 a d fig 2 a d suva254 sac340 and sacka310 decreased by 30 to 40 under complete uvr r254 365 was the exception decreasing by 65 only sac340 and sacka310 showed significant decreases in absorbance under reduced uvr table 4 these losses were 55 lower than those under complete uvr absorbance losses were not significantly different between normoxic and hyperoxic treatments figs 1a d 2a d to better visualize the impacts of lower oxygen concentrations across the absorbance spectrum mean light absorbance was subtracted from mean dark absorbance for each measured wavelength from 250 to 400 nm for both the complete and reduced uvr treatments fig 3 a b the percentage loss of absorbance under normoxia and near anoxia δabsorbance dark controls 100 was calculated fig 3c the ratio of δnear anoxia δnormoxia was calculated for each wavelength from the data of figs 3a and b and a composite graph was created of these data fig 4 under complete uvr the pattern of loss of absorbance across wavelengths under normoxia and near anoxia were similar but quantitatively different fig 3a curves n and n a three distinct regions were observed in the profile 250 270 nm 270 300 nm and 300 400 nm fig 3a profiles of the percentage loss in absorbance did not follow the same patterns as the profiles of absorbance loss against wavelength instead the curves increased to a maximum near 300 nm and then declined fig 3c reduced uvr responses showed much greater dependence on the presence of oxygen than the responses under complete uvr as seen by the difference between the normoxic and near anoxic responses in each uvr treatment figs 3a and b under reduced uvr the pattern of absorbance loss under normoxia extended to the lower wavelengths thus making it appear similar to absorbance losses under complete uvr figs 3a and b curves n closer inspection revealed a hollowing out of the curve between 250 300 nm the pattern of absorbance loss under near anoxia reduced uvr was not extended to lower wavelengths but was greatly collapsed especially at the shortest wavelengths 250 to 280 nm fig 3b curve n a curve n a fig 3b then increased to a shallow peak between 300 320 nm also seen in the normoxic curve absorbance losses in hyperoxia were greater than in normoxia under reduced uvr but less than those in normoxia in complete uvr figs 3a and b the absorbance ratios provided a clearer picture of the role of oxygen and uvr the flat upper line labelled a in fig 4 at 1 0 is hypothetical and represents a line of no impact of near anoxia on absorbance loss curve b is the ratio of δnear anoxia δnormoxia for doc exposed to complete uvr and curve c is the ratio of δnear anoxia δnormoxia for doc exposed to reduced uvr wavelengths 350 nm the top area a is the proportionate loss in photo oxidation due to lack of oxygen across wavelengths from 250 to 400 nm the area b c is the proportion of photo oxidation that remains under complete uvr and lack of oxygen and c is the proportion of photo oxidation that remains across wavelengths under reduced uvr and lack of oxygen the δnear anoxia δnormoxia ratios under complete uvr were similar along the absorbance spectrum from 250 to 360 nm with a slight decline as of 300 nm and a steeper decline above 360 nm under reduced uvr the ratios were low 0 10 0 15 from 250 to 280 nm because no significant change in absorbance occurred in the near anoxia treatment a peak in the ratio occurred between 300 and 340 nm followed by a steep decline 3 2 slope indices changes in the slope indices differed between the complete uvr and the reduced uvr exposures note that all initial slopes were negative thus as a slope becomes more negative the δslope is positive and vice versa under complete uvr exposure the steepness of slope275 295 increased became more negative in all treatments but more so with oxygen present fig 5 a slope350 400 became more positive flatter with no significant differences among oxygen treatments fig 5b under reduced uvr slope275 295 and slope 350 400 were not calculated in the near anoxia treatment because absorbance had not changed significantly throughout the slope region under oxic conditions slope275 295 became steeper and slope350 400 did not change normoxic and hyperoxic slopes were not significantly different figs 5c and d 3 3 fluorescence redox state can affect the intensity of fluorescence and the location of maximum fluorescence cory and mcknight 2005 dark control fluorescence intensities and maxima did not change across oxygen treatments except for an increase in fluorescence in 2018 at 370 nm data not shown nor were there significant differences in the location of maximum fluorescence between the dark control and light treatments with three exceptions 2015 370 nm excitation hyperoxia 2018 300 nm excitation hyperoxia and 2018 300 nm excitation normoxia the lack of noticeable shifts in the other profiles may be due to the 10 nm spacing of emission data two fluorescence indices were monitored during the experiments fa and ha under complete uvr δfa fluorescence saw gains negative or no change except for a loss positive at near anoxia 300 nm excitation figs 6 b and c under reduced uvr δfa fluorescences were equal and positive losses across oxygen concentrations figs 7 b d under both uvr treatments figs 6a c fig 7a d losses positive in δha fluorescence were larger as oxygen concentration increased under complete uvr the increase was gradual under reduced uvr the loss in ha fluorescence was significantly smaller under near anoxia than under normoxia or hyperoxia table 4 figs 6a and c 7a d the ratios of δnear anoxia δnormoxia showed no significant diferences under complete uvr and 26 to 52 losses under reduced uvr table 4 4 discussion 4 1 interaction of oxygen and light in near lack of oxygen photo oxidation is depressed and when coupled with a loss of the shorter uv wavelengths it nearly collapses fig 4 examining the changes in absorbance patterns and indices highlights how oxygen and light interact and where each is most needed for photo oxidation the quality of the results depends on the efficacy of the dark controls which account for all non light driven changes in absorbance bacteria are the principal concern if bacterial populations change at different rates in the light and dark estimates of photo oxidative absorbance loss will be affected we considered possible scenarios and concluded that the dark controls were unlikely to be compromised by changes in bacterial populations supplementary table s1 during photo oxidation radiant energy degrades doc both directly by breaking molecular bonds and indirectly by exciting electrons which can 1 form ros by interacting with oxygen 2 dissipate energy as heat or fluorescence or 3 move to other electron orbits and interactions cooper and klymkowsky 2019 mckay 2020 the most important result of the study was observed in the reduced uvr experiment the δabsorbance profile under normoxic conditions extended back to the shortest wavelengths measured 250 nm even though radiation below 300 nm had been removed and only limited radiation occurred between 300 and 350 nm fig 3b curve n under these conditions the highest levels of absorbance loss still occurred at 320 nm similar to the pattern under complete uvr figs 3a and b curves n del vecchio and blough 2004 made similar observations when they irradiated doc in a glycerol solution with a specific wavelength 266 318 355 390 460 and 535 nm they monitored the loss in absorbance over time from 250 to 550 nm absorbance was lost first at the initiating wavelength and then radiated out at irradiance wavelengths 355 nm the loss of absorbance became broader and extended out beyond 250 nm the patterns were characterized by a slight dip around 254 nm and a consistent peak at 300 nm as seen in our data fig 3a b curves n the spreading out of absorbance loss is a characteristic of doc photo oxidation in reduced uvr near anoxia photo oxidation processes broke down fig 3b curve n a significant loss of absorbance occurred only between 290 and 340 nm fig 3b curve n a this indicates that the extensive loss of absorbance at shorter wavelengths under reduced uvr normoxia was due to processes involving oxygen two possible secondary reactions could explain these patterns either the action of ros or of excited electrons on bonds associated with shorter wavelength absorbance which incorporated oxygen on degradation 4 2 doc processing during photo oxidation we used slope275 295 slope350 400 and the r254 365 to follow the responses in doc processes during photo oxidation namely the degradation of larger molecules into smaller molecules helms et al 2008 we concluded that 1 both uvb radiation and secondary processes involving oxygen contributed to processing doc from larger to smaller molecules along the 275 295 nm absorbance region slope275 295 fig 5a and c 2 breaking down larger aromatic molecules which absorb in the 350 400 nm range is dependent on radiant energy alone oxygen is not involved in changes to slope350 400 fig 5b and d 3 oxygen is involved in their further breakdown as seen by the much higher absorbance losses under normoxia than under near anoxia fig 4 curves b and c and 4 the relatively small change in r254 365 in near anoxia compared with normoxia suggests that the rate of production of smaller molecules is oxygen dependent and reduced compared with their conversion to co2 under near anoxia table 4 in the reduced uvr anoxia treatment δabsorbances in the 340 400 nm region were smaller than expected considering that uva radiation in the bottles was estimated at 56 of sub surface levels methods 2 1 and uva breakdowns doc dahlén et al 1996 senga et al 2018 the lack of change in slope350 400 under normoxia and hyperoxia reduced uvr near anoxia reflect the small δabsorbances fig 5d uva intensity was insufficient to cause slope changes johannsson et al 2020 examined the depth profile of doc absorbance changes due to photo oxidation in their study of the rio negro they used the same experimental procedures as employed in the present study running their experiment in quartz tubes suspended in a pool of rio negro water by re analyzing their data set we were able to examine the changes in δslope275 295 and δslope350 400 within the top 8 cm of the water column if slope350 400 is determined by shorter uvr which penetrates only a few centimeters into the water column then we should see significant changes in δslope350 400 in the upper few centimeters but not deeper in the water column on the other hand if photo oxidation is maintained by oxidative processes when shorter wavelengths no longer penetrate into the water column δslope275 295 should decrease with depth but still change significantly at greater depths than δslope350 400 that is what occurred slope350 400 changed only in the upper few centimeters and was not significantly different from zero as of 5 cm depth fig 8 approximately 5 of uvb and 25 of uva would reach 5 cm depth in the pool based on beer lambert calculations of absorbance loss by wavelength in unfiltered rio negro pool water slope275 295 changed throughout the depth examined fig 8 the importance of changes or lack of changes in slope350 400 are not easy to interpret absorbance slopes characterize the absorbance properties of the underlying doc structure flattening of slope350 400 is associated with shifts in mean molecular weight towards smaller molecules a breakdown of larger molecules helms et al 2008 our data show that slope350 400 is changed by uvr but not oxygen fig 5b and that in the absence of change in slope350 400 absorbance losses continue in the presence of oxygen fig 3b curves h n so how to reconcile a lack of change in slope with continued loss of absorbance change in r254 365 is a measure of the process of photo oxidation r254 365 follows the relative increase in the abundance of smaller molecules as the larger doc molecules are broken down δr254 365 is governed by the relative rates of two photo oxidative processes the loss of small molecules through production of co2 and the replenishment of small molecules through the degradation of larger molecules under complete uvr the majority of absorbance indices and production of co2 were reduced by 30 40 between the normoxic and near anoxia treatments table 4 patel sorrentino et al 2004 johannsson ferreira wood and val unpublished data δr254 365 however was reduced by 65 the relatively small change in r254 365 under near anoxia reflects a change in photo oxidative processes suva254 the numerator of r254 365 was depressed by 39 not enough to explain the 65 drop in r254 365 the absorbance loss at longer wavelengths under near anoxia was less than that of the shorter wavelengths fig 4 curve b indicating that a lack of oxygen reduced the rate of breakdown of larger molecules the imbalance between the losses and gains of small molecules would explain the small δr254 365 this conclusion is supported by helms et al 2008 who observed a 70 smaller increase in smaller molecules and a decreased conversion rate from high to low molecular weight compounds under low oxygen conditions 21 air saturation the above considerations provide insights into how areal m 2 photo oxidation is affected by changing oxygen and uvr conditions with depth under normoxic conditions at depths beyond the penetration of significant amounts of uvb 280 320 nm radiation gradients in uva and par and then just par maintain photo oxidation helms et al 2008 showed that increases in slope275 295 and decreases in slope350 400 tracked conversion of larger to smaller molecules at depth when slope350 400 ceases changing between 5 and 8 cm depth larger molecules in this region are no longer being cleaved into smaller molecules ros and or excited electrons from par maintain the breakdown of molecules across the absorbance spectrum changes in absorbance indices were observed down to 14 cm depth johannsson et al 2020 without par radiation the production of co2 and smaller molecules would quickly be curtailed in the water column under significantly reduced oxygen conditions near or at anoxia photo oxidation would be reduced by approximately a third at the water s surface in the rio negro patel sorrentino et al 2004 table 4 and would collapse with depth as the transmittance of shorter wavelengths is diminished and ros and oxygen are not available to maintain the processes of photo oxidation 4 3 fluorescence photo oxidation in oxygen and light gradients fa and ha fluorophores are affected by different portions of the radiation spectrum in conjunction with oxygen losses of ha fluorescence occurred in all treatments indicating that longer wavelengths are involved figs 6a and c figs 7a b c and d johannsson et al 2020 showed that ha fluorescence was lost to greater depths than changes in absorbance this supports the participation of par in losses of ha fluorescence the significant difference between normoxia and near anoxia under reduced uvr but not complete uvr suggests that uvb may also play some role and that oxygen increases the losses uvb together with oxygen drives gains in fa fluorophores fig 6b and c fa fluorescence losses occurred in situations where uvb was absent figs 7b c and d or oxygen was not present to work in conjunction with uvb fig 7b and c near anoxia senga et al 2018 and dahlén et al 1996 observed losses of fa fluorescence and concentration when only uva was applied during photo oxidation supporting the importance of specifically uvb in production of fa fluorophores the loss of fa fluorescence does not require oxygen or uvb radiation changes in fluorescence are not always indicators of changes in the abundance of fluorophores because their excitation can lead to a change in redox state as well as alteration of the molecule cory and mcknight 2005 in three instances the position of peak fluorescence shifted during photo oxidation toward shorter wavelengths indicative of a more oxidized state in each instance the shift would not affect the results of the experiments this suggests that changes in fluorescence were generally changes in concentration of fluorophores 5 conclusions oxygen and radiation type uvb uva and par interact to control different aspects of photo oxidation of doc oxygen coupled with uva and par radiation are essential to produce ros at depth in the water column the ros maintains photo oxidation across all absorbance wavelengths where penetration of shorter uvr wavelengths decreases without oxygen the processing of larger molecules would be depressed in the 275 295 nm region slopes275 295 and the return of co2 to the atmosphere would be reduced at all depths detailed relationships between oxygen and photo oxidation across oxygen concentrations from anoxia to normoxia are not known and need to be determined the upper surface waters where uvb radiation is high support higher rates of conversion of larger to smaller molecules through the 275 295 nm and 350 400 nm absorbance regions in addition fa like fluorophores were created only in the presence of uvb and oxygen the present day decreases in oxygen in many aquatic environments are likely affecting photo oxidation processes and may impact the global carbon cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

16880,light energy and oxygen drive photo oxidation of dissolved organic carbon doc the longer the wavelength the greater its depth of penetration into water changing the spectral environment with

photo oxidation of filtered 0 45 µm rio negro water amazon basin under near anoxia normoxia and hyperoxia exposed to natural sunlight or reduced sunlight 340 reduced uvr near anoxia decreased all absorbance and fluorescence indices absorbance changed across the spectrum 250 nm even under reduced uvr provided that oxygen was present this phenomenon maintains broader photo oxidation and the release of co2 at depth slope350 400 was responsive to changes in the irradiance field but not to oxygen concentration while slope275 295 responded to both thus larger molecules are broken down near

dissolved organic carbon doc each wavelength carries a specific level of energy which is an inverse function of wavelength the shorter the wavelength the higher the energy content in terms of co2 production in natural waters uva and par are equally important 37 44 while ubv is less important 15 17 granéli et al 1998 zhang and xie 2015 the proportionate contribution will vary with doc composition for instance wang et al 2009 using suwannee river humic acid alone found a ratio of 31 8 32 6 to 25 6 for ubv uva par these data indicate that uvb may be particularly important in breaking down the larger humic molecules the contribution of uvr and par to photo oxidation will change with depth the depth of penetration of radiant light energy into water is a function of radiation intensity and wavelength the longer the wavelength the greater the depth of potential penetration kirk 1994 penetration is attenuated by the processes of absorbance and scattering in an approximately exponentially manner kirk 1994 absorbance reduces the intensity of radiation plankton dissolved organic and inorganic matter and water absorb uvr and par kirk 1994 scattering decreases the downward intensity by redirecting light above and lateral to the line of descent scattering is a function of colloidal and particle density size and shape kirk 1994 due to the nature of light and these processes gradients in photon concentration and radiant energy are established in the water column higher photon concentrations particularly of the more energetic uvb occur near the surface lower photon concentrations mainly of the lower energy par occur at depth we know that the rate of complete photo oxidation production of co2 decreases with depth e g granéli et al 1996 johannsson et al 2020 we might expect that the greater loss of uvr with depth also affects the processes of photo oxidation of doc photo oxidation of doc usually involves the incorporation of oxygen lindell and rai 1994 amon and brenner 1996 patel sorrentino et al 2004 xie et al 2004 cory et al 2014 unsaturated carbon bonds of aromatic compounds are broken by radiant energy either directly or through the production and activity of reactive oxygen species ros and excited electrons with the incorporation of oxygen and hydrogen vähätalo et al 1999 gonsior et al 2009 cory et al 2010 ward and cory 2016 mckay 2020 most of the incorporated oxygen comes directly from the environment cory et al 2010 oxygen is one of a number of variables that influences the rates of photo oxidation and how doc is degraded gao and zepp 1998 lou et al 2006 helms et al 2008 gonsior et al 2009 zhang and xie 2015 the total amount of oxygen consumed by photo oxidation is not negligible but approximates the amount released as co2 e g amon and benner 1996 xie et al 2004 the present study extends this work by examining the relationship between oxygen concentration and structural degradation of doc with particular emphasis on how this relationship changes with changes in the radiation field with depth the question is not trivial low oxygen concentrations in surface waters are common in freshwater and nearshore environments wu 2002 smith et al 2006 diaz and breitburg 2009 they can occur both naturally and due to anthropogenic activities e g daniel et al 2002 in the amazon basin where this study was undertaken oxygen concentrations are typically greater than 3 mg o2 l 1 richey et al 1990 rasera et al 2013 johannsson et al 2017 however oxygen levels between 0 8 and 2 6 mg o2 l 1 have been observed

near river lakes during falling water val and almeida val 1995 photo oxidation of doc comprises numerous chemical reactions involving the breakdown of molecules with the incorporation of oxygen and increase in unsaturated bonds until eventually co2 and co are produced we hypothesize that these various chemical reactions will be differentially affected by oxygen concentration and radiant energy species uvb uva par and that these variables of oxygen and radiation may interact likely through the movement of excited electrons and ros given these thoughts and the opportunity for photo oxidation of doc to occur under conditions ranging from hypoxic anoxic to hyperoxic and under complete surface and reduced at depth radiation fields the objective of the present study was to determine the relationships between oxygen concentration radiation field and photo oxidation we monitored the changes in doc structure under full spectrum natural light and under reduced uvr exposure no uvb at three oxygen exposures near anoxia normoxia and hyperoxia using absorbance and fluorescence spectrophotometry 2 methods experiments with rio negro water were conducted outdoors at the instituto nacional de pesquisas da amazônia inpa in brazil in december 2015 and october 2018 experimental water was collected from the center of the river channel upstream of manaus 56 km above the confluence of the solimões and rio negro rivers which form the amazon river the same location used by johannsson et al 2020 water was filtered through 0 45 µm polyethersulfone or cellulose acetate filters and stored at 4 c the experimental protocols of johannsson et al 2020 were followed and are briefly described in supplementary materials only information specific to this study is presented here

a volume of 120 ml uvr reaching the center of the quartz tubes was 56 of subsurface radiation while that of the flint bottles was 31 the estimates were based on beer lambert absorbance decay of sample

xylem rye brook ny usa 2015 water was siphoned into each quartz tube or bottle until overflowing in order to maintain the oxygen concentration three oxygen treatments were run near anoxia 0 3 mgo2 l

al 1996 johannsson et al 2017 degradation of larger molecules into smaller molecules is captured in the slope indices absorbance data plotted against wavelength decline in a roughly exponential function the natural log of the absorbance data is basically straight over narrow ranges the slope of the linear regression of the ln data calculated over the wavelength range 275 295 nm slope275 295 correlates with mean molecular weight changes in this slope and slope350 400 reflect shifts in the proportion of smaller to larger molecules in these portions of the curve helms et al 2008 during photo oxidation slope275 295 becomes steeper and slope350 400 flattens helms et al 2008 two fluorescence metrics captured major portions of the humic acid like ha and fulvic acid like fa moieties table 3 consistently in rio negro waters johannsson et al 2020 the metrics sum the emission profiles across specific segments of each of the four excitation wavelengths measured table 3 these summed metrics can be compared across treatments in order to characterize changes in the doc composition and structure the loss of fluorescence can be due to either destruction of the fluorophore and or change in its redox state photo oxidation pushes fluorophores towards a more oxidized state which has a diminished fluorescence and shifts the location of the maximum emission toward smaller wavelengths cory and mcknight 2005 therefore changes in location of the maximum emission were noted 2 4 data analysis for all indices the light exposed values were subtracted from the average dark value for each treatment to determine the change due to photo oxidation δvalues each treatment had equal numbers of light and dark replicates thus positive δvalues are a loss or decrease in the index and negative δvalues are a gain or increase in the index the use of parametric or non parametric tests was determined by normality shapiro wilk normality test and equality of variance bartlet s test tests parametric tests included one way analysis of variance followed by tukey s multiple comparisons test or a student s t test if only two treatments were compared non parametric tests included the kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance followed by dunn s multiple comparison test or the mann whitney u test when two treatments were compared the significance level of 0 05 was accepted means are reported 1 sem n unless otherwise noted all analyses were carried out in graphpad prism 7 or 8 graphpad software inc ca usa www graphpad com scientific software prism 3 results significant changes in absorbance were observed at all wavelengths and treatments with the exception of reduced uvr near anoxia in that treatment dark control and light exposed absorbances were not statistically different at wavelengths 290 nm and 340 nm based on one tailed t tests 3 1 absorbance indices oxygen limitation of photo oxidative breakdown of doc was evident under near anoxia in all absorbance indices suva254 sac340 sacka310 and r254 365 fig 1 a d fig 2 a d suva254 sac340 and sacka310 decreased by 30 to 40 under complete uvr r254 365 was the exception decreasing by 65 only sac340 and sacka310 showed significant decreases in absorbance under reduced uvr table 4 these losses were 55 lower than those under complete uvr absorbance losses were not significantly different between normoxic and hyperoxic treatments figs 1a d 2a d to better visualize the impacts of lower oxygen concentrations across the absorbance spectrum mean light absorbance was subtracted from mean dark absorbance for each measured wavelength from 250 to 400 nm for both the complete and reduced uvr treatments fig 3 a b the percentage loss of absorbance under normoxia and near anoxia δabsorbance dark controls 100 was calculated fig 3c the ratio of δnear anoxia δnormoxia was calculated for each wavelength from the data of figs 3a and b and a composite graph was created of these data fig 4 under complete uvr the pattern of loss of absorbance across wavelengths under normoxia and near anoxia were similar but quantitatively different fig 3a curves n and n a three distinct regions were observed in the profile 250 270 nm 270 300 nm and 300 400 nm fig 3a profiles of the percentage loss in absorbance did not follow the same patterns as the profiles of absorbance loss against wavelength instead the curves increased to a maximum near 300 nm and then declined fig 3c reduced uvr responses showed much greater dependence on the presence of oxygen than the responses under complete uvr as seen by the difference between the normoxic and near anoxic responses in each uvr treatment figs 3a and b under reduced uvr the pattern of absorbance loss under normoxia extended to the lower wavelengths thus making it appear similar to absorbance losses under complete uvr figs 3a and b curves n closer inspection revealed a hollowing out of the curve between 250 300 nm the pattern of absorbance loss under near anoxia reduced uvr was not extended to lower wavelengths but was greatly collapsed especially at the shortest wavelengths 250 to 280 nm fig 3b curve n a curve n a fig 3b then increased to a shallow peak between 300 320 nm also seen in the normoxic curve absorbance losses in hyperoxia were greater than in normoxia under reduced uvr but less than those in normoxia in complete uvr figs 3a and b the absorbance ratios provided a clearer picture of the role of oxygen and uvr the flat upper line labelled a in fig 4 at 1 0 is hypothetical and represents a line of no impact of near anoxia on absorbance loss curve b is the ratio of δnear anoxia δnormoxia for doc exposed to complete uvr and curve c is the ratio of δnear anoxia δnormoxia for doc exposed to reduced uvr wavelengths 350 nm the top area a is the proportionate loss in photo oxidation due to lack of oxygen across wavelengths from 250 to 400 nm the area b c is the proportion of photo oxidation that remains under complete uvr and lack of oxygen and c is the proportion of photo oxidation that remains across wavelengths under reduced uvr and lack of oxygen the δnear anoxia δnormoxia ratios under complete uvr were similar along the absorbance spectrum from 250 to 360 nm with a slight decline as of 300 nm and a steeper decline above 360 nm under reduced uvr the ratios were low 0 10 0 15 from 250 to 280 nm because no significant change in absorbance occurred in the near anoxia treatment a peak in the ratio occurred between 300 and 340 nm followed by a steep decline 3 2 slope indices changes in the slope indices differed between the complete uvr and the reduced uvr exposures note that all initial slopes were negative thus as a slope becomes more negative the δslope is positive and vice versa under complete uvr exposure the steepness of slope275 295 increased became more negative in all treatments but more so with oxygen present fig 5 a slope350 400 became more positive flatter with no significant differences among oxygen treatments fig 5b under reduced uvr slope275 295 and slope 350 400 were not calculated in the near anoxia treatment because absorbance had not changed significantly throughout the slope region under oxic conditions slope275 295 became steeper and slope350 400 did not change normoxic and hyperoxic slopes were not significantly different figs 5c and d 3 3 fluorescence redox state can affect the intensity of fluorescence and the location of maximum fluorescence cory and mcknight 2005 dark control fluorescence intensities and maxima did not change across oxygen treatments except for an increase in fluorescence in 2018 at 370 nm data not shown nor were there significant differences in the location of maximum fluorescence between the dark control and light treatments with three exceptions 2015 370 nm excitation hyperoxia 2018 300 nm excitation hyperoxia and 2018 300 nm excitation normoxia the lack of noticeable shifts in the other profiles may be due to the 10 nm spacing of emission data two fluorescence indices were monitored during the experiments fa and ha under complete uvr δfa fluorescence saw gains negative or no change except for a loss positive at near anoxia 300 nm excitation figs 6 b and c under reduced uvr δfa fluorescences were equal and positive losses across oxygen concentrations figs 7 b d under both uvr treatments figs 6a c fig 7a d losses positive in δha fluorescence were larger as oxygen concentration increased under complete uvr the increase was gradual under reduced uvr the loss in ha fluorescence was significantly smaller under near anoxia than under normoxia or hyperoxia table 4 figs 6a and c 7a d the ratios of δnear anoxia δnormoxia showed no significant diferences under complete uvr and 26 to 52 losses under reduced uvr table 4 4 discussion 4 1 interaction of oxygen and light in near lack of oxygen photo oxidation is depressed and when coupled with a loss of the shorter uv wavelengths it nearly collapses fig 4 examining the changes in absorbance patterns and indices highlights how oxygen and light interact and where each is most needed for photo oxidation the quality of the results depends on the efficacy of the dark controls which account for all non light driven changes in absorbance bacteria are the principal concern if bacterial populations change at different rates in the light and dark estimates of photo oxidative absorbance loss will be affected we considered possible scenarios and concluded that the dark controls were unlikely to be compromised by changes in bacterial populations supplementary table s1 during photo oxidation radiant energy degrades doc both directly by breaking molecular bonds and indirectly by exciting electrons which can 1 form ros by interacting with oxygen 2 dissipate energy as heat or fluorescence or 3 move to other electron orbits and interactions cooper and klymkowsky 2019 mckay 2020 the most important result of the study was observed in the reduced uvr experiment the δabsorbance profile under normoxic conditions extended back to the shortest wavelengths measured 250 nm even though radiation below 300 nm had been removed and only limited radiation occurred between 300 and 350 nm fig 3b curve n under these conditions the highest levels of absorbance loss still occurred at 320 nm similar to the pattern under complete uvr figs 3a and b curves n del vecchio and blough 2004 made similar observations when they irradiated doc in a glycerol solution with a specific wavelength 266 318 355 390 460 and 535 nm they monitored the loss in absorbance over time from 250 to 550 nm absorbance was lost first at the initiating wavelength and then radiated out at irradiance wavelengths 355 nm the loss of absorbance became broader and extended out beyond 250 nm the patterns were characterized by a slight dip around 254 nm and a consistent peak at 300 nm as seen in our data fig 3a b curves n the spreading out of absorbance loss is a characteristic of doc photo oxidation in reduced uvr near anoxia photo oxidation processes broke down fig 3b curve n a significant loss of absorbance occurred only between 290 and 340 nm fig 3b curve n a this indicates that the extensive loss of absorbance at shorter wavelengths under reduced uvr normoxia was due to processes involving oxygen two possible secondary reactions could explain these patterns either the action of ros or of excited electrons on bonds associated with shorter wavelength absorbance which incorporated oxygen on degradation 4 2 doc processing during photo oxidation we used slope275 295 slope350 400 and the r254 365 to follow the responses in doc processes during photo oxidation namely the degradation of larger molecules into smaller molecules helms et al 2008 we concluded that 1 both uvb radiation and secondary processes involving oxygen contributed to processing doc from larger to smaller molecules along the 275 295 nm absorbance region slope275 295 fig 5a and c 2 breaking down larger aromatic molecules which absorb in the 350 400 nm range is dependent on radiant energy alone oxygen is not involved in changes to slope350 400 fig 5b and d 3 oxygen is involved in their further breakdown as seen by the much higher absorbance losses under normoxia than under near anoxia fig 4 curves b and c and 4 the relatively small change in r254 365 in near anoxia compared with normoxia suggests that the rate of production of smaller molecules is oxygen dependent and reduced compared with their conversion to co2 under near anoxia table 4 in the reduced uvr anoxia treatment δabsorbances in the 340 400 nm region were smaller than expected considering that uva radiation in the bottles was estimated at 56 of sub surface levels methods 2 1 and uva breakdowns doc dahlén et al 1996 senga et al 2018 the lack of change in slope350 400 under normoxia and hyperoxia reduced uvr near anoxia reflect the small δabsorbances fig 5d uva intensity was insufficient to cause slope changes johannsson et al 2020 examined the depth profile of doc absorbance changes due to photo oxidation in their study of the rio negro they used the same experimental procedures as employed in the present study running their experiment in quartz tubes suspended in a pool of rio negro water by re analyzing their data set we were able to examine the changes in δslope275 295 and δslope350 400 within the top 8 cm of the water column if slope350 400 is determined by shorter uvr which penetrates only a few centimeters into the water column then we should see significant changes in δslope350 400 in the upper few centimeters but not deeper in the water column on the other hand if photo oxidation is maintained by oxidative processes when shorter wavelengths no longer penetrate into the water column δslope275 295 should decrease with depth but still change significantly at greater depths than δslope350 400 that is what occurred slope350 400 changed only in the upper few centimeters and was not significantly different from zero as of 5 cm depth fig 8 approximately 5 of uvb and 25 of uva would reach 5 cm depth in the pool based on beer lambert calculations of absorbance loss by wavelength in unfiltered rio negro pool water slope275 295 changed throughout the depth examined fig 8 the importance of changes or lack of changes in slope350 400 are not easy to interpret absorbance slopes characterize the absorbance properties of the underlying doc structure flattening of slope350 400 is associated with shifts in mean molecular weight towards smaller molecules a breakdown of larger molecules helms et al 2008 our data show that slope350 400 is changed by uvr but not oxygen fig 5b and that in the absence of change in slope350 400 absorbance losses continue in the presence of oxygen fig 3b curves h n so how to reconcile a lack of change in slope with continued loss of absorbance change in r254 365 is a measure of the process of photo oxidation r254 365 follows the relative increase in the abundance of smaller molecules as the larger doc molecules are broken down δr254 365 is governed by the relative rates of two photo oxidative processes the loss of small molecules through production of co2 and the replenishment of small molecules through the degradation of larger molecules under complete uvr the majority of absorbance indices and production of co2 were reduced by 30 40 between the normoxic and near anoxia treatments table 4 patel sorrentino et al 2004 johannsson ferreira wood and val unpublished data δr254 365 however was reduced by 65 the relatively small change in r254 365 under near anoxia reflects a change in photo oxidative processes suva254 the numerator of r254 365 was depressed by 39 not enough to explain the 65 drop in r254 365 the absorbance loss at longer wavelengths under near anoxia was less than that of the shorter wavelengths fig 4 curve b indicating that a lack of oxygen reduced the rate of breakdown of larger molecules the imbalance between the losses and gains of small molecules would explain the small δr254 365 this conclusion is supported by helms et al 2008 who observed a 70 smaller increase in smaller molecules and a decreased conversion rate from high to low molecular weight compounds under low oxygen conditions 21 air saturation the above considerations provide insights into how areal m 2 photo oxidation is affected by changing oxygen and uvr conditions with depth under normoxic conditions at depths beyond the penetration of significant amounts of uvb 280 320 nm radiation gradients in uva and par and then just par maintain photo oxidation helms et al 2008 showed that increases in slope275 295 and decreases in slope350 400 tracked conversion of larger to smaller molecules at depth when slope350 400 ceases changing between 5 and 8 cm depth larger molecules in this region are no longer being cleaved into smaller molecules ros and or excited electrons from par maintain the breakdown of molecules across the absorbance spectrum changes in absorbance indices were observed down to 14 cm depth johannsson et al 2020 without par radiation the production of co2 and smaller molecules would quickly be curtailed in the water column under significantly reduced oxygen conditions near or at anoxia photo oxidation would be reduced by approximately a third at the water s surface in the rio negro patel sorrentino et al 2004 table 4 and would collapse with depth as the transmittance of shorter wavelengths is diminished and ros and oxygen are not available to maintain the processes of photo oxidation 4 3 fluorescence photo oxidation in oxygen and light gradients fa and ha fluorophores are affected by different portions of the radiation spectrum in conjunction with oxygen losses of ha fluorescence occurred in all treatments indicating that longer wavelengths are involved figs 6a and c figs 7a b c and d johannsson et al 2020 showed that ha fluorescence was lost to greater depths than changes in absorbance this supports the participation of par in losses of ha fluorescence the significant difference between normoxia and near anoxia under reduced uvr but not complete uvr suggests that uvb may also play some role and that oxygen increases the losses uvb together with oxygen drives gains in fa fluorophores fig 6b and c fa fluorescence losses occurred in situations where uvb was absent figs 7b c and d or oxygen was not present to work in conjunction with uvb fig 7b and c near anoxia senga et al 2018 and dahlén et al 1996 observed losses of fa fluorescence and concentration when only uva was applied during photo oxidation supporting the importance of specifically uvb in production of fa fluorophores the loss of fa fluorescence does not require oxygen or uvb radiation changes in fluorescence are not always indicators of changes in the abundance of fluorophores because their excitation can lead to a change in redox state as well as alteration of the molecule cory and mcknight 2005 in three instances the position of peak fluorescence shifted during photo oxidation toward shorter wavelengths indicative of a more oxidized state in each instance the shift would not affect the results of the experiments this suggests that changes in fluorescence were generally changes in concentration of fluorophores 5 conclusions oxygen and radiation type uvb uva and par interact to control different aspects of photo oxidation of doc oxygen coupled with uva and par radiation are essential to produce ros at depth in the water column the ros maintains photo oxidation across all absorbance wavelengths where penetration of shorter uvr wavelengths decreases without oxygen the processing of larger molecules would be depressed in the 275 295 nm region slopes275 295 and the return of co2 to the atmosphere would be reduced at all depths detailed relationships between oxygen and photo oxidation across oxygen concentrations from anoxia to normoxia are not known and need to be determined the upper surface waters where uvb radiation is high support higher rates of conversion of larger to smaller molecules through the 275 295 nm and 350 400 nm absorbance regions in addition fa like fluorophores were created only in the presence of uvb and oxygen the present day decreases in oxygen in many aquatic environments are likely affecting photo oxidation processes and may impact the global carbon cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

16881,with the rapid growth of the economy there are increasing conflicts between economic development and environmental protection among these conflicts the wastewater emission management as one of the significant ways to alleviate water scarcity has been paid increasing attention across the developing countries such as china it is thus essential to comprehensively investigate the enviro economic effects induced by wastewater related policies in this study a factorial emission focused general equilibrium model fege is first developed to facilitate examine the composite enviro economic effects of multiple policy scenarios with regards to wastewater related environmental taxes and the related subsides a special case study for the municipality of chongqing china is conducted to illustrate the potential benefits of its use in the formulation of wastewater related policies it is found that the impacts of various wastewater related policies i e environmental taxes and the related subside on gdp are different in detail green tax policies on gdp are negative while wastewater emission intensity wei improvement policies on gdp are positive when green tax reaches 14 yuan tonne which is the maximum proposed by the chinese government the gdp will drop by 0 37 which would be deemed acceptable for the municipality of chongqing in addition the impacts on rural households consumption are greater than those on urban households consumption whichever the application of wastewater related policies it is because the rural households in the municipality of chongqing have a relatively unitary income source it is thus recommended that the rural household in chongqing should be paid more attention for example some extra allowances could be considered to the rural household to help them cope with the negative economic impacts induced by a new environmental policy it is expected that the outputs would provide bases for formulating desired wastewater related policies

the increase of water demand for irrigation and industrial production and the poor management of wastewater water related scarcity problems have become increasingly serious in china fang and chen 2015 feng et al 2014 in particular the quality of water supply is deteriorating due to poor wastewater management which not only contributes to the proliferation of waterborne diseases but also reduces the amount of available water supply jimenez and asano 2008 luckmann et al 2016 in fact wastewater and water are closely associated with each other water is the origin of wastewater and wastewater is one of the fates of water consequently tremendous efforts are seriously needed to alleviate water scarcity through studying wastewater management for avoiding the increased risks of poor wastewater

findings suggested that the wastewater flows among sectors in guangdong were considerable and the industrial structure of guangdong province were expected to be adjusted to mitigate the wastewater emission nevertheless there were limited efforts to investigate the complex interactions between economy and environment induced by wastewater emission computable general equilibrium cge models as a popular policy simulation tool have been widely used to simulate the contributions of one economic activity or policy to socioeconomic benefits in the whole society which can be employed from different scopes including global beckman et al 2019 britz and hertel 2011 delzeit et al 2020 mukhopadhyay et al 2018 nechifor and winning 2017 ouraich et al 2019 timilsina et al 2010 national bataille and melton 2017 fu et al 2021 li and jia 2016 lin and jia 2020a 2018 ochuodho et al 2016 regional fang et al 2017 li et al 2019 liu et al 2018a 2020 zhang et al 2016 and industrial cui et al 2021 gupta 2016 lau et al 2016 lin and jia 2019 shi et al 2019 in addition there are an increasing number of studies employing a cge model to explore the economic and environmental effects of levying an environmental policy in recent years e g carbon tax allan et al 2014 fu et al 2021 guo et al 2014 jia and lin 2020 lin and jia 2020b 2020c 2019 2018 liu et al 2018a lofgren et al 2002 nong 2020 ojha et al 2020 rodríguez et al 2019 shi et al 2019 for instance guo et al 2014 applied a cge model to examine the effects of a carbon tax on the economy and carbon emission of china through disaggregating the energy sectors into eight ones according to energy use characteristics liu et al 2018 developed a cge model for the province of saskatchewan to study a series of direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts of a carbon tax rodríguez et al 2019 employed a static cge model to simulate a green tax reform in portugal and found that it was possible to decrease the energy intensity of the portuguese economy nong 2020 improved an open sourced cge model i e gtap e power to examine the economy wide impact of a carbon tax in south africa indicating that carbon tax is helpful for south africa to be low carbon and sustainable economy among these cge studies most of them paid attention to the socioeconomic effects of carbon tax while limited ones focused on the effects of regulations for wastewater emission for instance luckmann et al 2016 used a water focused cge model to examine a cascading water system in israel this model can produce shadow prices for wastewater to help governments and pricing decisions fang et al 2016 proposed a cge model with consideration of water resource and water environment factors to study the economic and environmental impacts of wastewater discharge fees however there has been no report of previous studies to evaluate the enviro economic effects of wastewater related environmental taxes through cge models in particular there has been a lack of research in analyzing the interactive effects of such environmental taxes and the related subsidies for encouraging emission reduction within one or multiple economic sectors consequently an emission focused cge to comprehensively investigate such envio economic effects is desired therefore the objective of this research is to develop a factorial emission focused general equilibrium model fege to investigate the composite enviro economic effects of multiple policy scenarios with regards to wastewater related environmental taxes and the related subsidies the developed fege will then be applied to the municipality of chongqing to explore desired pathways for mitigating wastewater emission in detail i factorial analysis will be undertaken to investigate the interactive relationships among different wastewater related policies taxes and subsidies and their compound effects on the enviro economic systems ii issues of wastewater and the related pollutant emissions will be addressed through examination of various tax policies within the cge model it is expected that this study would provide bases for formulating desired wastewater related policies 2 methodology 2 1 development of a factorial emission focused general equilibrium model a static factorial emission focused general equilibrium model fege has been first developed to illustrate the new equilibrium after an exogenous shock affects the municipality s economic system in addition the developed model has been applied to the municipality of chongqing to present its strength and feasibility fege could represent the structure of production and consumption in the economy comprehensively allowing to study the detailed implication of green tax policies factorial analysis is involved to further explore the interactive relationships of different factors e g green tax policies on major wastewater disposal industries facing the environmental pressure in chongqing the municipality government is eager to know the potential impacts of a green tax on the economy therefore fege is significant to help provide a scientific basis for the forthcoming policy development the developed model is subdivided into five modules production trade income and expenditure environment policy and factorial analysis modules 2 1 1 production module the production module for each sector describes the ways where capital labor water and intermediate inputs can be used to produce output böhringer and löschel 2006 lin and jiang 2011 as shown in fig 1 each production function is represented by the nested constant elasticity of substitution ces function with exception of intermediate inputs as the leontief production function in this module there are four types of production inputs i e water capital labor and intermediate inputs various production inputs are combined to produce final goods in detail the capital and water are aggregated into capital water composites while different inputs are aggregated into intermediate inputs then capital water composites and labor are aggregated into labor capital water composites the labor capital water composites and intermediate inputs are further aggregated into domestic outputs thus the mathematical expression of a ces function is shown in eq 1 chichilnisky and wu 2006 dissou 2010 liu et al 2018a lofgren et al 2002 1 q t i α i t δ i t v i σ 1 σ 1 δ i t w i σ 1 σ σ σ 1 where q t i is domestic output and i is production activity sets α i t and δ i t are a scale parameter and share parameter in the ces activity function respectively v i and w i represent two kinds of inputs respectively σ implies the elasticity substitution parameter in ces activity function 2 1 2 trade module as shown in fig 2 the export and import are considered simultaneously for given types of commodities in order to resolve the two way trade issue the armington assumption has been introduced to identify imported and domestic commodities as different products chichilnisky and wu 2006 lofgren et al 2002 for domestic products and imports the ces utility function has been used to determine their domestic demands as shown in eq 2 while for domestic products and exports a constant elasticity transformation cet function has been employed to describe the allocation of the marketed domestic output as shown in eq 3 chichilnisky and wu 2006 liu et al 2018a lofgren et al 2002 2 q q c α c q δ c q q d c ρ c q 1 δ c q q m c ρ c q 1 ρ c q 3 q x c α c t δ c t q d c ρ c t 1 δ c t q e c ρ c t 1 ρ c t where q q c and q x c are the composite supply and c is the commodity sets as both imported and produced domestically α c q and δ c q are a scale parameter and share parameter in the ces utility function respectively α c t and δ c t are a scale parameter and share parameter in the cet function respectively q d c q m c and q e c represent the domestic imported and exported commodities quantity respectively ρ c q and ρ c t imply the exponent of ces utility function and cet function respectively 2 1 3 income and expenditure module changes in income and expenditure for various economic entities can be described in the income and expenditure module in this research five types of economic agents have been considered which are constituted urban households rural households enterprises government and the rest of the world the behaviors of household are determined by the maximization of utility in detail the incomes of households come from the sale of labor and household savings while the expenses of households contain the consumption of commodities and direct tax the consumption function satisfies the assumption of the cobb douglas cd utility function as shown in eq 4 chichilnisky and wu 2006 li and jia 2016 lofgren et al 2002 4 d h ch p c γ ch β h 1 λ h y h h where d h c h is the demand of household h for commodity c p c denotes the market price of commodity c y h h is the total income of household h γ c h implies the proportion of household h in the total labor force β h is the marginal propensity of household h for saving λ h represents the income tax rate of household h the behaviors of enterprises are determined by the maximization of profits to be specific the incomes of enterprises come from the capital and the sale of merchandise while the expenses contain the payment of labor fees the expenditure for further production and the indirect tax owed to the government the government s incomes come from the income tax of household and enterprise indirect taxes tariffs and income from capital and transfer payments from the rest of the world the government s expenditures include the consumption of commodities and transfer payment to enterprises and households 2 1 4 environment policy module due to the increasing environmental issues more and more environment related taxes have been levied to achieve both economic and environmental benefits chou 2001 deng and huang 2020 among them green taxes also known as environmental taxes are becoming more popular in developed countries chou 2001 it can effectively encourage renewable energy production and enable enterprises to implement advanced energy saving technologies deng and huang 2020 zhang and smith 2007 according to the international tax glossary green tax levied on the industry with pollution emission and the use of pollutants xiuyue and hao 2014 in china green taxes aim at manufacturing industries e g mining and washing coal chemical industry manufacture of transport equipment etc the model assumes that pollution e g wastewater solid waste and waste air emissions related to the total output of each manufacturing industries the green tax imposed on different commodities is based on the emission content of pollution and is modeled as an excise tax the tax growths the cost of different industries in terms of pollution emissions and induces enterprise to decrease their use through substitution effects in this study green tax is considered to be one of the income sources for government the green tax implemented on different commodities in terms of wastewater emission and the ad valorem rate are quantified by eqs 5 and 6 allan et al 2014 dong et al 2017 liu et al 2018a 5 w t a x f t w q q f ε f 6 t w f w t a x f p q f q q f where w t a x f is a green tax levied on commodity f t w represents a specific duty rate of green tax t w f denotes the ad valorem duty rate of green tax on commodity f q q f and p q f imply the total domestic consumption and price of commodity f respectively ε f is the wastewater emission intensity wei of commodity f f represents the commodity sets which is levied on green tax 2 1 5 factorial analysis module factorial analysis fa originating from experimental design is an effective statistical tool for investigating the effects of multiple independent factors on several response variables xu et al 2019 it can help researchers gain insights into the interactive relationships of multiple factors at various levels and their impacts on system performance liu et al 2018b zhou et al 2016 the most common form of fa is the 2 k including k factors and two levels for each factor in detail the two levels of different factors are the low levels denoted by 1 and the high level represented by 1 taking a 22 fa as a case the statistic effects model and the summation of squares for single factor and two factors interaction are calculated through eq 7 to 19 montgomery 2017 7 y i j k μ τ i η j τ β i j ξ i j k i 1 2 a j 1 2 b k 1 2 n 8 y i j k 1 n y i j k 9 y i j 1 b k 1 n y i j k 10 y j i 1 a k 1 n y i j k 11 y i 1 a j 1 b k 1 n y i j k 12 s s a 1 b n i 1 a y i 2 y 2 a b n 13 s s b 1 a n j 1 b y j 2 y 2 a b n 14 s s a b 1 n i 1 a j 1 b y i j 2 y 2 a b n s s a s s b 15 s s t i 1 a j 1 b k 1 n y i j k 2 y 2 a b n 16 s s e s s t s s a s s b s s a b 17 f a s s a a 1 s s e a b n 1 18 f b s s b b 1 s s e a b n 1 19 s s a b s s a b a 1 b 1 s s e a b n 1 where y i j k represents the system response when factor a at the ith level and factor b at the jth level for kth replication μ denotes the overall mean τ i η j and τ η i j are the effects of factor a at the ith level factor b at the jth level and their interactions respectively ξ i j k is a random error component s s a s s b and s s a b are the sum of squares of factor a factor b and their combination s s t is the total sum of squares and s s e is the sum of squares of error f a f b and f a b are the f value of factor a factor b and their combination finally the contribution of factors is quantified as the proportion of their sum of squares to the total sum of squares the p value can be quantified through fa using the f value and significant level 0 05 is selected as the significant level in this study in this study a multiple factor i e six factors and two level i e 26 factorial design is adopted to explore the effects of a factor at two levels of other factors the linkage between cge and fa can be summarized that the output from the cge model is the input of fa the details are as follows i the selected factor e g a b and c and level e g i and j are firstly put in the cge model to produce the corresponding response i e y ii the relationships between factors and responses are revealed through the fa iii the significant level of each factor and interactions among different factors are further identified for example green tax is one of the factors selected in this study and the level of green tax is its rate in this study 3 and 14 yuan tonne are chosen as low and high level respectively when the green tax rate is 3 yuan tonne the responses e g gdp can be obtained through the cge model the factorial design will produce a number of combinations including all the information of different factors and levels therefore the combinations and their responses from the cge model will be put into the fa to examine the main and interactive effects among different factors in this study the cge model and fa are implemented in the software gams and minitab respectively since the inputs of this model are all deterministic numbers fege is a deterministic model which further denotes that replication is not necessary however there is a hypothesis testing in fa that the model errors are assumed to be normally and independently distributed random variables with mean zero and variance constant according to the eq 17 to 19 it can be seen that factor s f value is depended on the error item s value if the error item is zero the f value of factors is unable to be quantified therefore the error item is a necessary item in fa however there is no error item in deterministic model the high order interactions are thus chosen as the error item in the deterministic mode since the magnitude of high order interactions is small which can be assumed unimportant fu et al 2021 liu et al 2018b xu et al 2019 b zheng et al 2021a zhou et al 2016 in this study there are six factors fifteen two way interactions and ten three way interactions in total to be specific the total contribution of main effects accounts for 97 94 the total contribution of two way interactions accounts for 2 06 the total contribution of three way interaction effects less than 0 001 consequently the total effects of high order interactions are selected as the error item to reveal the complex effects of two way interactions 2 1 6 model closure and market clearing according to the theory of general equilibrium a cge model requires the balance of both the factor market and the commodity market simultaneously three kinds of macro equilibrium and three types of micro equilibrium are included in the equilibrium module in detail the macro equilibriums contain exchanges balance input and output balance and income and expenditure balance while the mic equilibriums include resources market clearing capital market clearing and product market clearing the income and expenditure balance requires that the expenditures of all economic entities equal their incomes the transfer payments from and to other entities are covered in both revenue and expenditure the input and output balance means that the total supplies of each industry equal the sum of intermediate demand domestic consumption net export and investment of each industry capital market clearing means that the savings of all sectors equal their total investment 2 2 case study and data sources chongqing as one of the six legacy industrial bases in china is located between the north latitude 28 10 32 13 and the east longitude 105 11 110 11 in 1997 chongqing was designated as a municipality directly managed by the chinese central government liu et al 2018 nassour et al 2020 due to administrative attention chongqing has experienced very rapid economic development after being a municipality yu et al 2017 to be specific the gdp of chongqing increased averaging over 14 per year from 2009 to 2017 bao et al 2019 in addition the population in chongqing has a rapid growth from 28 16 million in 2007 to 31 75 million in 2017 bao et al 2019 le et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 with the rapid development of the economy and population the environment of chongqing has been accompanied by a series of issues e g ghg emissions wastewater emission and water scarcity tan et al 2016 as a major industrial city in southwest china the economy of chongqing mainly depends on the development of heavy industries which largely increases water consumptions and wastewater emissions tan et al 2016 zheng et al 2021b the characteristics of the water resources in chongqing can be summarized as follows i the distribution of water resources in chongqing is uneven across time and space ii the local water resources are insufficient iii the development and utilization of transit water are difficult zheng et al 2020 due to the characteristics of water resources and the direction of economic development chongqing still belongs to the water deficient area though it is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze as one of the fates of water wastewater is closely related to water resource there are still a number of industrial wastewater emissions in chongqing every year in 2017 the industrial wastewater emission of chongqing was 193 03 million tonnes accounting for almost 3 of total ones of china for the water deficient area wastewater emissions management can be a useful pathway to alleviate water scarcity since water is the origin of wastewater in addition the environmental concerns of chongqing not only have a significant impact on its economic development but also influence crucially the ecological safety and sustainable development in regions surrounding the yangtze river due to geographical position consequently as the most highly populated city in china it is thus desired to pay more attention to the research related to environmental concerns for the municipality of chongqing hu et al 2017 wu et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 the input output table of chongqing which is obtained from chongqing statistical yearbook has been aggregated into twenty two sectors based on data availability and sector characteristics chongqing bureau of statistics 2013 the twenty two sectors employed in this study has been listed in table 1 the data of water consumption and wastewater emission is taken from chongqing statistical yearbook chongqing bureau of statistics 2013 china statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics 2013 chongqing water resource bulletin chongqing water resource bureau 2013 the social accounting matrix sam is constructed using the input output table of chongqing water consumption data wastewater emission data national accounts data and other statistical data the wei of each sector is calculated based on the environmental protection tax law of the people s republic of china and the integrated wastewater emission standard gb8978 1996 the relevant data are taken from chongqing statistical yearbook chongqing bureau of statistics 2013 and chongqing municipal ecological environment bureau chongqing bureau of municipal ecological environment 2013 in this study eleven policy scenarios are designed to investigate the effects of different wastewater emission management policies on various industries in detail six policy scenarios are first designed based on the reality of the implementation of the green tax in china additionally five policy scenarios are then designed based on the emission performance of each sector according to the regulation on the implementation of the environmental protection tax law of the people s republic of china issued by administrative regulations document number order no 693 of the state council the green tax rates regarding wastewater emission are from 1 4 to 14 yuan tonne and aim at reducting the emissions of manufacturing industry i e sector 2 to sector 14 in table 2 to examine the socioeconomic and environmental effects of green tax implemented on sectors of chongqing six green tax rates have been designed and simulated in this study shown in table 2 the green tax policy is one of the wastewater emission management policies as another wastewater emission management policy wei improvement policy is introduced in this study the work mechanisms of green tax policy and wei improvement policy are different in detail the green tax policy is from the perspective of consumption while the wei improvement policy is from the perspective of production the green tax policy works through the demand adjustment of commodities with a number of wastewater emissions for example when the green tax policy is applied to the textile sector the cost of textile commodities would be indirectly increased which would result in the growth of the price of textile commodities with the increase of the price of textile commodities their demand would be decreased since other commodities would be chosen to replace the local textile commodities therefore the plant manager would cut the production of textile to adapt to the market demand which can thus reduce the emission of wastewater the wei improvement policy is to achieve the objective through production activities such as technology mandates and environmental standards when it is implemented on sectors water consumption of industries can be reduced through improving the sectors production technology for example improving the production efficiency of the textile sector influences its whole production structure which will further cut the water consumption and wastewater emission of the textile sector consequently the major differences between the green tax policy and wei improvement policy are the work ways to be specific the green tax policy is a top down way which works by reducing the demand of commodities and indirectly influences the total wastewater emissions in contrast the wei improvement policy is a bottom up way which works by reducing the water consumption of production process and indirectly affects the total wastewater emission intensities for the sectors with relatively small wastewater emissions it is difficult to further improve the production technology to reduce water consumption during the production process with accepted capital input the induced wastewater emissions are thus relatively difficult to be mitigated therefore the top five wastewater emission sectors i e mwc mft mtf mc and mte in chongqing are chosen to further examine the effects of wei improvement policy on various sectors in addition 3 yuan tonne is the current green tax rate of chongqing therefore the wei improvement policy scenarios i e green tax related subsidies are designed with consideration of the current green tax to better investigate the actual enviro economic performance of chongqing the details are presented in table 2 the model was solved using the general algebraic modeling system gams software with the path solver bussieck and meeraus 2004 3 results 3 1 enviro economic effects induced by green tax policies using the developed model in this study the induced see effects are summarized in table 3 and performed in fig 3 and fig 4 the gdp change and its details are calculated under different green tax policy scenarios as shown in table 3 in addition the detailed import and export changes are quantified in fig 3 finally the environmental effects i e water demand and wastewater emission are revealed in fig 4 as shown in table 3 the impacts of green tax on gdp are negative when the green tax is under 3 yuan tonne i e scenarios 1 and 2 the gdp change is comparatively low this implies that a relatively low green tax won t have significant impacts on the economy when the green tax is 3 yuan tonne which is being implemented currently by chongqing government the gdp will reduce by 0 08 comparing with the results without green tax when the green tax reaches 14 yuan tonne which is the maximum proposed by the chinese government the gdp will drop by 0 37 considering that the growth of gdp in the municipality of chongqing was 5 40 in 2019 the gdp change for scenario 6 would be deemed acceptable in fact gdp is composed of rural household consumption urban household consumption government consumption investment imports and exports therefore the gdp change can be disaggregated into the above changes to facilitate the analysis of detailed economic changes in general the impacts of green tax on rural household consumption urban household consumption and exports are negative while those on government consumption investment and import are positive in addition the government consumption is affected significantly while the investment is affected relatively slightly when the green tax is 3 yuan tonne the government consumption increases by 1 93 and the investment only grows by 0 01 comparing the impacts on urban and rural household consumption the impacts on rural household consumption are similar with those on urban household consumption under a relatively low green tax e g s1 and s2 however the changes of rural household consumption are larger than those of urban household consumption when the green tax is relatively high e g s5 and s6 since the complex geographic conditions and historical reasons the economy of chongqing has a serious urban rural dual structure most rural areas of chongqing are in extreme poverty compared with urban areas resulting in the consumption difference when the green tax implemented on different sectors the cost of factories will increase and thus directly affects household incomes the consumption demand of rural households is determined by their incomes which are mainly earned through labor inputs in the production activities thus rural households have a unitary income source due to relative poverty by contrast urban households have multi income sources e g labor income and capital gains therefore the total rural incomes will be affected more significantly than the total urban revenues with the implication of green tax meanwhile the consumption of rural households will decline more than that of urban households due to economic depression the imports change is similar to the gdp change with the application of the same green tax for example when the green tax is 14 yuan tonne the gdp will decline by 0 37 and the imports increase by 0 31 however the government consumption change is higher than the gdp change under the same green tax scenario since the green tax can increase the government income from tax revenues fig 3 shows the changes of imports and exports under six green tax scenarios by sectors each sector is presented by a rectangle with unique color and the width of rectangles indicates the changes it is worth noting that the total changes of exports are larger than those of imports since both the domestic production and the total consumption will decline the imports will be a relatively low decrease as an important industrial area in western china the economy of chongqing is most contributed by the development of the manufacturing industry the exports from the manufacturing industry will be affected significantly since the green tax aims at the wastewater emission of the manufacturing industry in addition the exports and imports of different sectors vary significantly across the six green tax scenarios for example export change of mwc ranks at the top followed by mc and mte when the green tax reaches 14 yuan tonne the export changes of mwc mc and mte decrease by 4 63 3 00 and 2 26 respectively as for the import changes mte ranks at the top followed by mc mtf and psp when the green tax reaches 14 yuan tonne the import changes of mte mc mtf and psp reduce by 1 47 0 89 0 74 and 0 62 respectively it is worth mentioning that the primary industry and the tertiary industry will be affected by the green tax even if the green tax is only implemented on the manufacturing industry for instance when the green tax reaches 14 yuan tonne the export change of primary industry decreases by 0 10 and its import change grows by 0 06 this indicates different industries have complex interactive relationships which is desired to be explored to facilitate the macroeconomic and microeconomic effects induced by the green tax policy the changes of water demand and wastewater emission by sectors under two green tax scenarios are presented in fig 4 since the similar trends can be observed under different green tax policy scenarios the detailed results of other scenarios related to the impacts on water demand and wastewater emission are summarized in supporting information the water demand of manufacturing industry will decrease due to the productive activities reduction caused by the green tax while the water demand of other sectors will slightly increase for instance when the green tax is 14 yuan tonne the water demand of primary industry increases by 0 01 there are similar trends for different sectors in terms of water demand and wastewater emission for example when the green tax is 3 yuan tonne the water demand of mc decreases most i e 0 42 followed by mte i e 0 31 and mwc i e 0 21 the wastewater emission of mc also has the highest decrease i e 0 48 followed by mte i e 0 38 and mwc 0 36 in general the impacts of green tax on water demand are less obvious than those on wastewater emission for instance when the green tax reaches 14 yuan tonne the total water demand of all sectors can decrease by 0 21 and the total wastewater emission can drop by 1 40 thus the green tax is useful for reducing wastewater emission of the manufacturing industry 3 2 enviro economic effects of wastewater emission intensity improvement policies according to the above analysis the green tax has different impacts on various sectors as one of the main factors affecting wastewater emission it is significant to examine the see effects induced by wei improvement in order to further investigate the above effects five wei improvement policy scenarios have been conducted with consideration of the performances of each sector under the six green tax scenarios all simulations in this section are conducted when the green tax is 3 yuan tonne since this green tax is adopted now in the chongqing government the induced see effects are summarized in table 4 and performed in fig 5 and fig 6 the gdp changes caused by the wei improvement of specfic sectors are summarized in table 4 it can be seen that the impacts of wei improvement on gdp are positive when the wei improvement applied to mwc i e scenario 7 the gdp change is the highest followed by mc i e scenario 10 the wei of mwc and mc has been improved separately which results in an increase of gdp by 0 016 and 0 013 respectively by contrast the wei improvement implemented on mft i e scenario 8 mtf i e scenario 9 and mte i e scenario 11 have similar impacts on gdp changes which only makes the gdp increase by 0 003 0 002 and 0 004 respectively this indicates that wei improvement applied to various sectors has different performances in terms of gdp changes the impacts of wei improvement on rural household consumption urban household consumption and exports are positive while those on government consumption import and investment are negative in addition the impact on government consumption is largest followed by exports imports rural household consumption and urban household consumption while the impact on the investment is the smallest when the wei improvement implemented on mwc the changes of government consumption exports imports rural household consumption and urban household consumption and investment are 0 397 0 062 0 014 0 011 0 007 and 0 005 respectively it is obvious that the impacts on rural household consumption are larger than those on urban household consumption the reason is that the wei improvement can bring the productive activities growth which further increase the income from labor inputs in addition the impacts induced by wei improvement on rural households consumption are greater than those on urban households consumption this is suggested that rural households have a relatively unitary income source the changes of exports and imports under different wei improvement scenarios by sectors have been quantified in fig 5 by comparing the changes of exports and imports it can be seen that the total impacts on exports are more obvious than those on imports also the wei improvement can promote exports and inhibit imports simultaneously for example when the wei improvement on mwc i e s7 the total import change increases by 0 014 while the total export change rises by 0 062 which is more than five times of total import changes this is because the wei improvement can stimulate economic activities and thus improve the domestic production as shown in fig 5 a the total impacts on the export of one sector will increase most when the wei improvement applied to it to be specific the export change of mwc in s7 ranks at the top in s8 mft has the highest export change among sectors with an increase of 0 009 in s9 the impact on the export of mft is largest growing by 0 009 in s10 the export change of mc ranks at the top rising by 0 042 in s11 mte has the highest export change among sectors increasing by 0 014 it is worth noting that the impacts on imports are different by sectors according to fig 5 b for example when the wei improvement on mwc the import change of mte is largest decreasing by 0 067 while the import changes of mwc and fin are smallest which can be ignored when the wei improvement applied to different sectors the performances of various sectors on import vary significantly for instance when the wei improvement on mtf the impact on import of mte is largest declining by 0 011 consequently the impacts on imports and exports induced by wei improvement vary notably due to the economic characteristic of chongqing the changes of water demand and wastewater emission under different wei improvement policy scenarios are shown in fig 6 the different sectors are represented by different colors which are presented by the first axis on the left the total changes of water demand and wastewater emission are indicated by the purple triangle which is presented by the second axis on the right the total water demand changes under five wei improvement policy scenarios are from 0 001 to 0 010 while the total wastewater emission changes under five wei improvement policy scenarios are from 0 002 to 0 045 this indicates that the impacts of wei improvement on water demand and wastewater emission are all positive since the wei improvement can stimulate productive activities it further increases the wastewater emission thus it is reasonable to increase the green tax i e more than 3 yuan tonne in chongqing for achieving the target of environmental protection when the technology of addressing wastewater emission is improved as shown in fig 6 a the sectors with the highest water demand changes from s7 to s11 are mwc mft mtf mc and mte respectively a similar trend can be observed in fig 6 b to sum up when the wei improvement applied to a specific sector this sector will have higher impacts on export water demand and wastewater emission than other sectors 3 3 effects from different wastewater related policies and their interactions based on the above analysis the applications of both green tax and wei improvement can lead to a series of effects on enviro economic systems however the impacts induced by the green tax are opposite to those by wei improvement it is thus significant to examine the interactions of green tax and wei improvement in this section six factors i e green tax wei improvement on mwc mft mtf mc and mte respectively and their interaction effects are further investigated through a factorial analysis the relevant responses are gdp rural consumption urban consumption enterprise consumption government consumption imports and exports in detail the impacts on gdp are shown in table 5 fig 7 and fig 8 while impacts on others i e rural consumption urban consumption enterprise consumption government consumption imports and exports are presented in support information fig 7 presents the absolute values of each effect through estimating against the cumulative normal probabilities the half normal plot as a kind of graphical tool can be employed to visually distinguish whether the effects of factors are significant or not to be specific the distances of a factor lying away from the red line represent the factor s significant level if a factor is far away from the red line it should be significant shown as a red square in contrast the effect of a factor is insignificant if it is close to the red line which is presented as a blue dot it can be seen that the main effects of six factors are all significant including a b c d e and f however the interactive effects of six factors are not all significant for example the effect of be is significant while the effect of bc is insignificant in order to better examine the impacts of the major factors on the gdp table 5 offers the details of sum of squares contribution f value and p value for the six factors and their interactions it is indicated that the application of green tax is more significant than the application of wei improvement for gdp response it is also worth noting that the application of green tax has great impacts on the gdp of chongqing with its contribution being 92 75 the results for other responses i e rural consumption urban consumption investment government consumption imports and exports are similar as shown in support information the wei improvement applied to mwc has a relatively large contribution than that to other sectors although the contribution of interactions is only 2 06 a number of two way effects are significant i e p value lower than 0 05 specially the p values between green tax and the other five factors are all lower than 0 001 indicating that it is significant for the interactions between green tax and wei improvement in addition the p value of mwc mc is 0 014 i e lower than 0 05 which means that interactions between wei improvement on mwc and mc are also significant these results further illustrate that it is crucial to examine the interactive relationships between two factors fig 8 shows the interactive plot of all factors in detail the blue solid line represents the low level of factors while the red dotted line implies the high level of factors for instance the low level of green tax is 3 yuan tonne represented by 1 while the high level of green tax is 14 yuan tonne represented by 1 the matrixes can describe the interactive relationships through depicting specific variations generated by one design factor s impact on responses under the effect of another factor the intersecting lines stand for the effects of a factor that will change when the other factor is at different levels which also means that the combination of two factors has a significant interactive effect on system responses it is worth noting that there are intersecting lines in fig 8 with different patterns which means that the interactive relationships are obvious taking the green tax mwc subfigure of fig 8 as an example the red dotted line stands for the changes with the application of green tax across its two levels when the application of wei improvement on mwc is at its high level in contrast the blue solid line means that the effects of green tax across its two levels when the application of wei improvement on mwc takes the low level in the green tax mwc subfigure of fig 8 both the red dotted line and blue dotted line decline when the application of green tax from a low level to a high level the results indicate that the application of green tax would cause the effect of wei improvement on mwc to some extent obviously the interactions between the application of green tax and wei improvement on mwc are more significant 4 discussion according to the above analysis the developed fege in this study is appropriate to investigate the composite enviro economic effects induced by different wastewater related policies i e six green tax policy scenarios and five wei improvement policy scenarios for the municipality of chongqing china the main findings and suggestions are as follows firstly the green tax policies can help mitigate wastewater emission while accompanying the reduction of chongqing s economy i e gdp to be specific when the green tax is 3 yuan tonne which is the current green tax rate adopted by chongqing s government the gdp drops by 0 08 and the wastewater emissions decrease by 0 61 this shows that the green tax policy is useful to reduce wastewater emissions since the economy growth of chongqing heavily depends on manufacturing industry development the amount of wastewater emission in chongqing is larger than that in other areas under the same economic level moreover chongqing is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze and its wastewater emission has impacts on other provinces situated on the downstream of the yangtze therefore the higher green tax rate is significant for chongqing as well as other provinces along the yangtze to improve the environment when the green tax rate is 14 yuan tonne the wastewater emissions of chongqing reduce by 1 4 and the gdp only drops 0 37 it is thus suggested that the highest green tax rate i e 14 yuan tonne which is the maximum proposed by chinese government is deemed acceptable for the municipality of chongqing since the growth of gdp in chongqing is 5 4 in 2019 secondly in depth investigations on significant industries which are selected based on the outputs from green tax policy scenarios are conducted by simulating five wei improvement policy scenarios the wei improvement on industries can bring productive activities growth through technology improvement on wastewater emission which further leads to the increase of gdp and the decrease of wastewater emissions for example chongqing s gdp will drop by 0 016 and wastewater emission will grow by 0 027 when the wei improvement applied to mwc i e mining and washing of coal industry the results indicate the wei improvement polices cannot be implemented independently to improve the environment it is thus recommended that the wei improvement policies can be a supplementary policy of green tax to reduce wastewater emission and at the same time minimize the negative impacts on the economy thirdly the interactive effects between green tax policies and wei improvement policies have been explored through the developed fege it can be found that there are obvious interactive relationships when green tax policy and wei improvement on specfic industry i e mwc and mc are applied simultaneously particularly wei improvement policies can be increasingly useful to generate positive impacts on the economy of chongqing as the green tax rate increase from a low level to a high level for instance as shown in fig 8 when the green tax at a low level e g 3 yuan tonne there are no obvious differences for impacts on chongqing s economy whichever the wei improvement on mwc is at a low level or a high level however when the green tax at a high level e g 14 yuan tonne wei improvement on mwc at a high level can reduce more economic loss induced by green tax than that at a low level therefore it is suggested that the wei improvement policy as a supplementary policy of the green tax can be more effective only when the green tax is at a relatively high level e g larger than 3 yuan tonne finally there are increased differences between the impacts on urban household consumption and rural household consumption with the growth of green tax rate or wei improvement policies this is because chongqing s economy has a serious urban rural dual structure due to the complex geographic conditions and historical reasons also most rural areas of chongqing are in extremely poverty compared with urban areas owing to the income differences in detail rural households have a unitary income source leading to the poverty by contrast urban households have multi income sources e g labor income and capital gains which can help them to tackle the economic impacts induced by different waste related policies consequently it is recommended that the rural household in chongqing should be paid more attention to be specific some extra allowances can be considered to the rural household to help them cope with the negative economic impacts induced by a new environmental policy other income sources can be considered to extend for rural household which can help them handle the economic impacts by different policies 5 conclusion in this study a factorial emission focused general equilibrium model fege has been first developed to facilitate integrated wastewater related policies development the developed model has been applied to the municipality of chongqing china to explore the impacts of a wastewater related policy on the enviro economic system and support the implementation of a wastewater related policy six different green tax rates regarding wastewater emission have been simulated and analyzed to quantify the inter relationships of a green tax wastewater emission water demand and economic growth based on the simulation results technology improvement policies have been further implemented on key sectors to identify the critical wastewater related policies through analyzing the induced enviro economic effects finally the composite enviro economic effects of multiple interactive wastewater related policies and their compound impacts on the enviro economic system have been investigated it was found that a green tax will reduce wastewater emission while contracting the economy since the green tax policy works through decreasing the demand of commodities to achieve the emission mitigation objective its impacts on gdp are negative further increase in the green tax rate will lead to the reductions in the market in terms of gdp this indicates that a manufacturing oriented economy e g chongqing is difficult for industry switching and a green tax would merely lead to decisions to shrink economy activity rather than adjust to it by contrast wei improvement policies will stimulate the economy while increasing wastewater emission under green tax scenario i e 3 yuan tonne it is because the wei improvement policy works through improving the production technology which can bring the growth of production activities its impacts on gdp are thus positive the impacts on rural households consumption are greater than those on urban households consumption whichever the application of wastewater related policies it is because the rural households in the municipality of chongqing have a relatively unitary income source the interactions between green tax policies and wei improvement policies are significant which shows that the composite effects with application of both green tax and wei improvement policies deserved to study when both the wei improvement policy applied to mwc and the green tax policy implemented on the manufacturing industry the interactive effects could be discovered which are unable to be obtained from the application of a single policy these results suggest that economic development can be adjusted with consideration of multiple environment related policies rather than the single one some limitations will be tacked in future research firstly the dynamic cge model will be developed to better reflect the impacts of wastewater related policies during an application process over time secondly a stochastic analysis will be introduced to help address the inherent uncertainties of the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16881,with the rapid growth of the economy there are increasing conflicts between economic development and environmental protection among these conflicts the wastewater emission management as one of the significant ways to alleviate water scarcity has been paid increasing attention across the developing countries such as china it is thus essential to comprehensively investigate the enviro economic effects induced by wastewater related policies in this study a factorial emission focused general equilibrium model fege is first developed to facilitate examine the composite enviro economic effects of multiple policy scenarios with regards to wastewater related environmental taxes and the related subsides a special case study for the municipality of chongqing china is conducted to illustrate the potential benefits of its use in the formulation of wastewater related policies it is found that the impacts of various wastewater related policies i e environmental taxes and the related subside on gdp are different in detail green tax policies on gdp are negative while wastewater emission intensity wei improvement policies on gdp are positive when green tax reaches 14 yuan tonne which is the maximum proposed by the chinese government the gdp will drop by 0 37 which would be deemed acceptable for the municipality of chongqing in addition the impacts on rural households consumption are greater than those on urban households consumption whichever the application of wastewater related policies it is because the rural households in the municipality of chongqing have a relatively unitary income source it is thus recommended that the rural household in chongqing should be paid more attention for example some extra allowances could be considered to the rural household to help them cope with the negative economic impacts induced by a new environmental policy it is expected that the outputs would provide bases for formulating desired wastewater related policies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords factorial analysis emission focused green tax wastewater emission municipality 1 introduction in recent years since the rapid growth of the economy the increase of water demand for irrigation and industrial production and the poor management of wastewater water related scarcity problems have become increasingly serious in china fang and chen 2015 feng et al 2014 in particular the quality of water supply is deteriorating due to poor wastewater management which not only contributes to the proliferation of waterborne diseases but also reduces the amount of available water supply jimenez and asano 2008 luckmann et al 2016 in fact wastewater and water are closely associated with each other water is the origin of wastewater and wastewater is one of the fates of water consequently tremendous efforts are seriously needed to alleviate water scarcity through studying wastewater management for avoiding the increased risks of poor wastewater management on human health the environment and the economy previously there have been a number of studies associated with wastewater emission from different perspectives to keep the sustainable development of the environment pintilie et al 2016 renou et al 2008 shrestha and wang 2020 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2017 xie et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 b zheng et al 2021a for example renou et al 2008 used five life cycle impact assessment lcia methods to assess the different operated influences of the wastewater treatment plant for removing carbon and nutriment and discussed the importance of this operation phase related to construction and dismantlement pintilie et al 2016 employed the life cycle assessment lca method to study the primary environmental contributors from the wastewater treatment and water reclamation opportunities in tarragona spain wang et al 2017 proposed a model within the arcgis framework to quantity the accumulated wastewater of each city in the yangtze river basin and further analyze the relationship between population density and de facto reuse which helps the management of drinking water in the basin sun et al 2019 defined a total environmental impact score teis to evaluate the environmental impact of multi pollutants in wastewater emission from an integrated iron and steel industry through considering both the quality and quantity of wastewater zheng et al 2019 established a wastewater metabolism input output model to examine the industrial wastewater flow and relationships among sectors and applied it to guangdong province china the findings suggested that the wastewater flows among sectors in guangdong were considerable and the industrial structure of guangdong province were expected to be adjusted to mitigate the wastewater emission nevertheless there were limited efforts to investigate the complex interactions between economy and environment induced by wastewater emission computable general equilibrium cge models as a popular policy simulation tool have been widely used to simulate the contributions of one economic activity or policy to socioeconomic benefits in the whole society which can be employed from different scopes including global beckman et al 2019 britz and hertel 2011 delzeit et al 2020 mukhopadhyay et al 2018 nechifor and winning 2017 ouraich et al 2019 timilsina et al 2010 national bataille and melton 2017 fu et al 2021 li and jia 2016 lin and jia 2020a 2018 ochuodho et al 2016 regional fang et al 2017 li et al 2019 liu et al 2018a 2020 zhang et al 2016 and industrial cui et al 2021 gupta 2016 lau et al 2016 lin and jia 2019 shi et al 2019 in addition there are an increasing number of studies employing a cge model to explore the economic and environmental effects of levying an environmental policy in recent years e g carbon tax allan et al 2014 fu et al 2021 guo et al 2014 jia and lin 2020 lin and jia 2020b 2020c 2019 2018 liu et al 2018a lofgren et al 2002 nong 2020 ojha et al 2020 rodríguez et al 2019 shi et al 2019 for instance guo et al 2014 applied a cge model to examine the effects of a carbon tax on the economy and carbon emission of china through disaggregating the energy sectors into eight ones according to energy use characteristics liu et al 2018 developed a cge model for the province of saskatchewan to study a series of direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts of a carbon tax rodríguez et al 2019 employed a static cge model to simulate a green tax reform in portugal and found that it was possible to decrease the energy intensity of the portuguese economy nong 2020 improved an open sourced cge model i e gtap e power to examine the economy wide impact of a carbon tax in south africa indicating that carbon tax is helpful for south africa to be low carbon and sustainable economy among these cge studies most of them paid attention to the socioeconomic effects of carbon tax while limited ones focused on the effects of regulations for wastewater emission for instance luckmann et al 2016 used a water focused cge model to examine a cascading water system in israel this model can produce shadow prices for wastewater to help governments and pricing decisions fang et al 2016 proposed a cge model with consideration of water resource and water environment factors to study the economic and environmental impacts of wastewater discharge fees however there has been no report of previous studies to evaluate the enviro economic effects of wastewater related environmental taxes through cge models in particular there has been a lack of research in analyzing the interactive effects of such environmental taxes and the related subsidies for encouraging emission reduction within one or multiple economic sectors consequently an emission focused cge to comprehensively investigate such envio economic effects is desired therefore the objective of this research is to develop a factorial emission focused general equilibrium model fege to investigate the composite enviro economic effects of multiple policy scenarios with regards to wastewater related environmental taxes and the related subsidies the developed fege will then be applied to the municipality of chongqing to explore desired pathways for mitigating wastewater emission in detail i factorial analysis will be undertaken to investigate the interactive relationships among different wastewater related policies taxes and subsidies and their compound effects on the enviro economic systems ii issues of wastewater and the related pollutant emissions will be addressed through examination of various tax policies within the cge model it is expected that this study would provide bases for formulating desired wastewater related policies 2 methodology 2 1 development of a factorial emission focused general equilibrium model a static factorial emission focused general equilibrium model fege has been first developed to illustrate the new equilibrium after an exogenous shock affects the municipality s economic system in addition the developed model has been applied to the municipality of chongqing to present its strength and feasibility fege could represent the structure of production and consumption in the economy comprehensively allowing to study the detailed implication of green tax policies factorial analysis is involved to further explore the interactive relationships of different factors e g green tax policies on major wastewater disposal industries facing the environmental pressure in chongqing the municipality government is eager to know the potential impacts of a green tax on the economy therefore fege is significant to help provide a scientific basis for the forthcoming policy development the developed model is subdivided into five modules production trade income and expenditure environment policy and factorial analysis modules 2 1 1 production module the production module for each sector describes the ways where capital labor water and intermediate inputs can be used to produce output böhringer and löschel 2006 lin and jiang 2011 as shown in fig 1 each production function is represented by the nested constant elasticity of substitution ces function with exception of intermediate inputs as the leontief production function in this module there are four types of production inputs i e water capital labor and intermediate inputs various production inputs are combined to produce final goods in detail the capital and water are aggregated into capital water composites while different inputs are aggregated into intermediate inputs then capital water composites and labor are aggregated into labor capital water composites the labor capital water composites and intermediate inputs are further aggregated into domestic outputs thus the mathematical expression of a ces function is shown in eq 1 chichilnisky and wu 2006 dissou 2010 liu et al 2018a lofgren et al 2002 1 q t i α i t δ i t v i σ 1 σ 1 δ i t w i σ 1 σ σ σ 1 where q t i is domestic output and i is production activity sets α i t and δ i t are a scale parameter and share parameter in the ces activity function respectively v i and w i represent two kinds of inputs respectively σ implies the elasticity substitution parameter in ces activity function 2 1 2 trade module as shown in fig 2 the export and import are considered simultaneously for given types of commodities in order to resolve the two way trade issue the armington assumption has been introduced to identify imported and domestic commodities as different products chichilnisky and wu 2006 lofgren et al 2002 for domestic products and imports the ces utility function has been used to determine their domestic demands as shown in eq 2 while for domestic products and exports a constant elasticity transformation cet function has been employed to describe the allocation of the marketed domestic output as shown in eq 3 chichilnisky and wu 2006 liu et al 2018a lofgren et al 2002 2 q q c α c q δ c q q d c ρ c q 1 δ c q q m c ρ c q 1 ρ c q 3 q x c α c t δ c t q d c ρ c t 1 δ c t q e c ρ c t 1 ρ c t where q q c and q x c are the composite supply and c is the commodity sets as both imported and produced domestically α c q and δ c q are a scale parameter and share parameter in the ces utility function respectively α c t and δ c t are a scale parameter and share parameter in the cet function respectively q d c q m c and q e c represent the domestic imported and exported commodities quantity respectively ρ c q and ρ c t imply the exponent of ces utility function and cet function respectively 2 1 3 income and expenditure module changes in income and expenditure for various economic entities can be described in the income and expenditure module in this research five types of economic agents have been considered which are constituted urban households rural households enterprises government and the rest of the world the behaviors of household are determined by the maximization of utility in detail the incomes of households come from the sale of labor and household savings while the expenses of households contain the consumption of commodities and direct tax the consumption function satisfies the assumption of the cobb douglas cd utility function as shown in eq 4 chichilnisky and wu 2006 li and jia 2016 lofgren et al 2002 4 d h ch p c γ ch β h 1 λ h y h h where d h c h is the demand of household h for commodity c p c denotes the market price of commodity c y h h is the total income of household h γ c h implies the proportion of household h in the total labor force β h is the marginal propensity of household h for saving λ h represents the income tax rate of household h the behaviors of enterprises are determined by the maximization of profits to be specific the incomes of enterprises come from the capital and the sale of merchandise while the expenses contain the payment of labor fees the expenditure for further production and the indirect tax owed to the government the government s incomes come from the income tax of household and enterprise indirect taxes tariffs and income from capital and transfer payments from the rest of the world the government s expenditures include the consumption of commodities and transfer payment to enterprises and households 2 1 4 environment policy module due to the increasing environmental issues more and more environment related taxes have been levied to achieve both economic and environmental benefits chou 2001 deng and huang 2020 among them green taxes also known as environmental taxes are becoming more popular in developed countries chou 2001 it can effectively encourage renewable energy production and enable enterprises to implement advanced energy saving technologies deng and huang 2020 zhang and smith 2007 according to the international tax glossary green tax levied on the industry with pollution emission and the use of pollutants xiuyue and hao 2014 in china green taxes aim at manufacturing industries e g mining and washing coal chemical industry manufacture of transport equipment etc the model assumes that pollution e g wastewater solid waste and waste air emissions related to the total output of each manufacturing industries the green tax imposed on different commodities is based on the emission content of pollution and is modeled as an excise tax the tax growths the cost of different industries in terms of pollution emissions and induces enterprise to decrease their use through substitution effects in this study green tax is considered to be one of the income sources for government the green tax implemented on different commodities in terms of wastewater emission and the ad valorem rate are quantified by eqs 5 and 6 allan et al 2014 dong et al 2017 liu et al 2018a 5 w t a x f t w q q f ε f 6 t w f w t a x f p q f q q f where w t a x f is a green tax levied on commodity f t w represents a specific duty rate of green tax t w f denotes the ad valorem duty rate of green tax on commodity f q q f and p q f imply the total domestic consumption and price of commodity f respectively ε f is the wastewater emission intensity wei of commodity f f represents the commodity sets which is levied on green tax 2 1 5 factorial analysis module factorial analysis fa originating from experimental design is an effective statistical tool for investigating the effects of multiple independent factors on several response variables xu et al 2019 it can help researchers gain insights into the interactive relationships of multiple factors at various levels and their impacts on system performance liu et al 2018b zhou et al 2016 the most common form of fa is the 2 k including k factors and two levels for each factor in detail the two levels of different factors are the low levels denoted by 1 and the high level represented by 1 taking a 22 fa as a case the statistic effects model and the summation of squares for single factor and two factors interaction are calculated through eq 7 to 19 montgomery 2017 7 y i j k μ τ i η j τ β i j ξ i j k i 1 2 a j 1 2 b k 1 2 n 8 y i j k 1 n y i j k 9 y i j 1 b k 1 n y i j k 10 y j i 1 a k 1 n y i j k 11 y i 1 a j 1 b k 1 n y i j k 12 s s a 1 b n i 1 a y i 2 y 2 a b n 13 s s b 1 a n j 1 b y j 2 y 2 a b n 14 s s a b 1 n i 1 a j 1 b y i j 2 y 2 a b n s s a s s b 15 s s t i 1 a j 1 b k 1 n y i j k 2 y 2 a b n 16 s s e s s t s s a s s b s s a b 17 f a s s a a 1 s s e a b n 1 18 f b s s b b 1 s s e a b n 1 19 s s a b s s a b a 1 b 1 s s e a b n 1 where y i j k represents the system response when factor a at the ith level and factor b at the jth level for kth replication μ denotes the overall mean τ i η j and τ η i j are the effects of factor a at the ith level factor b at the jth level and their interactions respectively ξ i j k is a random error component s s a s s b and s s a b are the sum of squares of factor a factor b and their combination s s t is the total sum of squares and s s e is the sum of squares of error f a f b and f a b are the f value of factor a factor b and their combination finally the contribution of factors is quantified as the proportion of their sum of squares to the total sum of squares the p value can be quantified through fa using the f value and significant level 0 05 is selected as the significant level in this study in this study a multiple factor i e six factors and two level i e 26 factorial design is adopted to explore the effects of a factor at two levels of other factors the linkage between cge and fa can be summarized that the output from the cge model is the input of fa the details are as follows i the selected factor e g a b and c and level e g i and j are firstly put in the cge model to produce the corresponding response i e y ii the relationships between factors and responses are revealed through the fa iii the significant level of each factor and interactions among different factors are further identified for example green tax is one of the factors selected in this study and the level of green tax is its rate in this study 3 and 14 yuan tonne are chosen as low and high level respectively when the green tax rate is 3 yuan tonne the responses e g gdp can be obtained through the cge model the factorial design will produce a number of combinations including all the information of different factors and levels therefore the combinations and their responses from the cge model will be put into the fa to examine the main and interactive effects among different factors in this study the cge model and fa are implemented in the software gams and minitab respectively since the inputs of this model are all deterministic numbers fege is a deterministic model which further denotes that replication is not necessary however there is a hypothesis testing in fa that the model errors are assumed to be normally and independently distributed random variables with mean zero and variance constant according to the eq 17 to 19 it can be seen that factor s f value is depended on the error item s value if the error item is zero the f value of factors is unable to be quantified therefore the error item is a necessary item in fa however there is no error item in deterministic model the high order interactions are thus chosen as the error item in the deterministic mode since the magnitude of high order interactions is small which can be assumed unimportant fu et al 2021 liu et al 2018b xu et al 2019 b zheng et al 2021a zhou et al 2016 in this study there are six factors fifteen two way interactions and ten three way interactions in total to be specific the total contribution of main effects accounts for 97 94 the total contribution of two way interactions accounts for 2 06 the total contribution of three way interaction effects less than 0 001 consequently the total effects of high order interactions are selected as the error item to reveal the complex effects of two way interactions 2 1 6 model closure and market clearing according to the theory of general equilibrium a cge model requires the balance of both the factor market and the commodity market simultaneously three kinds of macro equilibrium and three types of micro equilibrium are included in the equilibrium module in detail the macro equilibriums contain exchanges balance input and output balance and income and expenditure balance while the mic equilibriums include resources market clearing capital market clearing and product market clearing the income and expenditure balance requires that the expenditures of all economic entities equal their incomes the transfer payments from and to other entities are covered in both revenue and expenditure the input and output balance means that the total supplies of each industry equal the sum of intermediate demand domestic consumption net export and investment of each industry capital market clearing means that the savings of all sectors equal their total investment 2 2 case study and data sources chongqing as one of the six legacy industrial bases in china is located between the north latitude 28 10 32 13 and the east longitude 105 11 110 11 in 1997 chongqing was designated as a municipality directly managed by the chinese central government liu et al 2018 nassour et al 2020 due to administrative attention chongqing has experienced very rapid economic development after being a municipality yu et al 2017 to be specific the gdp of chongqing increased averaging over 14 per year from 2009 to 2017 bao et al 2019 in addition the population in chongqing has a rapid growth from 28 16 million in 2007 to 31 75 million in 2017 bao et al 2019 le et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 with the rapid development of the economy and population the environment of chongqing has been accompanied by a series of issues e g ghg emissions wastewater emission and water scarcity tan et al 2016 as a major industrial city in southwest china the economy of chongqing mainly depends on the development of heavy industries which largely increases water consumptions and wastewater emissions tan et al 2016 zheng et al 2021b the characteristics of the water resources in chongqing can be summarized as follows i the distribution of water resources in chongqing is uneven across time and space ii the local water resources are insufficient iii the development and utilization of transit water are difficult zheng et al 2020 due to the characteristics of water resources and the direction of economic development chongqing still belongs to the water deficient area though it is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze as one of the fates of water wastewater is closely related to water resource there are still a number of industrial wastewater emissions in chongqing every year in 2017 the industrial wastewater emission of chongqing was 193 03 million tonnes accounting for almost 3 of total ones of china for the water deficient area wastewater emissions management can be a useful pathway to alleviate water scarcity since water is the origin of wastewater in addition the environmental concerns of chongqing not only have a significant impact on its economic development but also influence crucially the ecological safety and sustainable development in regions surrounding the yangtze river due to geographical position consequently as the most highly populated city in china it is thus desired to pay more attention to the research related to environmental concerns for the municipality of chongqing hu et al 2017 wu et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 the input output table of chongqing which is obtained from chongqing statistical yearbook has been aggregated into twenty two sectors based on data availability and sector characteristics chongqing bureau of statistics 2013 the twenty two sectors employed in this study has been listed in table 1 the data of water consumption and wastewater emission is taken from chongqing statistical yearbook chongqing bureau of statistics 2013 china statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics 2013 chongqing water resource bulletin chongqing water resource bureau 2013 the social accounting matrix sam is constructed using the input output table of chongqing water consumption data wastewater emission data national accounts data and other statistical data the wei of each sector is calculated based on the environmental protection tax law of the people s republic of china and the integrated wastewater emission standard gb8978 1996 the relevant data are taken from chongqing statistical yearbook chongqing bureau of statistics 2013 and chongqing municipal ecological environment bureau chongqing bureau of municipal ecological environment 2013 in this study eleven policy scenarios are designed to investigate the effects of different wastewater emission management policies on various industries in detail six policy scenarios are first designed based on the reality of the implementation of the green tax in china additionally five policy scenarios are then designed based on the emission performance of each sector according to the regulation on the implementation of the environmental protection tax law of the people s republic of china issued by administrative regulations document number order no 693 of the state council the green tax rates regarding wastewater emission are from 1 4 to 14 yuan tonne and aim at reducting the emissions of manufacturing industry i e sector 2 to sector 14 in table 2 to examine the socioeconomic and environmental effects of green tax implemented on sectors of chongqing six green tax rates have been designed and simulated in this study shown in table 2 the green tax policy is one of the wastewater emission management policies as another wastewater emission management policy wei improvement policy is introduced in this study the work mechanisms of green tax policy and wei improvement policy are different in detail the green tax policy is from the perspective of consumption while the wei improvement policy is from the perspective of production the green tax policy works through the demand adjustment of commodities with a number of wastewater emissions for example when the green tax policy is applied to the textile sector the cost of textile commodities would be indirectly increased which would result in the growth of the price of textile commodities with the increase of the price of textile commodities their demand would be decreased since other commodities would be chosen to replace the local textile commodities therefore the plant manager would cut the production of textile to adapt to the market demand which can thus reduce the emission of wastewater the wei improvement policy is to achieve the objective through production activities such as technology mandates and environmental standards when it is implemented on sectors water consumption of industries can be reduced through improving the sectors production technology for example improving the production efficiency of the textile sector influences its whole production structure which will further cut the water consumption and wastewater emission of the textile sector consequently the major differences between the green tax policy and wei improvement policy are the work ways to be specific the green tax policy is a top down way which works by reducing the demand of commodities and indirectly influences the total wastewater emissions in contrast the wei improvement policy is a bottom up way which works by reducing the water consumption of production process and indirectly affects the total wastewater emission intensities for the sectors with relatively small wastewater emissions it is difficult to further improve the production technology to reduce water consumption during the production process with accepted capital input the induced wastewater emissions are thus relatively difficult to be mitigated therefore the top five wastewater emission sectors i e mwc mft mtf mc and mte in chongqing are chosen to further examine the effects of wei improvement policy on various sectors in addition 3 yuan tonne is the current green tax rate of chongqing therefore the wei improvement policy scenarios i e green tax related subsidies are designed with consideration of the current green tax to better investigate the actual enviro economic performance of chongqing the details are presented in table 2 the model was solved using the general algebraic modeling system gams software with the path solver bussieck and meeraus 2004 3 results 3 1 enviro economic effects induced by green tax policies using the developed model in this study the induced see effects are summarized in table 3 and performed in fig 3 and fig 4 the gdp change and its details are calculated under different green tax policy scenarios as shown in table 3 in addition the detailed import and export changes are quantified in fig 3 finally the environmental effects i e water demand and wastewater emission are revealed in fig 4 as shown in table 3 the impacts of green tax on gdp are negative when the green tax is under 3 yuan tonne i e scenarios 1 and 2 the gdp change is comparatively low this implies that a relatively low green tax won t have significant impacts on the economy when the green tax is 3 yuan tonne which is being implemented currently by chongqing government the gdp will reduce by 0 08 comparing with the results without green tax when the green tax reaches 14 yuan tonne which is the maximum proposed by the chinese government the gdp will drop by 0 37 considering that the growth of gdp in the municipality of chongqing was 5 40 in 2019 the gdp change for scenario 6 would be deemed acceptable in fact gdp is composed of rural household consumption urban household consumption government consumption investment imports and exports therefore the gdp change can be disaggregated into the above changes to facilitate the analysis of detailed economic changes in general the impacts of green tax on rural household consumption urban household consumption and exports are negative while those on government consumption investment and import are positive in addition the government consumption is affected significantly while the investment is affected relatively slightly when the green tax is 3 yuan tonne the government consumption increases by 1 93 and the investment only grows by 0 01 comparing the impacts on urban and rural household consumption the impacts on rural household consumption are similar with those on urban household consumption under a relatively low green tax e g s1 and s2 however the changes of rural household consumption are larger than those of urban household consumption when the green tax is relatively high e g s5 and s6 since the complex geographic conditions and historical reasons the economy of chongqing has a serious urban rural dual structure most rural areas of chongqing are in extreme poverty compared with urban areas resulting in the consumption difference when the green tax implemented on different sectors the cost of factories will increase and thus directly affects household incomes the consumption demand of rural households is determined by their incomes which are mainly earned through labor inputs in the production activities thus rural households have a unitary income source due to relative poverty by contrast urban households have multi income sources e g labor income and capital gains therefore the total rural incomes will be affected more significantly than the total urban revenues with the implication of green tax meanwhile the consumption of rural households will decline more than that of urban households due to economic depression the imports change is similar to the gdp change with the application of the same green tax for example when the green tax is 14 yuan tonne the gdp will decline by 0 37 and the imports increase by 0 31 however the government consumption change is higher than the gdp change under the same green tax scenario since the green tax can increase the government income from tax revenues fig 3 shows the changes of imports and exports under six green tax scenarios by sectors each sector is presented by a rectangle with unique color and the width of rectangles indicates the changes it is worth noting that the total changes of exports are larger than those of imports since both the domestic production and the total consumption will decline the imports will be a relatively low decrease as an important industrial area in western china the economy of chongqing is most contributed by the development of the manufacturing industry the exports from the manufacturing industry will be affected significantly since the green tax aims at the wastewater emission of the manufacturing industry in addition the exports and imports of different sectors vary significantly across the six green tax scenarios for example export change of mwc ranks at the top followed by mc and mte when the green tax reaches 14 yuan tonne the export changes of mwc mc and mte decrease by 4 63 3 00 and 2 26 respectively as for the import changes mte ranks at the top followed by mc mtf and psp when the green tax reaches 14 yuan tonne the import changes of mte mc mtf and psp reduce by 1 47 0 89 0 74 and 0 62 respectively it is worth mentioning that the primary industry and the tertiary industry will be affected by the green tax even if the green tax is only implemented on the manufacturing industry for instance when the green tax reaches 14 yuan tonne the export change of primary industry decreases by 0 10 and its import change grows by 0 06 this indicates different industries have complex interactive relationships which is desired to be explored to facilitate the macroeconomic and microeconomic effects induced by the green tax policy the changes of water demand and wastewater emission by sectors under two green tax scenarios are presented in fig 4 since the similar trends can be observed under different green tax policy scenarios the detailed results of other scenarios related to the impacts on water demand and wastewater emission are summarized in supporting information the water demand of manufacturing industry will decrease due to the productive activities reduction caused by the green tax while the water demand of other sectors will slightly increase for instance when the green tax is 14 yuan tonne the water demand of primary industry increases by 0 01 there are similar trends for different sectors in terms of water demand and wastewater emission for example when the green tax is 3 yuan tonne the water demand of mc decreases most i e 0 42 followed by mte i e 0 31 and mwc i e 0 21 the wastewater emission of mc also has the highest decrease i e 0 48 followed by mte i e 0 38 and mwc 0 36 in general the impacts of green tax on water demand are less obvious than those on wastewater emission for instance when the green tax reaches 14 yuan tonne the total water demand of all sectors can decrease by 0 21 and the total wastewater emission can drop by 1 40 thus the green tax is useful for reducing wastewater emission of the manufacturing industry 3 2 enviro economic effects of wastewater emission intensity improvement policies according to the above analysis the green tax has different impacts on various sectors as one of the main factors affecting wastewater emission it is significant to examine the see effects induced by wei improvement in order to further investigate the above effects five wei improvement policy scenarios have been conducted with consideration of the performances of each sector under the six green tax scenarios all simulations in this section are conducted when the green tax is 3 yuan tonne since this green tax is adopted now in the chongqing government the induced see effects are summarized in table 4 and performed in fig 5 and fig 6 the gdp changes caused by the wei improvement of specfic sectors are summarized in table 4 it can be seen that the impacts of wei improvement on gdp are positive when the wei improvement applied to mwc i e scenario 7 the gdp change is the highest followed by mc i e scenario 10 the wei of mwc and mc has been improved separately which results in an increase of gdp by 0 016 and 0 013 respectively by contrast the wei improvement implemented on mft i e scenario 8 mtf i e scenario 9 and mte i e scenario 11 have similar impacts on gdp changes which only makes the gdp increase by 0 003 0 002 and 0 004 respectively this indicates that wei improvement applied to various sectors has different performances in terms of gdp changes the impacts of wei improvement on rural household consumption urban household consumption and exports are positive while those on government consumption import and investment are negative in addition the impact on government consumption is largest followed by exports imports rural household consumption and urban household consumption while the impact on the investment is the smallest when the wei improvement implemented on mwc the changes of government consumption exports imports rural household consumption and urban household consumption and investment are 0 397 0 062 0 014 0 011 0 007 and 0 005 respectively it is obvious that the impacts on rural household consumption are larger than those on urban household consumption the reason is that the wei improvement can bring the productive activities growth which further increase the income from labor inputs in addition the impacts induced by wei improvement on rural households consumption are greater than those on urban households consumption this is suggested that rural households have a relatively unitary income source the changes of exports and imports under different wei improvement scenarios by sectors have been quantified in fig 5 by comparing the changes of exports and imports it can be seen that the total impacts on exports are more obvious than those on imports also the wei improvement can promote exports and inhibit imports simultaneously for example when the wei improvement on mwc i e s7 the total import change increases by 0 014 while the total export change rises by 0 062 which is more than five times of total import changes this is because the wei improvement can stimulate economic activities and thus improve the domestic production as shown in fig 5 a the total impacts on the export of one sector will increase most when the wei improvement applied to it to be specific the export change of mwc in s7 ranks at the top in s8 mft has the highest export change among sectors with an increase of 0 009 in s9 the impact on the export of mft is largest growing by 0 009 in s10 the export change of mc ranks at the top rising by 0 042 in s11 mte has the highest export change among sectors increasing by 0 014 it is worth noting that the impacts on imports are different by sectors according to fig 5 b for example when the wei improvement on mwc the import change of mte is largest decreasing by 0 067 while the import changes of mwc and fin are smallest which can be ignored when the wei improvement applied to different sectors the performances of various sectors on import vary significantly for instance when the wei improvement on mtf the impact on import of mte is largest declining by 0 011 consequently the impacts on imports and exports induced by wei improvement vary notably due to the economic characteristic of chongqing the changes of water demand and wastewater emission under different wei improvement policy scenarios are shown in fig 6 the different sectors are represented by different colors which are presented by the first axis on the left the total changes of water demand and wastewater emission are indicated by the purple triangle which is presented by the second axis on the right the total water demand changes under five wei improvement policy scenarios are from 0 001 to 0 010 while the total wastewater emission changes under five wei improvement policy scenarios are from 0 002 to 0 045 this indicates that the impacts of wei improvement on water demand and wastewater emission are all positive since the wei improvement can stimulate productive activities it further increases the wastewater emission thus it is reasonable to increase the green tax i e more than 3 yuan tonne in chongqing for achieving the target of environmental protection when the technology of addressing wastewater emission is improved as shown in fig 6 a the sectors with the highest water demand changes from s7 to s11 are mwc mft mtf mc and mte respectively a similar trend can be observed in fig 6 b to sum up when the wei improvement applied to a specific sector this sector will have higher impacts on export water demand and wastewater emission than other sectors 3 3 effects from different wastewater related policies and their interactions based on the above analysis the applications of both green tax and wei improvement can lead to a series of effects on enviro economic systems however the impacts induced by the green tax are opposite to those by wei improvement it is thus significant to examine the interactions of green tax and wei improvement in this section six factors i e green tax wei improvement on mwc mft mtf mc and mte respectively and their interaction effects are further investigated through a factorial analysis the relevant responses are gdp rural consumption urban consumption enterprise consumption government consumption imports and exports in detail the impacts on gdp are shown in table 5 fig 7 and fig 8 while impacts on others i e rural consumption urban consumption enterprise consumption government consumption imports and exports are presented in support information fig 7 presents the absolute values of each effect through estimating against the cumulative normal probabilities the half normal plot as a kind of graphical tool can be employed to visually distinguish whether the effects of factors are significant or not to be specific the distances of a factor lying away from the red line represent the factor s significant level if a factor is far away from the red line it should be significant shown as a red square in contrast the effect of a factor is insignificant if it is close to the red line which is presented as a blue dot it can be seen that the main effects of six factors are all significant including a b c d e and f however the interactive effects of six factors are not all significant for example the effect of be is significant while the effect of bc is insignificant in order to better examine the impacts of the major factors on the gdp table 5 offers the details of sum of squares contribution f value and p value for the six factors and their interactions it is indicated that the application of green tax is more significant than the application of wei improvement for gdp response it is also worth noting that the application of green tax has great impacts on the gdp of chongqing with its contribution being 92 75 the results for other responses i e rural consumption urban consumption investment government consumption imports and exports are similar as shown in support information the wei improvement applied to mwc has a relatively large contribution than that to other sectors although the contribution of interactions is only 2 06 a number of two way effects are significant i e p value lower than 0 05 specially the p values between green tax and the other five factors are all lower than 0 001 indicating that it is significant for the interactions between green tax and wei improvement in addition the p value of mwc mc is 0 014 i e lower than 0 05 which means that interactions between wei improvement on mwc and mc are also significant these results further illustrate that it is crucial to examine the interactive relationships between two factors fig 8 shows the interactive plot of all factors in detail the blue solid line represents the low level of factors while the red dotted line implies the high level of factors for instance the low level of green tax is 3 yuan tonne represented by 1 while the high level of green tax is 14 yuan tonne represented by 1 the matrixes can describe the interactive relationships through depicting specific variations generated by one design factor s impact on responses under the effect of another factor the intersecting lines stand for the effects of a factor that will change when the other factor is at different levels which also means that the combination of two factors has a significant interactive effect on system responses it is worth noting that there are intersecting lines in fig 8 with different patterns which means that the interactive relationships are obvious taking the green tax mwc subfigure of fig 8 as an example the red dotted line stands for the changes with the application of green tax across its two levels when the application of wei improvement on mwc is at its high level in contrast the blue solid line means that the effects of green tax across its two levels when the application of wei improvement on mwc takes the low level in the green tax mwc subfigure of fig 8 both the red dotted line and blue dotted line decline when the application of green tax from a low level to a high level the results indicate that the application of green tax would cause the effect of wei improvement on mwc to some extent obviously the interactions between the application of green tax and wei improvement on mwc are more significant 4 discussion according to the above analysis the developed fege in this study is appropriate to investigate the composite enviro economic effects induced by different wastewater related policies i e six green tax policy scenarios and five wei improvement policy scenarios for the municipality of chongqing china the main findings and suggestions are as follows firstly the green tax policies can help mitigate wastewater emission while accompanying the reduction of chongqing s economy i e gdp to be specific when the green tax is 3 yuan tonne which is the current green tax rate adopted by chongqing s government the gdp drops by 0 08 and the wastewater emissions decrease by 0 61 this shows that the green tax policy is useful to reduce wastewater emissions since the economy growth of chongqing heavily depends on manufacturing industry development the amount of wastewater emission in chongqing is larger than that in other areas under the same economic level moreover chongqing is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze and its wastewater emission has impacts on other provinces situated on the downstream of the yangtze therefore the higher green tax rate is significant for chongqing as well as other provinces along the yangtze to improve the environment when the green tax rate is 14 yuan tonne the wastewater emissions of chongqing reduce by 1 4 and the gdp only drops 0 37 it is thus suggested that the highest green tax rate i e 14 yuan tonne which is the maximum proposed by chinese government is deemed acceptable for the municipality of chongqing since the growth of gdp in chongqing is 5 4 in 2019 secondly in depth investigations on significant industries which are selected based on the outputs from green tax policy scenarios are conducted by simulating five wei improvement policy scenarios the wei improvement on industries can bring productive activities growth through technology improvement on wastewater emission which further leads to the increase of gdp and the decrease of wastewater emissions for example chongqing s gdp will drop by 0 016 and wastewater emission will grow by 0 027 when the wei improvement applied to mwc i e mining and washing of coal industry the results indicate the wei improvement polices cannot be implemented independently to improve the environment it is thus recommended that the wei improvement policies can be a supplementary policy of green tax to reduce wastewater emission and at the same time minimize the negative impacts on the economy thirdly the interactive effects between green tax policies and wei improvement policies have been explored through the developed fege it can be found that there are obvious interactive relationships when green tax policy and wei improvement on specfic industry i e mwc and mc are applied simultaneously particularly wei improvement policies can be increasingly useful to generate positive impacts on the economy of chongqing as the green tax rate increase from a low level to a high level for instance as shown in fig 8 when the green tax at a low level e g 3 yuan tonne there are no obvious differences for impacts on chongqing s economy whichever the wei improvement on mwc is at a low level or a high level however when the green tax at a high level e g 14 yuan tonne wei improvement on mwc at a high level can reduce more economic loss induced by green tax than that at a low level therefore it is suggested that the wei improvement policy as a supplementary policy of the green tax can be more effective only when the green tax is at a relatively high level e g larger than 3 yuan tonne finally there are increased differences between the impacts on urban household consumption and rural household consumption with the growth of green tax rate or wei improvement policies this is because chongqing s economy has a serious urban rural dual structure due to the complex geographic conditions and historical reasons also most rural areas of chongqing are in extremely poverty compared with urban areas owing to the income differences in detail rural households have a unitary income source leading to the poverty by contrast urban households have multi income sources e g labor income and capital gains which can help them to tackle the economic impacts induced by different waste related policies consequently it is recommended that the rural household in chongqing should be paid more attention to be specific some extra allowances can be considered to the rural household to help them cope with the negative economic impacts induced by a new environmental policy other income sources can be considered to extend for rural household which can help them handle the economic impacts by different policies 5 conclusion in this study a factorial emission focused general equilibrium model fege has been first developed to facilitate integrated wastewater related policies development the developed model has been applied to the municipality of chongqing china to explore the impacts of a wastewater related policy on the enviro economic system and support the implementation of a wastewater related policy six different green tax rates regarding wastewater emission have been simulated and analyzed to quantify the inter relationships of a green tax wastewater emission water demand and economic growth based on the simulation results technology improvement policies have been further implemented on key sectors to identify the critical wastewater related policies through analyzing the induced enviro economic effects finally the composite enviro economic effects of multiple interactive wastewater related policies and their compound impacts on the enviro economic system have been investigated it was found that a green tax will reduce wastewater emission while contracting the economy since the green tax policy works through decreasing the demand of commodities to achieve the emission mitigation objective its impacts on gdp are negative further increase in the green tax rate will lead to the reductions in the market in terms of gdp this indicates that a manufacturing oriented economy e g chongqing is difficult for industry switching and a green tax would merely lead to decisions to shrink economy activity rather than adjust to it by contrast wei improvement policies will stimulate the economy while increasing wastewater emission under green tax scenario i e 3 yuan tonne it is because the wei improvement policy works through improving the production technology which can bring the growth of production activities its impacts on gdp are thus positive the impacts on rural households consumption are greater than those on urban households consumption whichever the application of wastewater related policies it is because the rural households in the municipality of chongqing have a relatively unitary income source the interactions between green tax policies and wei improvement policies are significant which shows that the composite effects with application of both green tax and wei improvement policies deserved to study when both the wei improvement policy applied to mwc and the green tax policy implemented on the manufacturing industry the interactive effects could be discovered which are unable to be obtained from the application of a single policy these results suggest that economic development can be adjusted with consideration of multiple environment related policies rather than the single one some limitations will be tacked in future research firstly the dynamic cge model will be developed to better reflect the impacts of wastewater related policies during an application process over time secondly a stochastic analysis will be introduced to help address the inherent uncertainties of the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16882,with two thirds of the global population living in areas affected by water scarcity wastewater reuse is actively being implemented or explored by many nations there is a need to better

rwtps produced high quality recycled water for non potable reuse by removing 95 of eops and args however subpopulations of eops and args survived disinfection and demonstrated potential to become

water along with the likely presence of multi drug resistant bacteria results provide new insights into the persistence and growth of eops and prevalence and removal of args in recycled water systems

recycling is an increasingly important climate independent water source for many nations with appropriate treatment monitoring and management water recycling provides safe stable and sustainable water

treatment plants wwtps as antimicrobial resistance amr hotspots guo et al 2017 michael et al 2013 it is also hypothesised that wwtps may be important in amr selection and transfer because wastewater microbes are exposed to antibiotic residues and other pollutants e g metals biocides organics as well as an array of physical oxidative treatment processes e g chlorine ozone ultraviolet radiation all of which can potentially stimulate eops and args selection propagation and horizontal gene transfer berendonk et al 2015 guo et al 2015 shi et al 2013 considerable uncertainties remain regarding the fate of drug resistant microorganisms both pathogens and commensals during wastewater treatment and in downstream environments wwtps and their disinfection treatments play an important role as critical barriers to mitigate environmental amr transfer guo et al 2017 singer et al 2016 yet relatively little is known about eops and args diversity abundance and survival in highly treated recycled

negreanu et al 2012 furthermore the comparability of such studies is limited due to the lack of available standard methods and other complicating factors such as local differences in wastewater eops and args burden and treatment intensity and variations in native microbiomes and resistomes in receiving environments greater understanding of the microbial ecology and downstream fate of eops and args in wastewater effluents and recycled waters is needed to underpin robust risk assessment and protect end users and the environment singer et al 2016 alongside resistance gene dynamics another

analysis of variance anova and tukey s honestly significant difference hsd to compare gene copy numbers between influents recycled and regrowth waters graphs were drawn using graphpad prism version 9 graphpad software inc 3 results and discussion 3 1 eops occurrence and detection in influent wastewater and recycled water mitigating the risk of waterborne disease is a high priority in recycled waters used for agriculture recycled water quality varied with rwtp b slightly outperforming rwtps a and c overall but no single treatment plant consistently ranked best across all eops all targeted eops were present in the influent wastewater to all three rwtps at 104 gene copies ml 1 dna fig 2 a significant decreases in all targeted eops were consistently achieved at all three rwtps fig 2a total bacterial removal efficiency across the three rwtps based on 16s rrna qpcr fig s1 ranged from 1 3 to 2 9 dna log10 reduction values lrvs across all seasons while species specific dna lrvs ranged from 2 1 to 5 all dna and rna based lrvs are presented in table 2 lrvs calculated using rna gene copy numbers showed greater variability of lrvs between different rwtps and eops than lrvs calculated using dna derived data overall rwtp b p 0 05 outperformed rwtps a and c with respect to eop inactivation rna lrvs but based on dna the majority of eop lrvs did not differ significantly p 0 086 across the three rwtps despite the varying treatment trains which included multiple chlorination stages plus uv irradiation for rwtp b 3 2 proliferation potential of eops in recycled water recycled water networks in australia can include long distribution pipelines and large storage basins therefore the potential for microbial regrowth in final product water exists laurenson et al 2010 eops regrowth comes from viable but non culturable vbnc eops is well established that several eops such e coli enterococcus spp listeria spp and salmonella spp can enter into a viable but non culturable vbnc state during the wastewater treatment and disinfection processes liu et al 2018 vbnc eops do not grow in conventional bacteriological media but are still alive and have low levels of metabolic activity more importantly vbnc eops may restart active growth when optimal conditions are restored wagley et al 2021 this suggests that vbnc eops in treated effluents can enter reclaimed water distribution systems and may serve as seeds for regrowth which pose potential health risks when reclaimed water is used lin et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to monitor not only culturable but also vbnc bacteria in treated effluents and at the point of use for reclaimed water guo et al 2019 to assess this the abundance and regrowth potential of eops in the recycled waters of each rwtp n 9 for each rwtp summer season only was measured using total dna and rna extracts from the treated water and following 7 day regrowth incubation together these dna and rna based qpcr results provide complementary insights distinguishing organisms that remain metabolically active rna based from those that are inactivated dna based by disinfection wang et al 2020 fig 3 shows that the patterns of response in terms of inactivation persistence and reactivation regrowth varied between bacteria but the patterns were consistent between rwtps a baumannii rna lrv 2 1 2 8 e coli populations rna lrv 1 9 3 4 and streptococcus spp rna lrv 1 6 2 1 remained metabolically active post disinfection but did not show further reactivation regrowth during the 7 day incubation period this may be indicative of cell death and or amoebic phagocytosis and or survival without active growth niller et al 2017 on the contrary a butzleri rna lrv 4 was detected only by dna analysis and did not show any indication of regrowth under ambient nutrient conditions table 1 these results were consistent across the three treatment plants indicating that this organism is more susceptible to inactivation stressors at the rwtps species that regrew significantly during incubation included k pneumoniae legionella spp l monocytogenes and p aeruginosa interestingly k pneumoniae rna lrv 1 8 4 7 remained metabolically active following disinfection at all three rwtps but the dna vs rna response patterns varied comparatively rwtp b achieved better overall removal based on dna results but rna copy numbers were significantly greater post regrowth and were the highest across all three plants given that the dna gene copy abundance did not change post incubation it suggests that there was metabolic resuscitation of existing cells rather than proliferation by contrast the k pneumoniae results from rwtps a and c do not show any obvious signs of post disinfection reactivation regrowth these findings on k pneumoniae might reflect differences in the treatment trains and resulting microbial community structure e g uv treatment at rwtp b open lagoons at rwtp c and subsequent sos response aminov 2011 and or competitive interactions in the different recycled waters legionella spp rna lrv 1 1 2 8 also responded differently across the three rwtps with copy numbers consistently lower at rwtp b compared to plants a and c the combined results indicate post disinfection regrowth in water from rwtp c and possibly also in a but not for rwtp b it is possible that the process configuration at rwtp c which included stabilization lagoons fig 1 provided conditions that fostered the growth of amoebae and protozoan communities specialized in hosting legionella spp and protecting from chlorine exposure jjemba et al 2010 kilvington and price 1990 inactivation and removal of legionella spp was notably better at rwtp b which could be a result of the membrane ultrafiltration 0 04 µm step effectively removing the natural hosts amoebae protozoa for this genus as well as the dual stage chlorination at rwtp b final recycled water chlorine dose and chlorine residuals were otherwise comparable across the three rwtps table 1 p aeruginosa rna lrv 2 1 3 remained metabolically active and was amongst the most resilient eops surviving disinfection and showing evidence of post disinfection regrowth post disinfection proliferation of pseudomonas spp has previously been observed shi et al 2013 and its genomic plasticity and propensity for amr carriage makes this finding of significance in the current context becerra castro et al 2016 l monocytogenes rna lrv 3 8 5 responded similarly across all three plants both dna and rna results clearly indicated replication and regrowth despite initial recycled water rna copies being consistently below detection suggesting initial disinfection induced dormancy or metabolic inactivation s enteritidis rna lrv 3 7 4 7 was particularly sensitive to rwtp treatment stressors but an active persister cell population clearly survived in all cases allowing rapid replication and regrowth during the 7 day incubation both l monocytogenes and s enteritidis are implicated in produce related foodborne outbreaks liu et al 2018 hence the effective inactivation of s enteritidis and l monocytogenes in these rwtps is a positive finding however their evident potential for regrowth and known capacity to be internalized in plants as bacterial endophytes kljujev et al 2018 highlight the need for proactive on farm water quality management to ensure risks are effectively controlled this is important from the perspective of understanding eops exposure potential for recycled water uses with direct contact e g turf irrigation or aerosolization potential e g dust suppression on building sites and for limiting food chain exposure risks for minimally processed produce e faecalis rna lrv 1 9 3 1 dna analysis showed no significant change in abundance during the regrowth incubation while rna analysis showed that metabolically active cells were present in the recycled water at the point of production but not after 7 days incubation as dna gene abundance was stable this may indicate a shift to persister cell vbnc phenotype kim et al 2018 a known strategy used by e faecalis under unfavorable environmental conditions oliver 2010 3 3 args occurrence and detection in influent wastewater and recycled water the majority of args quantified in this study were selected for their high priority in australian human amr surveillance and their global importance as major emerging threats currently some are infrequently detected in australian clinical isolates but recognised as emerging risks bla ndm bla oxa 48 like bla vim bla imi bla sme and bla kpc acsqhc 2019 the majority of the targeted genes were not detected by qpcr in the wastewater influents to the three sites indicating they are rare absent in the south australian communities surveyed results that concur with the relevant human surveillance data acsqhc 2019 turnidge and meleady 2018 specifically bla ndm bla oxa 48 like bla vim bla imi and bla sme were not detected in either the influent wastewater or treated recycled water at any of these rwtps however several other carbapenem resistance genes were repeatedly detected including bla tem bla ges and bla kpc the bla shv gene was present in the influents to all three sites but significantly more prevalent in the influent to rwtp a bla shv decreased in response to all three treatment trains and was bloq in the final recycled water from both rwtps b and c across all three rwtps the average log reduction of detected args following treatment varied from 2 2 lrv for mcr 1 to 5 lrv for bla kpc dna based and from 2 lrv for bla tem to 5 lrv for bla kpc rna based the varying arg removal efficiencies reflect the complex effects of water treatment processes on bacterial communities table 2 table 1 qnrs was the most abundant arg across all three rwtps with up to 1 7 1010 copies ml 1 influent rwtp a dna and average lrv of 1 2 qnrs was included for comparative purposes as it has been used and recommended for inter national environmental amr benchmarking berendonk et al 2015 rocha et al 2020 the mcr 1 gene was consistently detected across all three plants 2 7 102 1 3 106 copies ml 1 influent while mcr 3 and bla imi bla sme bla ndm bla vim bla imp and bla oxa 48 like were consistently below the detection limit the intl1 gene relates to the presence of class 1 integrons important genes that are often carried on mobile genetic elements and used as indicators for multi drug resistance gillings et al 2015 copy numbers in raw influents ranged between 8 2 105 and 2 108 copies ml 1 intl1 copies were reduced by 2 8 to 3 2 rna lrvs and 1 2 to 2 2 dna lrvs across the three rwtps this is better than or similar to removal rates reported for wwtps rwtps internationally as are the significant reductions in 16s rrna copies across all three treatment plants garner et al 2018 laht et al 2014 mao et al 2015 the persistence of intl1 detected in both dna and rna suggests that significant genetic recombination capacity remains in the treated effluents along with the presence of multi drug resistant persister cells fig 4 despite the reductions in gene load some clinically relevant args remained present and actively expressed in these effluents fig 4 given the complexity of recycled water quality storage and use internationally open closed storage managed aquifer recharge source mixing and product water blending etc the global significance of these findings is not easily ascertained and research is needed to understand arg fate in water recycling schemes and the potential need for and benefit of advanced treatment solutions for amr risk mitigation these results suggest that adding additional disinfection steps using conventional processes such as chlorination dose approx 10 mg l table 1 and uv treatment may be of limited benefit for further reducing arg copies in treated effluents figs 1 4 3 4 proliferation potential of args in recycled water while gene abundance varied between rwtps and args the pattern of arg proliferation following 7 day incubation was consistent across all three rwtps fig 4 results suggest that rwtps b and c produced higher quality recycled water than rwtp a eop observations in fig 3 for example qnrs was the only arg detected at 103 copies ml 1 dna in recycled water from rwtps b and c whereas water produced at rwtp a contained qnrs bla tem bla shv and mcr 1 at 103 copies ml 1 further bla shv was bloq in recycled water from rwtps b and c but 106 copies ml 1 in water produced at rwtp a although bla ges was also quantifiable in the dna extracted from all three recycled water sources bla imi bla sme bla ndm bla vim bla imp bla oxa 48 like and mcr 3 were never detected in any rwtp sample 3 4 1 quinolone resistance quinolone compounds are persistent environmental contaminants gutierrez et al 2017 and resistance rates from community derived infections have increased in recent years acsqhc 2019 mobile quinolone args have been found in clinical and environmental isolates worldwide hooper and jacoby 2015 robicsek et al 2006 in this study qnrs was detected in the influents and effluents of all three rwtps results showed that qnrs abundance decreased with post disinfection incubation suggesting that organisms carrying qnrs underwent die off and or predation inactivation during the 7 day incubation given the limited incubation scenario tested here no added nutrients it is uncertain if this would also occur in recycled waters used for irrigation and food production as on farm source water mixing may occur we note that qnrs was the only arg analyzed that showed this trend garner et al 2018 reported that qnra related to qnrs was the only one of four args quantified incl qnra bla tem vana and sul1 to be significantly removed following water treatment but only in one of four treatment plants examined 3 4 2 β lactamase resistance our results suggest that genes conferring resistance to various classes of β lactams were consistently detected in wwtp influents fig 2 most antimicrobials administered to humans worldwide are β lactams and the resistance types of greatest concern include extended spectrum β lactamases esbls which confer resistance to third generation cephalosporins and the carbapenemases which confer resistance to carbapenems and almost all other β lactams acsqhc 2019 in clinical settings carbapenemase producing enterobacterales are almost always highly multi drug resistant and resulting infections require last line agents such as colistin that can be cytotoxic acsqhc 2019 notably the pattern of abundance both in influents and recycled waters reflects the chronological order in which these genes have become clinically relevant and that in turn reflects the order in which these different classes of antimicrobials were therapeutically introduced jacoby 2006 liakopoulos et al 2016 nordmann et al 2012 temoneira tem extended spectrum β lactamases bla tem is the most encountered β lactamase gene in gram negative bacteria and bla tem 1 was the first β lactamase gene described in gram negatives smet et al 2010 here it was quantifiable in the dna and rna extracts of all three recycled waters signifying that a substantial proportion was carried in metabolically active cells bla tem abundance increased following incubation in all cases fig 4 indicating post disinfection regrowth of host cells carrying bla tem or uptake into new microbial hosts via horizontal gene transfer and subsequent growth sulfhydryl variable shv extended spectrum β lactamases bla shv was present in rwtp a at 107 ml 1 in the dna 105 ml 1 in the rna and 104 ml 1 in post incubation rna so although a significant proportion of the associated host cells were metabolically active in freshly disinfected recycled water there was no proliferation during 7 day ambient incubation by contrast bla shv was below detection in both the recycled water dna and rna from rwtps b and c but present post incubation at 104 copies ml 1 in rwtp a recycled water an increasing number of tem and shv derivatives have been found which have reduced affinity for β lactamase inhibitors adler et al 2020 with few exceptions tem and shv type enzymes which are less susceptible to the effects of β lactamase inhibitors have negligible hydrolytic activity against the extended spectrum cephalosporins and are not considered esbls it was not possible here to evaluate the prevalence of esbl and non esbl types and further investigations should explore the proportion of esbl and non esbl types in wastewater and recycled water metallo β lactamases such as bla ndm bla vim and bla imp are among the most disseminated carbapenemases worldwide cornaglia et al 2011 although human surveillance indicates that bla imp type carbapenemase are now endemic in east coast australia in multiple species of enterobacterales there is no evidence that other carbapenemases have become established in australia acsqhc 2019 bell et al 2018a b 2019 bla imp bla ndm bla oxa 48 like bla vim bla imi and bla sme were not detected by in any water samples but bla ges was present at low abundance dna 101 102 copies ml 1 in all three recycled waters moreover the rna and dna results from all three rwtps suggest that active post disinfection replication occurred fig 4 bla kpc was also present 103 104 copies ml 1 in the 7 day incubated samples from all three rwtps despite being bloq in dna and rna extracted from the three product waters for bla kpc the pattern of results indicates that bacteria carrying this gene were present at low abundance and then proliferated rather than being present in high abundance but inactive because both dna and rna were not detected initially before both increasing upon incubation 3 4 3 polymyxin resistance the most widely used polymyxin is colistin which now plays an essential role as the last line antibiotic for multi drug resistant enterobacterales infections clinically poirel et al 2017 in 2015 the discovery of mcr 1 liu et al 2016 a transmissible plasmid borne colistin resistance gene sparked widespread concern since then a further nine variants have been discovered although to date mcr 1 is the most widely reported gharaibeh and shatnawi 2019 and appears to have the widest host range its presence on plasmids that also carry genes encoding carbapenemases and esbls is of concern despite its use as a growth promoter in animal husbandry internationally ahmed et al 2019 colistin is not registered for use in livestock in australia but has previously been available for topical veterinary administration bean et al 2020 here mcr 1 was present in all recycled waters both pre and post incubation following a similar regrowth proliferation pattern to that observed for bla tem at each rwtp indicating the potential for environmental persistence proliferation in contrast mcr 3 was not detected in any wastewater influents or recycled waters tested this variant has previously been detected in isolates from animals and humans in asia europe and africa but has thus far been linked to fewer bacterial hosts than mcr 1 forde et al 2018 3 5 potential for post disinfection eops and args proliferation in recycled water results here figs 2 4 show that all assayed organisms and resistance elements were reduced by rwtp processing but differed both in the intensity of response and propensity to persist and replicate post disinfection it was not possible to assign resistance gene carriage to eops nevertheless eops such as p aeruginosa are known carriers of args such as bla tem bla ges bla kpc and mcr 1 which increased post disinfection p aeruginosa has significant genome plasticity and is a favorable plasmid host that rapidly evolves towards multi and even pan drug resistance wang et al 2006 post disinfection increases in arg abundance may also be driven by other less direct relationships for example persister cells may also acquire new args through horizontal gene transfer e g through the uptake of free dna from lysed bacterial cells post disinfection similar research elsewhere has highlighted the potential for post disinfection selective enrichment of persistent species with enhanced elevated arg carriage shi et al 2013 sousa et al 2017 dissolved organics provide nutrients that support post disinfection bacterial regrowth and arg proliferation but their presence varies as a function of water source and treatment regime jjemba et al 2010 to date research on bacterial colonization and regrowth in water distribution systems has focused on a narrow range of organisms in potable water and has until recently overlooked the risks of arg proliferation results here support previous findings that standard treatment and disinfection barriers such as uv treatment or chlorination are more effective at inactivating removing bacteria than they are at removing args mckinney and pruden 2012 yuan et al 2015 more work is needed to understand the persistence and growth of arb gs in recycled water networks under relevant environmental conditions disinfection residual temperature nutrient levels etc and how to appropriately risk manage this in the context of a varied local water storage practices farm dams covered tanks aquifer storage b on farm blending of source waters mixing recycled potable aquifer surface waters and c varying on farm practices for water quality management 3 6 microbial growth strategy implications on post disinfection water quality metabolic strategy flexibility and niche specialization affect the propensity for microbes to survive colonize and proliferate in recycled water systems eop and arg abundance in both the total dna and rna extracts shed new insights into their disinfection post disinfection dynamics for example bacteria such as a baumannii and e coli that were sensitive to disinfection and ambient regrowth incubation conditions either remained static or significantly decreased in abundance across the three recycled waters even in the absence of a chlorine residual sensitive species such as a butzleri decreased below detection and displayed no propensity for regrowth by contrast more resilient species such as s enteritidis spector and kenyon 2012 that were significantly diminished by water treatment rebounded rapidly upon post disinfection incubation other species whose populations grew significantly during incubation i e increase in dna based arg abundance included k pneumoniae rwtp b only legionella spp rwtp c only l monocytogenes and p aeruginosa consideration of the rna based results reveal differences in the underlying response for example l monocytogenes was consistently below detection in the recycled water rna but 105 copies ml 1 after 7 day incubation as the l monocytogenes dna results indicate active growth over the incubation period these combined results suggest disinfection induced dormancy occurred followed by resuscitation and replication upon incubation in the absence of a chlorine residual resilient bacteria such as p aeruginosa were notably less affected by rwtp disinfection these populations remained metabolically active evidenced by rna data and increased post disinfection several different mechanisms may underpin these observations of bacterial tolerance and persistence including i resistance to amoebic phagocytosis some bacteria can survive or even replicate in amoebic cysts where they are protected from disinfectants and unfavorable environmental conditions these amoebae such as acanthamoeba spp and vermamoeba spp effectively function as reservoirs and can act as trojan horses to penetrate chlorine disinfection barriers not all amoeba residing bacteria are able to multiply within protozoa but some can including legionella mycobacterium and pseudomonas spp and this enhances their dissemination and virulence thomas and ashbolt 2011 ii biofilm protection cell clusters from detached biofilms may be protected from disinfection resulting in enhanced disinfection tolerance when compared with planktonic cultures of the same species behnke et al 2011 iii disinfection process efficacy non ideal hydrodynamics in contact tanks due to suboptimal baffling can lead to insufficient chlorine contact time ammonia breakthrough from secondary treatment stages can also exert a chlorine demand and reduce disinfection efficacy via chloramine formation however this was unlikely to have played a role here as ammonia removal across all sites was near complete and all rwtps achieved product water free chlorine residuals there is ample evidence that a variety of eops can colonize and persist in water distribution systems and that these organisms have multi drug resistant strains fahrenfeld et al 2013 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 shi et al 2013 questions and challenges remain regarding the potential integration of molecular data into the existing culture based approach to recycled water regulation the resilience of genetic material to water treatment processes and persistence in final product waters gives rise to compressed lrvs based on molecular quantitation e g 2 3 log10 for e coli here table 2 relative to culture based assessments 6 8 log10 for e coli valid questions remain regarding what fraction of this discrepancy between lrvs is vbnc versus free dna and what this means for establishing molecular based lrv requirements for recycled water supply considerable work is also required to establish molecular based lrvs for rwtp processes e g reduction equivalent uv dose for arb gs and set agreed operating envelopes for critical control parameters in rwtp process performance monitoring based on molecular derived lrvs for individual process barriers e g as currently done for parameters like turbidity uv disinfection and free chlorine 4 conclusions here we focused on the class 1 integron integrase gene and a suite of specific eops and args of key relevance in healthcare and demonstrated that rwtps can significantly reduce their loads from urban communities to the environment and effectively functioning as critical control points to limit their dissemination and associated risk we deliberately focused on emerging amr risks causing resistance to last line antimicrobials carbapenems fluoroquinolones and colistin to provide baseline data for important emerging args in recycled water our research also showed that subpopulations of mobile genetic elements eops and args survive disinfection and may become active members of the recycled water and distribution system microbiomes these findings suggest that water recycling guidelines should take into consideration pathogens and commensals potential survival regrowth and horizontal gene transfer in mixed use recycled water supplies for horticulture animal industries and urban recreational purposes to better understand health risks related to the presence of priority eops args and mobile genetic elements in recycled waters more investigations like ours are needed before water quality guidance or guideline limits can be established once these are established engineered treatment

16882,with two thirds of the global population living in areas affected by water scarcity wastewater reuse is actively being implemented or explored by many nations there is a need to better understand the efficacy of recycled water treatment plants rwtps for removal of human opportunistic pathogens and antimicrobial resistant microorganisms here we used a suite of probe based multiplex and sybr green real time pcr assays to monitor enteric opportunistic pathogens eops acinetobacter baumannii arcobacter butzlieri escherichia coli enterococcus faecalis klebsiella pneumoniae legionella spp listeria monocytogenes pseudomonas aeruginosa salmonella enteritidis streptococcus spp and antimicrobial resistance genes args qnrs bla shv bla tem bla ge s bla kpc bla imi bla sme bla ndm bla vim bla imp bla oxa 48 like mcr 1 and mcr 3 of key concern from an antimicrobial resistance amr waterborne and foodborne disease perspective the class 1 integron integrase gene intl1 was quantified as a proxy for multi drug resistance eops intl1 and args absolute abundance dna and rna and metabolic activity rna was assessed through three rwtps with differing treatment trains our results indicate that rwtps produced high quality recycled water for non potable reuse by removing 95 of eops and args however subpopulations of eops and args survived disinfection and demonstrated potential to become actively growing members of the recycled water and distribution system microbiomes the persistence of functional intl1 suggests that significant genetic recombination capacity remains in the recycled water along with the likely presence of multi drug resistant bacteria results provide new insights into the persistence and growth of eops and prevalence and removal of args in recycled water systems these data will contribute towards the emerging evidence base of amr risks in recycled water to inform quantitative risk based policy development regarding water recycling schemes graphical abstract

recycling is an increasingly important climate independent water source for many nations with appropriate treatment monitoring and management water recycling provides safe stable and sustainable water resources for a variety of end uses to deliver these benefits to customers and meet duty of care obligations regarding public health water managers and regulators must proactively identify and assess risks regarding contaminants of emerging concern enteric opportunistic pathogens eops are those microbes that are normally non pathogenic or commensal but can become pathogenic in immunocompromised hosts eops and antimicrobial resistant genes args are an emerging potential concern for the industry and regulators alike in the delivery of wastewater treatment and water recycling services singer et al 2016 wuijts et al 2017 research has shown that an array of eops and args is consistently present in municipal wastewater and treated effluents christou et al 2017 prompting reference to wastewater treatment plants wwtps as antimicrobial resistance amr hotspots guo et al 2017 michael et al 2013 it is also hypothesised that wwtps may be important in amr selection and transfer because wastewater microbes are exposed to antibiotic residues and other pollutants e g metals biocides organics as well as an array of physical oxidative treatment processes e g chlorine ozone ultraviolet radiation all of which can potentially stimulate eops and args selection propagation and horizontal gene transfer berendonk et al 2015 guo et al 2015 shi et al 2013 considerable uncertainties remain regarding the fate of drug resistant microorganisms both pathogens and commensals during wastewater treatment and in downstream environments wwtps and their disinfection treatments play an important role as critical barriers to mitigate environmental amr transfer guo et al 2017 singer et al 2016 yet relatively little is known about eops and args diversity abundance and survival in highly treated recycled waters treatment processes such as conventional activated sludge membrane ultrafiltration uv treatment and chlorination range in eops and args removal efficacy from highly effective to minimal or even negative effects guo et al 2015 shi et al 2013 zhang et al 2015a zheng et al 2017 while eops and args have been detected in non potable recycled water distribution systems fahrenfeld et al 2013 garner et al 2018 contrasting impacts of recycled water on amr in receiving environments have been reported from no effect to significant resistome enrichment fahrenfeld et al 2013 mclain and williams 2014 negreanu et al 2012 furthermore the comparability of such studies is limited due to the lack of available standard methods and other complicating factors such as local differences in wastewater eops and args burden and treatment intensity and variations in native microbiomes and resistomes in receiving environments greater understanding of the microbial ecology and downstream fate of eops and args in wastewater effluents and recycled waters is needed to underpin robust risk assessment and protect end users and the environment singer et al 2016 alongside resistance gene dynamics another aspect requiring additional study is the potential for microbial regrowth in treated product water of eops that may acquire resistance as a result of treatment induced processes sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 shi et al 2013 and pose a health risk to end users regrowth in water distribution systems is a complex but common phenomenon fahrenfeld et al 2013 widely documented in treated potable water distribution systems garner et al 2019 wang et al 2012 xi et al 2009 as well as recycled water systems garner et al 2018 garner et al 2019 jjemba et al 2010 regrowth can potentially degrade downstream point of use water quality posing important water quality and public health risks prest et al 2016 regrowth prevention management is a key component of many jurisdictional drinking water quality guidelines particularly in warmer regions and is commonly achieved by maintaining minimum chemical disinfection residuals e g chlorine or chloramine in water distribution networks this study sought to understand the abundance activity and regrowth potential of priority eops and priority args in three full scale recycled water treatment plants rwtps with differing treatment trains but all producing high quality recycled water for non potable reuse fig 1 high specificity real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays were used to investigate the abundance dna and rna and metabolic activity rna of eops acinetobacter baumannii arcobacter butzlieri escherichia coli enterococcus faecalis klebsiella pneumoniae legionella spp listeria monocytogenes pseudomonas aeruginosa salmonella enteritidis and streptococcus spp of concern from an amr and or waterborne foodborne disease perspective truchado et al 2020 a selection of priority args conferring transferable resistance to

and mcr 3 the class 1 integron integrase gene intl1 was also quantified as a proxy for antibiotic and multi drug resistance horizontal gene transfer potential quantifying args that pose a health risk against the complex background of environmental args is an ongoing challenge garner et al 2019 to link this study directly to local epidemiological data arg qpcr assays were designed to mirror the pcr assays currently used for australia wide human surveillance for nosocomial and community acquired antimicrobial resistant infections acsqhc 2019 overall these analyses provided quantitative information on intl1 eops and args total abundance and metabolic activity in recycled waters following a range of water recycling treatment processes and their post production regrowth potential 2 materials and methods 2 1 recycled water treatment plants and sample collection samples were collected from three australian rwtps hereafter rwtps a b and c rwtp characteristics influent volume and

graphpad software inc 3 results and discussion 3 1 eops occurrence and detection in influent wastewater and recycled water mitigating the risk of waterborne disease is a high priority in recycled waters used for agriculture recycled water quality varied with rwtp b slightly outperforming rwtps a and c overall but no single treatment plant consistently ranked best across all eops all targeted eops were present in the influent wastewater to all three rwtps at 104 gene copies ml 1 dna fig 2 a significant decreases in all targeted eops were consistently achieved at all three rwtps fig 2a total bacterial removal efficiency across the three rwtps based on 16s rrna qpcr fig s1 ranged from 1 3 to 2 9 dna log10 reduction values lrvs across all seasons while species specific dna lrvs ranged from 2 1 to 5 all dna and rna based lrvs are presented in table 2 lrvs calculated using rna gene copy numbers showed greater variability of lrvs between different rwtps and eops than lrvs calculated using dna derived data overall rwtp b p 0 05 outperformed rwtps a and c with respect to eop inactivation rna lrvs but based on dna the majority of eop lrvs did not differ significantly p 0 086 across the three rwtps despite the varying treatment trains which included multiple chlorination stages plus uv irradiation for rwtp b 3 2 proliferation potential of eops in recycled water recycled water networks in australia can include long distribution pipelines and large storage basins therefore the potential for microbial regrowth in final product water exists laurenson et al 2010 eops regrowth comes from viable but non culturable vbnc eops is well established that several eops such e coli enterococcus spp listeria spp and salmonella spp can enter into a viable but non culturable vbnc state during the wastewater treatment and disinfection processes liu et al 2018 vbnc eops do not grow in conventional bacteriological media but are still alive and have low levels of metabolic activity more importantly vbnc eops may restart active growth when optimal conditions are restored wagley et al 2021 this suggests that vbnc eops in treated effluents can enter reclaimed water distribution systems and may serve as seeds for regrowth which pose potential health risks when reclaimed water is used lin et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to monitor not only culturable but also vbnc bacteria in treated effluents and at the point of use for reclaimed water guo et al 2019 to assess this the abundance and regrowth potential of eops in the recycled waters of each rwtp n 9 for each rwtp summer season only was measured using total dna and rna extracts from the treated water and following 7 day regrowth incubation together these dna and rna based qpcr results provide complementary insights distinguishing organisms that remain metabolically active rna based from those that are inactivated dna based by disinfection wang et al 2020 fig 3 shows that the patterns of response in terms of inactivation persistence and reactivation regrowth varied between bacteria but the patterns were consistent between rwtps a baumannii rna lrv 2 1 2 8 e coli populations rna lrv 1 9 3 4 and streptococcus spp rna lrv 1 6 2 1 remained metabolically active post disinfection but did not show further reactivation regrowth during the 7 day incubation period this may be indicative of cell death and or amoebic phagocytosis and or survival without active growth niller et al 2017 on the contrary a butzleri rna lrv 4 was detected only by dna analysis and did not show any indication of regrowth under ambient nutrient conditions table 1 these results were consistent across the three treatment plants indicating that this organism is more susceptible to inactivation stressors at the rwtps species that regrew significantly during incubation included k pneumoniae legionella spp l monocytogenes and p aeruginosa interestingly k pneumoniae rna lrv 1 8 4 7 remained metabolically active following disinfection at all three rwtps but the dna vs rna response patterns varied comparatively rwtp b achieved better overall removal based on dna results but rna copy numbers were significantly greater post regrowth and were the highest across all three plants given that the dna gene copy abundance did not change post incubation it suggests that there was metabolic resuscitation of existing cells rather than proliferation by contrast the k pneumoniae results from rwtps a and c do not show any obvious signs of post disinfection reactivation regrowth these findings on k pneumoniae might reflect differences in the treatment trains and resulting microbial community structure e g uv treatment at rwtp b open lagoons at rwtp c and subsequent sos response aminov 2011 and or competitive interactions in the different recycled waters legionella spp rna lrv 1 1 2 8 also responded differently across the three rwtps with copy numbers consistently lower at rwtp b compared to plants a and c the combined results indicate post disinfection regrowth in water from rwtp c and possibly also in a but not for rwtp b it is possible that the process configuration at rwtp c which included stabilization lagoons fig 1 provided conditions that fostered the growth of amoebae and protozoan communities specialized in hosting legionella spp and protecting from chlorine exposure jjemba et al 2010 kilvington and price 1990 inactivation and removal of legionella spp was notably better at rwtp b which could be a result of the membrane ultrafiltration 0 04 µm step effectively removing the natural hosts amoebae protozoa for this genus as well as the dual stage chlorination at rwtp b final recycled water chlorine dose and chlorine residuals were otherwise comparable across the three rwtps table 1 p aeruginosa rna lrv 2 1 3 remained metabolically active and was amongst the most resilient eops surviving disinfection and showing evidence of post disinfection regrowth post disinfection proliferation of pseudomonas spp has previously been observed shi et al 2013 and its genomic plasticity and propensity for amr carriage makes this finding of significance in the current context becerra castro et al 2016 l monocytogenes rna lrv 3 8 5 responded similarly across all three plants both dna and rna results clearly indicated replication and regrowth despite initial recycled water rna copies being consistently below detection suggesting initial disinfection induced dormancy or metabolic inactivation s enteritidis rna lrv 3 7 4 7 was particularly sensitive to rwtp treatment stressors but an active persister cell population clearly survived in all cases allowing rapid replication and regrowth during the 7 day incubation both l monocytogenes and s enteritidis are implicated in produce related foodborne outbreaks liu et al 2018 hence the effective inactivation of s enteritidis and l monocytogenes in these rwtps is a positive finding however their evident potential for regrowth and known capacity to be internalized in plants as bacterial endophytes kljujev et al 2018 highlight the need for proactive on farm water quality management to ensure risks are effectively controlled this is important from the perspective of understanding eops exposure potential for recycled water uses with direct contact e g turf irrigation or aerosolization potential e g dust suppression on building sites and for limiting food chain exposure risks for minimally processed produce e faecalis rna lrv 1 9 3 1 dna analysis showed no significant change in abundance during the regrowth incubation while rna analysis showed that metabolically active cells were present in the recycled water at the point of production but not after 7 days incubation as dna gene abundance was stable this may indicate a shift to persister cell vbnc phenotype kim et al 2018 a known strategy used by e faecalis under unfavorable environmental conditions oliver 2010 3 3 args occurrence and detection in influent wastewater and recycled water the majority of args quantified in this study were selected for their high priority in australian human amr surveillance and their global importance as major emerging threats currently some are infrequently detected in australian clinical isolates but recognised as emerging risks bla ndm bla oxa 48 like bla vim bla imi bla sme and bla kpc acsqhc 2019 the majority of the targeted genes were not detected by qpcr in the wastewater influents to the three sites indicating they are rare absent in the south australian communities surveyed results that concur with the relevant human surveillance data acsqhc 2019 turnidge and meleady 2018 specifically bla ndm bla oxa 48 like bla vim bla imi and bla sme were not detected in either the influent wastewater or treated recycled water at any of these rwtps however several other carbapenem resistance genes were repeatedly detected including bla tem bla ges and bla kpc the bla shv gene was present in the influents to all three sites but significantly more prevalent in the influent to rwtp a bla shv decreased in response to all three treatment trains and was bloq in the final recycled water from both rwtps b and c across all three rwtps the average log reduction of detected args following treatment varied from 2 2 lrv for mcr 1 to 5 lrv for bla kpc dna based and from 2 lrv for bla tem to 5 lrv for bla kpc rna based the varying arg removal efficiencies reflect the complex effects of water treatment processes on bacterial communities table 2 table 1 qnrs was the most abundant arg across all three rwtps with up to 1 7 1010 copies ml 1 influent rwtp a dna and average lrv of 1 2 qnrs was included for comparative purposes as it has been used and recommended for inter national environmental amr benchmarking berendonk et al 2015 rocha et al 2020 the mcr 1 gene was consistently detected across all three plants 2 7 102 1 3 106 copies ml 1 influent while mcr 3 and bla imi bla sme bla ndm bla vim bla imp and bla oxa 48 like were consistently below the detection limit the intl1 gene relates to the presence of class 1 integrons important genes that are often carried on mobile genetic elements and used as indicators for multi drug resistance gillings et al 2015 copy numbers in raw influents ranged between 8 2 105 and 2 108 copies ml 1 intl1 copies were reduced by 2 8 to 3 2 rna lrvs and 1 2 to 2 2 dna lrvs across the three rwtps this is better than or similar to removal rates reported for wwtps rwtps internationally as are the significant reductions in 16s rrna copies across all three treatment plants garner et al 2018 laht et al 2014 mao et al 2015 the persistence of intl1 detected in both dna and rna suggests that significant genetic recombination capacity remains in the treated effluents along with the presence of multi drug resistant persister cells fig 4 despite the reductions in gene load some clinically relevant args remained present and actively expressed in these effluents fig 4 given the complexity of recycled water quality storage and use internationally open closed storage managed aquifer recharge source mixing and product water blending etc the global significance of these findings is not easily ascertained and research is needed to understand arg fate in water recycling schemes and the potential need for and benefit of advanced treatment solutions for amr risk mitigation these results suggest that adding additional disinfection steps using conventional processes such as chlorination dose approx 10 mg l table 1 and uv treatment may be of limited benefit for further reducing arg copies in treated effluents figs 1 4 3 4 proliferation potential of args in recycled water while gene abundance varied between rwtps and args the pattern of arg proliferation following 7 day incubation was consistent across all three rwtps fig 4 results suggest that rwtps b and c produced higher quality recycled water than rwtp a eop observations in fig 3 for example qnrs was the only arg detected at 103 copies ml 1 dna in recycled water from rwtps b and c whereas water produced at rwtp a contained qnrs bla tem bla shv and mcr 1 at 103 copies ml 1 further bla shv was bloq in recycled water from rwtps b and c but 106 copies ml 1 in water produced at rwtp a although bla ges was also quantifiable in the dna extracted from all three recycled water sources bla imi bla sme bla ndm bla vim bla imp bla oxa 48 like and mcr 3 were never detected in any rwtp sample 3 4 1 quinolone resistance quinolone compounds are persistent environmental contaminants gutierrez et al 2017 and resistance rates from community derived infections have increased in recent years acsqhc 2019 mobile quinolone args have been found in clinical and environmental isolates worldwide hooper and jacoby 2015 robicsek et al 2006 in this study qnrs was detected in the influents and effluents of all three rwtps results showed that qnrs abundance decreased with post disinfection incubation suggesting that organisms carrying qnrs underwent die off and or predation inactivation during the 7 day incubation given the limited incubation scenario tested here no added nutrients it is uncertain if this would also occur in recycled waters used for irrigation and food production as on farm source water mixing may occur we note that qnrs was the only arg analyzed that showed this trend garner et al 2018 reported that qnra related to qnrs was the only one of four args quantified incl qnra bla tem vana and sul1 to be significantly removed following water treatment but only in one of four treatment plants examined 3 4 2 β lactamase resistance our results suggest that genes conferring resistance to various classes of β lactams were consistently detected in wwtp influents fig 2 most antimicrobials administered to humans worldwide are β lactams and the resistance types of greatest concern include extended spectrum β lactamases esbls which confer resistance to third generation cephalosporins and the carbapenemases which confer resistance to carbapenems and almost all other β lactams acsqhc 2019 in clinical settings carbapenemase producing enterobacterales are almost always highly multi drug resistant and resulting infections require last line agents such as colistin that can be cytotoxic acsqhc 2019 notably the pattern of abundance both in influents and recycled waters reflects the chronological order in which these genes have become clinically relevant and that in turn reflects the order in which these different classes of antimicrobials were therapeutically introduced jacoby 2006 liakopoulos et al 2016 nordmann et al 2012 temoneira tem extended spectrum β lactamases bla tem is the most encountered β lactamase gene in gram negative bacteria and bla tem 1 was the first β lactamase gene described in gram negatives smet et al 2010 here it was quantifiable in the dna and rna extracts of all three recycled waters signifying that a substantial proportion was carried in metabolically active cells bla tem abundance increased following incubation in all cases fig 4 indicating post disinfection regrowth of host cells carrying bla tem or uptake into new microbial hosts via horizontal gene transfer and subsequent growth sulfhydryl variable shv extended spectrum β lactamases bla shv was present in rwtp a at 107 ml 1 in the dna 105 ml 1 in the rna and 104 ml 1 in post incubation rna so although a significant proportion of the associated host cells were metabolically active in freshly disinfected recycled water there was no proliferation during 7 day ambient incubation by contrast bla shv was below detection in both the recycled water dna and rna from rwtps b and c but present post incubation at 104 copies ml 1 in rwtp a recycled water an increasing number of tem and shv derivatives have been found which have reduced affinity for β lactamase inhibitors adler et al 2020 with few exceptions tem and shv type enzymes which are less susceptible to the effects of β lactamase inhibitors have negligible hydrolytic activity against the extended spectrum cephalosporins and are not considered esbls it was not possible here to evaluate the prevalence of esbl and non esbl types and further investigations should explore the proportion of esbl and non esbl types in wastewater and recycled water metallo β lactamases such as bla ndm bla vim and bla imp are among the most disseminated carbapenemases worldwide cornaglia et al 2011 although human surveillance indicates that bla imp type carbapenemase are now endemic in east coast australia in multiple species of enterobacterales there is no evidence that other carbapenemases have become established in australia acsqhc 2019 bell et al 2018a b 2019 bla imp bla ndm bla oxa 48 like bla vim bla imi and bla sme were not detected by in any water samples but bla ges was present at low abundance dna 101 102 copies ml 1 in all three recycled waters moreover the rna and dna results from all three rwtps suggest that active post disinfection replication occurred fig 4 bla kpc was also present 103 104 copies ml 1 in the 7 day incubated samples from all three rwtps despite being bloq in dna and rna extracted from the three product waters for bla kpc the pattern of results indicates that bacteria carrying this gene were present at low abundance and then proliferated rather than being present in high abundance but inactive because both dna and rna were not detected initially before both increasing upon incubation 3 4 3 polymyxin resistance the most widely used polymyxin is colistin which now plays an essential role as the last line antibiotic for multi drug resistant enterobacterales infections clinically poirel et al 2017 in 2015 the discovery of mcr 1 liu et al 2016 a transmissible plasmid borne colistin resistance gene sparked widespread concern since then a further nine variants have been discovered although to date mcr 1 is the most widely reported gharaibeh and shatnawi 2019 and appears to have the widest host range its presence on plasmids that also carry genes encoding carbapenemases and esbls is of concern despite its use as a growth promoter in animal husbandry internationally ahmed et al 2019 colistin is not registered for use in livestock in australia but has previously been available for topical veterinary administration bean et al 2020 here mcr 1 was present in all recycled waters both pre and post incubation following a similar regrowth proliferation pattern to that observed for bla tem at each rwtp indicating the potential for environmental persistence proliferation in contrast mcr 3 was not detected in any wastewater influents or recycled waters tested this variant has previously been detected in isolates from animals and humans in asia europe and africa but has thus far been linked to fewer bacterial hosts than mcr 1 forde et al 2018 3 5 potential for post disinfection eops and args proliferation in recycled water results here figs 2 4 show that all assayed organisms and resistance elements were reduced by rwtp processing but differed both in the intensity of response and propensity to persist and replicate post disinfection it was not possible to assign resistance gene carriage to eops nevertheless eops such as p aeruginosa are known carriers of args such as bla tem bla ges bla kpc and mcr 1 which increased post disinfection p aeruginosa has significant genome plasticity and is a favorable plasmid host that rapidly evolves towards multi and even pan drug resistance wang et al 2006 post disinfection increases in arg abundance may also be driven by other less direct relationships for example persister cells may also acquire new args through horizontal gene transfer e g through the uptake of free dna from lysed bacterial cells post disinfection similar research elsewhere has highlighted the potential for post disinfection selective enrichment of persistent species with enhanced elevated arg carriage shi et al 2013 sousa et al 2017 dissolved organics provide nutrients that support post disinfection bacterial regrowth and arg proliferation but their presence varies as a function of water source and treatment regime jjemba et al 2010 to date research on bacterial colonization and regrowth in water distribution systems has focused on a narrow range of organisms in potable water and has until recently overlooked the risks of arg proliferation results here support previous findings that standard treatment and disinfection barriers such as uv treatment or chlorination are more effective at inactivating removing bacteria than they are at removing args mckinney and pruden 2012 yuan et al 2015 more work is needed to understand the persistence and growth of arb gs in recycled water networks under relevant environmental conditions disinfection residual temperature nutrient levels etc and how to appropriately risk manage this in the context of a varied local water storage practices farm dams covered tanks aquifer storage b on farm blending of source waters mixing recycled potable aquifer surface waters and c varying on farm practices for water quality management 3 6 microbial growth strategy implications on post disinfection water quality metabolic strategy flexibility and niche specialization affect the propensity for microbes to survive colonize and proliferate in recycled water systems eop and arg abundance in both the total dna and rna extracts shed new insights into their disinfection post disinfection dynamics for example bacteria such as a baumannii and e coli that were sensitive to disinfection and ambient regrowth incubation conditions either remained static or significantly decreased in abundance across the three recycled waters even in the absence of a chlorine residual sensitive species such as a butzleri decreased below detection and displayed no propensity for regrowth by contrast more resilient species such as s enteritidis spector and kenyon 2012 that were significantly diminished by water treatment rebounded rapidly upon post disinfection incubation other species whose populations grew significantly during incubation i e increase in dna based arg abundance included k pneumoniae rwtp b only legionella spp rwtp c only l monocytogenes and p aeruginosa consideration of the rna based results reveal differences in the underlying response for example l monocytogenes was consistently below detection in the recycled water rna but 105 copies ml 1 after 7 day incubation as the l monocytogenes dna results indicate active growth over the incubation period these combined results suggest disinfection induced dormancy occurred followed by resuscitation and replication upon incubation in the absence of a chlorine residual resilient bacteria such as p aeruginosa were notably less affected by rwtp disinfection these populations remained metabolically active evidenced by rna data and increased post disinfection several different mechanisms may underpin these observations of bacterial tolerance and persistence including i resistance to amoebic phagocytosis some bacteria can survive or even replicate in amoebic cysts where they are protected from disinfectants and unfavorable environmental conditions these amoebae such as acanthamoeba spp and vermamoeba spp effectively function as reservoirs and can act as trojan horses to penetrate chlorine disinfection barriers not all amoeba residing bacteria are able to multiply within protozoa but some can including legionella mycobacterium and pseudomonas spp and this enhances their dissemination and virulence thomas and ashbolt 2011 ii biofilm protection cell clusters from detached biofilms may be protected from disinfection resulting in enhanced disinfection tolerance when compared with planktonic cultures of the same species behnke et al 2011 iii disinfection process efficacy non ideal hydrodynamics in contact tanks due to suboptimal baffling can lead to insufficient chlorine contact time ammonia breakthrough from secondary treatment stages can also exert a chlorine demand and reduce disinfection efficacy via chloramine formation however this was unlikely to have played a role here as ammonia removal across all sites was near complete and all rwtps achieved product water free chlorine residuals there is ample evidence that a variety of eops can colonize and persist in water distribution systems and that these organisms have multi drug resistant strains fahrenfeld et al 2013 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 shi et al 2013 questions and challenges remain regarding the potential integration of molecular data into the existing culture based approach to recycled water regulation the resilience of genetic material to water treatment processes and persistence in final product waters gives rise to compressed lrvs based on molecular quantitation e g 2 3 log10 for e coli here table 2 relative to culture based assessments 6 8 log10 for e coli valid questions remain regarding what fraction of this discrepancy between lrvs is vbnc versus free dna and what this means for establishing molecular based lrv requirements for recycled water supply considerable work is also required to establish molecular based lrvs for rwtp processes e g reduction equivalent uv dose for arb gs and set agreed operating envelopes for critical control parameters in rwtp process performance monitoring based on molecular derived lrvs for individual process barriers e g as currently done for parameters like turbidity uv disinfection and free chlorine 4 conclusions here we focused on the class 1 integron integrase gene and a suite of specific eops and args of key relevance in healthcare and demonstrated that rwtps can significantly reduce their loads from urban communities to the environment and effectively functioning as critical control points to limit their dissemination and associated risk we deliberately focused on emerging amr risks causing resistance to last line antimicrobials carbapenems fluoroquinolones and colistin to provide baseline data for important emerging args in recycled water our research also showed that subpopulations of mobile genetic elements eops and args survive disinfection and may become active members of the recycled water and distribution system microbiomes these findings suggest that water recycling guidelines should take into consideration pathogens and commensals potential survival regrowth and horizontal gene transfer in mixed use recycled water supplies for horticulture animal industries and urban recreational purposes to better understand health risks related to the presence of priority eops args and mobile genetic elements in recycled waters more investigations like ours are needed before water quality guidance or guideline limits can be established once these are established engineered treatment

16883,dissolved organic matter dom chemistry in rivers regulates aquatic food web dynamics water quality and carbon storage the operation of reservoirs represents one of the major human modifications on the natural flow of rivers which can affect dom chemistry although hydrologic heterogeneity has been observed in different segments of the reservoir whether it will structure dom chemistry is poorly assessed which is critical to better constrain the carbon cycle in reservoirs by the combination of a series of techniques including stable carbon isotopes optical spectroscopy and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry here we showed that hydrologic heterogeneity induced changes in dom molecular composition between two large tributaries named shennongxi sr and xiangxi xr rivers of the three gorges reservoir tgr with water intrusion from mainstream sr had relatively higher terrestrial and more recalcitrant dom than xr where no water intrusion from the mainstream was observed in contrast the averaged relative abundance of autochthonous input and biological lability of dom along upstream to downstream transect were higher in xr than that in sr the presence or absence of water intrusion from mainstream to tributaries induced by hydrologic management is likely the main factor controlling dom chemistry in different tributaries of the tgr by linking dom chemistry in the water column with that in surface sediments we suggest that hydrologic management of reservoir likely affects the preferential preservation of recalcitrant dom in surface sediments which further affects the organic carbon burial and the river carbon cycle with reservoir construction increasing worldwide further studies are encouraged to investigate the dom chemistry under different hydrologic management of reservoirs to better constrain and predict the carbon cycling in fluvial ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter ft icr ms three gorges reservoir hydrological heterogeneity organic carbon burial 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom as one of the largest reactive carbon reservoirs plays a central role in global carbon cycling nutrient export and food web dynamics stedmon et al 2003 evans et al 2017 therefore elucidating processes regulating the flux and transformation of dom is crucial to understand the carbon cycling mechanism in aquatic ecosystems cole et al 2007 battin et al 2008 lu et al 2013 since dom in fluvial systems such as rivers and reservoirs is often dominated by terrestrial input e g humic substances generated from the decomposed plant material or leaching from the soil the variation of hydrologic conditions in fluvial systems such as water level and flow which would influence the terrestrial input has been brought into focus in the investigation of the composition and fate of dom battin et al 2008 johnston et al 2020 as a special fluvial aquatic ecosystem which is regulated by an artificial hydrologic

dom composition at tgr these studies usually focused on a single tributary and indicated the relationship between dom chemistry with co2 emission through the analysis of surface water dom wang et al 2019 d he et al 2020 while the dom chemistry in water columns and its linkage with organic carbon oc burial another crucial part of carbon cycling still remains unclear tranvik et al 2009 previous studies have suggested that recalcitrant dom is involved in the sedimentary preservation of organic matter making a critical contribution to oc burial e g schmidt et al 2009 since terrestrial dom is usually more biologically recalcitrant than autochthonous dom it usually accounts for a dominant part of oc buried in sediments stallard 1998 jacinthe et al 2012 in addition recalcitrant dom compounds with carboxylic and hydroxylic groups allow for ligand exchange with metals on mineral surfaces kothawala et al 2012 riedel et al 2013 chassé et al 2015 resulting in a preference to be reserved in sediments kalbitz et al 2005 therefore the linkage between dom chemistry in water columns and hydrologic management needs further investigation to better constrain the carbon cycling especially in the

averaged relative abundances of unsaturated aliphatic compounds 6 2 0 6 and peptides 0 6 0 1 in xr table s8 3 5 principal component analysis of dom in sr and xr to further compare the difference of dom chemistry in sr and xr we performed a principal component analysis pca based on optical and molecular indices the loadings of the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 49 and

mostly related to autotrophic productivity related parameters e g bix h c and mlbl compared to pc1 pc2 was more driven by fi ai and mlbl the samples in sr were separated from samples in xr by pc1 and

both tributaries of the tgr the range of δ13c dom 28 5 to 27 5 and abundances of humic like components c1 and c3 identified by parafac analysis indicated the contribution of terrestrial inputs cawley et al 2012 table s5 polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds identified by ft icr ms usually related to vascular plant sourced organic matter and soil derived products of lignin degradation respectively were also detected seidel et al 2015 to assess the sources of dom comprehensively the association of optical techniques and ft icr ms was evaluated by spearman s rank correlation analysis wagner et al 2015 the terrestrial indicators of cdom e g suva254 and fdom such as c1 c3 and hix were significantly positive correlated r 0 5 p 0 01 with the terrestrial indicators in spe dom by ft icr ms such as polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds higher ai dbe m z and o c ratios but lower h c ratios fig s5 table s10 the averaged value of bix 0 75 0 11 an indicator of autotrophic productivity showed autochthonous input of dom in the tgr huguet et al 2009 previous studies suggested that protein like component c4 of fdom was associated with autochthonous production osburn et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the detection of peptides and unsaturated aliphatics in spe dom by ft icr ms suggested the contribution from bacterial and algal inputs kujawinski et al 2004 however no significant positive correlation was observed between c4 and peptides or unsaturated aliphatics table s10 this lack of correlation might be attributed to the molecular weight limitation of the analytical window of ft icr ms 800 da here for high molecular weight compounds associated with the c4 component coble et al 1990 compared with ft icr ms high pressure size exclusion chromatography could better determine the molecular weight of dom e g mcadams et al 2018 which would better constrain the cluster of dom that is associated with the c4 component the identification of the c2 component which was likely sourced from wastewater indicated the anthropogenic input of fdom wang et al 2019 in terms of spe dom a series of o3s and o5s compounds were detected table s8 the o3s compounds were likely associated with linear alkylbenzene sulfonates las which is a significant class of surfactants gonsior et al 2011 the o5s compounds were likely associated with sulfophenyl carboxylic acids spc which could be generated by the degradation of las under aerobic conditions ramón azcón et al 2006 both o3s and o5s classes of compounds have been detected in anthropogenically perturbated waters and could be an indicator of anthropogenic input he et al 2019 besides there was a significant correlation between the c2 component and o3s and o5s compounds further supporting a contribution of dom from anthropogenic input table s10 the average values of hix 0 71 0 09 and bix 0 75 0 11 were used to assess the humification degree and autotrophic productivity of dom suggesting mixed allochthonous and autochthonous input ohno 2002 huguet et al 2009 besides the average value of fi 1 73 0 13 used to identify the relative contribution of terrestrial and microbial sources to the dom which has a value of 1 9 for microbial input and a value of 1 4 for terrestrial input mcknight et al 2001 also demonstrated the mixed sources of dom therefore multiple sources of dom including terrestrial anthropogenic and autochthonous inputs were detected in both tributaries of the tgr cole et al 2007 wang et al 2019 4 2 hydrologic heterogeneity induced dom chemistry difference between sr and xr of the tgr a significant difference in the dom composition was observed between sr and xr bulk characteristics optical and molecular properties revealed that there were significantly higher p 0 01 relative proportions of terrestrial and anthropogenic dom but a significantly lower p 0 01 relative proportion of autochthonous dom in sr compared to xr figs 3 and s1 in parallel significantly higher averaged proportions of c1 c3 and c2 polyphenols highly unsaturated compounds but lower averaged proportions of c4 peptides unsaturated aliphatics were determined in sr compared to xr p 0 01 figs 3 and s1 meanwhile dom in sr showed significantly higher averaged suva254 hix dbe ai m z but lower averaged fi and bix values than those in xr p 0 01 figs 3 and s1 pca further revealed the optical and molecular property induced difference between sr and xr fig s5 these results indicated that dom in sr had higher aromaticity humification degree and molecular weight but a lower proportion of microbial or freshly produced dom than those in xr in terms of spatial variation of dom there were an increasing trend of δ13c and a decreasing trend of hix suva254 and ai from downstream to upstream in sr indicating the higher terrestrial signal downstream than that upstream of sr whereas no variations in xr indicating the overall homogeneity of dom in xr fig 4 no significant differences were observed for averaged isotopic optical and molecular parameters of dom between the surface and bottom water in sr and xr which demonstrated that the dom chemistry showed little vertical variations during the storage period although there is ca 50 km distance between sr and xr the environmental context including rainfall flux slope main soil type and dominant plant communities along the river bank which could control autochthonous production was similar between sr and xr table s1 min et al 2011 chen et al 2016 xu et al 2017 fan 2017 hu et al 2020 wang 2020 yang et al 2020 besides considering the smaller differences of averaged terrestrial indicator values e g humic like components c1 c3 suva254 hix ai between upstream sites e g sr06 vs xr07 than those of downstream sites e g sr01 vs xr01 of sr and xr fig 4 table s11 the difference in dom chemistry i e significantly higher relative abundances of terrestrial dom in sr than that in xr should not be mainly caused by autochthonous production in situ or terrestrial input from upstream instead we suggest the difference in dom chemistry could result mainly from the variation of reservoir management induced hydrologic conditions which were considered to be a key factor restructuring the chemical energy distribution in aquatic ecosystems cole et al 2007 battin et al 2008 c he et al 2020 two distinctly different water exchange models were previously established in sr and xr based on their different water structures fig 2 ji et al 2010 shi et al 2020 the water exchange model in xr was river like with the flow from its upstream to downstream as detailed in ji et al 2010 and our previous work d he et al 2020 in contrast the water exchange model in sr was established based on water intrusion from the mainstream to the tributary these two contrasting models were further supported by water chemistry investigation in this study e g spatial distributions of conservative anions and cations in surface and bottom water layers fig 2 table s3 integrated with the two contrasting water exchange models a conceptual model was proposed to account for the variations in dom chemistry between sr and xr tributaries fig 5 in sr the management of the tgr resulted in the up to middle layer intrusion current and drove mainstream water intruding into the tributary fig 2 because of the higher averaged humification and aromaticity of dom in the mainstream than those in the sr tributary table s12 this intrusion process will lead to the decreasing trend of terrestrial signal from downstream to upstream which was observed in sr fig 4 fig 5a in contrast no intrusion current was formed and water flowed from upstream to downstream in xr resulting in relatively homogenized dom chemistry with a less relative abundance of terrestrial input along the downstream to upstream transect for both surface and bottom water layers fig 4 fig 5b therefore the intrusion current from mainstream led to relatively more contribution of terrestrial dom to sr than to xr this enhancement of terrestrial dom due to hydrologic alteration e g water level flux was observed in various reservoirs as well mash et al 2004 hur et al 2007 meanwhile an increase of autochthonous dom input results from reservoir operation induced lentic water structure was also reported e g yi et al 2021 therefore more investigations were needed to better constrain the further linkage between reservoir hydrologic management induced variability in hydrodynamics and dom chemistry in multiple reservoirs 4 3 implications for organic carbon burial in reservoirs and further considerations considering that terrestrial dom usually has higher environmental stability i e more biologically recalcitrant and preference of absorption to particulate matter than autochthonous dom kim et al 2006 saidy et al 2013 the intrusion current from the mainstream might accelerate the flocculation aggregation and further deposition of terrestrial dom to sediments of sr lalonde et al 2012 shields et al 2016 this potential mechanism was preliminarily supported by the higher averaged relative abundance of terrestrial dom and molecular weight of dom in water columns and higher oc hix lower δ13c of organic matter in sediments from sr than those from xr p 0 01 figs 3 and s1 table s9 moreover the quality association of dom in water columns and oc in sediments was observed in sr and xr by the significant positive correlation p 0 01 between ai value of water dom and oc hix in the sediment samples fig s6a b and significant negative correlation p 0 01 between ai value of water dom and δ13c for the sediment samples fig s6c further suggesting the positive linkage between terrestrial recalcitrant dom and oc burial therefore more terrestrial and recalcitrant dom would devote to more oc burial in sr than that in xr the estimation of annual burial fluxes of oc in globally surveyed reservoirs demonstrated an increasing trend in world reservoirs especially in africa and asia maavara et al 2017 this increasing trend of oc burial is therefore partly associated with changes in dom quality which is further controlled by hydrologic management of the reservoir some limitations still exist firstly it should be emphasized that other less constrained factors also likely have a severe impact on oc burial in reservoirs through the reservation of particulate and sedimentary organic matter pom and som for instance sediments movement driven by hydrologic management microbial composition and algal blooms due to eutrophication of tributaries all affect the oc burial significantly e g maavara et al 2020 secondly although the relationship between hydrologic heterogeneity and dom chemistry difference among different tributaries is based on sampling event in the storage period during which maximum flocculation of dom and thus deposition and burial in sediments is expected further seasonal investigations are needed thirdly considering the averaged sediment rate in tributaries of the tgr 0 70 to 1 54 cm tong 2020 the dom in the top 2 cm layer of sediments might represent a whole year signal therefore although the dom samples of water columns and surface sediment were taken at the same time there must be variable time period deviations between dom in water columns and that in surface sediments from different sites and tributaries although these above specified limitations need further investigations to the best of our knowledge for the first time this study confirmed the linkage between the hydrologic heterogeneity and variation in dom chemistry among tributaries of the tgr in addition this study has complemented previous studies which barely linked dom chemistry with hydrologic heterogeneity in different segments of a reservoir moreover by analyzing dom in the water column and surface sediments we have also provided new insight into the carbon burial mechanism in the tgr in particular considering the interaction among dom pom and som he et al 2016 the hydrodynamics not only shape the dom chemistry in the water column but also affect oc burial in sediments further investigations of dom dynamics under different hydrologic management of the tgr and other reservoirs should be performed for a better understanding of the carbon cycling in the fluvial ecosystem considering the worldwide booming of reservoir constructions maavara et al 2017 4 conclusions we investigated the influence of hydrologic heterogeneity on dom chemistry between sr and xr tributaries of the tgr the dom chemistry was significantly different between sr and xr which was depicted by bulk optical and molecular techniques relatively more terrestrial dom with higher aromaticity and humification degree but less autochthonous dom in sr than those in xr were revealed by a variety of fluorescent components identified in eems and molecular groups detected by ft icr ms this significant variation in dom chemistry has mainly resulted from the hydrologic heterogeneity induced by reservoir management between sr and xr tributaries in particular water intrusion from the mainstream to sr tributary due to reservoir management introduced more terrestrial dom to sr than that in xr which also led to the spatial variation in dom quality in sr we further showed that the reservoir management induced variation in dom chemistry was imprinted in surface sediments and likely further contributed to the carbon burial in the tgr with the dam booming worldwide the linkage between hydrologic management and dom chemistry should be further investigated which would better improve our understanding of carbon cycling in fluvial ecosystems declaration of competing interest

16883,dissolved organic matter dom chemistry in rivers regulates aquatic food web dynamics water quality and carbon storage the operation of reservoirs represents one of the major human modifications on the natural flow of rivers which can affect dom chemistry although hydrologic heterogeneity has been observed in different segments of the reservoir whether it will structure dom chemistry is poorly assessed which is critical to better constrain the carbon cycle in reservoirs by the combination of a series of techniques including stable carbon isotopes optical spectroscopy and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry here we showed that hydrologic heterogeneity induced changes in dom molecular composition between two large tributaries named shennongxi sr and xiangxi xr rivers of the three gorges reservoir tgr with water intrusion from mainstream sr had relatively higher terrestrial and more recalcitrant dom than xr where no water intrusion from the mainstream was observed in contrast the averaged relative abundance of autochthonous input and biological lability of dom along upstream to downstream transect were higher in xr than that in sr the presence or absence of water intrusion from mainstream to tributaries induced by hydrologic management is likely the main factor controlling dom chemistry in different tributaries of the tgr by linking dom chemistry in the water column with that in surface sediments we suggest that hydrologic management of reservoir likely affects the preferential preservation of recalcitrant dom in surface sediments which further affects the organic carbon burial and the river carbon cycle with reservoir construction increasing worldwide further studies are encouraged to investigate the dom chemistry under different hydrologic management

capacity of 22 2 billion cubic meters with a water elevation of 175 m dai and liu 2013 three gorges dam tgd operation has significantly altered the hydrologic regime of the yangtze river from chongqing to yichang ca 660 km fig 1 the timing magnitude frequency duration and rate of flows water temperature water levels and sediment load have been profoundly altered resulting in the alteration of biogeochemical processes and some side effects such as the algal blooms xu et al 2009 zhao et al 2013 chen et al 2014 although some works have investigated constraints of hydrologic management on dom composition at tgr these studies usually focused on a single tributary and indicated the relationship between dom chemistry with co2 emission through the analysis of surface water dom wang et al 2019 d he et al 2020 while the dom chemistry in water columns and its linkage with organic carbon oc burial another crucial part of carbon cycling still remains unclear tranvik et al 2009 previous studies have suggested that recalcitrant dom is involved in the sedimentary preservation of organic matter making a critical contribution to oc burial e g schmidt et al 2009 since terrestrial dom is usually more biologically recalcitrant than autochthonous dom it usually accounts for a dominant part of oc buried in sediments stallard 1998 jacinthe et al 2012 in addition recalcitrant dom compounds with carboxylic and hydroxylic groups allow for ligand exchange with metals on mineral surfaces kothawala et al 2012 riedel et al 2013 chassé et al 2015 resulting in a preference to be reserved in sediments kalbitz et al 2005 therefore the linkage between dom chemistry in water columns and hydrologic management needs further investigation to better constrain the carbon cycling especially in the context of spatially hydrologic heterogeneity e g water structure temperature and flow which has been observed in different segments e g tributaries of the tgr ji et al 2010 yang et al 2018 shi et al 2020 the chemical complexity of dom has always been a demanding research topic e g hansell and carlson 2014 besides that unnatural fluctuation regimes in flows resulting from artificial management of

our study targets sr and xr have similar climate regimes geomorphology and river networks but under different hydrologic management influences mainly because of the variation in the structure of water temperature and distances to the dam ji et al 2010 shi et al 2020 we collected surface and bottom water samples and surface sediment samples to i characterize the property variation of dom in

averaged relative abundances of unsaturated aliphatic compounds 6 2 0 6 and peptides 0 6 0 1 in xr table s8 3 5 principal component analysis of dom in sr and xr to further compare the difference of dom chemistry in sr and xr we performed a principal component analysis pca based on optical and molecular indices the loadings of the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 49 and 29 of the variations of dom respectively fig s4 pc1 showed strongly positive loadings that were related to humification associated parameters e g ai dbe and hix whereas negative loadings of pc1 were mostly related to autotrophic productivity related parameters e g bix h c and mlbl compared to pc1 pc2 was more driven by fi ai and mlbl the samples in sr were separated from samples in xr by pc1 and pc2 3 6 chemical properties of dom and total organic carbon in surface sediments the hix values of dom in surface sediments of sr and xr ranged from 0 78 to 0 81 and 0 83 to 0 88 respectively with

1 11 to 1 13 in sr with significantly higher p 0 01 averaged toc observed in surface sediments of sr than that of xr table s9 4 discussion 4 1 sources of dom identified by complementary techniques in both tributaries of the tgr the range of δ13c dom 28 5 to 27 5 and abundances of humic like components c1 and c3 identified by parafac analysis indicated the contribution of terrestrial inputs cawley et al 2012 table s5 polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds identified by ft icr ms usually related to vascular plant sourced organic matter and soil derived products of lignin degradation respectively were also detected seidel et al 2015 to assess the sources of dom comprehensively the association of optical techniques and ft icr ms was evaluated by spearman s rank correlation analysis wagner et al 2015 the terrestrial indicators of cdom e g suva254 and fdom such as c1 c3 and hix were significantly positive correlated r 0 5 p 0 01 with the terrestrial indicators in spe dom by ft icr ms such as polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds higher ai dbe m z and o c ratios but lower h c ratios fig s5 table s10 the averaged value of bix 0 75 0 11 an indicator of autotrophic productivity showed autochthonous input of dom in the tgr huguet et al 2009 previous studies suggested that protein like component c4 of fdom was associated with autochthonous production osburn et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the detection of peptides and unsaturated aliphatics in spe dom by ft icr ms suggested the contribution from bacterial and algal inputs kujawinski et al 2004 however no significant positive correlation was observed between c4 and peptides or unsaturated aliphatics table s10 this lack of correlation might be attributed to the molecular weight limitation of the analytical window of ft icr ms 800 da here for high molecular weight compounds associated with the c4 component coble et al 1990 compared with ft icr ms high pressure size exclusion chromatography could better determine the molecular weight of dom e g mcadams et al 2018 which would better constrain the cluster of dom that is associated with the c4 component the identification of the c2 component which was likely sourced from wastewater indicated the anthropogenic input of fdom wang et al 2019 in terms of spe dom a series of o3s and o5s compounds were detected table s8 the o3s compounds were likely associated with linear alkylbenzene sulfonates las which is a significant class of surfactants gonsior et al 2011 the o5s compounds were likely associated with sulfophenyl carboxylic acids spc which could be generated by the degradation of las under aerobic conditions ramón azcón et al 2006 both o3s and o5s classes of compounds have been detected in anthropogenically perturbated waters and could be an indicator of anthropogenic input he et al 2019 besides there was a significant correlation between the c2 component and o3s and o5s compounds further supporting a contribution of dom from anthropogenic input table s10 the average values of hix 0 71 0 09 and bix 0 75 0 11 were used to assess the humification degree and autotrophic productivity of dom suggesting mixed allochthonous and autochthonous input ohno 2002 huguet et al 2009 besides the average value of fi 1 73 0 13 used to identify the relative contribution of terrestrial and microbial sources to the dom which has a value of 1 9 for microbial input and a value of 1 4 for terrestrial input mcknight et al 2001 also demonstrated the mixed sources of dom therefore multiple sources of dom including terrestrial anthropogenic and autochthonous inputs were detected in both tributaries of the tgr cole et al 2007 wang et al 2019 4 2 hydrologic heterogeneity induced dom chemistry difference between sr and xr of the tgr a significant difference in the dom composition was observed between sr and xr bulk characteristics optical and molecular properties revealed that there were significantly higher p 0 01 relative proportions of terrestrial and anthropogenic dom but a significantly lower p 0 01 relative proportion of autochthonous dom in sr compared to xr figs 3 and s1 in parallel significantly higher averaged proportions of c1 c3 and c2 polyphenols highly unsaturated compounds but lower averaged proportions of c4 peptides unsaturated aliphatics were determined in sr compared to xr p 0 01 figs 3 and s1 meanwhile dom in sr showed significantly higher averaged suva254 hix dbe ai m z but lower averaged fi and bix values than those in xr p 0 01 figs 3 and s1 pca further revealed the optical and molecular property induced difference between sr and xr fig s5 these results indicated that dom in sr had higher aromaticity humification degree and molecular weight but a lower proportion of microbial or freshly produced dom than those in xr in terms of spatial variation of dom there were an increasing trend of δ13c and a decreasing trend of hix suva254 and ai from downstream to upstream in sr indicating the higher terrestrial signal downstream than that upstream of sr whereas no variations in xr indicating the overall homogeneity of dom in xr fig 4 no significant differences were observed for averaged isotopic optical and molecular parameters of dom between the surface and bottom water in sr and xr which demonstrated that the dom chemistry showed little vertical variations during the storage period although there is ca 50 km distance between sr and xr the environmental context including rainfall flux slope main soil type and dominant plant communities along the river bank which could control autochthonous production was similar between sr and xr table s1 min et al 2011 chen et al 2016 xu et al 2017 fan 2017 hu et al 2020 wang 2020 yang et al 2020 besides considering the smaller differences of averaged terrestrial indicator values e g humic like components c1 c3 suva254 hix ai between upstream sites e g sr06 vs xr07 than those of downstream sites e g sr01 vs xr01 of sr and xr fig 4 table s11 the difference in dom chemistry i e significantly higher relative abundances of terrestrial dom in sr than that in xr should not be mainly caused by autochthonous production in situ or terrestrial input from upstream instead we suggest the difference in dom chemistry could result mainly from the variation of reservoir management induced hydrologic conditions which were considered to be a key factor restructuring the chemical energy distribution in aquatic ecosystems cole et al 2007 battin et al 2008 c he et al 2020 two distinctly different water exchange models were previously established in sr and xr based on their different water structures fig 2 ji et al 2010 shi et al 2020 the water exchange model in xr was river like with the flow from its upstream to downstream as detailed in ji et al 2010 and our previous work d he et al 2020 in contrast the water exchange model in sr was established based on water intrusion from the mainstream to the tributary these two contrasting models were further supported by water chemistry investigation in this study e g spatial distributions of conservative anions and cations in surface and bottom water layers fig 2 table s3 integrated with the two contrasting water exchange models a conceptual model was proposed to account for the variations in dom chemistry between sr and xr tributaries fig 5 in sr the management of the tgr resulted in the up to middle layer intrusion current and drove mainstream water intruding into the tributary fig 2 because of the higher averaged humification and aromaticity of dom in the mainstream than those in the sr tributary table s12 this intrusion process will lead to the decreasing trend of terrestrial signal from downstream to upstream which was observed in sr fig 4 fig 5a in contrast no intrusion current was formed and water flowed from upstream to downstream in xr resulting in relatively homogenized dom chemistry with a less relative abundance of terrestrial input along the downstream to upstream transect for both surface and bottom water layers fig 4 fig 5b therefore the intrusion current from mainstream led to relatively more contribution of terrestrial dom to sr than to xr this enhancement of terrestrial dom due to hydrologic alteration e g water level flux was observed in various reservoirs as well mash et al 2004 hur et al 2007 meanwhile an increase of autochthonous dom input results from reservoir operation induced lentic water structure was also reported e g yi et al 2021 therefore more investigations were needed to better constrain the further linkage between reservoir hydrologic management induced variability in hydrodynamics and dom chemistry in multiple reservoirs 4 3 implications for organic carbon burial in reservoirs and further considerations considering that terrestrial dom usually has higher environmental stability i e more biologically recalcitrant and preference of absorption to particulate matter than autochthonous dom kim et al 2006 saidy et al 2013 the intrusion current from the mainstream might accelerate the flocculation aggregation and further deposition of terrestrial dom to sediments of sr lalonde et al 2012 shields et al 2016 this potential mechanism was preliminarily supported by the higher averaged relative abundance of terrestrial dom and molecular weight of dom in water columns and higher oc hix lower δ13c of organic matter in sediments from sr than those from xr p 0 01 figs 3 and s1 table s9 moreover the quality association of dom in water columns and oc in sediments was observed in sr and xr by the significant positive correlation p 0 01 between ai value of water dom and oc hix in the sediment samples fig s6a b and significant negative correlation p 0 01 between ai value of water dom and δ13c for the sediment samples fig s6c further suggesting the positive linkage between terrestrial recalcitrant dom and oc burial therefore more terrestrial and recalcitrant dom would devote to more oc burial in sr than that in xr the estimation of annual burial fluxes of oc in globally surveyed reservoirs demonstrated an increasing trend in world reservoirs especially in africa and asia maavara et al 2017 this increasing trend of oc burial is therefore partly associated with changes in dom quality which is further controlled by hydrologic management of the reservoir some limitations still exist firstly it should be emphasized that other less constrained factors also likely have a severe impact on oc burial in reservoirs through the reservation of particulate and sedimentary organic matter pom and som for instance sediments movement driven by hydrologic management microbial composition and algal blooms due to eutrophication of tributaries all affect the oc burial significantly e g maavara et al 2020 secondly although the relationship between hydrologic heterogeneity and dom chemistry difference among different tributaries is based on sampling event in the storage period during which maximum flocculation of dom and thus deposition and burial in sediments is expected further seasonal investigations are needed thirdly considering the averaged sediment rate in tributaries of the tgr 0 70 to 1 54 cm tong 2020 the dom in the top 2 cm layer of sediments might represent a whole year signal therefore although the dom samples of water columns and surface sediment were taken at the same time there must be variable time period deviations between dom in water columns and that in surface sediments from different sites and tributaries although these above specified limitations need further investigations to the best of our knowledge for the first time this study confirmed the linkage between the hydrologic heterogeneity and variation in dom chemistry among tributaries of the tgr in addition this study has complemented previous studies which barely linked dom chemistry with hydrologic heterogeneity in different segments of a reservoir moreover by analyzing dom in the water column and surface sediments we have also provided new insight into the carbon burial mechanism in the tgr in particular considering the interaction among dom pom and som he et al 2016 the hydrodynamics not only shape the dom chemistry in the water column but also affect oc burial in sediments further investigations of dom dynamics under different hydrologic management of the tgr and other reservoirs should be performed for a better understanding of the carbon cycling in the fluvial ecosystem considering the worldwide booming of reservoir constructions maavara et al 2017 4 conclusions we investigated the influence of hydrologic heterogeneity on dom chemistry between sr and xr tributaries of the tgr the dom chemistry was significantly different between sr and xr which was depicted by bulk optical and molecular techniques relatively more terrestrial dom with higher aromaticity and humification degree but less autochthonous dom in sr than those in xr were revealed by a variety of fluorescent components identified in eems and molecular groups detected by ft icr ms this significant variation in dom chemistry has mainly resulted from the hydrologic heterogeneity induced by reservoir management between sr and xr tributaries in particular water intrusion from the mainstream to sr tributary due to reservoir management introduced more terrestrial dom to sr than that in xr which also led to the spatial variation in dom quality in sr we further showed that the reservoir management induced variation in dom chemistry was imprinted in surface sediments and likely further contributed to the carbon burial in the tgr with the dam booming worldwide the linkage between hydrologic management and dom chemistry should be further investigated which would better improve our understanding of carbon cycling in fluvial ecosystems declaration of competing interest

16884,even the most carefully designed water distribution network wdn can suffer from local capacity deficiencies as a result of the quick and unpredictable growth of the urbanization of new industrial sites to solve this problem this paper focuses on the identification of the best possible location for a new pipeline within an existing wdn which maximizes the node wise capacity to determine the optimal solution a parameter namely pressure sensitivity is defined which can localize nodes with local capacity problems computationally efficiently during our research a fitness function transformation technique was defined which increases the effectivity of the optimization on a larger scale by the formulation of a feasible fitness function combining this technique with an extended version of the genetic algorithm the topology of eleven real life wdn was optimized a scrutiny is performed on three networks highlighting typical deficiencies keywords water distribution networks topology optimization capacity enhancement local capacity scarcities network expansion msc 76d55 1 introduction as clean drinking water is an elementary need of life water distribution networks wdns are among the most important parts of modern human settlements as modern metropolises were often born by connecting smaller cities their wdns were also constructed by integrating smaller wdns into larger even regional networks nowadays the rate of urbanization is still increasing heavily and almost every type of network city districts smaller towns or villages might face issues with pressure deficiency i e capacity scarcities might appear local scarcities emerge typically by t he heterogeneous nature of wdns which is one of the numerous consequences of the turbulent expansion of settlements as it was pointed out by house peters and chang 2011 as nazif et al 2010 found another source of unsufficient system pressure might be the result of uncertain demand fluctuations this peculiar behavior of wdns on the one hand can inhibit extensions of networks with new areas on the other hand it might cause limitations in firewater provision as it was highlighted by kaufman and rosencrants 2015 using geographic information system data to give a proper answer to these challenges researchers defined parameters capable of describing the hydraulic performance or the hydraulic resilience of wdns from numerous different aspects dziedzic and karney 2016 created a wdn performance indicator which can identify the nodes where pressure is unnecessarily high or the places with insufficient pressure level through an energy consumption based approach following the resilience index of creaco et al 2016 besides using hydraulics purely another widely applied technique for wdn robustness analysis is graph theory meng et al 2018 identified a connection between the resilience and the topology of wdns while abdel mottaleb et al 2019 and weber et al 2020 analyzed the effect of pipe bursts from the viewpoint of unserved demands after defining a parameter for the description of hydraulic resilience of wdns lorenz and pelz 2020 used this for the fitness function of a genetic algorithm to calculate the optimal places for the implementation of new pipelines the current study s approach follows the hydraulic viewpoint of network resilience and the topology extension based on graph analysis most of the resilience metrics on the one hand give a detailed picture of the network robustness i e their focus is not on the local consumer capacity but the functionality of the whole network however these parameters might need a considerable amount of hardware resources to compute due to these two strong arguments this study focuses on finding a simple yet efficient from the computational point of view node specific indicator which can describe local capacity scarcities in wdns and it can also serve as a fitness function for optimization we are then pursuing those node pairs which upon connected by a new pipeline will provide the highest possible increase in nodal capacity the main questions of this article are the following is there an indicator quantity that describes and localizes local capacity deficiencies where should a new pipeline be added into an existing network to increase the capacity of critical parts of wdns the structure of the paper is the

full control over the source code made it efficient and flexible to experiment with new ideas and techniques from the computational point of view staci is not as efficient as the epanet solver due to its modularity and general framework there is no structural restriction on the modeling equations new methods implementation efforts can be lower nevertheless all of our hydraulic results reported in this paper were validated against epanet with the use of this solver eleven real life wdns have been analysed from the region of western hungary the main parameters of these real life networks can be seen in table 1 in all of the cases snapshot simulations were used as the basis of the optimisation and the consumption values are calculated as a one year average 2 2 hydraulic capacity to describe a wdn mathematically one has to resolve the network to nodes and edges a node represents a location where pipes are connected consumption is present or diameter change can be found and the equation of mass conservation must be solved for the edges the conservation of energy must be fulfilled these equations form a nonlinear algebraic system 1 f x 0 where x is the vector in which the nodal pressures and the flowrates of the edges are collected the above system can be solved e g by newton s technique collins et al 1978 for efficiently solving the resulting linear system we use a sparse matrix solver available in the eigen package guennebaud et al 2010 in the first step of the capacity analysis metrics have to be chosen in maiolo et al 2018 recently suggested the reliability of a wdn can be divided into three main approaches 1 topology based 2 hydraulic or 3 entropy focused as yazdani and jeffrey 2011 and agathokleous et al 2017 summarized in the case of topology based analysis only the layout of the network is exploited using complex network theory tools as described in e g barabási and albert 1999 the entropy based approach uses only the network losses to characterize its reliability as it was described by yassin kassab 1999 and tanyimboh and templeman 2000 the hydraulic reliability approach tries to describe a threshold in terms of specific parameters within which the wdn can still fulfill the needs of the inhabitants see todini 2000 prasad and park 2004 extended this definition and proposed a parameter that characterizes the sufficient and surplus nodal head as an indicator of consumer comfort based on this jayaram and srinivasan 2008 added a lifecycle cost and friction loss energy analysis while these works employed node specific indicators jung et al 2014 defined a novel goodness factor describing the whole network which parameter was extended to characterize the effect of the leakages see creaco et al 2016 the current paper follows a similar idea one single quantity describing the reliability of a whole wdn we define the average network capacity as 2 c 1 n i 1 n c i where n is the number of nodes in the network and c i is the locally available ammount of water at the i th node this node specific c i flowrate is the nodal capacity that is computed as follows a prescribed pressure point reservoir is connected to the i th node with ambient pressure with a new hydraulic simulation the effluent flow rate is calculated during the calculation of c i there is only one additional reservoir connected to the i th node while the remaining parts are unchanged then we repeat the same capacity computation for all nodes this type of analysis provides the maximum value of water at a specific node the authors think this metric can also be applied as a guideline for the maximal value of the available drinking water during the design phase of network extensions a similar analysis can be performed for calculating firewater except that lateral hydrant losses have to be also implemented 2 3 senstivity according to eq 2 the complete capacity analysis of a whole network needs n number of nodes hydraulic simulations which means that the use of the average capacity as a fitness function for optimization due to its vast calculation cost is not suitable according to the literature perelman et al 2013 and creaco et al 2019 the outtakeable water extent and the nodal pressure are closely related thus the current study follows the pressure sensitivity approach we introduce the nodal pressure sensitivity with respect to the demands similarly to pudar and liggett 1992 as 3 s p i d j p 1 d 1 p 1 d n p n d 1 p n d n where s is the sensitivity matrix of the wdn the element in the i th row and the j th column measures the effect of the demand change in the j th node on the i th node s pressure the matrix represents the pressure response of the network in the case of an infinitesimal demand change which is identical to the slope of the pressure demand characteristic curve as it can be seen in fig 1 intuitively the lower the sensitivity is the more robust the nodal pressure is against perturbations in the system for example change in demand due to new consumptions although the evaluation of this quantity seems expensive due to the derivatives and the large size of the sensitivity matrix applying the partial derivative to eq 1 with respect to the j th nodal demand it can be computed efficiently specifically we have 4 f x x d j f d j 0 where f x is the jacobian matrix x d j is one column of the sensitivity matrix and the third term can be easily calculated from the nodal and edge equations more importantly the jacobian matrix is already calculated during the iterative solution of the governing equations and it is known to be a sparse matrix with only three non zero elements per row furthermore as only the third term f d j changes between nodes applying lu decomposition results in highly efficient computation of the sensitivity matrix columns see schwarzenberg czerny 1995 hence the computational effort of the sensitivity matrix is less than the hydraulic simulation itself as it requires the solution of n linear sparse systems with constant coefficient matrix n being the number of nodes it should be noted that the same process could be employed to compute the sensitivity of any output variable with respect to wrt to any parameter for example the sensitivity of the pipe flow rates wrt to demand however this study focuses on the sensitivity of nodal pressures wrt the nodal demands finally computing the sensitivity matrix 3 is identical to solving 4 where f x is already known now we turn to define a node specific quantity we introduce local sensitivity 5 s i j 1 n p i d j that is the row wise sum of the sensitivity matrix this quantity aggregates the sensitivity of the i th node wrt to all of the demands furthermore this parameter can locate the regions where small changes in demands might cause large pressure fluctuations as it can be seen in fig 2 for four real life wdns 2 4 capacity vs sensitivity intuitively one would expect that capacity and sensitivity are correlated as we expect high capacity at nodes where the pressure is stable i e insensitive in the sense that adding a new consumption does not cause pressure deficiency fig 3 reveals that the connection between sensitivity and capacity is hyperbolic the higher the sensitivity is the smaller the capacity becomes thus an a x type function was fitted using the least squares method the coefficient of determination r 2 was found to be 0 6947 indicating a moderately strong correlation to underpin this observation we performed a more detailed statistical analysis namely the spearman rank correlation technique dodge 2008 this statistical analysis explores the correlation between two variables without a prior assumption of the correlation s actual form the result of the spearman rank correlation analysis is c sm 0 7041 which confirms the strong opposed connection between the local sensitivity and the capacity from the engineering point of view in the case of a reservoir node the pressure sensitivity is zero the pressure is independent of the demand and the capacity tends to infinity theoretically an infinite amount of demand can be served a similar argument can be made for the opposite case imagine a simple linear pipeline system consisting of serial pipe segments with demand points between them and pressure points at one end the local sensitivity of the node at the other end of the pipeline is high because all nodal demands affect its pressure its capacity is low due to the pressure drop along all of the pipes 2 5 the fitness function transformation since the nodal sensitivity see eq 5 is still a vector quantity a scalar network specific variable needs to be defined serving as a fitness function for optimization the average network sensitivity s is the average of the nodal sensitivities s i that is 6 s 1 n i 1 n s i this metric makes it possible to measure the effect of any topology modification between the base original and a new topology after adding a new pipe between two nodes based on this the fitness function is formulated as 7 δ s s old s new s old 100 where δ s is the average robustness change of a network s new s old represents improvement i e less sensitive network after the modification hence our ultimate goal is to maximize δ s it is now straightforward to formulate a fitness function 8 f id 1 id 2 δ s where id 1 and id 2 denote the start and end node of the new pipeline after formulating the fitness function matlab s built in genetic algorithm was used and the smallest network no 11 was used for testing purposes due to the small size of test wdn fast convergence was experienced the relatively small size of this network only 377 nodes made it suitable for a complete parameter space mapping that is evaluating all possible connections which can be seen on the top of the right hand side of fig 4 as it can be seen the parameter sweep revealed that the fitness function formulated as eq 8 is showing the properties of a stochastic hölder table which is one of the most challenging fitness function structure according to scott and de jong 2015 thus the naive approach of using the node ids as decision variables during the optimization encumbers the solution process the node numbering in fig 4 is random for a wdn it is clear that merely changing the order of nodes will result in a completely different geography of the fitness function even though the fitness value for a pair of nodes remains unchanged one would expect any optimization strategy to converge faster over regular surfaces with well defined peaks and valleys hence we introduce a change of coordinates instead of using the node ids as primary variables we employ 9 δ s l o c a l s i s j and the geometrical distance between the two nodes l as new decision variables 10 δ s l o c a l l δ s once an optimal pair of δ s l o c a l and l is found one can search the list for the corresponding node ids the advantage of this transformation is clear from the right bottom panel of fig 4 showing a regular optimization surface while testing the novel fitness function it also turned out that the transformation organizes all of the optimal solutions onto one envelope curve as it can also be seen in the bottom right of fig 4 moreover we have found that in the case of single source networks only one reservoir pump or pressure point all of the optimal connections as the allowed node distance l is increased are located on the upper verge of the envelope curve which beholds the data points with the maximum values of δ s l o c a l thus for single source networks no optimization is needed the optimal novel pipe connection is simply the one with the highest local sensitivity see huzsvar et al 2020 for further details 2 6 optimisation according to mala jetmarova et al 2018 the topology optimization of wdns is a well established research field since the works of alperovits and shamir 1977 shamir 1974 nowadays since the work of halhal et al 1997 savic and walters 1997 genetic algorithms are among the most widely used techniques of the wdn topology optimization according to creaco et al 2018 ghassemi et al 2017 mala jetmarova et al 2015 the actual implementation and parameter settings of efficient genetic algorithms ga are always strongly connected to the features of the search space in the current study three different versions of the genetic algorithm were implemented and at last the extended technique of dao et al 2016 2017a 2017b proved to be the best whose most important feature is the adaptive restart condition which utilizes a restart in the optimization process when the search seems to be stuck in a local minimum in this technique four parallel evolution processes are run starting from different starting conditions the best chromosomes are then saved and added to each new evolution process increasing the robustness of the technique against local minima another improvement compared to traditional gas is the use of a local search technique indeed dao et al 2017b suggests the hybridization of a ga decreases the amount of function calls significantly more pieces of information on the optimization process are reported in table 2 in order to ensure a repeatable comparison the runtime of the algorithm was limited for network 1 and 2 the maximal runtime was limited to 48 hours while for the rest of the smaller networks 24 hours was set this distinction was necessary because network 1 and 2 is significantly larger compared to the other analyzed wdns in all of the cases the optimisation process was performed using a standard office desktop pc specifically with the parameters of 16 gb ddr3 ran intel core i7 7500 3 4 ghz quad core processor 2 7 the workflow of the optimization fig 5 describes the process of the topology extension the optimization process searches for the new pipeline between two existing nodes which causes the highest possible capacity increment a linear constraint was also applied in the initialization phase limiting the allowed maximum pipe length this real life dictated condition essentially truncates the search space and exclude unrealistically long pipelines see the right bottom panel in 4 again this constraint also allows us to study the effect of the length of new pipelines on the capacity change in what follows we will run each computation with three limits as summarized in table 3 finally we point out that the diameter of the new pipeline was not a subject of the optimization we uniformly set 100 mm for all pipe lengths 3 case studies for detailed presentation four different was selected based on the following aspects network 11 is selected as a small easy to interpret example for validating the optimization method since complete fitness function evaluation is possible for every available node pairs network 10 serves a densely populated urban area with high demands for further details see huzsvár et al 2019 network 6 is selected to show that our algorithm is capable of detecting a peculiar topological deficiency finally network 2 is presented which is the largest analysed network from the viewpoint of summarized pipe length 3 1 case study 1 network 11 consists of a total of 6 39 km pipe length and 377 nodes serving approx one thousand inhabitants this network is far the smallest one analyzed in this study this wdn has two different sources see fig 6 one tank and one reservoir which can be found at the northern edge of the model the reservoir models a connection to another larger network while the other source is a tank that ensures constant pressure despite all of the efforts of the utility company as it is seen in the left hand side of fig 6 the whole network has high pressure sensitivity except the region in the vicinity of the sources the following constraints were selected 1 5 and 10 percentage of the total pipe length that is 69 3 346 5 and 639 m see also in table 3 the optimization technique proposed the same new pipeline for limits 1 and 2 shown in the right upper corner this solution has a limited effect on sensitivity the improvement is localized close to the sources but most of the network remains critically sensitive however the case of limit 3 adding 10 of additional pipeline shows a significantly different picture bottom right panel in fig 6 a novel relatively long by pass pipeline was added that decreases the sensitivity of the network drastically while also increasing the capacity by 36 26 percent a complete local capacity analysis was also performed to verify these results including 1131 hydraulic simulations c i values were calculated for both the original network and the two modified topologies the capacity histogram is shown in fig 7 where 100 represents the mean capacity of the base network the optimal bin width is calculated with the technique of freedman and diaconis 1981 the distribution of the base network and the modified ones according to limit 1 and 2 coincide i e no significant capacity increase was achieved due to this the nodal capacity distributions of limit 1 and 2 are not shown in the histogram but table 4 summarizes the numerical results for each case limit 3 resulted in a significant capacity increase of 61 2 see also fig 7 and table 4 compared against the solution of limit 1 and 2 limit 3 suggests a completely different solution a by pass between the main body of the network and the sources as a result the capacity of the outstanding nodes is decreased significantly but the capacity of the suffocating nodes where capacity was critically low increased on a larger scale due to the fact that the surrounding area of the sources has tremendous capacity compared to the main body of the network the distribution of the capacity in the original case just showing two large peaks one at the average capacity of the primary network body and a lot higher at the average of the capacity of the sources as this representation conceal the behavior of the main body of the network which is in the focus of the current case study node exclusion was implemented to clarify the results this excluded histogram can be seen in fig 7 due to problems that are rooted in the subjectivity of the node exclusion this technique has not been applied in the case of every other network to sum up it can be concluded that this network has a bottleneck between its sources and the main body of the network which can be eliminated by the solution according to limit 3 3 2 case study 2 fig 8 presents the layout of network 10 there is only one source in this wdn a pumping station but we model it as a constant pressure node see the eastern side of the graph the left upper panel shows the original topology highlighting intense capacity problems red area while the area close to the pumping station is outstandingly robust blue area this network is significantly larger than the previous one since it has 17 62 km of pipeline length and 1293 nodes in this case the length limits were selected as 0 1 1 and 5 percentages of the cumulative pipe length giving 17 176 and 738 m respectively see also table 4 besides its size the new challenge for the algorithm was the highly looped topology of this network the results of the optimization with limit 1 can be seen on the top of the right hand side of fig 8 the computation unveils a bottleneck see upper right panel but due to the first limit 17 62 meters the improvement in the sensitivity is limited and the overall sensitivity remains almost unchanged nevertheless even in this case the average capacity is increased by 0 2715 percent the run with limit 2 lower right panel provided a similar solution in this case the linear constraints maximum pipeline length make it possible to add a longer pipeline which by passes a longer section from this critically narrow section in this case there is a clear and visible improvement in the sensitivity and the average capacity is also increased by 3 percent finally limit 3 lower left panel results in an average capacity increase of 6 739 percent and more importantly the pressure sensitivity drops significantly see also table 4 however it is clear that the suggested new pipeline is not feasible in reality as its track intersects several other pipelines and more importantly it goes through private properties nevertheless this virtual solution provides valuable information on where to increase pipe diameter to improve critically sensitive areas 3 3 case study 3 network 6 is a large step forward from the viewpoint of network complexity and size as it consists of approx 2000 nodes and an overall pipeline length of 33 16 kilometers the graph of the network is shown in fig 9 this network has four sources two of them are reservoirs with pressure stabilization purposes these are located in the deep blue areas in the northern and at the southern side of the network graph see the left hand side of fig 9 besides these tanks there are two reservoirs in the middle section of the network denoted by letter p we have chosen this network to demonstrate that our algorithm is capable of identifying the bottleneck in the network topology the runs with all three length limits suggest the same pipe of 22 39 meter also see table 4 this bottleneck also explains the nodes with high sensitivity at the network center even though the pressure sources are close similar to network 10 in case study 2 the algorithm suggested a new parallel pipeline besides an existing one increasing the flow rate from the critically segregated source to the other parts of the network according to fig 9 the implementation of this short pipeline changes the whole network s pressure robustness and capacity numerically the capacity of the network is increased by 6 739 percent 3 4 case study 4 from the viewpoint of overall pipelength network 2 is the largest from the overall pipelength is 111 9 kilometres including 6907 nodes the graph of the network can be seen in fig 10 this wdn embraces a whole suburban type area the long radial arms which are stretching widely from the centrum of the network serve the satellite villages which were connected to the main wdn during the last decades this case study is presented to imitate the case when the optimisation technique has to solve network problems which are covering large distances the central densely populated section of the network is a well supported stable area as it can be seen in fig 10 contrary the regions with the villages at the southern side are critically sensitive based on the network graph it is even possible to intuitively locate the bottleneck because it is clearly seen that the capacity of the hanging section are blocked by the flow volume of the long single express pipeline which connects it to the main body of the network the problem is that even the shortest pipeline which connects a robust and critically sensitive area is more than 2 kilometres long it means that in such cases when the scale of the network features is larger than the economically implementable pipeline length the algorithm has to identify a solution which is far from trivial according to fig 10 as it can be seen the identified optimal solution is a new parallel pipeline to the express line but its location is special its starting node is not at the already overused central sources but it is aiming to connect the stable and malfunctioning regions as strongly as possible within the limitations dictated by the pipe length constraint the results can be seen in table 4 the expansion of the critically sensitive area is so enourmous that only in the case of limit 3 is it possible to increase the pressure robustness and capacity significantly by adding a pipeline with 1 111 kilometers the average capacity increased by 1 599 percent the other two cases limit 1 and 2 only modify the network robustness to a negligible extent this result shows that the modification of the sensitivity is always connected to the topology of the network it is almost impossible to decrease the network sensitivity with a short few ten meter long pipeline if the structural areas of the network which are different from the viewpoint of network sensitivity are kilometers away from each other 3 5 summary of the optimization results we now present the optimization results for all networks and all three allowed pipe length limits fig 11 presents the average capacity increase left hand side panel and the average sensitivity decrease right hand side panel for all networks the number of nodes decreases from network 1 to 11 the summarized results of the analysis can be seen in fig 11 while the table of the results can be found in table 5 comparing the capacity increases left panel against the pressure sensitivity decreases right panel we see that these two quantities are not fully correlated in the sense that a high decrease in average sensitivity does not necessarily imply a significant increase in average capacity for example in network 1 there is only a mild approx 1 capacity increment for limit 3 whereas the same new pipeline connection results in a significant increase of approx 54 pressure sensitivity however in network 11 we have found that the decrease in average pressure sensitivity and an average capacity increase is in the same order of magnitude nevertheless it is clear that a decrease in the average sensitivity increases the wds average capacity networks 1 and 2 are the largest ones their node number is 3000 higher than network 3 thus these were the most challenging from the optimization point of view according to the results of case study 4 these networks due to their large extent pose a new challenge for the optimisation technique as it is presented in the right hand side panel in fig 11 a significant sensitivity improvement was achieved and the longer the allowed pipe length is the higher the gain is as these systems are large serving more than ten thousand inhabitants the relatively low capacity increase is still significant in the absolute sense in the case of networks 7 8 and 9 the increase in the capacity is moderate 5 even though the decrease in sensitivity is significant the reason is that these networks are already stable in the sense that their capacity is sufficient and thus a new consumer with large demand e g use of a fire hydrant remains hidden from the viewpoint of pressure fluctuation the results of networks 3 4 5 6 10 and 11 show significant improvement both in terms of capacity and sensitivity that is the proposed optimization technique successfully identified the optimal location of new pipelines see table 5 for details in particular in the case of network 11 a 15 7 meter long pipeline could significantly decrease the sensitivity of the network with this surprisingly small modification this network s average capacity increased by 11 4 percent which is a remarkable gain given that the network consists of more than 377 nodes table 6 contains the number of function calls showing that the optimal solutions were found with a relatively low number of hydraulic simulations compared e g to a full evaluation of all possible pipe connections it is worth mentioning that in some cases e g network 3 5 and 8 the capacity increase in the case of limit 2 is higher than that of limit 3 meaning that lower sensitivity does not always necessarily mean higher capacity see also fig 3 4 conclusions this paper presented an efficient optimization technique based on fitness function transformation for identifying a new pipeline that improves capacity deficiency problems of wdns two key parameters were defined local capacity and local pressure sensitivity local capacity c i measures the available drinking water at the i t h node however as this parameter is computationally expensive for each node an independent hydraulic simulation is required it is not suitable for optimization local pressure sensitivity s i characterizes the effect of the demand change from the viewpoint of nodal pressures and as it was shown it is also capable of identifying the nodes where capacity problems might appear more importantly its computation cost is significantly lower than the local capacity no additional hydraulic simulation is needed by proving the correlation between local capacity and local pressure sensitivity a new fitness function transformation technique was defined which drastically decreased the complexity of the search space we have solved the emerging optimization problem by employing the genetic algorithm described by dao et al 2017b three case studies demonstrated the viability of the approach in the simplest case case study 1 our technique suggested an entirely new pipeline connection between low sensitivity and high sensitivity regions in the second case with the shorter length limits the method suggested a new pipe parallel to an existing one which translates to a diameter increase in real life this second study also revealed that even though adding long new pipelines is tempting because the sensitivity drops significantly such modification might be infeasible due to financial or other practical limitations there was a third interesting scenario case study 3 the algorithm located a short but limiting bottleneck pipe in the system whose replacement by larger diameter one results improves the wds s overall behavior aggregating the optimization results for all 11 networks we experienced a clear trend proving that reducing the pressure sensitivity improves capacity based on these studies we draw the following conclusions a correlation was identified between the computationally expensive nodal capacity c i and the computationally cheap nodal pressure sensitivity s i on the one hand the strength of the correlation was analyzed with the use of the spearman rank correlation where the correlation parameter was 0 7041 indicating a relatively strong correlation on the other hand a hyperbole was fitted using the least squares method and the coefficient of determination r 2 was found to be 0 6947 in the case of three case studies a fitness function transformation technique was defined which can re map the search space of the topology optimization into a more convenient structure without this transformation applying a general genetic algorithm was inhibited by the complexity of the fitness function moreover the method is proved to be so effective that in the case of wdns with only one source the optimum can be found directly that is without any searching technique a constraint resistant genetic algorithm was applied for the optimization with this method the topology of eleven real life wdn was analyzed in the case of every network the algorithm identified a solution that increased the network s capacity besides these conclusions there are some open questions and directions for further investigation and research first of all there are cases when the network topology is such that one has to add extremely long pipe connections to reach a reasonable decrease in sensitivity see network 2 in the supplementary material as an example secondly during this research linear pipe length constraints were used but the method is general enough to cope with others possibly nonlinear constraints for instance it is possible to add special penalties for candidate pipelines crossing specific areas where the cost of building a new pipeline is high another example would be to consider the cost of different pipe diameters in this investigation the diameter of the novel pipeline was assumed to be uniformly 100 mm finally as for future plans a natural next step would be to extend the methodology towards adding multiple pipelines simultaneously increasing the applicability of the method towards larger networks data availability statement the source code of

16884,even the most carefully designed water distribution network wdn can suffer from local capacity deficiencies as a result of the quick and unpredictable growth of the urbanization of new industrial sites to solve this problem this paper focuses on the identification of the best possible location for a new pipeline within an existing wdn which maximizes the node wise capacity to determine the optimal solution a parameter namely pressure sensitivity is defined which can localize nodes with local capacity problems computationally efficiently during our research a fitness function transformation technique was defined which increases the effectivity of the optimization on a larger scale by the formulation of a feasible fitness function combining this technique with an extended version of the genetic algorithm the topology of eleven real life wdn was optimized a scrutiny is performed on three networks highlighting typical deficiencies keywords water distribution networks topology optimization capacity enhancement local capacity scarcities network expansion msc 76d55 1 introduction as clean drinking water is an elementary need of life water distribution networks wdns are among the most important parts of modern human settlements as modern metropolises were often born by connecting smaller cities their wdns were also constructed by integrating smaller wdns into larger even regional networks nowadays the rate of urbanization is still increasing heavily and almost every type of network city districts smaller towns or villages might face issues with pressure deficiency i e capacity scarcities might appear local scarcities emerge typically by t he heterogeneous nature of wdns which is one of the numerous consequences of the turbulent expansion of settlements as it was pointed out by house peters and chang 2011 as nazif et al 2010 found another source of unsufficient system pressure might be the result of uncertain demand fluctuations this peculiar behavior of wdns on the one hand can inhibit extensions of networks with new areas on the other hand it might cause limitations in firewater provision as it was highlighted by kaufman and rosencrants 2015 using geographic information system data to give a proper answer to these challenges researchers defined parameters capable of describing the hydraulic performance or the hydraulic resilience of wdns from numerous different aspects dziedzic and karney 2016 created a wdn performance indicator which can identify the nodes where pressure is unnecessarily high or the places with insufficient pressure level through an energy consumption based approach following the resilience index of creaco et al 2016 besides using hydraulics purely another widely applied technique for wdn robustness analysis is graph theory meng et al 2018 identified a connection between the resilience and the topology of wdns while abdel mottaleb et al 2019 and weber et al 2020 analyzed the effect of pipe bursts from the viewpoint of unserved demands after defining a parameter for the description of hydraulic resilience of wdns lorenz and pelz 2020 used this for the fitness function of a genetic algorithm to calculate the optimal places for the implementation of new pipelines the current study s approach follows the hydraulic viewpoint of network resilience and the topology extension based on graph analysis most of the resilience metrics on the one hand give a detailed picture of the network robustness i e their focus is not on the local consumer capacity but the functionality of the whole network however these parameters might need a considerable amount of hardware resources to compute due to these two strong arguments this study focuses on finding a simple yet efficient from the computational point of view node specific indicator which can describe local capacity scarcities in wdns and it can also serve as a fitness function for optimization we are then pursuing those node pairs which upon connected by a new pipeline will provide the highest possible increase in nodal capacity the main questions of this article are the following is there an indicator quantity that describes and localizes local capacity deficiencies where should a new pipeline be added into an existing network to increase the capacity of critical parts of wdns the structure of the paper is the

wdn mathematically one has to resolve the network to nodes and edges a node represents a location where pipes are connected consumption is present or diameter change can be found and the equation of mass conservation must be solved for the edges the conservation of energy must be fulfilled these equations form a nonlinear algebraic system 1 f x 0 where x is the vector in which the nodal pressures and the flowrates of the edges are collected the above system can be solved e g by newton s technique collins et al 1978 for efficiently solving the resulting linear system we use a sparse matrix solver available in the eigen package guennebaud et al 2010 in the first step of the capacity analysis metrics have to be chosen in maiolo et al 2018 recently suggested the reliability of a wdn can be divided into three main approaches 1 topology based 2 hydraulic or 3 entropy focused as yazdani and jeffrey 2011 and agathokleous et al 2017 summarized in the case of topology based analysis only the layout of the network is exploited using complex network theory tools as described in e g barabási and albert 1999 the entropy based approach uses only the network losses to characterize its reliability as it was described by yassin kassab 1999 and tanyimboh and templeman 2000 the hydraulic reliability approach tries to describe a threshold in terms of specific parameters within which the wdn can still fulfill the needs of the inhabitants see todini 2000 prasad and park 2004 extended this definition and proposed a parameter that characterizes the sufficient and surplus nodal head as an indicator of consumer comfort based on this jayaram and srinivasan 2008 added a lifecycle cost and friction loss energy analysis while these works employed node specific indicators jung et al 2014 defined a novel goodness factor describing the whole network which parameter was extended to characterize the effect of the leakages see creaco et al 2016 the current paper follows a similar idea one single quantity describing the reliability of a whole wdn we define the average network capacity as 2 c 1 n i 1 n c i where n is the number of nodes in the network and c i is the locally available ammount of water at the i th node this node specific c i flowrate is the nodal capacity that is computed as follows a prescribed pressure point reservoir is connected to the i th node with ambient pressure with a new hydraulic simulation the effluent flow rate is calculated during the calculation of c i there is only one additional reservoir connected to the i th node while the remaining parts are unchanged then we repeat the same capacity computation for all nodes this type of analysis provides the maximum value of water at a specific node the authors think this metric can also be applied as a guideline for the maximal value of the available drinking water during the design phase of network extensions a similar analysis can be performed for calculating firewater except that lateral hydrant losses have to be also implemented 2 3 senstivity according to eq 2 the complete capacity analysis of a whole network needs n number of nodes hydraulic simulations which means that the use of the average capacity as a fitness function for optimization due to its vast calculation cost is not suitable according to the literature perelman et al 2013 and creaco et al 2019 the outtakeable water extent and the nodal pressure are closely related thus the current study follows the pressure sensitivity approach we introduce the nodal pressure sensitivity with respect to the demands similarly to pudar and liggett 1992 as 3 s p i d j p 1 d 1 p 1 d n p n d 1 p n d n where s is the sensitivity matrix of the wdn the element in the i th row and the j th column measures the effect of the demand change in the j th node on the i th node s pressure the matrix represents the pressure response of the network in the case of an infinitesimal demand change which is identical to the slope of the pressure demand characteristic curve as it can be seen in fig 1 intuitively the lower the sensitivity is the more robust the nodal pressure is against perturbations in the system for example change in demand due to new consumptions although the evaluation of this quantity seems expensive due to the derivatives and the large size of the sensitivity matrix applying the partial derivative to eq 1 with respect to the j th nodal demand it can be computed efficiently specifically we have 4 f x x d j f d j 0 where f x is the jacobian matrix x d j is one column of the sensitivity matrix and the third term can be easily calculated from the nodal and edge equations more importantly the jacobian matrix is already calculated during the iterative solution of the governing equations and it is known to be a sparse matrix with only three non zero elements per row furthermore as only the third term f d j changes between nodes applying lu decomposition results in highly efficient computation of the sensitivity matrix columns see schwarzenberg czerny 1995 hence the computational effort of the sensitivity matrix is less than the hydraulic simulation itself as it requires the solution of n linear sparse systems with constant coefficient matrix n being the number of nodes it should be noted that the same process could be employed to compute the sensitivity of any output variable with respect to wrt to any parameter for example the sensitivity of the pipe flow rates wrt to demand however this study focuses on the sensitivity of nodal pressures wrt the nodal demands finally computing the sensitivity matrix 3 is identical to solving 4 where f x is already known now we turn to define a node specific quantity we introduce local sensitivity 5 s i j 1 n p i d j that is the row wise sum of the sensitivity matrix this quantity aggregates the sensitivity of the i th node wrt to all of the demands furthermore this parameter can locate the regions where small changes in demands might cause large pressure fluctuations as it can be seen in fig 2 for four real life wdns 2 4 capacity vs sensitivity intuitively one would expect that capacity and sensitivity are correlated as we expect high capacity at nodes where the pressure is stable i e insensitive in the sense that adding a new consumption does not cause pressure deficiency fig 3 reveals that the connection between sensitivity and capacity is hyperbolic the higher the sensitivity is the smaller the capacity becomes thus an a x type function was fitted using the least squares method the coefficient of determination r 2 was found to be 0 6947 indicating a moderately strong correlation to underpin this observation we performed a more detailed statistical analysis namely the spearman rank correlation technique dodge 2008 this statistical analysis explores the correlation between two variables without a prior assumption of the correlation s actual form the result of the spearman rank correlation analysis is c sm 0 7041 which confirms the strong opposed connection between the local sensitivity and the capacity from the engineering point of view in the case of a reservoir node the pressure sensitivity is zero the pressure is independent of the demand and the capacity tends to infinity theoretically an infinite amount of demand can be served a similar argument can be made for the opposite case imagine a simple linear pipeline system consisting of serial pipe segments with demand points between them and pressure points at one end the local sensitivity of the node at the other end of the pipeline is high because all nodal demands affect its pressure its capacity is low due to the pressure drop along all of the pipes 2 5 the fitness function transformation since the nodal sensitivity see eq 5 is still a vector quantity a scalar network specific variable needs to be defined serving as a fitness function for optimization the average network sensitivity s is the average of the nodal sensitivities s i that is 6 s 1 n i 1 n s i this metric makes it possible to measure the effect of any topology modification between the base original and a new topology after adding a new pipe between two nodes based on this the fitness function is formulated as 7 δ s s old s new s old 100 where δ s is the average robustness change of a network s new s old represents improvement i e less sensitive network after the modification hence our ultimate goal is to maximize δ s it is now straightforward to formulate a fitness function 8 f id 1 id 2 δ s where id 1 and id 2 denote the start and end node of the new pipeline after formulating the fitness function matlab s built in genetic algorithm was used and the smallest network no 11 was used for testing purposes due to the small size of test wdn fast convergence was experienced the relatively small size of this network only 377 nodes made it suitable for a complete parameter space mapping that is evaluating all possible connections which can be seen on the top of the right hand side of fig 4 as it can be seen the parameter sweep revealed that the fitness function formulated as eq 8 is showing the properties of a stochastic hölder table which is one of the most challenging fitness function structure according to scott and de jong 2015 thus the naive approach of using the node ids as decision variables during the optimization encumbers the solution process the node numbering in fig 4 is random for a wdn it is clear that merely changing the order of nodes will result in a completely different geography of the fitness function even though the fitness value for a pair of nodes remains unchanged one would expect any optimization strategy to converge faster over regular surfaces with well defined peaks and valleys hence we introduce a change of coordinates instead of using the node ids as primary variables we employ 9 δ s l o c a l s i s j and the geometrical distance between the two nodes l as new decision variables 10 δ s l o c a l l δ s once an optimal pair of δ s l o c a l and l is found one can search the list for the corresponding node ids the advantage of this transformation is clear from the right bottom panel of fig 4 showing a regular optimization surface while testing the novel fitness function it also turned out that the transformation organizes all of the optimal solutions onto one envelope curve as it can also be seen in the bottom right of fig 4 moreover we have found that in the case of single source networks only one reservoir pump or pressure point all of the optimal connections as the allowed node distance l is increased are located on the upper verge of the envelope curve which beholds the data points with the maximum values of δ s l o c a l thus for single source networks no optimization is needed the optimal novel pipe connection is simply the one with the highest local sensitivity see huzsvar et al 2020 for further details 2 6 optimisation according to mala jetmarova et al 2018 the topology optimization of wdns is a well established research field since the works of alperovits and shamir 1977 shamir 1974 nowadays since the work of halhal et al 1997 savic and walters 1997 genetic algorithms are among the most widely used techniques of the wdn topology optimization according to creaco et al 2018 ghassemi et al 2017 mala jetmarova et al 2015 the actual implementation and parameter settings of efficient genetic algorithms ga are always strongly connected to the features of the search space in the current study three different versions of the genetic algorithm were implemented and at last the extended technique of dao et al 2016 2017a 2017b proved to be the best whose most important feature is the adaptive restart condition which utilizes a restart in the optimization process when the search seems to be stuck in a local minimum in this technique four parallel evolution processes are run starting from different starting conditions the best chromosomes are then saved and added to each new evolution process increasing the robustness of the technique against local minima another improvement compared to traditional gas is the use of a local search technique indeed dao et al 2017b suggests the hybridization of a ga decreases the amount of function calls significantly more pieces of information on the optimization process are reported in table 2 in order to ensure a repeatable comparison the runtime of the algorithm was limited for network 1 and 2 the maximal runtime was limited to 48 hours while for the rest of the smaller networks 24 hours was set this distinction was necessary because network 1 and 2 is significantly larger compared to the other analyzed wdns in all of the cases the optimisation process was performed using a standard office desktop pc specifically with the parameters of 16 gb ddr3 ran intel core i7 7500 3 4 ghz quad core processor 2 7 the workflow of the optimization fig 5 describes the process of the topology extension the optimization process searches for the new pipeline between two existing nodes which causes the highest possible capacity increment a linear constraint was also applied in the initialization phase limiting the allowed maximum pipe length this real life dictated condition essentially truncates the search space and exclude unrealistically long pipelines see the right bottom panel in 4 again this constraint also allows us to study the effect of the length of new pipelines on the capacity change in what follows we will run each computation with three limits as summarized in table 3 finally we point out that the diameter of the new pipeline was not a subject of the optimization we uniformly set 100 mm for all pipe lengths 3 case studies for detailed presentation four different was selected based on the following aspects network 11 is selected as a small easy to interpret example for validating the optimization method since complete fitness function evaluation is possible for every available node pairs network 10 serves a densely populated urban area with high demands for further details see huzsvár et al 2019 network 6 is selected to show that our algorithm is capable of detecting a peculiar topological deficiency finally network 2 is presented which is the largest analysed network from the viewpoint of summarized pipe length 3 1 case study 1 network 11 consists of a total of 6 39 km pipe length and 377 nodes serving approx one thousand inhabitants this network is far the smallest one analyzed in this study this wdn has two different sources see fig 6 one tank and one reservoir which can be found at the northern edge of the model the reservoir models a connection to another larger network while the other source is a tank that ensures constant pressure despite all of the efforts of the utility company as it is seen in the left hand side of fig 6 the whole network has high pressure sensitivity except the region in the vicinity of the sources the following constraints were selected 1 5 and 10 percentage of the total pipe length that is 69 3 346 5 and 639 m see also in table 3 the optimization technique proposed the same new pipeline for limits 1 and 2 shown in the right upper corner this solution has a limited effect on sensitivity the improvement is localized close to the sources but most of the network remains critically sensitive however the case of limit 3 adding 10 of additional pipeline shows a significantly different picture bottom right panel in fig 6 a novel relatively long by pass pipeline was added that decreases the sensitivity of the network drastically while also increasing the capacity by 36 26 percent a complete local capacity analysis was also performed to verify these results including 1131 hydraulic simulations c i values were calculated for both the original network and the two modified topologies the capacity histogram is shown in fig 7 where 100 represents the mean capacity of the base network the optimal bin width is calculated with the technique of freedman and diaconis 1981 the distribution of the base network and the modified ones according to limit 1 and 2 coincide i e no significant capacity increase was achieved due to this the nodal capacity distributions of limit 1 and 2 are not shown in the histogram but table 4 summarizes the numerical results for each case limit 3 resulted in a significant capacity increase of 61 2 see also fig 7 and table 4 compared against the solution of limit 1 and 2 limit 3 suggests a completely different solution a by pass between the main body of the network and the sources as a result the capacity of the outstanding nodes is decreased significantly but the capacity of the suffocating nodes where capacity was critically low increased on a larger scale due to the fact that the surrounding area of the sources has tremendous capacity compared to the main body of the network the distribution of the capacity in the original case just showing two large peaks one at the average capacity of the primary network body and a lot higher at the average of the capacity of the sources as this representation conceal the behavior of the main body of the network which is in the focus of the current case study node exclusion was implemented to clarify the results this excluded histogram can be seen in fig 7 due to problems that are rooted in the subjectivity of the node exclusion this technique has not been applied in the case of every other network to sum up it can be concluded that this network has a bottleneck between its sources and the main body of the network which can be eliminated by the solution according to limit 3 3 2 case study 2 fig 8 presents the layout of network 10 there is only one source in this wdn a pumping station but we model it as a constant pressure node see the eastern side of the graph the left upper panel shows the original topology highlighting intense capacity problems red area while the area close to the pumping station is outstandingly robust blue area this network is significantly larger than the previous one since it has 17 62 km of pipeline length and 1293 nodes in this case the length limits were selected as 0 1 1 and 5 percentages of the cumulative pipe length giving 17 176 and 738 m respectively see also table 4 besides its size the new challenge for the algorithm was the highly looped topology of this network the results of the optimization with limit 1 can be seen on the top of the right hand side of fig 8 the computation unveils a bottleneck see upper right panel but due to the first limit 17 62 meters the improvement in the sensitivity is limited and the overall sensitivity remains almost unchanged nevertheless even in this case the average capacity is increased by 0 2715 percent the run with limit 2 lower right panel provided a similar solution in this case the linear constraints maximum pipeline length make it possible to add a longer pipeline which by passes a longer section from this critically narrow section in this case there is a clear and visible improvement in the sensitivity and the average capacity is also increased by 3 percent finally limit 3 lower left panel results in an average capacity increase of 6 739 percent and more importantly the pressure sensitivity drops significantly see also table 4 however it is clear that the suggested new pipeline is not feasible in reality as its track intersects several other pipelines and more importantly it goes through private properties nevertheless this virtual solution provides valuable information on where to increase pipe diameter to improve critically sensitive areas 3 3 case study 3 network 6 is a large step forward from the viewpoint of network complexity and size as it consists of approx 2000 nodes and an overall pipeline length of 33 16 kilometers the graph of the network is shown in fig 9 this network has four sources two of them are reservoirs with pressure stabilization purposes these are located in the deep blue areas in the northern and at the southern side of the network graph see the left hand side of fig 9 besides these tanks there are two reservoirs in the middle section of the network denoted by letter p we have chosen this network to demonstrate that our algorithm is capable of identifying the bottleneck in the network topology the runs with all three length limits suggest the same pipe of 22 39 meter also see table 4 this bottleneck also explains the nodes with high sensitivity at the network center even though the pressure sources are close similar to network 10 in case study 2 the algorithm suggested a new parallel pipeline besides an existing one increasing the flow rate from the critically segregated source to the other parts of the network according to fig 9 the implementation of this short pipeline changes the whole network s pressure robustness and capacity numerically the capacity of the network is increased by 6 739 percent 3 4 case study 4 from the viewpoint of overall pipelength network 2 is the largest from the overall pipelength is 111 9 kilometres including 6907 nodes the graph of the network can be seen in fig 10 this wdn embraces a whole suburban type area the long radial arms which are stretching widely from the centrum of the network serve the satellite villages which were connected to the main wdn during the last decades this case study is presented to imitate the case when the optimisation technique has to solve network problems which are covering large distances the central densely populated section of the network is a well supported stable area as it can be seen in fig 10 contrary the regions with the villages at the southern side are critically sensitive based on the network graph it is even possible to intuitively locate the bottleneck because it is clearly seen that the capacity of the hanging section are blocked by the flow volume of the long single express pipeline which connects it to the main body of the network the problem is that even the shortest pipeline which connects a robust and critically sensitive area is more than 2 kilometres long it means that in such cases when the scale of the network features is larger than the economically implementable pipeline length the algorithm has to identify a solution which is far from trivial according to fig 10 as it can be seen the identified optimal solution is a new parallel pipeline to the express line but its location is special its starting node is not at the already overused central sources but it is aiming to connect the stable and malfunctioning regions as strongly as possible within the limitations dictated by the pipe length constraint the results can be seen in table 4 the expansion of the critically sensitive area is so enourmous that only in the case of limit 3 is it possible to increase the pressure robustness and capacity significantly by adding a pipeline with 1 111 kilometers the average capacity increased by 1 599 percent the other two cases limit 1 and 2 only modify the network robustness to a negligible extent this result shows that the modification of the sensitivity is always connected to the topology of the network it is almost impossible to decrease the network sensitivity with a short few ten meter long pipeline if the structural areas of the network which are different from the viewpoint of network sensitivity are kilometers away from each other 3 5 summary of the optimization results we now present the optimization results for all networks and all three allowed pipe length limits fig 11 presents the average capacity increase left hand side panel and the average sensitivity decrease right hand side panel for all networks the number of nodes decreases from network 1 to 11 the summarized results of the analysis can be seen in fig 11 while the table of the results can be found in table 5 comparing the capacity increases left panel against the pressure sensitivity decreases right panel we see that these two quantities are not fully correlated in the sense that a high decrease in average sensitivity does not necessarily imply a significant increase in average capacity for example in network 1 there is only a mild approx 1 capacity increment for limit 3 whereas the same new pipeline connection results in a significant increase of approx 54 pressure sensitivity however in network 11 we have found that the decrease in average pressure sensitivity and an average capacity increase is in the same order of magnitude nevertheless it is clear that a decrease in the average sensitivity increases the wds average capacity networks 1 and 2 are the largest ones their node number is 3000 higher than network 3 thus these were the most challenging from the optimization point of view according to the results of case study 4 these networks due to their large extent pose a new challenge for the optimisation technique as it is presented in the right hand side panel in fig 11 a significant sensitivity improvement was achieved and the longer the allowed pipe length is the higher the gain is as these systems are large serving more than ten thousand inhabitants the relatively low capacity increase is still significant in the absolute sense in the case of networks 7 8 and 9 the increase in the capacity is moderate 5 even though the decrease in sensitivity is significant the reason is that these networks are already stable in the sense that their capacity is sufficient and thus a new consumer with large demand e g use of a fire hydrant remains hidden from the viewpoint of pressure fluctuation the results of networks 3 4 5 6 10 and 11 show significant improvement both in terms of capacity and sensitivity that is the proposed optimization technique successfully identified the optimal location of new pipelines see table 5 for details in particular in the case of network 11 a 15 7 meter long pipeline could significantly decrease the sensitivity of the network with this surprisingly small modification this network s average capacity increased by 11 4 percent which is a remarkable gain given that the network consists of more than 377 nodes table 6 contains the number of function calls showing that the optimal solutions were found with a relatively low number of hydraulic simulations compared e g to a full evaluation of all possible pipe connections it is worth mentioning that in some cases e g network 3 5 and 8 the capacity increase in the case of limit 2 is higher than that of limit 3 meaning that lower sensitivity does not always necessarily mean higher capacity see also fig 3 4 conclusions this paper presented an efficient optimization technique based on fitness function transformation for identifying a new pipeline that improves capacity deficiency problems of wdns two key parameters were defined local capacity and local pressure sensitivity local capacity c i measures the available drinking water at the i t h node however as this parameter is computationally expensive for each node an independent hydraulic simulation is required it is not suitable for optimization local pressure sensitivity s i characterizes the effect of the demand change from the viewpoint of nodal pressures and as it was shown it is also capable of identifying the nodes where capacity problems might appear more importantly its computation cost is significantly lower than the local capacity no additional hydraulic simulation is needed by proving the correlation between local capacity and local pressure sensitivity a new fitness function transformation technique was defined which drastically decreased the complexity of the search space we have solved the emerging optimization problem by employing the genetic algorithm described by dao et al 2017b three case studies demonstrated the viability of the approach in the simplest case case study 1 our technique suggested an entirely new pipeline connection between low sensitivity and high sensitivity regions in the second case with the shorter length limits the method suggested a new pipe parallel to an existing one which translates to a diameter increase in real life this second study also revealed that even though adding long new pipelines is tempting because the sensitivity drops significantly such modification might be infeasible due to financial or other practical limitations there was a third interesting scenario case study 3 the algorithm located a short but limiting bottleneck pipe in the system whose replacement by larger diameter one results improves the wds s overall behavior aggregating the optimization results for all 11 networks we experienced a clear trend proving that reducing the pressure sensitivity improves capacity based on these studies we draw the following conclusions a correlation was identified between the computationally expensive nodal capacity c i and the computationally cheap nodal pressure sensitivity s i on the one hand the strength of the correlation was analyzed with the use of the spearman rank correlation where the correlation parameter was 0 7041 indicating a relatively strong correlation on the other hand a hyperbole was fitted using the least squares method and the coefficient of determination r 2 was found to be 0 6947 in the case of three case studies a fitness function transformation technique was defined which can re map the search space of the topology optimization into a more convenient structure without this transformation applying a general genetic algorithm was inhibited by the complexity of the fitness function moreover the method is proved to be so effective that in the case of wdns with only one source the optimum can be found directly that is without any searching technique a constraint resistant genetic algorithm was applied for the optimization with this method the topology of eleven real life wdn was analyzed in the case of every network the algorithm identified a solution that increased the network s capacity besides these conclusions there are some open questions and directions for further investigation and research first of all there are cases when the network topology is such that one has to add extremely long pipe connections to reach a reasonable decrease in sensitivity see network 2 in the supplementary material as an example secondly during this research linear pipe length constraints were used but the method is general enough to cope with others possibly nonlinear constraints for instance it is possible to add special penalties for candidate pipelines crossing specific areas where the cost of building a new pipeline is high another example would be to consider the cost of different pipe diameters in this investigation the diameter of the novel pipeline was assumed to be uniformly 100 mm finally as for future plans a natural next step would be to extend the methodology towards adding multiple pipelines simultaneously increasing the applicability of the method towards larger networks data availability statement the source code of
