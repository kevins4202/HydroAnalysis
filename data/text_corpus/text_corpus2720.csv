wastewater treatment plants wwtps typically employ conventional activated sludge cas systems that require extensive energy input and produce large amount of residuals 1 2 the operational energy consumption of cas plants generally ranges from 0 3 to 0 6 kw h m3 of which about 50 is used for aeration 3 in addition most of the energy contained in the wastewater is used by aerobic mineralization during treatment leaving behind limited amount available for recovery 4 in the united states wastewater treatment consumes approximately 4 of the nation s electricity demands 75 billion kwh 5 the electricity cost to deliver safe drinking water and to ensure effective wastewater treatment is about 7 5 billion annually 6 over the next 20 years the us wastewater infrastructure will require a huge investment of 300 billion for upgrades due to rapid population growth aging infrastructure deterioration of surface waters resulting from excess nutrient loading and a reliance on energy intensive treatment processes 5 the electricity demand to operate wwtps will increase by more than 20 in the next 15 years in the developed countries contributing to climate change via greenhouse gas ghg emissions due to the use of fossil fuels in power plants 7 if the current trend continues natural resource depletion environmental degradation and subsequent economic expenditure will be intensified 2 6 therefore adoption of energy efficient treatment technologies is crucial for wwtps currently operating in cas configurations 8 the current challenges faced by the wastewater industry is motivating a great deal of research towards the development of alternate treatment layouts that reduce consumption of resources and ensure increased recycling and reuse of water nutrients and energy contained in the wastewater 5 some of the major position papers 9 11 published in the last decade studied alternative treatment schemes based on anaerobic technologies that are significant departures from the cas systems the anaerobic technologies can recover usable energy in the form of methane from organic carbon measured as chemical oxygen demand cod and are expected to be less energy intensive compared to aerobic processes due to the absence of aeration 12 to date the design of alternate wastewater treatment layouts has focused on combining sustainable treatment technologies and resource recovery processes and are mostly based on a two stage system known as the a b process 9 in a b processes the a stage is designed to maximize the capture of organic matter for anaerobic digestion prior to biological oxidation whereas the b stage is employed for nutrient removal 3 in an extensive literature review wan et al 11 argued that only three processes namely chemically enhanced primary treatment cept high rate activated sludge hras and anaerobic treatment may serve as a stage among the a stage processes anaerobic treatment has shown the greatest promise for organics measured as cod capture from wastewater 9 a single stage anaerobic process such as anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs can eliminate aeration reduce sludge production and convert organic carbon to methane for energy recovery 4 some of the critical challenges that this technology is facing include unreliable performance at low temperature and high concentration of soluble methane in reactor effluent however previous studies indicated that maintaining a high sludge concentration by efficient retention of suspended solids colloids and part of the soluble solids using microfiltration ultrafiltration membranes could ensure high quality effluent at low temperatures 13 improved soluble methane recovery was also demonstrated by using hollow fiber degassing membranes 14 17 several studies have also showed successful long term psychrophilic 20 c operation of the anmbr technology 14 18 20 autotrophic nitrogen n removal by anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria amx in partial nitritation anammox pn a process was identified as a suitable n removal option at the b stage 11 the pn a process combines the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite nitritation with subsequent anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process both nitritation and anammox are autotrophic processes that do not require organic carbon 21 at an energy cost of 1 2 kwh kgn 1 removed this process represents a 60 reduction in energy requirement compared to conventional biological nutrient removal bnr systems 22 while pn a technology in the side stream is at present state of the art 23 feasibility for implementation in the mainstream is still under investigation the major challenges are i presence of high cod n ratio leading to denitrifiers outcompeting amx ii stable nitritation which needs selective retention of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob over nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob iii sufficient accumulation of amx and iv strict temperature requirements 23 24 even with high levels of n and elevated temperatures typical for municipal sidestream treatment processes amx requires a doubling time of 15 30 days 25 26 this slow growth rate is an obstacle for mainstream implementation of deammonification due to the demands of reactor volume and biomass retention in general successful anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox operation depends on a balanced activity between aob amx and nob the anammox reactor and the treatment conditions i e dissolved oxygen temperature ph solids retention time should favor the retention of aob and amx as well as suppress the growth of nob so far biofilm based systems involving granules or biofilm carriers have been shown to be effective for amx retention 23 27 laureni et al 24 achieved stable nitritation and total n tn removal efficiency over 90 in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr operating at 15 c 24 among the emerging sustainable p removal processes polymeric anion exchanger impregnated with iron oxide nanoparticles has displayed significant sorption capacity for phosphate in several different studies 28 31 batstone et al 9 discussed the possibility of using polymeric anion exchangers impregnated with hydrated ferric oxide hfo for adsorptive p removal 31 at the b stage sengupta and pandit 31 demonstrated that this technology can selectively remove phosphate from a background of competing anions and reduce phosphate levels to 0 1 mg l p for up to 300 bed volumes bvs for an empty bed contact time ebct of 3 min while significant amount of research is currently being performed on the development of low energy sustainable technologies very little is still known as to how to incorporate such technologies in municipal wwtps batstone et al 9 and wan et al 11 reviewed the possibility of practical application of low energy treatment configurations however they do not focus on feasibility of full scale implementation considering a variety of environmental and operational conditions i e temperature cod concentration combined heat and power chp system efficiency aeration efficiency influent characteristics to date it is unclear whether the conversion of organic carbon to usable energy will be adequate for energy positive operation for a wide range of wastewater characteristics and climate and operational conditions municipal wastewater utilities typically encounter therefore the major goal of this present work is to assess the potential for implementation of energy positive treatment configurations in full scale municipal wwtps considering a wide range of environmental and operational conditions while simultaneously meeting a set of typical stringent effluent discharge guidelines tcod 50 mg l tn 3 mg ntot l and tp 1 mg l mandated by the united states environmental protection agency usepa and some state regulatory agencies 32 to achieve this a low energy treatment scheme consisting of fine screen pretreatment anmbr for biochemical oxygen demand bod and total suspended solids tss removal reactive filter media for adsorptive phosphorus p removal and cold pn a process for n removal was simulated using operational conditions that are typical for a wwtp in the us to investigate the feasibility of implementation the treatment scheme was compared to a reference conventional biological nutrient removal bnr configuration based on several performance indicators i e effluent quality production of energy production of residuals and operational energy consumption finally to identify solution space and potential challenges for energy self sufficient operations a sensitivity analysis was performed on four environmental and operational parameters namely temperature electrical efficiency of the chp system standard oxygen transfer efficiency sote and wastewater composition 2 methodology 2 1 construction of treatment process scenarios scenario 1 s1 represents the mainstream low energy treatment configuration proposed in this study fig 1 a the anmbr system consists of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor connected to submerged membrane tanks it also includes a sludge dewatering system for conditioning the resulting sludge a degassing membrane for capturing the dissolved methane in the effluent and a chp system enabling energy to be recovered from methane for nitrogen removal moving bed biofilm reactor was used to achieve effective retention and prolonged srt of amx biomass in our study for adsorptive p removal it was assumed that polymeric anion exchangers impregnated with iron would be used for reactive filtration scenario 2 s2 represented a variation of the modified university of cape town muct process bnr without the nitrate recycle in conjunction with sidestream sludge treatment fig 1b this system was selected to represent the conventional bnr configuration since the local nine springs wastewater treatment plant madison wi uses a similar configuration where nitrate reduction is not a requirement 33 the preliminary and primary treatment processes consist of grit tank and primary clarifier sedimentation tank in the sidestream waste activated sludge was and primary sludge ps were thickened and dewatered in a belt filter this process was coupled with mesophilic anaerobic digestion for solids stabilization and energy recovery via biogas combustion both treatment scenarios were constructed using a widely used process model simulating software biowin v 6 0 envirosim associates ltd canada biowin uses its proprietary activated sludge digestion model asdm which allows users to model different aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment processes without coupling additional models 34 the asdm model includes several processes which are divided into six main modules an activated sludge model an anaerobic digestion model settling models a chemical precipitation model a ph model and an aeration and gas transfer model 33 the individual modules are made up of a series of equations that describe the behavior of the system components based on fundamental laws that govern a process or transformations occurring as part of the process 35 to construct the equations mass balances and kinetics are performed on the specific set of basic system components termed as state variables e g soluble biodegradable organics particulate organic n biodegradable soluble organic p in mathematical modeling 36 37 the most recent versions of the biowin software v 5 6 also enables users to obtain a plant wide inventory of power demand and operating costs this particular process simulator was selected because of its prior successful application in full scale facility simulation in various studies 38 40 and capability of integrating user defined modules 2 2 integration of p removal module to simulate adsorptive p removal in biowin a model builder reactor element was used in conjunction with a solids removal unit iss cyclone the model builder feature allows users to set up their own module the module can then be applied on their own or in conjunction with other integrated process models in our study the adsorption process took place in the model builder element and the solids removal unit retained all the media in the system biowin s user defined variables ud4 and ud3 were used to represent adsorbed component and regenerating media respectively the solids removal unit was configured such that adsorbed p is selectively removed as inert suspended solids iss while the media are recycled back into the system 2 3 design approach and simulation both the treatment configurations were simulated under identical influent flowrate and characteristics to facilitate direct comparisons it was assumed that the facility is a mid sized u s wwtp with a capacity of 5 mgd average dry weather flow to establish the wastewater load characteristics the monthly average data for the time period of january 2010 to november 2015 were collected from the local nine springs wwtp madison wi the averaged data table 1 were introduced into biowin influent cod tkn and tp fractionation parameters were calculated from the nine spring s wwtp s collected data included in supplemental information table s1 these parameters are indicators of the wastewater strength and chemical composition the fractionation parameters help predict microorganism growth and the fate of pollutants within the model 35 2 3 1 scenario 1 membrane tanks were designed to represent ultrafiltration commercial hollow fiber membrane systems zeeweed 500 0 05 μm nominal pore size and 30 m2 nominal surface area as they have been used in several successful full scale implementations 41 eight trains of 15 cassettes each consisted of 25 hollow fiber modules the power and heat efficiency of the chp technology was approximately 35 11 to protect the membrane tank hollow fiber modules from clogging by fibrous materials mechanical fine screen with 1 mm mesh size was used for pretreatment it was assumed that 10 of the influent cod will be removed in the pretreatment process according to the typical values stated in the literature 42 43 the mbbrs were designed to be filled with plastic biofilm carriers k5 800 m2 m3 protective surface area at a biofilm media filling ratio of 50 the reactor was operated under micro aerobic conditions at 0 25 mgo2 l for anammox operation at 20 c laureni et al 24 showed that such a reactor could achieve stable suppression of nitrite oxidizing biomass for simulations it was assumed that the mbbr was seeded with enriched anaerobic ammonium oxidizing granular sludge with initial biomass concentration of 0 6 g l 1 on operating day 0 for p removal it was assumed that polymeric anionic exchangers impregnated with hfo would be used the maximum sorption capacity was assumed to be 23 mg p g of sorbent at ph of 7 when h2po4 is the dominant species 31 it was assumed that a packed column for an average ebct of 10 min would be used to attain a bv of 1000 prior to breakthrough 9 the energy requirement for the process including regeneration was assumed to be 0 1 kw h m3 as reported in batstone et al 9 tables 2 and 3 summarize the basic design and modeling parameters adopted for the construction and simulation of scenario s1 2 3 2 scenario 2 tank sizes and process parameters for the bnr system such as hrt srt were established according to the standards set forth in the water environment federation manual 44 summary of design parameters for the treatment configurations are listed in table 4 which provides the basic design and modeling parameters adopted for the construction and simulation of scenario s2 2 4 operational energy calculations the net operational energy requirement oer for scenario s1 is calculated according to the following eq 1 1 o e r w q a e r e c o v e r e d where w q and a represent mechanical heating and aeration energy demand respectively biogas production from anaerobic digestion ebiogas was included in the power calculations as a negative energy requirement for both of the scenarios the mechanical power requirement for the operation of anmbr was obtained from pretel et al 45 the electricity consumption for the aeration unit was calculated in biowin by assuming sote of 6 5 per meter of reactor depth based on values typically stated by vendors of fine bubble aeration diffusers 46 heating energy demand was calculated using the following eq 2 2 q f d c p t s e t p o i n t t i n where q is the heating energy consumption kwh day f is the volumetric influent flowrate m3 day d is density of water 1 kg l or 103 kg m3 cp is the specific heat capacity of water 0 001167 kw h kg c tsetpoint is the operational temperature of anmbr set to 20 c and tin is the wastewater temperature aeration pumping heating and mixing operations contributed to the total operational energy calculations in scenario s1 the design and operational parameters necessary for the energy calculations for scenario s1 are listed in table 4 for estimation of energy requirements in scenario s2 aeration in the oxic zone liquid mixing in the anoxic and anaerobic zone pumping of solids and mixing and heating for anaerobic sludge digestion unit were considered biowin aeration model was used to determine the oxygen transfer rate electricity consumption for the aeration unit was subsequently calculated by assuming a sote of 6 5 per meter of reactor depth based on values typically stated by vendors of fine bubble aeration diffusers 41 electricity consumption for all pumps was estimated from individual flow rate and the assumed pumping head hydraulic efficiency of pumps was estimated from standard curves with a motor efficiency of 95 40 the stirring power for liquid mixing in the anoxic and anaerobic zones was assumed to be 5 w m3 liquor 43 the amount of heat kwh required per wet metric ton 1000 kg of sludge during anaerobic digestion was calculated from the difference between the initial and desired temperatures multiplied by specific heat capacity of sludge with 6 solids content 1117 kwh kg deg c and the heat loss from the digester using available heat transfer coefficients 40 parameters relevant to process modeling and energy calculations are provided in the supplementary information section 2 5 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted for scenario s1 with respect to four factors electric efficiency of the chp system chpeff wastewater cod concentration sote sote m reactor depth and temperature tin the first three parameters were chosen to investigate the possibility of maximizing energy recovery in the a stage and minimizing energy requirement for nutrient removal in the b stage which is the primary objective in energy self sufficient a b systems 11 the fourth parameter temperature was selected as it is considered one of the major constraint for successful mainstream implementation of anaerobic treatment technologies 24 25 energy consumption and energy production were first calculated for the nominal values the current value of the input parameter of the factors and then at values 20 of nominal the normalized sensitivity coefficient sij is defined by the following eq 3 as a ratio of the percentage change in the factor yi due to a 20 change in the input variable xi 3 s i j δ y i y i δ x i x i for our analysis temperature ranged from 16 to 24 c total cod concentration ranged from 390 to 670 mg l electric efficiency of chp engine ranged from 35 to 45 and sote ranged from 5 5 8 5 the mean square sensitivity measure δ j m s q r as defined by brun et al 47 was calculated using the following eq 4 4 δ j m s q r 1 n i 1 n s i j 2 a higher value of δ j m s q r indicates that particular parameter has an important influence on the simulation results whereas the value of zero means that the simulation results do not depend on a particular parameter thus ranking parameters based on δ j m s q r in decreasing order provides a measure of a parameter s importance this analysis provides a direction for future research to develop energy positive operations for wastewater treatment systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 effluent quality the proposed treatment scenarios s1 and s2 could reliably achieve the typical effluent quality tcod 50 mg l tn 3 mg ntot l and tp 1 mg l specified in this study table 5 the removal efficiencies of tn tp and tcod in the effluent was 93 90 and 94 respectively a comparison of results from scenario s1 and scenario s2 shows that s1 performed remarkably well in tss removal in addition higher tn removal 17 was achieved in scenario s1 compared to scenario s2 mainly due to lower concentration of nitrate in the effluent the bnr configuration i e scenario s2 performed efficiently to convert ammonia n to oxidized n but the oxidized form was only partially removed due to the absence of a nitrate recycle stream as a result while 99 of ammonia n was removed the corresponding level was only 75 for tn 3 2 mass balance the mass fluxes for organic matter measured as cod n and p in the treatment systems are shown in fig 2 the organics expressed as cod mass balance in scenario s2 closely matches with the cod mass flow in domestic wwtp presented in wan et al 11 which validates our simulation results in scenario s1 the anmbr system removed about 77 of the influent organic matter measured as cod from pretreated wastewater which was subsequently used for biogas generation as can be seen from the simulation results 55 of the removed organic matter measured as cod could be converted to methane through anaerobic digestion scenario s1 fig 2b whereas only 37 of the organic matter measured as cod could be recovered as methane in scenario s2 fig 2c the pretreatment and anmbr operation removed about 80 of the influent organics measured as cod producing a stream that is ideal for mainstream deammonification while this amount of reduction in cod concentration is not sufficient to meet the discharge standards tcod 50 mg l the subsequent mbbr operation in the deammonification unit reduced the effluent cod concentration to 6 of influent cod only minimal amounts of n 6 and p 14 were removed by the anmbr operation about 73 of the influent n was removed and converted into n2 gas in the anammox operation on the other hand the bnr system removed 53 of the influent n as n2 gas in scenario s2 therefore scenario s2 where 22 of the influent n was incorporated in biosolids had a greater potential for recycling n through land application compared to scenario s1 the simulation results show that the scenario s1 configuration can be expected to remove about 90 2 of the influent p sengupta and pandit 29 demonstrated that the p removed by adsorptive filtration 69 in our study could be recovered as solid phase fertilizer upon the addition of calcium or magnesium salt after regeneration of the anion exchanger a total of 86 p removed in the bnr process scenario s2 was incorporated into the wasted sludge about 10 and 14 of the influent p ended up in the effluent in scenario s1 and scenario s2 respectively 3 3 energy production the extent of energy recovery is dependent on the ability to maximize the capture of organics measured as cod for digestion instead of transforming it to co2 during biological oxidation in our reference cas treatment scheme scenario s2 a significant portion of the incoming cod 30 was utilized in heterotrophic denitrification which reduced cod availability for energy recovery the chemical energy recovered from 1 g of wastewater cod in scenario s2 was about 1 80 kj g cod considering 13 9 kj of chemical energy stored in 1 g of cod methane 11 this value represents about 56 of the total electrical energy required to remove 1 g of cod from wastewater i e 3 2 kj g cod on the other hand the recovered chemical energy per gram of cod was 2 77 kj in scenario s1 indicating that the mainstream anaerobic configuration scenario s1 was about 30 more energy efficient than the conventional bnr system s2 3 4 sludge production the treatment of excess sludge generated at wastewater treatment plants is an economical issue and may account for 25 60 of the total plant operating cost 48 our proposed scenario s1 reduced the sludge production by about 49 compared to scenario s2 1257 25 kg day vs 2525 kg day the reduction in sludge production in scenario s1 was mainly due to the capture of a substantial portion of cod for biogas generation that would otherwise end up in wasted sludge in addition only about 10 of the influent p ended up in wasted sludge this reduction in biosolids p content might have a secondary benefit from a biosolids management point of view since high soil p content of agricultural lands often limits the use of biosolids as fertilizer 3 5 operational energy requirement simulation results predict an aeration energy consumption of 0 22 kw h per m3 of wastewater for the reference cas system table 6 which matches with the value reported by mccarty et al 10 of 0 3 kw h per m3 this comparison provides additional validation of our configuration assessment table 6 also shows that the total energy consumption in scenario s1 was much lower than that of scenario s2 i e 0 32 vs 0 70 kw h per m3 of wastewater this substantially lower energy consumption is mainly attributable to reduced aeration needs for scenario s1 the amount of recovered energy in scenario s1 was about 38 higher than that of scenario s2 consequently the net operational energy requirement for scenario s1 and scenario s2 are 0 03 and 0 49 kw h per m3 respectively table 6 3 6 sensitivity analysis table 7 presents the values of the mean square sensitivity coefficients δ j m s q r in terms of energy consumption and energy production for scenario s1 these coefficients were obtained after 20 variations of temperature δtemperature wastewater cod concentrations δcod electric efficiency of chp engine δchpeff and sote δsote from the nominal values as can be seen from table 7 the maximum impact on net energy requirement was observed from a 20 variation in temperature this was due to the fact most of the anaerobic processes used in the treatment configuration are more efficient at higher temperatures 49 so heating is necessary for successful operation however variation of temperature did not appear to have substantial influence on aeration requirement and biogas generation another important parameter impacting net energy requirement is electric efficiency of the chp engine as it influenced the energy recovery the impact of varying sote is minor compared to changes in temperature indicating that the energy use associated with aeration is small in the overall system compared to other energy uses the simulation results on aeration energy requirement biogas production and net energy requirement were also sensitive to changes in cod concentration to further illustrate the results from sensitivity analysis the heating energy aeration energy total energy consumption and energy recovery values were plotted in fig 3 these graphs may be helpful for determining the solution space for which energy self sufficiency would be achieved as can be seen the heating energy requirement increased sharply at temperatures below 20 c fig 3a this was primarily due to the high wastewater flowrate in mainstream of the treatment plant that makes heating a very energy intensive process similar results were not observed for temperatures above 20 c since the reactor temperature for anmbr and anammox operation was set to 20 c these results suggest that successful full scale implementation of the proposed treatment scheme in cold climate regions will be largely dependent on ability to conduct the anaerobic processes i e anmbr anammox at low temperatures although not yet applied in practice in full scale systems a few studies 13 24 provided evidence of successful anammox operation in dilute streams at temperatures as low as 12 15 c fig 3b also shows that when total cod increased by 20 the biogas production increased by 14 so the net energy requirement for treatment decreased as temperature increased the proposed treatment scheme reached a break even point i e energy recovered from biogas can be used to meet the total energy requirements for treatment at about 544 mg cod l fig 3b this cod concentration is about 7 higher than the average influent cod concentration of the local municipal wastewater treatment plant and very close to the maximum concentration measured in the five year sampling period table 1 in bnr systems diverting various types of organic waste materials or food waste primarily fats oil and grease to anaerobic digesters used for wastewater treatment has been helpful to increase cod loading and achieve energy self sufficiency the east bay municipal utility district ebmud in california started co digesting post consumer food waste in 2002 in 2012 the plant became the first energy self sufficient wastewater treatment plant in north america 50 food waste consists of three main organic components carbohydrates proteins and lipids the volatile solids to total solids vs ts ratios typically range from 80 to 97 51 therefore significant variations in digestion performance could occur during biological conversion processes parry 52 characterized six different types of organic waste materials i e cheese whey chicken waste restaurant grease canola oil biodiesel glycerin ethanol stillage to identify how they can complement traditional wastewater solids by balancing out organics and nutrient contents for co digestion according to reported measurements the total cod concentration for different types of organic waste materials varied between 68 g l to 1790 g l the 5 day biological energy conversion bec5 indicates that all organic wastes are readily converted to biogas compared to wastewater solids and can be used as good co digestion feedstock 52 co digestion of organic feedstock with wastewater solids might also be useful in mainstream anaerobic treatment configuration for energy positive operation however maintaining an ideal cod n ratio for successful anammox operation is one of the main challenges for such configurations so the possibility of co digestion in mainstream anaerobic treatment configuration needs further investigation fig 3b indicates that a change in sote from 6 5 8 5 could reduce the aeration energy requirements by 70 which would help the configuration save more operational energy however the reduction in aeration energy was not sufficient to achieve an energy positive operation as it could not generate more energy than that is necessary to satisfy the requirements of the wastewater treatment plant also fig 3d shows that boosting the electrical efficiency of chp engine from 35 to 38 should recover more energy onsite than the total requirements for wastewater treatment this would present an excellent opportunity for energy self sufficiency to treatment plants where co digestion is not an option the strass wastewater treatment plant in austria was successful in adopting this approach with several individual attempts of optimization and installation of high efficiency state of the art chp technology the plant turned itself into an energy independent facility 53 among the most applied chp technologies fuel cells and reciprocating engines operate between 35 43 electrical efficiency some other less electrically efficient chp technologies include gas 24 35 steam 24 28 and microturbines 5 7 54 overall our analysis shows that a treatment configuration incorporating anaerobic processes in the mainstream scenario s1 has great potential to transform municipal wwtps into energy self sufficient systems the electrical efficiency of chp engine and higher cod concentration required to achieve energy positive operations are within realistic and achievable ranges 3 7 significance for the design and operation of energy positive wwtps to develop robust long range plans a utility must understand its existing facility operations its underlying strengths and weaknesses and the most pressing needs and opportunities for change this study has evaluated an emerging mainstream anaerobic treatment scheme that offers the possibility to overcome some of the major challenges e g higher resource consumption large amount of residuals that utilities are facing today while simultaneously achieving effluent target goals the results from the sensitivity analysis would help identify potential challenges for energy positive operation in full scale implementation and facilitate development of operational strategies to overcome them we believe that our advanced mathematical modeling based analysis can support various decision making steps required for utilities to meet the paradigm of sustainable wastewater treatment by using our evaluation procedure other alternative configurations could also be potentially designed and assessed to select the most promising treatment train to accommodate a wide variety of wastewater characteristics and climatic conditions 4 conclusions this study used advanced mathematical modeling to investigate a promising mainstream anaerobic treatment configuration consisting of anmbr cold partial nitritation anammox and adsorptive p removal the net energy requirement for the proposed configuration 0 03 kwh m3 is significantly lower compared to that needed for a reference cas plant 0 49 kw h m3 determination of solution space for energy self sufficiency indicated that the proposed treatment scheme could reach a breakeven point at 544 mg l cod and 38 electric efficiency of the chp engine both engine efficiency upgrades and elevated influent cod levels to increase biogas production are required to ensure energy positive municipal wastewater treatment thus co digestion of high strength waste with municipal sludge can provide significant benefits a comprehensive analysis focusing on capital and operational costs redistribution for the proposed configuration versus a conventional cas plant would provide additional insights into the prospects of energy positive wastewater treatment operations declaration of

wastewater treatment plants wwtps typically employ conventional activated sludge cas systems that require extensive energy input and produce large amount of residuals 1 2 the operational energy consumption of cas plants generally ranges from 0 3 to 0 6 kw h m3 of which about 50 is used for aeration 3 in addition most of the energy contained in the wastewater is used by aerobic mineralization during treatment leaving behind limited amount available for recovery 4 in the united states wastewater treatment consumes approximately 4 of the nation s electricity demands 75 billion kwh 5 the electricity cost to deliver safe drinking water and to ensure effective wastewater treatment is about 7 5 billion annually 6 over the next 20 years the us wastewater infrastructure will require a huge investment of 300 billion for upgrades due to rapid population growth aging infrastructure deterioration of surface waters resulting from excess nutrient loading and a reliance on energy intensive treatment processes 5 the electricity demand to operate wwtps will increase by more than 20 in the next 15 years in the developed countries contributing to climate change via greenhouse gas ghg emissions due to the use of fossil fuels in power plants 7 if the current trend continues natural resource depletion environmental degradation and subsequent economic expenditure will be intensified 2 6 therefore adoption of energy efficient treatment technologies is crucial for wwtps currently operating in cas configurations 8 the current challenges faced by the wastewater industry is motivating a great deal of research towards the development of alternate treatment layouts that reduce consumption of resources and ensure increased recycling and reuse of water nutrients and energy contained in the wastewater 5 some of the major position papers 9 11 published in the last decade studied alternative treatment schemes based on anaerobic technologies that are significant departures from the cas systems the anaerobic technologies can recover usable energy in the form of methane from organic carbon measured as chemical oxygen demand cod and are expected to be less energy intensive compared to aerobic processes due to the absence of aeration 12 to date the design of alternate wastewater treatment layouts has focused on combining sustainable treatment technologies and resource recovery processes and are mostly based on a two stage system known as the a b process 9 in a b processes the a stage is designed to maximize the capture of organic matter for anaerobic digestion prior to biological oxidation whereas the b stage is employed for nutrient removal 3 in an extensive literature review wan et al 11 argued that only three processes namely chemically enhanced primary treatment cept high rate activated sludge hras and anaerobic treatment may serve as a stage among the a stage processes anaerobic treatment has shown the greatest promise for organics measured as cod capture from wastewater 9 a single stage anaerobic process such as anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs can eliminate aeration reduce sludge production and convert organic carbon to methane for energy recovery 4 some of the critical challenges that this technology is facing include unreliable performance at low temperature and high concentration of soluble methane in reactor effluent however previous studies indicated that maintaining a high sludge concentration by efficient retention of suspended solids colloids and part of the soluble solids using microfiltration ultrafiltration membranes could ensure high quality effluent at low temperatures 13 improved soluble methane recovery was also demonstrated by using hollow fiber degassing membranes 14 17 several studies have also showed successful long term psychrophilic 20 c operation of the anmbr technology 14 18 20 autotrophic nitrogen n removal by anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria amx in partial nitritation anammox pn a process was identified as a suitable n removal option at the b stage 11 the pn a process combines the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite nitritation with subsequent anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process both nitritation and anammox are autotrophic processes that do not require organic carbon 21 at an energy cost of 1 2 kwh kgn 1 removed this process represents a 60 reduction in energy requirement compared to conventional biological nutrient removal bnr systems 22 while pn a technology in the side stream is at present state of the art 23 feasibility for implementation in the mainstream is still under investigation the major challenges are i presence of high cod n ratio leading to denitrifiers outcompeting amx ii stable nitritation which needs selective retention of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob over nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob iii sufficient accumulation of amx and iv strict temperature requirements 23 24 even with high levels of n and elevated temperatures typical for municipal sidestream treatment processes amx requires a doubling time of 15 30 days 25 26 this slow growth rate is an obstacle for mainstream implementation of deammonification due to the demands of reactor volume and biomass retention in general successful anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox operation depends on a balanced activity between aob amx and nob the anammox reactor and the treatment conditions i e dissolved oxygen temperature ph solids retention time should favor the retention of aob and amx as well as suppress the growth of nob so far biofilm based systems involving granules or biofilm carriers have been shown to be effective for amx retention 23 27 laureni et al 24 achieved stable nitritation and total n tn removal efficiency over 90 in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr operating at 15 c 24 among the emerging sustainable p removal processes polymeric anion exchanger impregnated with iron oxide nanoparticles has displayed significant sorption capacity for phosphate in several different studies 28 31 batstone et al 9 discussed the possibility of using polymeric anion exchangers impregnated with hydrated ferric oxide hfo for adsorptive p removal 31 at the b stage sengupta and pandit 31 demonstrated that this technology can selectively remove phosphate from a background of competing anions and reduce phosphate levels to 0 1 mg l p for up to 300 bed volumes bvs for an empty bed contact time ebct of 3 min while significant amount of research is currently being performed on the development of low energy sustainable technologies very little is still known as to how to incorporate such technologies in municipal wwtps batstone et al 9 and wan et al 11 reviewed the possibility of practical application of low energy treatment configurations however they do not focus on feasibility of full scale implementation considering a variety of environmental and operational conditions i e temperature cod concentration combined heat and power chp system efficiency aeration efficiency influent characteristics to date it is unclear whether the conversion of organic carbon to usable energy will be adequate for energy positive operation for a wide range of wastewater characteristics and climate and operational conditions municipal wastewater utilities typically encounter therefore the major goal of this present work is to assess the potential for implementation of energy positive treatment configurations in full scale municipal wwtps considering a wide range of environmental and operational conditions while simultaneously meeting a set of typical stringent effluent discharge guidelines tcod 50 mg l tn 3 mg ntot l and tp 1 mg l mandated by the united states environmental protection agency usepa and some state regulatory agencies 32 to achieve this a low energy treatment scheme consisting of fine screen pretreatment anmbr for biochemical oxygen demand bod and total suspended solids tss removal reactive filter media for adsorptive phosphorus p removal and cold pn a process for n removal was simulated using operational conditions that are typical for a wwtp in the us to investigate the feasibility of implementation the treatment scheme was compared to a reference conventional biological nutrient removal bnr configuration based on several performance indicators i e effluent quality production of energy production of residuals and operational energy consumption finally to identify solution space and potential challenges for energy self sufficient operations a sensitivity analysis was performed on four environmental and operational parameters namely temperature electrical efficiency of the chp system standard oxygen transfer efficiency sote and wastewater composition 2 methodology 2 1 construction of treatment process scenarios scenario 1 s1 represents the mainstream low energy treatment configuration proposed in this study fig 1 a the anmbr system consists of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor connected to submerged membrane tanks it also includes a sludge dewatering system for conditioning the resulting sludge a degassing membrane for capturing the dissolved methane in the effluent and a chp system enabling energy to be recovered from methane for nitrogen removal moving bed biofilm reactor was used to achieve effective retention and prolonged srt of amx biomass in our study for adsorptive p removal it was assumed that polymeric anion exchangers impregnated with iron would be used for reactive filtration scenario 2 s2 represented a variation of the modified university of cape town muct process bnr without the nitrate recycle in conjunction with sidestream sludge treatment fig 1b this system was selected to represent the conventional bnr configuration since the local nine springs wastewater treatment plant madison wi uses a similar configuration where nitrate reduction is not a requirement 33 the preliminary and primary treatment processes consist of grit tank and primary clarifier sedimentation tank in the sidestream waste activated sludge was and primary sludge ps were thickened and dewatered in a belt filter this process was coupled with mesophilic anaerobic digestion for solids stabilization and energy recovery via biogas combustion both treatment scenarios were constructed using a widely used process model simulating software biowin v 6 0 envirosim associates ltd canada biowin uses its proprietary activated sludge digestion model asdm which allows users to model different aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment processes without coupling additional models 34 the asdm model includes several processes which are divided into six main modules an activated sludge model an anaerobic digestion model settling models a chemical precipitation model a ph model and an aeration and gas transfer model 33 the individual modules are made up of a series of equations that describe the behavior of the system components based on fundamental laws that govern a process or transformations occurring as part of the process 35 to construct the equations mass balances and kinetics are performed on the specific set of basic system components termed as state variables e g soluble biodegradable organics particulate organic n biodegradable soluble organic p in mathematical modeling 36 37 the most recent versions of the biowin software v 5 6 also enables users to obtain a plant wide inventory of power demand and operating costs this particular process simulator was selected because of its prior successful application in full scale facility simulation in various studies 38 40 and capability of integrating user defined modules 2 2 integration of p removal module to simulate adsorptive p removal in biowin a model builder reactor element was used in conjunction with a solids removal unit iss cyclone the model builder feature allows users to set up their own module the module can then be applied on their own or in conjunction with other integrated process models in our study the adsorption process took place in the model builder element and the solids removal unit retained all the media in the system biowin s user defined variables ud4 and ud3 were used to represent adsorbed component and regenerating media respectively the solids removal unit was configured such that adsorbed p is selectively removed as inert suspended solids iss while the media are recycled back into the system 2 3 design approach and simulation both the treatment configurations were simulated under identical influent flowrate and characteristics to facilitate direct comparisons it was assumed that the facility is a mid sized u s wwtp with a capacity of 5 mgd average dry weather flow to establish the wastewater load characteristics the monthly average data for the time period of january 2010 to november 2015 were collected from the local nine springs wwtp madison wi the averaged data table 1 were introduced into biowin influent cod tkn and tp fractionation parameters were calculated from the nine spring s wwtp s collected data included in supplemental information table s1 these parameters are indicators of the wastewater strength and chemical composition the fractionation parameters help predict microorganism growth and the fate of pollutants within the model 35 2 3 1 scenario 1 membrane tanks were designed to represent ultrafiltration commercial hollow fiber membrane systems zeeweed 500 0 05 μm nominal pore size and 30 m2 nominal surface area as they have been used in several successful full scale implementations 41 eight trains of 15 cassettes each consisted of 25 hollow fiber modules the power and heat efficiency of the chp technology was approximately 35 11 to protect the membrane tank hollow fiber modules from clogging by fibrous materials mechanical fine screen with 1 mm mesh size was used for pretreatment it was assumed that 10 of the influent cod will be removed in the pretreatment process according to the typical values stated in the literature 42 43 the mbbrs were designed to be filled with plastic biofilm carriers k5 800 m2 m3 protective surface area at a biofilm media filling ratio of 50 the reactor was operated under micro aerobic conditions at 0 25 mgo2 l for anammox operation at 20 c laureni et al 24 showed that such a reactor could achieve stable suppression of nitrite oxidizing biomass for simulations it was assumed that the mbbr was seeded with enriched anaerobic ammonium oxidizing granular sludge with initial biomass concentration of 0 6 g l 1 on operating day 0 for p removal it was assumed that polymeric anionic exchangers impregnated with hfo would be used the maximum sorption capacity was assumed to be 23 mg p g of sorbent at ph of 7 when h2po4 is the dominant species 31 it was assumed that a packed column for an average ebct of 10 min would be used to attain a bv of 1000 prior to breakthrough 9 the energy requirement for the process including regeneration was assumed to be 0 1 kw h m3 as reported in batstone et al 9 tables 2 and 3 summarize the basic design and modeling parameters adopted for the construction and simulation of scenario s1 2 3 2 scenario 2 tank sizes and process parameters for the bnr system such as hrt srt were established according to the standards set forth in the water environment federation manual 44 summary of design parameters for the treatment configurations are listed in table 4 which provides the basic design and modeling parameters adopted for the construction and simulation of scenario s2 2 4 operational energy calculations the net operational energy requirement oer for scenario s1 is calculated according to the following eq 1 1 o e r w q a e r e c o v e r e d where w q and a represent mechanical heating and aeration energy demand respectively biogas production from anaerobic digestion ebiogas was included in the power calculations as a negative energy requirement for both of the scenarios the mechanical power requirement for the operation of anmbr was obtained from pretel et al 45 the electricity consumption for the aeration unit was calculated in biowin by assuming sote of 6 5 per meter of reactor depth based on values typically stated by vendors of fine bubble aeration diffusers 46 heating energy demand was calculated using the following eq 2 2 q f d c p t s e t p o i n t t i n where q is the heating energy consumption kwh day f is the volumetric influent flowrate m3 day d is density of water 1 kg l or 103 kg m3 cp is the specific heat capacity of water 0 001167 kw h kg c tsetpoint is the operational temperature of anmbr set to 20 c and tin is the wastewater temperature aeration pumping heating and mixing operations contributed to the total operational energy calculations in scenario s1 the design and operational parameters necessary for the energy calculations for scenario s1 are listed in table 4 for estimation of energy requirements in scenario s2 aeration in the oxic zone liquid mixing in the anoxic and anaerobic zone pumping of solids and mixing and heating for anaerobic sludge digestion unit were considered biowin aeration model was used to determine the oxygen transfer rate electricity consumption for the aeration unit was subsequently calculated by assuming a sote of 6 5 per meter of reactor depth based on values typically stated by vendors of fine bubble aeration diffusers 41 electricity consumption for all pumps was estimated from individual flow rate and the assumed pumping head hydraulic efficiency of pumps was estimated from standard curves with a motor efficiency of 95 40 the stirring power for liquid mixing in the anoxic and anaerobic zones was assumed to be 5 w m3 liquor 43 the amount of heat kwh required per wet metric ton 1000 kg of sludge during anaerobic digestion was calculated from the difference between the initial and desired temperatures multiplied by specific heat capacity of sludge with 6 solids content 1117 kwh kg deg c and the heat loss from the digester using available heat transfer coefficients 40 parameters relevant to process modeling and energy calculations are provided in the supplementary information section 2 5 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted for scenario s1 with respect to four factors electric efficiency of the chp system chpeff wastewater cod concentration sote sote m reactor depth and temperature tin the first three parameters were chosen to investigate the possibility of maximizing energy recovery in the a stage and minimizing energy requirement for nutrient removal in the b stage which is the primary objective in energy self sufficient a b systems 11 the fourth parameter temperature was selected as it is considered one of the major constraint for successful mainstream implementation of anaerobic treatment technologies 24 25 energy consumption and energy production were first calculated for the nominal values the current value of the input parameter of the factors and then at values 20 of nominal the normalized sensitivity coefficient sij is defined by the following eq 3 as a ratio of the percentage change in the factor yi due to a 20 change in the input variable xi 3 s i j δ y i y i δ x i x i for our analysis temperature ranged from 16 to 24 c total cod concentration ranged from 390 to 670 mg l electric efficiency of chp engine ranged from 35 to 45 and sote ranged from 5 5 8 5 the mean square sensitivity measure δ j m s q r as defined by brun et al 47 was calculated using the following eq 4 4 δ j m s q r 1 n i 1 n s i j 2 a higher value of δ j m s q r indicates that particular parameter has an important influence on the simulation results whereas the value of zero means that the simulation results do not depend on a particular parameter thus ranking parameters based on δ j m s q r in decreasing order provides a measure of a parameter s importance this analysis provides a direction for future research to develop energy positive operations for wastewater treatment systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 effluent quality the proposed treatment scenarios s1 and s2 could reliably achieve the typical effluent quality tcod 50 mg l tn 3 mg ntot l and tp 1 mg l specified in this study table 5 the removal efficiencies of tn tp and tcod in the effluent was 93 90 and 94 respectively a comparison of results from scenario s1 and scenario s2 shows that s1 performed remarkably well in tss removal in addition higher tn removal 17 was achieved in scenario s1 compared to scenario s2 mainly due to lower concentration of nitrate in the effluent the bnr configuration i e scenario s2 performed efficiently to convert ammonia n to oxidized n but the oxidized form was only partially removed due to the absence of a nitrate recycle stream as a result while 99 of ammonia n was removed the corresponding level was only 75 for tn 3 2 mass balance the mass fluxes for organic matter measured as cod n and p in the treatment systems are shown in fig 2 the organics expressed as cod mass balance in scenario s2 closely matches with the cod mass flow in domestic wwtp presented in wan et al 11 which validates our simulation results in scenario s1 the anmbr system removed about 77 of the influent organic matter measured as cod from pretreated wastewater which was subsequently used for biogas generation as can be seen from the simulation results 55 of the removed organic matter measured as cod could be converted to methane through anaerobic digestion scenario s1 fig 2b whereas only 37 of the organic matter measured as cod could be recovered as methane in scenario s2 fig 2c the pretreatment and anmbr operation removed about 80 of the influent organics measured as cod producing a stream that is ideal for mainstream deammonification while this amount of reduction in cod concentration is not sufficient to meet the discharge standards tcod 50 mg l the subsequent mbbr operation in the deammonification unit reduced the effluent cod concentration to 6 of influent cod only minimal amounts of n 6 and p 14 were removed by the anmbr operation about 73 of the influent n was removed and converted into n2 gas in the anammox operation on the other hand the bnr system removed 53 of the influent n as n2 gas in scenario s2 therefore scenario s2 where 22 of the influent n was incorporated in biosolids had a greater potential for recycling n through land application compared to scenario s1 the simulation results show that the scenario s1 configuration can be expected to remove about 90 2 of the influent p sengupta and pandit 29 demonstrated that the p removed by adsorptive filtration 69 in our study could be recovered as solid phase fertilizer upon the addition of calcium or magnesium salt after regeneration of the anion exchanger a total of 86 p removed in the bnr process scenario s2 was incorporated into the wasted sludge about 10 and 14 of the influent p ended up in the effluent in scenario s1 and scenario s2 respectively 3 3 energy production the extent of energy recovery is dependent on the ability to maximize the capture of organics measured as cod for digestion instead of transforming it to co2 during biological oxidation in our reference cas treatment scheme scenario s2 a significant portion of the incoming cod 30 was utilized in heterotrophic denitrification which reduced cod availability for energy recovery the chemical energy recovered from 1 g of wastewater cod in scenario s2 was about 1 80 kj g cod considering 13 9 kj of chemical energy stored in 1 g of cod methane 11 this value represents about 56 of the total electrical energy required to remove 1 g of cod from wastewater i e 3 2 kj g cod on the other hand the recovered chemical energy per gram of cod was 2 77 kj in scenario s1 indicating that the mainstream anaerobic configuration scenario s1 was about 30 more energy efficient than the conventional bnr system s2 3 4 sludge production the treatment of excess sludge generated at wastewater treatment plants is an economical issue and may account for 25 60 of the total plant operating cost 48 our proposed scenario s1 reduced the sludge production by about 49 compared to scenario s2 1257 25 kg day vs 2525 kg day the reduction in sludge production in scenario s1 was mainly due to the capture of a substantial portion of cod for biogas generation that would otherwise end up in wasted sludge in addition only about 10 of the influent p ended up in wasted sludge this reduction in biosolids p content might have a secondary benefit from a biosolids management point of view since high soil p content of agricultural lands often limits the use of biosolids as fertilizer 3 5 operational energy requirement simulation results predict an aeration energy consumption of 0 22 kw h per m3 of wastewater for the reference cas system table 6 which matches with the value reported by mccarty et al 10 of 0 3 kw h per m3 this comparison provides additional validation of our configuration assessment table 6 also shows that the total energy consumption in scenario s1 was much lower than that of scenario s2 i e 0 32 vs 0 70 kw h per m3 of wastewater this substantially lower energy consumption is mainly attributable to reduced aeration needs for scenario s1 the amount of recovered energy in scenario s1 was about 38 higher than that of scenario s2 consequently the net operational energy requirement for scenario s1 and scenario s2 are 0 03 and 0 49 kw h per m3 respectively table 6 3 6 sensitivity analysis table 7 presents the values of the mean square sensitivity coefficients δ j m s q r in terms of energy consumption and energy production for scenario s1 these coefficients were obtained after 20 variations of temperature δtemperature wastewater cod concentrations δcod electric efficiency of chp engine δchpeff and sote δsote from the nominal values as can be seen from table 7 the maximum impact on net energy requirement was observed from a 20 variation in temperature this was due to the fact most of the anaerobic processes used in the treatment configuration are more efficient at higher temperatures 49 so heating is necessary for successful operation however variation of temperature did not appear to have substantial influence on aeration requirement and biogas generation another important parameter impacting net energy requirement is electric efficiency of the chp engine as it influenced the energy recovery the impact of varying sote is minor compared to changes in temperature indicating that the energy use associated with aeration is small in the overall system compared to other energy uses the simulation results on aeration energy requirement biogas production and net energy requirement were also sensitive to changes in cod concentration to further illustrate the results from sensitivity analysis the heating energy aeration energy total energy consumption and energy recovery values were plotted in fig 3 these graphs may be helpful for determining the solution space for which energy self sufficiency would be achieved as can be seen the heating energy requirement increased sharply at temperatures below 20 c fig 3a this was primarily due to the high wastewater flowrate in mainstream of the treatment plant that makes heating a very energy intensive process similar results were not observed for temperatures above 20 c since the reactor temperature for anmbr and anammox operation was set to 20 c these results suggest that successful full scale implementation of the proposed treatment scheme in cold climate regions will be largely dependent on ability to conduct the anaerobic processes i e anmbr anammox at low temperatures although not yet applied in practice in full scale systems a few studies 13 24 provided evidence of successful anammox operation in dilute streams at temperatures as low as 12 15 c fig 3b also shows that when total cod increased by 20 the biogas production increased by 14 so the net energy requirement for treatment decreased as temperature increased the proposed treatment scheme reached a break even point i e energy recovered from biogas can be used to meet the total energy requirements for treatment at about 544 mg cod l fig 3b this cod concentration is about 7 higher than the average influent cod concentration of the local municipal wastewater treatment plant and very close to the maximum concentration measured in the five year sampling period table 1 in bnr systems diverting various types of organic waste materials or food waste primarily fats oil and grease to anaerobic digesters used for wastewater treatment has been helpful to increase cod loading and achieve energy self sufficiency the east bay municipal utility district ebmud in california started co digesting post consumer food waste in 2002 in 2012 the plant became the first energy self sufficient wastewater treatment plant in north america 50 food waste consists of three main organic components carbohydrates proteins and lipids the volatile solids to total solids vs ts ratios typically range from 80 to 97 51 therefore significant variations in digestion performance could occur during biological conversion processes parry 52 characterized six different types of organic waste materials i e cheese whey chicken waste restaurant grease canola oil biodiesel glycerin ethanol stillage to identify how they can complement traditional wastewater solids by balancing out organics and nutrient contents for co digestion according to reported measurements the total cod concentration for different types of organic waste materials varied between 68 g l to 1790 g l the 5 day biological energy conversion bec5 indicates that all organic wastes are readily converted to biogas compared to wastewater solids and can be used as good co digestion feedstock 52 co digestion of organic feedstock with wastewater solids might also be useful in mainstream anaerobic treatment configuration for energy positive operation however maintaining an ideal cod n ratio for successful anammox operation is one of the main challenges for such configurations so the possibility of co digestion in mainstream anaerobic treatment configuration needs further investigation fig 3b indicates that a change in sote from 6 5 8 5 could reduce the aeration energy requirements by 70 which would help the configuration save more operational energy however the reduction in aeration energy was not sufficient to achieve an energy positive operation as it could not generate more energy than that is necessary to satisfy the requirements of the wastewater treatment plant also fig 3d shows that boosting the electrical efficiency of chp engine from 35 to 38 should recover more energy onsite than the total requirements for wastewater treatment this would present an excellent opportunity for energy self sufficiency to treatment plants where co digestion is not an option the strass wastewater treatment plant in austria was successful in adopting this approach with several individual attempts of optimization and installation of high efficiency state of the art chp technology the plant turned itself into an energy independent facility 53 among the most applied chp technologies fuel cells and reciprocating engines operate between 35 43 electrical efficiency some other less electrically efficient chp technologies include gas 24 35 steam 24 28 and microturbines 5 7 54 overall our analysis shows that a treatment configuration incorporating anaerobic processes in the mainstream scenario s1 has great potential to transform municipal wwtps into energy self sufficient systems the electrical efficiency of chp engine and higher cod concentration required to achieve energy positive operations are within realistic and achievable ranges 3 7 significance for the design and operation of energy positive wwtps to develop robust long range plans a utility must understand its existing facility operations its underlying strengths and weaknesses and the most pressing needs and opportunities for change this study has evaluated an emerging mainstream anaerobic treatment scheme that offers the possibility to overcome some of the major challenges e g higher resource consumption large amount of residuals that utilities are facing today while simultaneously achieving effluent target goals the results from the sensitivity analysis would help identify potential challenges for energy positive operation in full scale implementation and facilitate development of operational strategies to overcome them we believe that our advanced mathematical modeling based analysis can support various decision making steps required for utilities to meet the paradigm of sustainable wastewater treatment by using our evaluation procedure other alternative configurations could also be potentially designed and assessed to select the most promising treatment train to accommodate a wide variety of wastewater characteristics and climatic conditions 4 conclusions this study used advanced mathematical modeling to investigate a promising mainstream anaerobic treatment configuration consisting of anmbr cold partial nitritation anammox and adsorptive p removal the net energy requirement for the proposed configuration 0 03 kwh m3 is significantly lower compared to that needed for a reference cas plant 0 49 kw h m3 determination of solution space for energy self sufficiency indicated that the proposed treatment scheme could reach a breakeven point at 544 mg l cod and 38 electric efficiency of the chp engine both engine efficiency upgrades and elevated influent cod levels to increase biogas production are required to ensure energy positive municipal wastewater treatment thus co digestion of high strength waste with municipal sludge can provide significant benefits a comprehensive analysis focusing on capital and operational costs redistribution for the proposed configuration versus a conventional cas plant would provide additional insights into the prospects of energy positive wastewater treatment operations declaration of

13601,this study aimed to investigate the adsorption performance of a macroalgae based biocomposite as a biosorbent of water soluble hydrocarbons wsh like btexn benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene on packed bed columns the effects of the inlet flow rate 0 3 1 1 ml min using naphthalene as a model were analyzed and the operation parameters are described the registered breakthrough volume increased from 12 to 52 ml at an ebct of 4 and 20 min respectively the breakthrough curves profiles of the competitive biosorption of btexn were modeled by five well accepted dynamic adsorption models known as thomas clark dose response bdst and yoon nelson the biocomposite swelling degree and the external mass transfer limitations are the main factors influencing the adsorption process at different inlet fluxes a result that was corroborated by the linearized yoon nelson model in the case of multicomponent systems the hydrocarbon hydrophobicity determined the

as process water i e the wastewater generated during petroleum and gas extraction and oil spillages 2 in this regard the most commonly found wsh are benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene btexn 3 btexn are pollutants of great concern due to their effects to ecosystems and to human health 4 absorption of btexn through the skin or plant membrane happens especially for plants and sessile immobile organisms although it also occurs in birds and mammals producing changes in their reproductive and feeding behavior which cause tainting and loss of habitat 3 in humans multiple harmful effects have been reported for example neurotoxicity and central nervous system depression 5 lungs liver kidney and eyes damage 6 in addition lip esophagus lung bronchus rectum colon and unspecified cancers acute non lymphocytic leukemia anll and other neoplasms have been reported 7 despite the above wsh have been detected at concentrations of up to 600 mg l in process waters 2 hence wsh are classified as priority pollutants by the us environmental protection agency 8 different approaches have been suggested to remove or eliminate these pollutants from water such as filtration aeration biodegradation and photocatalysis 9 10 although these techniques have had different degrees of success in reducing the contamination levels of wsh they have drawbacks because they a are energy and chemical consuming b need prolonged periods of time for effective treatment and c are expensive in terms of equipment and maintenance 11 on the other hand physicochemical processes such as adsorption technologies are low cost accessible and versatile alternative forms of treatment in this context a wide range of bio based materials like macroalgae biomass i e macrocystis pyrifera have been effectively used for the removal of dyes 12 heavy metals 13 and wsh such as btex 14 due to their compatible chemical composition furthermore macroalgae biomass in particular have achieved relevance because of its lack of toxicity and large scale availability 14 16 compared to batch systems the continuous adsorption process in packed columns represents the most frequently used industrial application for wastewater pollution control 17 the main benefit of the packed bed column is that the adsorbate is in constant contact with the adsorbent and the fluid concentration is virtually zero at early stages as time proceeds the mass transfer zone mtz moves downward through the package column at a certain point the adsorbate is detected breakthrough by measuring the adsorbate concentration in the effluent as it leaves the fixed bed at the end a typically s shaped breakthrough curve is obtained which is the result of equilibrium mechanisms mass transfer and influent flow properties 18 previous works have reported the dynamic biosorption of organics dyes and hydrocarbons including phenol methylene blue tricaine methanesulfonate ms 222 and basic fuchsin with biosorbents and agro industrial wastes such as immobilized active sludge sawdust paper mill sludge and mandacaru cactus 19 23 however a paucity of data exists regarding multicomponent systems of wsh with similar polarities like btexn a comprehensive description and simulation of competitive biosorption mechanisms in packed bed systems are valuable and fundamental to transfer the model test results to a full scale process a previously reported macroalgae based biosorbent was prepared through a precipitation technique using macroalgae biomass i e macrocystis pyrifera ma chitosan ch and pectin pe 75 4 19 8 and 4 8 respectively 24 chitosan is a multifunctional polymer derived from abundant biomaterial in nature i e crustacean shell waste composed of hydroxyl groups and highly reactive amino groups that confer it the capacity of undergo a wide range of chemical modifications 25 26 due to its versatility biocompatibility biodegradability nonimmunogenic properties and low cost chitosan has been used in a wide range of applications such as in food pharmaceutical biotechnology medical textile paper and agriculture 27 due to its hydrophilicity adsorption and flocculating ability chitosan has also been effectively employed for environmental applications e g removal of pollutants from water like dyes phenolic compounds herbicides pesticides oils grease and metals 28 29 likewise pe a group of acidic macromolecular polysaccharides with a high degree of polymerization is widely found in various plant cells pectin like chitosan is an environmentally friendly material 30 together pe and ch confer stability and biodegradability to the composites 30 furthermore the affinity for wsh for the studied chitosan macroalgae biocomposite was verified in batch essays 24 hence the primary objective of this research was to examine the influence of critical design parameters of a fixed bed column packed with our previously reported composite which contains brown macroalgae biomass macrocystis pyrifera chitosan and pectin as precursors in the dynamic biosorption of btexn in this work flow rate and competitive adsorption processes and breakthrough profiles were analyzed

of the aromatic hydrocarbons evaluated as adsorbates are shown in table s1 supplementary information a natural water sample was collected from a reservoir located in the city of san luis potosi state in the mexican state of the same name the sample was filtered through millipore nylon filters of 0 22 μm nominal pore size to retain the suspended particles the permeate was treated for subsequent analytical characterizations including determination of total organic carbon metals and anions which were analyzed following a previously established methodology 14 a summary of sample results and overall analytical determinations is shown in table s2 the inert biomass of the brown macroalgae m pyrifera was previously rinsed with abundant deionized water dried at 60 c for 72 h milled to powder texture and stored in a free moisture environment 2 1 synthesis of the biosorbent composite a previous study reported a simple methodology for the preparation of a macroalgae based biocomposite with good affinity toward wsh 24 in this method the precursor pe was first dissolved in deionized water followed by the addition of a pre defined amount of ma and finally the mixing of a definite quantity of ch with 5 v v acetic acid followed the composite mixture fixed proportions of 75 4 19 8 and 4 8 for macroalgae biomass chitosan and pectin respectively were selected for the biocomposite composition the homogeneous ma pe ch solution was extruded through a drop system into a 5 naoh solution for hydrogel reaction 31 the final biomaterial was washed repeatedly with distilled water until a ph close to 7 was attained finally the biomaterials were dried at 60 c for 48 h the ma pe ch biocomposite adsorbent used in the experiments has a low surface area 0 12 m2 g and a swelling degree value of 380 2 2 continuous flow adsorption experiments the continuous flow adsorption experiments were evaluated in a 15 cm long column with an inner diameter of 0 5 cm as shown in fig s1 supplementary information an approximate biosorbent mass of 1 4 g particle size 600 800 μm was packed into the column with a determined bed length of 5 cm an inert flat disk of 150 μm pore opening was placed at the bottom of the column to serve as material support and to prevent any solid losses the continuous experiments were performed under controlled conditions to prevent any hydrocarbon loss i e during the experiment the stock solution was stored in a container with ice shielded from light and the samples were taken in amber glass vials with any headspace at 18 c the experiments considered two major parts 1 different empty bed contact times ebct were applied using naphthalene the most hydrophobic molecule as the model pollutant where ebct refers to the time required for a fluid to pass through the volume equivalent to the media bed calculated as eq 1 1 ebct vf q where vf is the volume occupied by the biosorbent media in the packed column ml and q is the influent flow rate ml min which had a naphthalene concentration of 2 6 mg l the liquid flowed downwards at a constant flow rate of 1 1 0 41 and 0 3 ml min for an ebct of 4 15 and 20 min respectively 2 in a second approach the equimolar removal rate of btexn biosorption was carried out using deionized and natural water as solvents the effluent was collected over a given period of time and the concentration of the different pollutants ct mg l were determined as previously reported 14 the initial breakpoint was established at an effluent concentration of a 2 ratio in relation with the influent concentration ct ci 0 02 in accordance to a previous report 32 the breakthrough time tb was referred to this point and the column saturation point was considered when the ct ci ratio was 0 95 the main characteristics of the biocomposite and the column operational parameters are shown in table 1 whereas and the detailed computations are show in fig s2 supplementary information 2 3 fixed bed column models fitting an appropriate mathematical model allows the development and optimization of concentration time profiles of a fixed bed column relevant information such as sorption mechanisms kinetic constants and adsorption capacities could be predicted by adequate fitting of experimental data 19 33 hence five different mathematical models were employed including thomas clark yoon nelson dose response and bed depth service time bdst which were run using the statistica software next is a brief description of each of these models 2 3 1 thomas model the theoretical background of the thomas model implies no mass transfer and axial dispersion 34 furthermore the adsorption process is defined by the langmuir adsorption isotherm and a second order rate equation this expression is generally applied when external and internal diffusion limitations in the sorption process are negligible the thomas model can be calculated using the following equation eq 2 2 c t c i 1 1 e k t h q m q t h c i v 1 1 e k t h m q t h q k t h c i t where kth corresponds to the thomas rate constant and qth is the maximum adsorbate uptake mg g 2 3 2 clark model this model considers the use of a fluid phase mass transfer coefficient combined with the freundlich adsorption isotherm equation 35 and can be determined by using the following expression 3 c t c i 1 1 a e k c t 1 n f 1 with a c i n f 1 c b n f 1 e k c t b where nf is the freundlich empirical constant computed from batch studies kc 1 min is the biosorption rate constant and cb mg l is the solute concentration in the fluid at the breakthrough time 2 3 3 yoon nelson yoon nelson model 36 takes into account that the decrease in the probability of each adsorbate to be adsorbed is proportional to the probability of its adsorption and breakthrough on the adsorbent the equation is given as follows eq 4 4 c t c i e k y n t k y n t 50 1 e k y n t k y n t 50 where kyn is the yoon nelson adsorption kinetic constant 1 min and t 50 min is the time necessary to reach the 50 amount of adsorbate loss of the initial hydrocarbon content c ci 0 5 2 3 4 dose response dr model the dose response model was utilized to overcome the error produced from thomas models at short and large intervals of the breakthrough curve 37 which is given by the following equation eq 5 5 c s c i 1 1 1 c i q t q d m t o t a l where cs is the adsorbate concentration at saturation time ts and α is the dose response model constant of the model 2 3 5 bed depth service time bdst model this model expresses that an external process between the adsorbate and the unused fraction of the sorbent is the main approach that govern the biosorption behavior of the adsorbent 38 6 c t c i 1 1 e k b d s t c i n b d s t c i v l t where nbdst is the dynamic bed biosorption uptake mg l v is the linear fluid velocity cm h kbdst is the adsorption rate constant which is related to the liquid particle mass transfer l mg h and l refers to the vertical height cm to test the significance of the non linear relationship between experimental data and regression models the correlation coefficient r2 and the sum of the squares error sse were determined by using the following expression 7 s s e i 1 n y e m e a s y e c a l c i 2 where ye meas and y e calc are the measured and theoretically calculated dependent variables 3 results and discussions 3 1 static adsorption of wsh by macroalgae based biocomposite the chitosan macroalgae biocomposite showed great affinity for wsh obtaining removal capacities of 58 68 16 64 and 6 13 mg g for benzene toluene and naphthalene respectively 24 for ethylbenzene and xylenes the removal capacities were 25 8 and 23 mg g respectively under the same experimental conditions i e deionized water including the maximum solubility of each compound table s1 these results exhibited comparable biosorption capacities and even higher than other natural materials like bagasse or wood chips 39 42 furthermore the data were well described by sips adsorption isotherm and the pseudo second order equation represented the best fitting model for the biosorption kinetics flores chaparro et al 24 reported the complete characterization of the biocomposite in this sense interactions between the composite and the organic pollutants could be summarized as 1 the physical biosorption caused by van der waals interactions between amino and surface hydroxyl groups of chitosan 38 39 2 dispersion forces with hydroxyl and carboxylic surface groups of pectin and 3 π π and hydrophobic interactions with the lipid fraction of the macroalgae and weak intermolecular interactions van der waals forces with lignocellulosic compounds of the biomass 24 3 2 dynamic adsorption of wsh by macroalgae based biocomposite all the adsorbate breakthrough curves correspond to a characteristic s shape concentration profiles c ci as the influent passes along the column at a certain time t in min at the first stage of adsorption the wsh were rapidly adsorbed on the upper few layers of the fresh biocomposite due to the high availability of active sites as the polluted solution continues to flow through the column the top layers of the sorbent are saturated with the incoming solute and become less effective for further sorption the process continues until the saturation point was reached at 95 of the inlet concentration value 43 3 2 1 effect of flow rate in naphthalene biosorption as expected the removal efficiency of the column increased at lower flow rate values since its behavior is defined by the contact time at low influent loadings the dissolved naphthalene stream had more time in contact with the biosorbent based on these results dynamic parameters such as the treatment objective tobj and the breakthrough volume vc values increased from 14 to 186 min and 14 56 ml respectively a breakthrough volume at a c ci value of 0 02 also increased from 12 to 52 ml at an ebct of 4 and 20 min respectively by using the integration method the area a under the breakthrough curve was used to estimate column parameters including mtotal and qe table 2 and s3 the total amount of naphthalene passed through the column mtotal using an ebct of 4 and 20 min was 0 19 and 0 54 mg for which the biocomposite removed qe 0 006 and 0 016 mg g respectively other parameters increased in proportion to ebct e g specific throughput st and stobj from 8 5 to 23 mg l which refers to the volume treated per unit mass of adsorbent at a c ci value of 0 02 and to the limit detection value defined by the drinking water list of standards and guidelines 1 3 2 1 1 mass transfer zone parameters and operational characteristics the changes in flow rate also affected the mass transfer zone mtz parameters which are closely linked to the equilibrium and kinetics features as the bed is continually exposed to the liquid based on our results the height of the mass transfer zone hmtz and the rate of the mass transfer zone rmtz showed an inverse correspondence with the increment of ebct these parameters which consider the affinity of the adsorbate for the biosorbent and indicate the rate at which the adsorbent will be exhausted the percentage occupied by the mtz hmtz h within the packed column before the biosorbent becomes completely saturated were 70 and 105 for an ebct of 20 and 4 min respectively a result that indicate the positive effect of longer contact time between naphthalene and the biocomposite lower hmtz values are associated to higher rates of removal qtotal and increasing fractional capacities φ 44 the fractional capacity is an indicator of the amount of solute adsorbed related to the total capacity of the mtz 45 46 in this sense a decrease in the fractional capacity represents an increase in the length necessary to produce a desired service time tojb and t0 02 with a lower total mass of the adsorbate retained in the column 44 3 2 1 2 naphthalene breakthrough curves modeling numerical solutions of different breakthrough models are necessary to validate theoretical and practical assumptions related to the column operation for the fixed bed equations given previously the estimations of the isotherm parameters were developed by nonlinear regressions following the rosenbrook and quasi newton rq methodology using statistica the variance r2 parameter and the sse values were registered in intervals between 0 92 to 0 99 and 0 02 to 0 17 respectively in both cases the best correlation values for the different fixed bed adsorption models registered the following order dr bdst yoon nelson thomas clark table 3 however some of the models differ mainly in the adsorption capacity value and assumptions concerning mass transfer processes furthermore the reason is due to the overestimated value of the maximum concentration of the adsorbate in the solid phase qd mg g for all the different ebct values moreover uncertainty in the qth and qd model parameters from the thomas and dr breakthrough adsorption models could be due to the presence of mass transfer restrictions caused by saturation of the solid phase in addition the clark model is based on mass transfer associated to the freundlich isotherm equation however batch biosorption data correlated well with the sips adsorption isotherm 24 in the case of the nb parameter from the bdst model the fitting divergence could suggest that both the residual capacity of the composite and the inlet concentration of naphthalene are unrelated to the biosorption rate in the yoon nelson model the time necessary to reach 50 t 50 of the removal value increases with the decrease of the inlet flow rate mainly due to a diffusion resistance in the boundary layer at lower ebct values the yoon nelson model has successfully fitted biosorption data in previous works related to the removal of pharmaceutical residues 19 remediation of lead by algae biomass 47 and uptake of phenol by activated carbon derived from olive stones 45 it is noteworthy that the breakthrough curve shapes shown in fig 1 did not follow the typical s shape at c ci values around 0 6 for ebct of 15 and 20 min however this trend could be explained in terms of a different effectiveness of intraparticle diffusion in relation to the flow rate and b the swelling degree in aqueous solutions of the biocomposites previous studies identified an increase in the film resistance to mass transfer as the limiting step due to a higher inlet flow rate 33 thus at a larger flow rate naphthalene molecules have an unfavorable effect on intraparticle diffusion furthermore biosorption is produced only onto exposed surface active sites with strong affinity toward the adsorbate e g in lignocellulosic fractions conversely slow fluid flows through the adsorption column promotes an extensive intraparticle diffusion and interaction with available surface functional groups that possess lower adsorption capacities or adsorption degree 20 hence an enhanced biosorption capacity was achieved similar results were obtained by chern and chien 2002 48 who showed that the adsorption of nitrophenol onto activated carbon produced a sharp front at the end of the operational column time that they attributed to a strong influence of a mass transfer resistance at the solid solution interface the linearized yoon nelson model was employed to identify an overall change in the mass transfer rate ky 1 min by identifying the different slopes in the regression fitting data in general two or three main steps were identified fig 2 for example an ebct of 20 min registered two different slopes at the first time period a constant slope is noticeable in the system ky 0 04 1 min which means that the adsorbate diffuses into mesopores of the biocomposite obtaining the faster rate of uptake especially prior to the initial breakthrough at extended times a second slope shows a notable lower ky value equal to 0 01 1 min attributed to a reduction in the adsorbate intraparticle diffusion in addition the second slope on the breakthrough curve obtained when using an ebct of 4 min means that the adsorbent surface is almost saturated and that the final biosorption step occurs mainly onto in the available internal active sites furthermore changes in the biocomposite s swelling degree were expected based on previous studies that reported a sw ratio of 380 23 therefore this phenomenon promotes intraparticle diffusion especially at operation times close to 200 min where a noticeable plateau can be observed at an ebct value of 15 as the flow rate decreases ebct 20 a similar plateau is observed at an operation time around 400 min at the highest flow rate the swelling degree may not affect significantly the adsorption removal due to the large mass transfer zone that reaches the end of the column before the swelling process increases the biosorbent porosity 3 3 selectivity in continuous adsorption experiments breakthrough curves for equimolar btexn in deionized and natural water are presented in fig 3 similarly the experimental data showed a better fitting by the dr and bdst models but the estimated removal capacities were higher than those reported by the experimental data hence like in the single naphthalene systems the yoon nelson model was selected as the most suitable to fit the experimental data the yoon nelson adsorption rate constant ky 1 min was higher in the presence of organic matter probably because of the presence of additional surface exposed groups available for wsh adsorption table 4 and table s4 this mechanism influenced mass transfer of the process increasing the diffusion rate for pollutants in dissolved organic matter dom media this result confirms our previous result in batch studies where the presence of dom enhanced the uptake rate of adsorbates however a lower removal capacity was registered observed in early breakthroughs compared with the system that processed sparked deionized water it is important to consider that in batch biosorption systems a selected weight of composites is well mixed in a certain volume of a solute within the presence of the adsorbate at a given concentration 49 in contrast in continuous systems the dom constituents may attach to the first layers of the fixed column probably causing channeling and diffusional restrictions for larger molecules that accelerated the initial breakthrough fig 3 according to the literature the dom contains a significant degree of aromatic polymers and functional groups that promote hydrophobic interactions with large molecular aromatic compounds the shape of the equimolar breakthrough curves fig 3a and b show that the benzene uptake rate is more favorable in comparison to the rest of the evaluated molecules this could be explained by the diffusion coefficients values of these organic molecules in aqueous solution listed in table s1 which show a linear trend with their molecular weights 50 for this reason it is assumed that simple aromatic molecules e g benzene or toluene readily attached to the available active sites however in the two aqueous systems tested no displacement process were observed desorption even if the pollutants under study had different mass transfer zones in the system moreover in systems with deionized water when the weaker adsorbable molecules based on the total removal percentage like ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene reached the adsorbents surface a cooperative adsorption at c ci values over 0 6 could take place forming multilayers of adsorbate during the adsorption process this result is consistent with previous results involving benzene toluene and naphthalene with coconut shell biosorbent 51 on the other hand the dom system showed a decrease in adsorption capacity for btexn in addition to a noticeable affinity for apolar molecules such as ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene this behavior is probably due to a multilayer adsorption of the pollutants in the first layers promoted from the dom this phenomenon hinders the adsorbates to reach the overall active sites of the biosorbent fig 4 an analogous behavior could be observed by the degree of swelling in multicomponent experiments in the case of natural water fig 3b a concentration plateau was observed only for the strongest adsorbable pollutant naphthalene at c ci of 0 6 corresponding to a service time of about 120 min in the case of deionized water fig 3a the effect of the swelling process was observed for all the components showing a concentration plateau at a similar operation time of about 150 min as shown in fig 4 swelling degree and multilayer adsorption should be considered when the biosorption of a mixture of aromatic molecules is studied the use of natural water registered a noticeable effect on the column operating parameters based on the results considering that vb vc v0 095 v0 02 c0 9 and c0 02 were lower than those calculated when deionized water was used instead although the computed specific throughput variables show the same trend st st0 02 and stobj finally regarding to the mtz parameters the lower hmtz values refer to quick adsorption steps whereas the rmtz values are linked to a high rate of exhaustion of the biosorbent in the column 46 all evidences indicate that the presence of dom decreases the uptake capacity of the biocomposites to adsorb the pollutants under study however naphthalene in natural water was preferentially removed probably because of its high hydrophobicity of this molecule log kow which enhanced stronger interactions with the biosorbent in the presence of dom considering the aromatic nature of its components as previously observed in batch studies 4 conclusions in this study a macroalgae based biocomposite was synthesized and used for benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene btexn removal in fixed bed columns under different experimental conditions breakthrough curves at different empty bed contact time showed that the naphthalene adsorption increases as the ebct decreases due to a higher contact with the adsorbent this behavior was reflected in the different operational and mass transfer parameters computed from the breakthrough curves in this sense the lower mass transfer resistance produced by the increase of the flow rate had detrimental effects in intraparticle diffusion and subsequently in the affinity for naphthalene the swelling degree of the biosorbent at service times close to 200 and 400 min for an ebct of 15 and 20 min respectively generated larger pore openings by the swelling degree of the composite producing a noticeable plateau in the shape of the breakthrough curves the competitive column systems in natural water solutions showed selectivity for the aromatic molecules which is based on their hydrophobicity degree lighter aromatic molecules benzene and toluene can be associated to higher diffusional coefficients followed by larger molecules ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene this behavior was more evident in the presence of dom which decreases their removal capacities except for naphthalene assuming that dom restricts porosity at the same time increased the kinetic processes due to presence of more active sites as a result of the hydrophobicity provided by dissolved organic matter the plateau obtained in the breakthrough curves at operational times around 200 min could be explained by the swelling degree and higher availability of surface active sites finally the yoon nelson breakthrough column model successfully predicted hydrocarbons breakthrough curves

13601,this study aimed to investigate the adsorption performance of a macroalgae based biocomposite as a biosorbent of water soluble hydrocarbons wsh like btexn benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene on packed bed columns the effects of the inlet flow rate 0 3 1 1 ml min using naphthalene as a model were analyzed and the operation parameters are described the registered breakthrough volume increased from 12 to 52 ml at an ebct of 4 and 20 min respectively the breakthrough curves profiles of the competitive biosorption of btexn were modeled by five well accepted dynamic adsorption models known as thomas clark dose response bdst and yoon nelson the biocomposite swelling degree and the external mass transfer limitations are the main factors influencing the adsorption process at different inlet fluxes a result that was corroborated by the linearized yoon nelson model in the case of multicomponent systems the hydrocarbon hydrophobicity determined the

as process water i e the wastewater generated during petroleum and gas extraction and oil spillages 2 in this regard the most commonly found wsh are benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene btexn 3 btexn are pollutants of great concern due to their effects to ecosystems and to human health 4 absorption of btexn through the skin or plant membrane happens especially for plants and sessile immobile organisms although it also occurs in birds and mammals producing changes in their reproductive and feeding behavior which cause tainting and loss of habitat 3 in humans multiple harmful effects have been reported for example neurotoxicity and central nervous system depression 5 lungs liver kidney and eyes damage 6 in addition lip esophagus lung bronchus rectum colon and unspecified cancers acute non lymphocytic leukemia anll and other neoplasms have been reported 7 despite the above wsh have been detected at concentrations of up to 600 mg l in process waters 2 hence wsh are classified as priority pollutants by the us environmental protection agency 8 different approaches have been suggested to remove or eliminate these pollutants from water such as filtration aeration biodegradation and photocatalysis 9 10 although these techniques have had different degrees of success in reducing the contamination levels of wsh they have drawbacks because they a are energy and chemical consuming b need prolonged periods of time for effective treatment and c are expensive in terms of equipment and maintenance 11 on the other hand physicochemical processes such as adsorption technologies are low cost accessible and versatile alternative forms of treatment in this context a wide range of bio based materials like macroalgae biomass i e macrocystis pyrifera have been effectively used for the removal of dyes 12 heavy metals 13 and wsh such as btex 14 due to their compatible chemical composition furthermore macroalgae biomass in particular have achieved relevance because of its lack of toxicity and large scale availability 14 16 compared to batch systems the continuous adsorption process in packed columns represents the most frequently used industrial application for wastewater pollution control 17 the main benefit of the packed bed column is that the adsorbate is in constant contact with the adsorbent and the fluid concentration is virtually zero at early stages as time proceeds the mass transfer zone mtz moves downward through the package column at a certain point the adsorbate is detected breakthrough by measuring the adsorbate concentration in the effluent as it leaves the fixed bed at the end a typically s shaped breakthrough curve is obtained which is the result of equilibrium mechanisms mass transfer and influent flow properties 18 previous works have reported the dynamic biosorption of organics dyes and hydrocarbons including phenol methylene blue tricaine methanesulfonate ms 222 and basic fuchsin with biosorbents and agro industrial wastes such as immobilized active sludge sawdust paper mill sludge and mandacaru cactus 19 23 however a paucity of data exists regarding multicomponent systems of wsh with similar polarities like btexn a comprehensive description and simulation of competitive biosorption mechanisms in packed bed systems are valuable and fundamental to transfer the model test results to a full scale process a previously reported macroalgae based biosorbent was prepared through a precipitation technique using macroalgae biomass i e macrocystis pyrifera ma chitosan ch and pectin pe 75 4 19 8 and 4 8 respectively 24 chitosan is a multifunctional polymer derived from abundant biomaterial in nature i e crustacean shell waste composed of hydroxyl groups and highly reactive amino groups that confer it the capacity of undergo a wide range of chemical modifications 25 26 due to its versatility biocompatibility biodegradability nonimmunogenic properties and low cost chitosan has been used in a wide range of applications such as in food pharmaceutical biotechnology medical textile paper and agriculture 27 due to its hydrophilicity adsorption and flocculating ability chitosan has also been effectively employed for environmental applications e g removal of pollutants from water like dyes phenolic compounds herbicides pesticides oils grease and metals 28 29 likewise pe a group of acidic macromolecular polysaccharides with a high degree of polymerization is widely found in various plant cells pectin like chitosan is an environmentally friendly material 30 together pe and ch confer stability and biodegradability to the composites 30 furthermore the affinity for wsh for the studied chitosan macroalgae biocomposite was verified in batch essays 24 hence the primary objective of this research was to examine the influence of critical design parameters of a fixed bed column packed with our previously reported composite which contains brown macroalgae biomass macrocystis pyrifera chitosan and pectin as precursors in the dynamic biosorption of btexn in this work flow rate and competitive adsorption processes and breakthrough profiles were analyzed

appropriate mathematical model allows the development and optimization of concentration time profiles of a fixed bed column relevant information such as sorption mechanisms kinetic constants and adsorption capacities could be predicted by adequate fitting of experimental data 19 33 hence five different mathematical models were employed including thomas clark yoon nelson dose response and bed depth service time bdst which were run using the statistica software next is a brief description of each of these models 2 3 1 thomas model the theoretical background of the thomas model implies no mass transfer and axial dispersion 34 furthermore the adsorption process is defined by the langmuir adsorption isotherm and a second order rate equation this expression is generally applied when

biocomposite the chitosan macroalgae biocomposite showed great affinity for wsh obtaining removal capacities of 58 68 16 64 and 6 13 mg g for benzene toluene and naphthalene respectively 24 for ethylbenzene and xylenes the removal capacities were 25 8 and 23 mg g respectively under the same experimental conditions i e deionized water including the maximum solubility of each compound table s1 these results exhibited comparable biosorption capacities and even higher than other natural materials like bagasse or wood chips 39 42 furthermore the data were well described by sips adsorption isotherm and the pseudo second order equation represented the best fitting model for the biosorption kinetics flores chaparro et al 24 reported the complete characterization of the biocomposite in this sense interactions between the composite and the organic pollutants could be summarized as 1 the physical biosorption caused by van der waals interactions between amino and surface hydroxyl groups of chitosan 38 39 2 dispersion forces with hydroxyl and carboxylic surface groups of pectin and 3 π π and hydrophobic interactions with the lipid fraction of the macroalgae and weak intermolecular interactions van der waals forces with lignocellulosic compounds of the biomass 24 3 2 dynamic adsorption of wsh by macroalgae based biocomposite all the adsorbate breakthrough curves correspond to a characteristic s shape concentration profiles c ci as the influent passes along the column at a certain time t in min at the first stage of adsorption the wsh were rapidly adsorbed on the upper few layers of the fresh biocomposite due to the high availability of active sites as the polluted solution continues to flow through the column the top layers of the sorbent are saturated with the incoming solute and become less effective for further sorption the process continues until the saturation point was reached at 95 of the inlet concentration value 43 3 2 1 effect of flow rate in naphthalene biosorption as expected the removal efficiency of the column increased at lower flow rate values since its behavior is defined by the contact time at low influent loadings the dissolved naphthalene stream had more time in contact with the biosorbent based on these results dynamic parameters such as the treatment objective tobj and the breakthrough volume vc values increased from 14 to 186 min and 14 56 ml respectively a breakthrough volume at a c ci value of 0 02 also increased from 12 to 52 ml at an ebct of 4 and 20 min respectively by using the integration method the area a under the breakthrough curve was used to estimate column parameters including mtotal and qe table 2 and s3 the total amount of naphthalene passed through the column mtotal using an ebct of 4 and 20 min was 0 19 and 0 54 mg for which the biocomposite removed qe 0 006 and 0 016 mg g respectively other parameters increased in proportion to ebct e g specific throughput st and stobj from 8 5 to 23 mg l which refers to the volume treated per unit mass of adsorbent at a c ci value of 0 02 and to the limit detection value defined by the drinking water list of standards and guidelines 1 3 2 1 1 mass transfer zone parameters and operational characteristics the changes in flow rate also affected the mass transfer zone mtz parameters which are closely linked to the equilibrium and kinetics features as the bed is continually exposed to the liquid based on our results the height of the mass transfer zone hmtz and the rate of the mass transfer zone rmtz showed an inverse correspondence with the increment of ebct these parameters which consider the affinity of the adsorbate for the biosorbent and indicate the rate at which the adsorbent will be exhausted the percentage occupied by the mtz hmtz h within the packed column before the biosorbent becomes completely saturated were 70 and 105 for an ebct of 20 and 4 min respectively a result that indicate the positive effect of longer contact time between naphthalene and the biocomposite lower hmtz values are associated to higher rates of removal qtotal and increasing fractional capacities φ 44 the fractional capacity is an indicator of the amount of solute adsorbed related to the total capacity of the mtz 45 46 in this sense a decrease in the fractional capacity represents an increase in the length necessary to produce a desired service time tojb and t0 02 with a lower total mass of the adsorbate retained in the column 44 3 2 1 2 naphthalene breakthrough curves modeling numerical solutions of different breakthrough models are necessary to validate theoretical and practical assumptions related to the column operation for the fixed bed equations given previously the estimations of the isotherm parameters were developed by nonlinear regressions following the rosenbrook and quasi newton rq methodology using statistica the variance r2 parameter and the sse values were registered in intervals between 0 92 to 0 99 and 0 02 to 0 17 respectively in both cases the best correlation values for the different fixed bed adsorption models registered the following order dr bdst yoon nelson thomas clark table 3 however some of the models differ mainly in the adsorption capacity value and assumptions concerning mass transfer processes furthermore the reason is due to the overestimated value of the maximum concentration of the adsorbate in the solid phase qd mg g for all the different ebct values moreover uncertainty in the qth and qd model parameters from the thomas and dr breakthrough adsorption models could be due to the presence of mass transfer restrictions caused by saturation of the solid phase in addition the clark model is based on mass transfer associated to the freundlich isotherm equation however batch biosorption data correlated well with the sips adsorption isotherm 24 in the case of the nb parameter from the bdst model the fitting divergence could suggest that both the residual capacity of the composite and the inlet concentration of naphthalene are unrelated to the biosorption rate in the yoon nelson model the time necessary to reach 50 t 50 of the removal value increases with the decrease of the inlet flow rate mainly due to a diffusion resistance in the boundary layer at lower ebct values the yoon nelson model has successfully fitted biosorption data in previous works related to the removal of pharmaceutical residues 19 remediation of lead by algae biomass 47 and uptake of phenol by activated carbon derived from olive stones 45 it is noteworthy that the breakthrough curve shapes shown in fig 1 did not follow the typical s shape at c ci values around 0 6 for ebct of 15 and 20 min however this trend could be explained in terms of a different effectiveness of intraparticle diffusion in relation to the flow rate and b the swelling degree in aqueous solutions of the biocomposites previous studies identified an increase in the film resistance to mass transfer as the limiting step due to a higher inlet flow rate 33 thus at a larger flow rate naphthalene molecules have an unfavorable effect on intraparticle diffusion furthermore biosorption is produced only onto exposed surface active sites with strong affinity toward the adsorbate e g in lignocellulosic fractions conversely slow fluid flows through the adsorption column promotes an extensive intraparticle diffusion and interaction with available surface functional groups that possess lower adsorption capacities or adsorption degree 20 hence an enhanced biosorption capacity was achieved similar results were obtained by chern and chien 2002 48 who showed that the adsorption of nitrophenol onto activated carbon produced a sharp front at the end of the operational column time that they attributed to a strong influence of a mass transfer resistance at the solid solution interface the linearized yoon nelson model was employed to identify an overall change in the mass transfer rate ky 1 min by identifying the different slopes in the regression fitting data in general two or three main steps were identified fig 2 for example an ebct of 20 min registered two different slopes at the first time period a constant slope is noticeable in the system ky 0 04 1 min which means that the adsorbate diffuses into mesopores of the biocomposite obtaining the faster rate of uptake especially prior to the initial breakthrough at extended times a second slope shows a notable lower ky value equal to 0 01 1 min attributed to a reduction in the adsorbate intraparticle diffusion in addition the second slope on the breakthrough curve obtained when using an ebct of 4 min means that the adsorbent surface is almost saturated and that the final biosorption step occurs mainly onto in the available internal active sites furthermore changes in the biocomposite s swelling degree were expected based on previous studies that reported a sw ratio of 380 23 therefore this phenomenon promotes intraparticle diffusion especially at operation times close to 200 min where a noticeable plateau can be observed at an ebct value of 15 as the flow rate decreases ebct 20 a similar plateau is observed at an operation time around 400 min at the highest flow rate the swelling degree may not affect significantly the adsorption removal due to the large mass transfer zone that reaches the end of the column before the swelling process increases the biosorbent porosity 3 3 selectivity in continuous adsorption experiments breakthrough curves for equimolar btexn in deionized and natural water are presented in fig 3 similarly the experimental data showed a better fitting by the dr and bdst models but the estimated removal capacities were higher than those reported by the experimental data hence like in the single naphthalene systems the yoon nelson model was selected as the most suitable to fit the experimental data the yoon nelson adsorption rate constant ky 1 min was higher in the presence of organic matter probably because of the presence of additional surface exposed groups available for wsh adsorption table 4 and table s4 this mechanism influenced mass transfer of the process increasing the diffusion rate for pollutants in dissolved organic matter dom media this result confirms our previous result in batch studies where the presence of dom enhanced the uptake rate of adsorbates however a lower removal capacity was registered observed in early breakthroughs compared with the system that processed sparked deionized water it is important to consider that in batch biosorption systems a selected weight of composites is well mixed in a certain volume of a solute within the presence of the adsorbate at a given concentration 49 in contrast in continuous systems the dom constituents may attach to the first layers of the fixed column probably causing channeling and diffusional restrictions for larger molecules that accelerated the initial breakthrough fig 3 according to the literature the dom contains a significant degree of aromatic polymers and functional groups that promote hydrophobic interactions with large molecular aromatic compounds the shape of the equimolar breakthrough curves fig 3a and b show that the benzene uptake rate is more favorable in comparison to the rest of the evaluated molecules this could be explained by the diffusion coefficients values of these organic molecules in aqueous solution listed in table s1 which show a linear trend with their molecular weights 50 for this reason it is assumed that simple aromatic molecules e g benzene or toluene readily attached to the available active sites however in the two aqueous systems tested no displacement process were observed desorption even if the pollutants under study had different mass transfer zones in the system moreover in systems with deionized water when the weaker adsorbable molecules based on the total removal percentage like ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene reached the adsorbents surface a cooperative adsorption at c ci values over 0 6 could take place forming multilayers of adsorbate during the adsorption process this result is consistent with previous results involving benzene toluene and naphthalene with coconut shell biosorbent 51 on the other hand the dom system showed a decrease in adsorption capacity for btexn in addition to a noticeable affinity for apolar molecules such as ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene this behavior is probably due to a multilayer adsorption of the pollutants in the first layers promoted from the dom this phenomenon hinders the adsorbates to reach the overall active sites of the biosorbent fig 4 an analogous behavior could be observed by the degree of swelling in multicomponent experiments in the case of natural water fig 3b a concentration plateau was observed only for the strongest adsorbable pollutant naphthalene at c ci of 0 6 corresponding to a service time of about 120 min in the case of deionized water fig 3a the effect of the swelling process was observed for all the components showing a concentration plateau at a similar operation time of about 150 min as shown in fig 4 swelling degree and multilayer adsorption should be considered when the biosorption of a mixture of aromatic molecules is studied the use of natural water registered a noticeable effect on the column operating parameters based on the results considering that vb vc v0 095 v0 02 c0 9 and c0 02 were lower than those calculated when deionized water was used instead although the computed specific throughput variables show the same trend st st0 02 and stobj finally regarding to the mtz parameters the lower hmtz values refer to quick adsorption steps whereas the rmtz values are linked to a high rate of exhaustion of the biosorbent in the column 46 all evidences indicate that the presence of dom decreases the uptake capacity of the biocomposites to adsorb the pollutants under study however naphthalene in natural water was preferentially removed probably because of its high hydrophobicity of this molecule log kow which enhanced stronger interactions with the biosorbent in the presence of dom considering the aromatic nature of its components as previously observed in batch studies 4 conclusions in this study a macroalgae based biocomposite was synthesized and used for benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene btexn removal in fixed bed columns under different experimental conditions breakthrough curves at different empty bed contact time showed that the naphthalene adsorption increases as the ebct decreases due to a higher contact with the adsorbent this behavior was reflected in the different operational and mass transfer parameters computed from the breakthrough curves in this sense the lower mass transfer resistance produced by the increase of the flow rate had detrimental effects in intraparticle diffusion and subsequently in the affinity for naphthalene the swelling degree of the biosorbent at service times close to 200 and 400 min for an ebct of 15 and 20 min respectively generated larger pore openings by the swelling degree of the composite producing a noticeable plateau in the shape of the breakthrough curves the competitive column systems in natural water solutions showed selectivity for the aromatic molecules which is based on their hydrophobicity degree lighter aromatic molecules benzene and toluene can be associated to higher diffusional coefficients followed by larger molecules ethylbenzene xylenes and naphthalene this behavior was more evident in the presence of dom which decreases their removal capacities except for naphthalene assuming that dom restricts porosity at the same time increased the kinetic processes due to presence of more active sites as a result of the hydrophobicity provided by dissolved organic matter the plateau obtained in the breakthrough curves at operational times around 200 min could be explained by the swelling degree and higher availability of surface active sites finally the yoon nelson breakthrough column model successfully predicted hydrocarbons breakthrough curves

13602,this study highlights the significance of increasing the phytoremediation treatment of nelumbo nucifera plant efficiency using treated nanoclay soil to adjust its surface charge the treated nanoclay consisted of zeta potential values of 11 41 28 7 and 42 5 mv for ph 4 6 and 10 respectively the biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrate removals no3 for the reference samples were 6 1 5 and 10 2 respectively without the plant and soil on day 5 of observation with the plant the biochemical oxygen demand removal efficiency increased to 51 7 when treated with as received clay and followed by 78 7 73 7 and 77 3 when treated with nanoclay soil at ph 4 6 and 10 respectively the chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency also increased to 32 4 when treated with as received soil followed by 66 7 70 62 7 when treated with ph 4 6 and 10 respectively the significant changes were noticed on the n adsorption capacity represented by the no3 removal efficiency of as received clay increased from 18 1 54 5 64 5 and 70 when treated with ph 4 6 and 10 respectively here we suggest that the surface charge of nanoclay particles in the basic condition is the important step to allow high n adsorption keywords phytoremediation nelumbo nucifera surface charge contaminant removal efficiency 1 introduction surface water pollution is majorly caused by the rainwater runoff that carries pollutants into the water body and decreases dissolved oxygen 1 according to mcisaac 2 the flow from the water drainage and irrigation system that lead to the surface water appears to be the hydrologic pathway that caused nitrogen n contamination that comes in both organic and inorganic forms the inorganic n mostly ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 are readily available to plants before the organic n can be taken up it must first be converted into inorganic forms soil microbes complete this process as a by product of organic matter decomposition known as mineralization 3 the long retention time of organic n before converted into inorganic n and accumulation of inorganic n in bulk affect the surface water s ecosystem 4 by improving the n cycle mechanism in surface water the macrophytes ability to perform its phytoremediation function to assimilate concentrate and store the converted contaminants can be improved as an alternative to the commercial methods that use physical and chemical processes 5 however macrophytes application in phytoremediation is less effective due to low nitrogen n and phosphorus p uptake for example the n uptake of several macrophytes species i e typha and juncus is within 600 2630 kg ha 1 yr 1 6 meanwhile macrophytes crops such as nelumbo nucifera only uptake about 27 8 kg ha 1 yr 1 although it has an advantage of providing sufficient oxygen and altering dissolved oxygen in the water column 7 1 9 in this work we focused on nelumbo nucifera since it is feasible to supply an adequate amount of 0 2 2 1 ml min of oxygen to increase the microbial activities for phytoremediation however the supplied gas is unable to solve the accumulation of n in the system and only indicates 18 1 of the total no3 removal efficiency under the nature ecosystem 10 if the plant is utilized for the phytoremediation process the no3 accumulation from the runoff water and the oxic or anoxic conditions from the underwater sediment can lead to the efflux of the total n in the system caused by the advective fluid flow that was demonstrated to influences the rates and pathways of n processing in the sediments 11 as a result phytoremediation alone is a less efficient and time consuming process 12 1 14 to minimize the n cycle s return to the bulk treated nanoclay particles with surface charge adjustment are introduced to the system to improve the total n accumulation according to huang yang and piwoni keeley 15 16 clay properties provide the sorptive sites for the contaminants to attach and accumulate onto its surface soil porosity and large surface area provide strong physical and chemical interactions and allow enormous microbial species for the plant growth and nutrient uptake because clay soil porosity possesses a high negative charge to contribute to strong attractive forces and bonding power 17 1 21 recently the contaminants were successfully removed by a combination of zeolite adsorption and echinodorus palaefolius phytoremediation 22 the utilization of different clay adsorption 20 and the utilization of scirpus grossus phytoremediation 23 numerous studies have previously been done on the utilization of clay for the adsorption purpose 20 21 the same goes for phytoremediation numerous studies have done on an aquatic plant s ability to treat wastewater 13 however the investigation of the soil used in the phytoremediation system is relatively scarce moreover the phytoremediation process alone has many limitations and needs to improve 10 12 13 this study helps to enhance the available phytoremediation process to provide better treated wastewater wastewater treatment workers may incorporate the treated nanoclay to improve the contaminants adsorption in the phytoremediation system therefore this study comes with a novel idea to utilize treated nanoclay in enhancing the phytoremediation system to the best of our knowledge no comprehensive research has been conducted in subjecting treated nanoclay into the phytoremediation system the combination of the phytoremediation plant and treated nanoclay soil with the acidic and basic solutions was performed to provide a large surface area with various ion exchange capacities to demonstrate the surface charge s role therefore this study aims to scientifically analyze and observe the water quality characteristic in terms of bod cod and no3 after subjecting the treated nanoclay soil to the phytoremediation system important parameters that influenced the n adsorptive capacity of clays such as soil size zeta potential nitrate concentration and plant condition were the subjects concerned 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil preparation the soil preparation was done according to tahir marschner 24 with modifications the as received clay soil was collected from the established paddy soil farm of the agriculture sector in universiti putra malaysia as received clay soil represents the natural soil directly taken from the site and has not undergone any treatment the soil was dried at 70 c overnight in an oven the dried soil was crushed using a commercial blender waring blender 8011s usa before sieving through 300 100 μm sieves the soil was mixed with 600 ml of distilled water in a beaker until the level reached 1000 ml a 10 μm microfiltration system that consisted of a water pump was set up at 2000 rpm to purify the samples from other debris and dirt after the filtration process the retentate soil sample underwent the earlier step and was subjected to a 5 μm microfiltration system coarse soils were discarded by filtering the soil mixtures into the 10 and 5 μm microfiltration system respectively and a vacuum pump removed the excess water the soil particle size distribution was measured using malvern mastersizer 2000 malvern panalytical ltd united kingdom 2 2 nanoclay soil preparation the nanoclay soil preparation was conducted based on a previous study by rasid et al and naim et al 10 25 from the same source of the purified as received clay soil the soil was dried under direct sunlight to facilitate the milling process the dried clay was milled using a cutting mill sm200 retsch germany to break the aggregate soil the fluidisation process was performed using a fluidized bed separator to separate the soil from other biomass contents embedded in the soil suitable compressed air supply was measured and chosen to provide the soil s optimum velocity or fluidization condition the separated soils were fluidized again to ensure the separation of particles into different sizes the clay particles with the larger size precipitated and smaller sized soil or impurities were suspended at the bed s surface the milled clay was fluidized using a swan 2 hp air cooled piston compressor svp 202 tong cheng iron works co taiwan with a maximum flow rate of 225 l min after the fluidization process the obtained soil was mixed with distilled water and subjected to an ultrasonic probe q500 sonicator qsonica us until the aggregated clay particles were dispersed and suspended in water the sonication condition was set to 500 w 20 khz and an amplitude of 50 for 10 min this ultrasonication is a secondary process that can break down the clay particles into smaller sizes and increase the particles surface area the suspended clay s surface charge was adjusted by mixing the particles in hcl and naoh solution for 24 h different ph values of 4 6 and 10 were used to adjust the particles surface charge from their natural condition finally the dried clay particles were prepared by drying the samples solution in an oven at 60 c for overnight and further ground using a laboratory mill 120 perten sweden 2 3 nanoclay particles stability analysis the stability analysis was done according to rasid et al and naim et al 10 25 the sonicated nanoclay particles ph value was adjusted to 4 6 and 10 using hcl and naoh the clays were allowed to sediment the solutions were centrifuged for 180 min at 5000 rpm using a 5804r centrifuge eppendorf malaysia to ensure that all particles greater than nanosize were not in the supernatant then the supernatant was injected into a flow cell for zeta potential measurement of the nanoclay particles the zeta potential values of the sonicated nanoclay particles at ph 4 6 and 10 were analyzed using the particulate systems zeta nanoparticle analyzer nanoplus micrometrics usa 2 4 phytoremediation experimental work the phytoremediation set up was done according to kanabkaew puetpaiboon 26 with modifications the adult nelumbo nucifera lotus plants with a length of 40 60 cm were collected from a local pond located in kampar perak malaysia the plants were re cultivated for adaptation purpose in polymer boxes of 180 5 90 60 cm l w h located at the faculty of engineering universiti putra malaysia upm the phytoremediation process was conducted in batch within 30 days the phytoremediation tank consisted of 500 g of prepared soil to mimic the plant s natural condition for treating the contaminated surface water sample the contaminated surface water was taken from a pond located in ladang 10 upm an agricultural practice area the source was filtered with a 5 μm microfiltration system still it consisted of dissolved contaminants from rainwater runoff such as nitrogen fertilizer and other chemicals involved in the agricultural activities the initial concentration of no3 was approximately 21 7 mg l for all samples the treatment condition was also applied to all lotus plant samples as shown in fig 1 a control experiment setup without soil and plant was set as a comparison the selected water quality analysis including bod cod and no3 were conducted every 5 days 2 5 bod cod and no3 analysis bod was defined as the amount of dissolved oxygen needed to break down organic matter biologically or microorganisms means 27 for bod measurement the sample was prepared by diluting the sample solution with water in a ratio of 1 9 three hundred millilitres sample was prepared and 1 ml of each alkaline iodide azide reagent and manganese sulphate solution mnso4 was added the solution was gently agitated in a bod flask after the precipitate settled down 1 ml of sulphuric acid solution h2so4 was added and the flask was gently agitated again then 2 ml of 0 1 starch solution was added into each flask sodium thiosulphate was used to titrate 200 ml of the sample until the solution changed to a clear solution the final reading was recorded as the initial dissolved oxygen do level the sample was incubated in an incubator at 20 c for 5 days and was titrated again the result was recorded as the final dissolved oxygen do level the value of bod5 was obtained using the following equation 1 b o d 5 m g l d o i d o f d i l u t i o n f a c t o r where doi is the dissolved oxygen level in the sample immediately after preparation and dof is the dissolved oxygen level in the sample after 5 days incubation at 20 c the bod removal efficiency was calculated using the following equation 23 2 bod removal efficiency b o d 0 b o d t b o d 0 100 where bod0 is the initial bod and bodt is the bod at day t cod represents the measurement of carbon bioavailability it is also defined as the amount of oxygen required to chemically oxidized organic matter that microorganisms may oxidize only partially or not at all 28 for cod analysis 2 5 ml of sample was filled into borosilicate culture tubes and 2 5 ml of distilled water was prepared as a blank sample then 1 5 ml of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 was added and the sample was refluxed by adding 3 5 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid 99 of h2so4 while holding the culture tubes at 45 the culture tubes were shaken until the colour of the solution changed to yellow the sample was left inside a block heater hole for 2 h at 150 c and was then left to cool after that the solution was titrated using 0 1 m of ferrous ammonium sulphate fas until the colour of the solution changed to reddish brown the reading of the final titration was recorded and cod levels were determined using the following equation 3 c o d m g l a b 8000 v o l u m e o f s a m p l e where a is the volume of fas used for blank ml b is the volume of fas used for the sample ml the cod removal efficiency was calculated using the following equation 23 4 c o d r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c o d 0 c o d t c o d 0 100 where cod0 is the initial cod and codt is the cod at day t meanwhile for nitrate measurement laquatwin nitrate meter horiba scientific japan was used in situ to measure the amount of nitrate in the water the water sample was dropped into the nitrate meter sensor and the reading measurement was taken after a constant reading was achieved 10 no3 became the parameter of concern in this study because during the phytoremediation the nitrosomonas and nitrobacter converted the excess nh4 initially to become nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 the accumulation of no3 contributes to the total n if the phytoremediation was too weak or fail to utilise the accumulated no3 the no3 removal efficiency was calculated using the following equation 29 5 no 3 removal efficiency n o 3 0 n o 3 t n o 3 0 100 where no3 0 is the initial nitrate concentration and no3 t is the nitrate concentration at day t all the parameter values were obtained according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 21st edition 2005 48 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristic of clay particles size and zeta potential when the purified clay was subjected to the sonication process at different ph values zeta potential value decreased from low ph acidic to high ph basic condition as shown in fig 2 a high ph value increases the electrostatic stabilization of the suspended clay from 4 to 42 5 mv from ph 2 to ph 10 the increased ph condition and the friction energy obtained from the ultrasound probe allow the particle size to reduce from 5 μm to 112 nm gradually deficient ph condition i e ph 2 seems unfavorable for size reduction purpose because the surface charge of the clay is close to the point of zero charges it eventually brought the clay particles to aggregate and sediment to the bottom instantaneously when the treated clay was introduced to the phytoremediation process thus only ph 4 6 and 10 were selected and subjected to the phytoremediation process fig 2 b presents the characteristics of the treated clay particles at ph 4 6 and 10 when subjected to the phytoremediation process consisting of the nelumbo nucifera plant at day 0 the zeta value of the treated nanoclay particles of ph 4 6 and 10 were 11 4 24 9 and 42 5 mv respectively from day 5 a significant reduction in zeta potential value was noticed for ph 6 and ph 10 from 20 8 and 14 4 mv respectively to approximately 8 mv on day 30 unfortunately only a slight reduction was noticed in ph 4 when all the samples were treated with nanoclay particles for 30 days the magnitude of zeta potential values converged to smaller values the zeta potential s average value was between 8 and 5 mv allow the particles to reach the sedimentation zone thus the merging lines represent the converging zeta potential value after the treated nanoclay was introduced to the phytoremediation process the converged values at day 30 show that the suspended nanoclay particles turned to be unstable aggregates and sediments at the bottom after the contaminants adsorption however no significant changes were noticed for the nanoclay particle size except for the highest zeta potential value of ph 4 that showed a slight reduction in particle size distribution from 112 nm to 58 8 nm on day 30 the significant change was difficult to observe due to the movement of plant petiole by the wind and eventually create a water movement along the phytoremediation process according to zhang 30 complex mechanisms such as agglomeration and sedimentation behavior occurred after the immobilization of contaminants to the adsorbent 3 2 soil properties and treated water removal efficiency the bod removal efficiency for the phytoremediation process using different soil types for 30 days of treatment is depicted in fig 3 table 1 shows the characteristics of the runoff surface water and nanoclay soil the initial bod and cod concentrations of the surface water were 95 and 78 4 mg l respectively all samples showed the increasing value of bod removal in day 5 except for the control experiment without nelumbo nucifera plant the negative bod removal efficiency indicates that the bod value at the specific day is higher than the initial bod value that might be due to the limited source of dissolved oxygen for microbial activities without the treated nanoclay and plant the bod removal percentage reduced to 6 1 on day 5 and decreased drastically to 188 6 on day 30 with the addition of the plant soil and the treated nanoclay the bod removal efficiency increased to 51 1 when treated with the as received clay and followed by 78 7 82 6 and 81 8 3 when treated with nanoclay soil at ph 4 6 and 10 respectively in day 5 after day 30 all samples showed an increment value of bod removal efficiency of 78 5 in general all the nanoclay soil samples reached its plateau between 78 9 81 8 after day 5 while the bod removal efficiency of the as received soil fluctuated between 50 8 78 from day 5 to day 30 o2 gas transportation limits the bod removal efficiency in this work since the plant itself can only supply about 0 2 2 1 ml min of o2 gases 10 moderate bod removal efficiency was obtained in this work due to the electrostatic force induced by soil surface charges of the treated soil unfavorable for adhesion of microbe to the soil colloids 31 thus decreasing the microbial activity the cod removal efficiency for all soil types during the phytoremediation process is shown in fig 4 without the treated nanoclay and plant the cod removal efficiency showed a negative value of 5 on day 5 and reduced to 104 on day 30 indicating cod s value in the water on the final day was higher compared to the initial day of treatment with the addition of the plant soil and the treated nanoclay the samples removal efficiency was further increased to 32 7 62 7 66 7 and 70 when treated with as received soil and nanoclay at ph 4 6 and 10 respectively in day 5 the cod removal efficiency is lower than bod removal efficiency due to the interference of chloride ions in the runoff fertilizer 32 33 because the sample source was obtained from the agriculture pond in ladang 10 upm according to terry 34 chloride ion in water with aquatic plants can only be reduced via the photosynthesis process referring to fig 4 the increasing value of 47 6 was noticed on day 10 when the sample was treated with the as received soil using the treated nanoclay soil the surface charge increment seems able to increase the adsorption of contaminants 35 36 thus increasing the cod removal at ph 4 6 and 10 nanoclay soil by 62 7 66 7 and 70 compared to the initial surface charge of from day 15 onwards thus we presumed that the nh4 and no2 no3 adsorption onto the treated clay particles might occur in the treated samples fig 5 a shows the plant leaves produced along the phytoremediation process the number of leaves increased and many leaves became wither and some of them already died a significant increase in the number of leaves and dissolved oxygen do value were noticed along the 30 days of treatment as indicated in fig 5 b the average do value for all samples was between 6 5 and 7 0 mg l on day 30 the increased number of leaves and do values were due to the capabilities of nelumbo nucifera to transport oxygen gas from the leaves down to the buried rhizomes through the petiole of the plant and the value decreased after the plant started to wither previous studies showed that the plant has two unique gas transport mechanisms that transport gases from the leaves down to the rhizomes 37 and carry the produced carbon dioxide from the rhizosphere up to the leaves 38 through the gas canals for the photosynthesis purpose 39 40 referring to our previous study the amount of do for all samples was about the same because all samples were about the same plant ages 10 25 the number of leaves of the nelumbo nucifera plant plays an important role in transporting oxygen from the surrounding to the buried rhizomes located beneath the water according to matthews 38 the stomata in the leaves can regulate the convective flow in the plant s gas pathway the study also proved that the leaves exposed to the high photon density could increase the internal stomata pressure and allow the entrapped oxygen to be thermodynamically driven down to the buried rhizome the excess oxygen penetrates the water body through the roots thus increasing the availability of do in the water the initial amount of nitrate in the water was 21 7 mg l in all samples after 5 days of phytoremediation as shown in fig 6 a the no3 removal efficiency for the sample treated with the as received clay was 18 1 while the removal efficiency of no3 increased to 54 5 64 5 70 when treated with the nanoclay at ph 4 6 and 10 respectively this might be due to the soil particle s ability that consists of surface charge to bind with no3 41 however without the plant and the nanoclay the no3 removal efficiency of the sample treated with fine soil was 10 2 and reduced to 130 1 after 30 days of treatment we believed that without any surface charge the samples could not attract and adsorb no3 that caused the no3 to accumulate in bulk as indicated in fig 6 the no3 removal efficiency values for the as received clay also seemed to fluctuate along the treatment process because the n contaminants were dynamically converted by the microbes at the rhizosphere and absorbed by the plant itself 7 the nelumbo nucifera plant could affect the amount of nitrate concentration in the water due to a sufficient oxygen supply for the conversion of ammonium ion into nitrate 42 this finding was in agreement with the results observed by kanabkaew 36 they found that the final amount of no3 in domestic wastewater was 0 048 mg l by using nelumbo nucifera 26 which was lower than the allowable nitrate concentration set by the department of environment malaysia doe at 10 mg l 43 typically aquatic plants such as nelumbo nucifera provide an adherent substrate for the microorganism to speed up the interception of organic colloidal matter surrounding the roots and help suppress suspended particles 44 with the sufficient supply of oxygen gas by the nelumbo nucifera plant the microbial activity increased and n contaminants rapid breakdown to ammonium and nitrate occurred the plant absorbs the accumulated nitrate located at the rhizosphere after the enzymatic reaction of nitrate reductase that converts nitrite into nitrate 45 the activity of nitrogen reductase nra is significant in producing the plant s protein as nelumbo nucifera rhizomes contain about 1 7 protein 0 1 fat 9 7 carbohydrate and 1 1 ash 46 a similar observation was also noticed by 47 they found that the amount of excess nitrate in the water can be transported efficiently by the soil that consists of fine porous particles and shows the capabilities to retain the nitrate longer than common or coarse soil 4 conclusion the increasing clay particle surface charge or zeta values provides 70 removal of the total free nh4 of a runoff agriculture source when the clay sediments the converted no3 that remains at the particle surface not release to bulk contributes to reducing total n in the system the condition allowed the slow nutrient uptake by macrophytes i e nelumbo nucifera to absorb the nutrients via the plant roots

13602,this study highlights the significance of increasing the phytoremediation treatment of nelumbo nucifera plant efficiency using treated nanoclay soil to adjust its surface charge the treated nanoclay consisted of zeta potential values of 11 41 28 7 and 42 5 mv for ph 4 6 and 10 respectively the biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrate removals no3 for the reference samples were 6 1 5 and 10 2 respectively without the plant and soil on day 5 of observation with the plant the biochemical oxygen demand removal efficiency increased to 51 7 when treated with as received clay and followed by 78 7 73 7 and 77 3 when treated with nanoclay soil at ph 4 6 and 10 respectively the chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency also increased to 32 4 when treated with as received soil followed by 66 7 70 62 7 when treated with ph 4 6 and 10 respectively the significant changes were noticed on the n adsorption capacity represented by the no3 removal efficiency of as received clay increased from 18 1 54 5 64 5 and 70 when treated with ph 4 6 and 10 respectively here we suggest that the surface charge of nanoclay particles in the basic condition is the important step to allow high n adsorption keywords phytoremediation nelumbo nucifera surface charge contaminant removal efficiency 1 introduction surface water pollution is majorly caused by the rainwater runoff that carries pollutants into the water body and decreases dissolved oxygen 1 according to mcisaac 2 the flow from the water drainage and irrigation system that lead to the surface water appears to be the hydrologic pathway that caused nitrogen n contamination that comes in both organic and inorganic forms the inorganic n mostly ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 are readily available to plants before the organic n can be taken up it must first be converted into inorganic forms soil microbes complete this process as a by product of organic matter decomposition known as mineralization 3 the long retention time of organic n before converted into inorganic n and accumulation of inorganic n in bulk affect the surface water s ecosystem 4 by improving the n cycle mechanism in surface water the macrophytes ability to perform its phytoremediation function to assimilate concentrate and store the converted contaminants can be improved as an alternative to the commercial methods that use physical and chemical processes 5 however macrophytes application in phytoremediation is less effective due to low nitrogen n and phosphorus p uptake for example the n uptake of several macrophytes species i e typha and juncus is within 600 2630 kg ha 1 yr 1 6 meanwhile macrophytes crops such as nelumbo nucifera only uptake about 27 8 kg ha 1 yr 1 although it has an advantage of providing sufficient oxygen and altering dissolved oxygen in the water column 7 1 9 in this work we focused on nelumbo nucifera since it is feasible to supply an adequate amount of 0 2 2 1 ml min of oxygen to increase the microbial activities for phytoremediation however the supplied gas is unable to solve the accumulation of n in the system and only indicates 18 1 of the total no3 removal efficiency under the nature ecosystem 10 if the plant is utilized for the phytoremediation process the no3 accumulation from the runoff water and the oxic or anoxic conditions from the underwater sediment can lead to the efflux of the total n in the system caused by the advective fluid flow that was demonstrated to influences the rates and pathways of n processing in the sediments 11 as a result phytoremediation alone is a less efficient and time consuming process 12 1 14 to minimize the n cycle s return to the bulk treated nanoclay particles with surface charge adjustment are introduced to the system to improve the total n accumulation according to huang yang and piwoni keeley 15 16 clay properties provide the sorptive sites for the contaminants to attach and accumulate onto its surface soil porosity and large surface area provide strong physical and chemical interactions and allow enormous microbial species for the plant growth and nutrient uptake because clay soil porosity possesses a high negative charge to contribute to strong attractive forces and bonding power 17 1 21 recently the contaminants were successfully removed by a combination of zeolite adsorption and echinodorus palaefolius phytoremediation 22 the utilization of different clay adsorption 20 and the utilization of scirpus grossus phytoremediation 23 numerous studies have previously been done on the utilization of clay for the adsorption purpose 20 21 the same goes for phytoremediation numerous studies have done on an aquatic plant s ability to treat wastewater 13 however the investigation of the soil used in the phytoremediation system is relatively scarce moreover the phytoremediation process alone has many limitations and needs to improve 10 12 13 this study helps to enhance the available phytoremediation process to provide better treated wastewater wastewater treatment workers may incorporate the treated nanoclay to improve the contaminants adsorption in the phytoremediation system therefore this study comes with a novel idea to utilize treated nanoclay in enhancing the phytoremediation system to the best of our knowledge no comprehensive research has been conducted in subjecting treated nanoclay into the phytoremediation system the combination of the phytoremediation plant and treated nanoclay soil with the acidic and basic solutions was performed to provide a large surface area with various ion exchange capacities to demonstrate the surface charge s role therefore this study aims to scientifically analyze and observe the water quality characteristic in terms of bod cod and no3 after subjecting the treated nanoclay soil to the phytoremediation system important parameters that influenced the n adsorptive capacity of clays such as soil size zeta potential nitrate concentration and plant condition were the subjects concerned 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil preparation the soil preparation was done according to tahir marschner 24 with modifications the as received clay soil was collected from the established paddy soil farm of the agriculture sector in universiti putra malaysia as received clay soil represents the natural soil directly taken from the site and has not undergone any treatment the soil was dried at 70 c overnight in an oven the dried soil was crushed using a commercial blender waring blender 8011s usa before sieving through 300 100 μm sieves the soil was mixed with 600 ml of distilled water in a beaker until the level reached 1000 ml a 10 μm microfiltration system that consisted of a water pump was set up at 2000 rpm to purify the samples from other debris and dirt after the filtration process the retentate soil sample underwent the earlier step and was subjected to a 5 μm microfiltration system coarse soils were discarded by filtering the soil mixtures into the 10 and 5 μm microfiltration system respectively and a vacuum pump removed the excess water the soil particle size distribution was measured using malvern mastersizer 2000 malvern panalytical ltd united kingdom 2 2 nanoclay soil preparation the nanoclay soil preparation was conducted based on a previous study by rasid et al and naim et al 10 25 from the same source of the purified as received clay soil the soil was dried under direct sunlight to facilitate the milling process the dried clay was milled using a cutting mill sm200 retsch germany to break the aggregate soil the fluidisation process was performed using a fluidized bed separator to separate the soil from other biomass contents embedded in the soil suitable compressed air supply was measured and chosen to provide the soil s optimum velocity or fluidization condition the separated soils were fluidized again to ensure the separation of particles into different sizes the clay particles with the larger size precipitated and smaller sized soil or impurities were suspended at the bed s surface the milled clay was fluidized using a swan 2 hp air cooled piston compressor svp 202 tong cheng iron works co taiwan with a maximum flow rate of 225 l min after the fluidization process the obtained soil was mixed with distilled water and subjected to an ultrasonic probe q500 sonicator qsonica us until the aggregated clay particles were dispersed and suspended in water the sonication condition was set to 500 w 20 khz and an amplitude of 50 for 10 min this ultrasonication is a secondary process that can break down the clay particles into smaller sizes and increase the particles surface area the suspended clay s surface charge was adjusted by mixing the particles in hcl and naoh solution for 24 h different ph values of 4 6 and 10 were used to adjust the particles surface charge from their natural condition finally the dried clay particles were prepared by drying the samples solution in an oven at 60 c for overnight and further ground using a laboratory mill 120 perten sweden 2 3 nanoclay particles stability analysis the stability analysis was done according to rasid et al and naim et al 10 25 the sonicated nanoclay particles ph value was adjusted to 4 6 and 10 using hcl and naoh the clays were allowed to sediment the solutions were centrifuged for 180 min at 5000 rpm using a 5804r centrifuge eppendorf malaysia to ensure that all particles greater than nanosize were not in the supernatant then the supernatant was injected into a flow cell for zeta potential measurement of the nanoclay particles the zeta potential values of the sonicated nanoclay particles at ph 4 6 and 10 were analyzed using the particulate systems zeta nanoparticle analyzer nanoplus micrometrics usa 2 4 phytoremediation experimental work the phytoremediation set up was done according to kanabkaew puetpaiboon 26 with modifications the adult nelumbo nucifera lotus plants with a length of 40 60 cm were collected from a local pond located in kampar perak malaysia the plants were re cultivated for adaptation purpose in polymer boxes of 180 5 90 60 cm l w h located at the faculty of engineering universiti putra malaysia upm the phytoremediation process was conducted in batch within 30 days the phytoremediation tank consisted of 500 g of prepared soil to mimic the plant s natural condition for treating the contaminated surface water sample the contaminated surface water was taken from a pond located in ladang 10 upm an agricultural practice area the source was filtered with a 5 μm microfiltration system still it consisted of dissolved contaminants from rainwater runoff such as nitrogen fertilizer and other chemicals involved in the agricultural activities the initial concentration of no3 was approximately 21 7 mg l for all samples the treatment condition was also applied to all lotus plant samples as shown in fig 1 a control experiment setup without soil and plant was set as a comparison the selected water quality analysis including bod cod and no3 were conducted every 5 days 2 5 bod cod and no3 analysis bod was defined as the amount of dissolved oxygen needed to break down organic matter biologically or microorganisms means 27 for bod measurement the sample was prepared by diluting the sample solution with water in a ratio of 1 9 three hundred millilitres sample was prepared and 1 ml of each alkaline iodide azide reagent and manganese sulphate solution mnso4 was added the solution was gently agitated in a bod flask after the precipitate settled down 1 ml of sulphuric acid solution h2so4 was added and the flask was gently agitated again then 2 ml of 0 1 starch solution was added into each flask sodium thiosulphate was used to titrate 200 ml of the sample until the solution changed to a clear solution the final reading was recorded as the initial dissolved oxygen do level the sample was incubated in an incubator at 20 c for 5 days and was titrated again the result was recorded as the final dissolved oxygen do level the value of bod5 was obtained using the following equation 1 b o d 5 m g l d o i d o f d i l u t i o n f a c t o r where doi is the dissolved oxygen level in the sample immediately after preparation and dof is the dissolved oxygen level in the sample after 5 days incubation at 20 c the bod removal efficiency was calculated using the following equation 23 2 bod removal efficiency b o d 0 b o d t b o d 0 100 where bod0 is the initial bod and bodt is the bod at day t cod represents the measurement of carbon bioavailability it is also defined as the amount of oxygen required to chemically oxidized organic matter that microorganisms may oxidize only partially or not at all 28 for cod analysis 2 5 ml of sample was filled into borosilicate culture tubes and 2 5 ml of distilled water was prepared as a blank sample then 1 5 ml of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 was added and the sample was refluxed by adding 3 5 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid 99 of h2so4 while holding the culture tubes at 45 the culture tubes were shaken until the colour of the solution changed to yellow the sample was left inside a block heater hole for 2 h at 150 c and was then left to cool after that the solution was titrated using 0 1 m of ferrous ammonium sulphate fas until the colour of the solution changed to reddish brown the reading of the final titration was recorded and cod levels were determined using the following equation 3 c o d m g l a b 8000 v o l u m e o f s a m p l e where a is the volume of fas used for blank ml b is the volume of fas used for the sample ml the cod removal efficiency was calculated using the following equation 23 4 c o d r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c o d 0 c o d t c o d 0 100 where cod0 is the initial cod and codt is the cod at day t meanwhile for nitrate measurement laquatwin nitrate meter horiba scientific japan was used in situ to measure the amount of nitrate in the water the water sample was dropped into the nitrate meter sensor and the reading measurement was taken after a constant reading was achieved 10 no3 became the parameter of concern in this study because during the phytoremediation the nitrosomonas and nitrobacter converted the excess nh4 initially to become nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 the accumulation of no3 contributes to the total n if the phytoremediation was too weak or fail to utilise the accumulated no3 the no3 removal efficiency was calculated using the following equation 29 5 no 3 removal efficiency n o 3 0 n o 3 t n o 3 0 100 where no3 0 is the initial nitrate concentration and no3 t is the nitrate concentration at day t all the parameter values were obtained according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 21st edition 2005 48 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristic of clay particles size and zeta potential when the purified clay was subjected to the sonication process at different ph values zeta potential value decreased from low ph acidic to high ph basic condition as shown in fig 2 a high ph value increases the electrostatic stabilization of the suspended clay from 4 to 42 5 mv from ph 2 to ph 10 the increased ph condition and the friction energy obtained from the ultrasound probe allow the particle size to reduce from 5 μm to 112 nm gradually deficient ph condition i e ph 2 seems unfavorable for size reduction purpose because the surface charge of the clay is close to the point of zero charges it eventually brought the clay particles to aggregate and sediment to the bottom instantaneously when the treated clay was introduced to the phytoremediation process thus only ph 4 6 and 10 were selected and subjected to the phytoremediation process fig 2 b presents the characteristics of the treated clay particles at ph 4 6 and 10 when subjected to the phytoremediation process consisting of the nelumbo nucifera plant at day 0 the zeta value of the treated nanoclay particles of ph 4 6 and 10 were 11 4 24 9 and 42 5 mv respectively from day 5 a significant reduction in zeta potential value was noticed for ph 6 and ph 10 from 20 8 and 14 4 mv respectively to approximately 8 mv on day 30 unfortunately only a slight reduction was noticed in ph 4 when all the samples were treated with nanoclay particles for 30 days the magnitude of zeta potential values converged to smaller values the zeta potential s average value was between 8 and 5 mv allow the particles to reach the sedimentation zone thus the merging lines represent the converging zeta potential value after the treated nanoclay was introduced to the phytoremediation process the converged values at day 30 show that the suspended nanoclay particles turned to be unstable aggregates and sediments at the bottom after the contaminants adsorption however no significant changes were noticed for the nanoclay particle size except for the highest zeta potential value of ph 4 that showed a slight reduction in particle size distribution from 112 nm to 58 8 nm on day 30 the significant change was difficult to observe due to the movement of plant petiole by the wind and eventually create a water movement along the phytoremediation process according to zhang 30 complex mechanisms such as agglomeration and sedimentation behavior occurred after the immobilization of contaminants to the adsorbent 3 2 soil properties and treated water removal efficiency the bod removal efficiency for the phytoremediation process using different soil types for 30 days of treatment is depicted in fig 3 table 1 shows the characteristics of the runoff surface water and nanoclay soil the initial bod and cod concentrations of the surface water were 95 and 78 4 mg l respectively all samples showed the increasing value of bod removal in day 5 except for the control experiment without nelumbo nucifera plant the negative bod removal efficiency indicates that the bod value at the specific day is higher than the initial bod value that might be due to the limited source of dissolved oxygen for microbial activities without the treated nanoclay and plant the bod removal percentage reduced to 6 1 on day 5 and decreased drastically to 188 6 on day 30 with the addition of the plant soil and the treated nanoclay the bod removal efficiency increased to 51 1 when treated with the as received clay and followed by 78 7 82 6 and 81 8 3 when treated with nanoclay soil at ph 4 6 and 10 respectively in day 5 after day 30 all samples showed an increment value of bod removal efficiency of 78 5 in general all the nanoclay soil samples reached its plateau between 78 9 81 8 after day 5 while the bod removal efficiency of the as received soil fluctuated between 50 8 78 from day 5 to day 30 o2 gas transportation limits the bod removal efficiency in this work since the plant itself can only supply about 0 2 2 1 ml min of o2 gases 10 moderate bod removal efficiency was obtained in this work due to the electrostatic force induced by soil surface charges of the treated soil unfavorable for adhesion of microbe to the soil colloids 31 thus decreasing the microbial activity the cod removal efficiency for all soil types during the phytoremediation process is shown in fig 4 without the treated nanoclay and plant the cod removal efficiency showed a negative value of 5 on day 5 and reduced to 104 on day 30 indicating cod s value in the water on the final day was higher compared to the initial day of treatment with the addition of the plant soil and the treated nanoclay the samples removal efficiency was further increased to 32 7 62 7 66 7 and 70 when treated with as received soil and nanoclay at ph 4 6 and 10 respectively in day 5 the cod removal efficiency is lower than bod removal efficiency due to the interference of chloride ions in the runoff fertilizer 32 33 because the sample source was obtained from the agriculture pond in ladang 10 upm according to terry 34 chloride ion in water with aquatic plants can only be reduced via the photosynthesis process referring to fig 4 the increasing value of 47 6 was noticed on day 10 when the sample was treated with the as received soil using the treated nanoclay soil the surface charge increment seems able to increase the adsorption of contaminants 35 36 thus increasing the cod removal at ph 4 6 and 10 nanoclay soil by 62 7 66 7 and 70 compared to the initial surface charge of from day 15 onwards thus we presumed that the nh4 and no2 no3 adsorption onto the treated clay particles might occur in the treated samples fig 5 a shows the plant leaves produced along the phytoremediation process the number of leaves increased and many leaves became wither and some of them already died a significant increase in the number of leaves and dissolved oxygen do value were noticed along the 30 days of treatment as indicated in fig 5 b the average do value for all samples was between 6 5 and 7 0 mg l on day 30 the increased number of leaves and do values were due to the capabilities of nelumbo nucifera to transport oxygen gas from the leaves down to the buried rhizomes through the petiole of the plant and the value decreased after the plant started to wither previous studies showed that the plant has two unique gas transport mechanisms that transport gases from the leaves down to the rhizomes 37 and carry the produced carbon dioxide from the rhizosphere up to the leaves 38 through the gas canals for the photosynthesis purpose 39 40 referring to our previous study the amount of do for all samples was about the same because all samples were about the same plant ages 10 25 the number of leaves of the nelumbo nucifera plant plays an important role in transporting oxygen from the surrounding to the buried rhizomes located beneath the water according to matthews 38 the stomata in the leaves can regulate the convective flow in the plant s gas pathway the study also proved that the leaves exposed to the high photon density could increase the internal stomata pressure and allow the entrapped oxygen to be thermodynamically driven down to the buried rhizome the excess oxygen penetrates the water body through the roots thus increasing the availability of do in the water the initial amount of nitrate in the water was 21 7 mg l in all samples after 5 days of phytoremediation as shown in fig 6 a the no3 removal efficiency for the sample treated with the as received clay was 18 1 while the removal efficiency of no3 increased to 54 5 64 5 70 when treated with the nanoclay at ph 4 6 and 10 respectively this might be due to the soil particle s ability that consists of surface charge to bind with no3 41 however without the plant and the nanoclay the no3 removal efficiency of the sample treated with fine soil was 10 2 and reduced to 130 1 after 30 days of treatment we believed that without any surface charge the samples could not attract and adsorb no3 that caused the no3 to accumulate in bulk as indicated in fig 6 the no3 removal efficiency values for the as received clay also seemed to fluctuate along the treatment process because the n contaminants were dynamically converted by the microbes at the rhizosphere and absorbed by the plant itself 7 the nelumbo nucifera plant could affect the amount of nitrate concentration in the water due to a sufficient oxygen

13603,choline chloride chcl based natural deep eutectic solvents nades were synthesized and tested as coagulant for stable bentonite colloidal suspensions in this work three chcl based natural deep eutectic solvent nades were synthesized by mixing choline chloride as the hydrogen bond acceptor hba with lactic acid la malic acid ma and citric acid ca as the hydrogen bond donors hbd with a molar ratio of 1 1 the analysis showed that there is no significant difference in the result however chcl la was the easiest to synthesize and showed slightly higher efficiency at low dosage for the determination of the optimum conditions response surface methodology with central composite design was employed to generate an experimental design with two controlled variables the chcl la dosage and the bentonite solid content the turbidity removal percentage the reduction in zeta potential the variation in the floc size of the sediments and ph of the system were the design responses however due to the high turbidity removal percentage even at lower dosage of the coagulant and the constant removal percentage of almost 99 led to excluding the turbidity as a response as it proves to be insignificant by performing a multiple response optimization on the designed experiment the optimum condition for the destabilization and separation process that results in a zeta potential of 5 8 mv a ph of 2 2 d50 of 31 5 μm and a d90 63 8 μm was found to be 77 mm and 3 48 g l 1 for the chcl la dosage and the bentonite solid content respectively keywords choline chloride nades colloids coagulation response surface methodology bentonite 1 introduction bentonite is a clay mineral that forms as a result of natural phenomena of volcanic ash weathering in the presence of water 1 it is mainly composed of montmorillonite which represents the major structure in addition to other minerals such as illite quartz pyrite calcite feldspars iron oxides hydroxides and other types of minerals depending on the composition of bentonite mineralogical properties of the clay vary making it suitable for a wide range of applications 2 3 generally bentonite consists of three layers one octahedral layer of aluminum oxide al2o3 between two tetrahedral sheets of silicon oxide sio2 bentonite particles have a platelet like structure with a negative net charge as a result of the isomorphic substitution of al 3 ions in the octahedral layer with lower valence ions like mg 2 and fe 2 and the substitution of si 4 in the tetrahedral layer with al 3 ion 4 5 bentonite has micro particles d50 2 μm leading to a very high surface area with negative zeta potential ζ 35 mv hence when dispersed in aqueous media it forms a highly stable suspension with the help of brownian motion known as colloidal dispersion 6 large amounts of wastewater containing stable colloidal dispersions are being generated continuously in many industrial applications because of the high consumption of clay minerals in general colloids in wastewater are very fine particles of less than 2 μm size and are described as a highly stable suspension that is difficult to separate due to its small size and the repulsion forces between the particles hindering their ability to settle 7 several solid liquid separation methods can be employed to clarify colloidal wastewater however some constraints including efficiency cost and energy requirements limit their application for colloidal wastewater treatment 8 11 coagulation and flocculation are the most suitable solid liquid separation techniques for the treatment of colloidal suspension as they are highly efficient economical and have low cost and energy requirements 12 coagulant or flocculant or a combination of both are used in order to destabilize the clay particles by inducing attractive forces van der waals forces helping the particles to come together and form aggregates or flocs in aqueous media colloidal particles develop an electrical double layer edl around the particle s surface the edl consists of two chief layers the inner stern layer where the charges on the particle s surface usually negative attract ions opposite in nature forming a rigid stationary layer due to the high density of counter ions and the outer diffused layer where co and counter ions are dispersed and can move freely due to diffusion 13 14 the difference in the electrical potential between the inner stern layer and the outer diffused layer is known as the zeta potential ζ potential ζ potential is an essential parameter in investigating the colloidal stability as it provides an indication on the magnitude of the repulsion forces between the particles a highly positive or a highly negative zeta potential ζ 30 m v o r ζ 30 m v implies greater repulsion between the colloidal particles and hence more stable suspension 5 as the ζ potential values approach zero the repulsion forces between the particles decrease reducing the stability of the system destabilization of colloidal systems through the reduction of the negative or positive zeta potential values with the assistant of a destabilizing agent is considered as the key principle in the coagulation and flocculation processes 12 different types of chemicals were used as destabilizing agents for coagulation and flocculation of colloidal suspension including metal salts such as aluminum and iron salts and polyelectrolytes 15 in recent years the use of polyelectrolytes as a flocculant has become a common practice due to their efficiency in treating colloidal suspension through bridging mechanism 12 polyelectrolyte such as polyacrylamide pam has been widely used for the separation of colloidal particles from industrial wastewater 7 16 18 flocculation of fine colloidal particles using polyelectrolytes such as polyacrylamide pam may occur through different mechanisms polymer adsorption and bridging charge neutralization particle surface complex formation and depletion flocculation or by a combination of these mechanisms 19 the flocculation negative colloidal particle using cationic pam is widely used in destabilization and separation of stable colloidal particles and this occurs through the cationic polymer chains adsorption via hydrogen bonding interactions between the particle surface and polymer s primary amide functional groups thus charge neutralization becomes a major mechanism where the cationic polyacrylamides will locally reverse the particle surface charge 12 deep eutectic solvents des were reported for the first time in 2003 by abbot et al 20 as a possible alternative for ionic liquids il dess are described as a combination of two components at least at a certain molar ration forming eutectic mixture the constituent components are defined as hydrogen bond donor and acceptor hbd and hba hence they associate together through the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds 21 22 the term deep in des comes from the deep depression in the melting point of both hba and hbd leading to the formation of a liquid mixture at room temperature 23 25 des has a very simple preparation technique that depends on continuously heating the components at moderate temperatures coupled with vigorous mixing until a clear homogenous liquid is formed when des is formed from natural components mainly primary metabolites such as organic acids sugars amino acids choline salts and alcohols the resultant des is defined as natural deep eutectic solvents nades 26 nadess have favorable characteristics as they are composed of non toxic and widely abundant materials consequently the synthesis process of such solvents is very simple time efficient and economical making them a potential green alternative for some industrial solvents 27 furthermore nades properties are tunable through the manipulation of their composition by varying the molar ratio of the components and the water content making them a suitable industrial solvent for a wide range of applications such as gas absorption co2 and so2 lead removal fuel purification and nanoparticle fabrication 23 28 33 furthermore dess can be used in the removal of metal oxides and heavy metal in addition to the preparation production and purification of bio diesel 34 38 the appropriate implementation of the destabilization and separation process is essential in order to achieve the desired results of the maximum reduction in negative zeta potential and turbidity and maximizing the produced flocs size which is important for further handling and treatment the right execution depends mainly on the concentration of the selected coagulant ph and the suspended solid content initial turbidity 39 in traditional practices process optimization is done by optimizing each variable individually where one variable is changing while the rest remains constant however it is a time consuming and unreliable process as it does not take into consideration the interactions between the different variables therefore using a computational method to study the relation between the variables and their effect on the studied responses is necessary to find the optimum operating conditions that attain the targeted results 40 response surface methodology rsm is a statistical and mathematical method that combines experimental design regression analysis and optimization methods to optimize the process conditions by providing an experimental design with a specified number of experiments thus reducing the required time and improving the accuracy of the obtained results 40 41 generally rsm is employed for modeling and optimization of processes with a number of independent variables that influence the behavior and the performance of the system 42 rsm can be conducted by different sampling methods such as central composite design full factorial and box behnken central composite design ccd is a sampling design method commonly used in rsm to generate a quadratic second order model by selecting central axial and corner points without the need to perform a full factorial design according to eq 1 the design will have a total of nine experiments one run at the central point 0 0 four runs at the axial points 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 and another four runs at the corner points 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 n 2 k 2 k 1 where n is the total experimental runs and k is the number of the studied variables however in ccd designs additional replicate runs of the central point are required usually four resulting in increasing the total number of experiments to exceed n 43 in our recent study chcl la based nades was proven to be highly efficient for destabilization and aggregation of colloidal particles in suspension 44 the coagulation was proposed to take place through electrostatic patch mechanism esp patches of the negatively charged colloids were neutralized by adsorption of the cationic coagulant resulting in high turbidity removal of 99 8 with a negative zeta potential of 18 8 m v and loose micro flocs 44 therefore this paper further investigates the use of choline chloride based nades as a destabilizing agent for stable colloids under different conditions a comparative study was performed to analyze the performance of three choline chloride based nades with different hydrogen bond donors lactic acid malic acid and citric acid as a coagulant for highly stable bentonite suspension furthermore response surface methodology rsm and central composite design ccd were used to design a set of experiments to investigate the effect of the coagulant dosage and the suspension s solid content on the destabilization process of bentonite suspension using choline chloride lactic acid based chcl la nades the effects of these two variables were recorded in terms of zeta potential ph and turbidity reduction in addition to the variation in the size of the formed flocs furthermore the experimental results in combination with the computational methods were employed to determine the optimum operating conditions for the process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study were purchased from sigma aldrich table 1 shows the utilized chemicals with their specification including the structure purity molecular weight melting point and their cas number bentonite cas number 1302 78 9 was used with deionized water at room temperature of 25 to prepare the bentonite suspension 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 synthesis of nades three different choline chloride based natural deep eutectic solvents were prepared with the lactic acid chcl la malic acid chcl ma and citric acid chcl ca as the hydrogen bond donors with a molar ratio of 1 1 for hba to hbd the appropriate amount of each component was measured using an analytical balance isolab and placed in a pear shaped flask the flask was attached to a rotatory evaporator heidolph 2 g3 hei vap precision where the synthesis of nades was carried out at atmospheric pressure with vigorous mixing at 200 rpm and continuous heating using an oil bath at 80 the preparation time varied from 1 h to 24 h depending on the selected hbd after the formation of a transparent homogenous liquid nades was stored in an airtight container at room temperature 2 2 2 density and thermogravimetric analysis tga density measurement and thermogravimetric analysis tga for chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca nadess samples were performed and compared with the literature the density was measured with an anton paar dma 4500 m densitometer calibrated with water as a reference the density for each sample was measured with respect to temperature at atmospheric pressure over a range from room temperature up to 363 15 k however for chcl ca the measurements were conducted over a temperature varying from 318 15 k to 338 15 k as it is solid at room temperature and has a relatively high melting temperature of 316 15 1 5 k compared to the other nadess perkinelmer pyris 6 tga instrument calibrated with calcium oxalate sample was employed to conduct a thermogravimetric analysis on the studied nades systems chcl la chcl ma chcl ca the measurements were conducted with temperature ranging from 303 k to 1050 k with an increase rate of 5 k per minute to analyze the thermal behavior and determine the decomposition and onset temperatures the measurements were done under an environment of nitrogen gas to generate a weight loss curve 2 2 3 ft ir spectroscopy nicolet is10 thermo scientific ftir spectrometer was used to create the fourier transform infrared spectrums for all raw components chcl la ma and ca in addition to the spectrum of the three synthesized nadess chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca the spectrums were generated by running 24 scans for each sample over a wavenumber between 400 c m 1 and 4000 c m 1 and a resolution of 16 c m 1 2 2 4 response surface methodology experimental design and analysis of the obtained data were done through minitab software version 17 the design was generated using response surface methodology rsm in combination with the central composite design method ccd in order to find the optimized conditions for the coagulation process using choline chloride based nades as a coagulant the bentonite concentration in water and the chcl la dosage were selected as the two dominating variables in the studied process the ranges of both independent variables with the corresponding level for each are presented in table 2 the ranges of the independent variables were selected according to a set of experiments conducted to roughly estimate the operating conditions that maximize the turbidity removal floc size and zeta potential reduction separately table 3 shows the full factorial ccd design 9 experiments in addition to four replicate experiments for the central points run number 3 6 7 and 11 which are required to estimate the percentage error involved in the developed model 45 the two independent variables are expressed in terms of their original units in panel b mm for the chcl la dosage and gl 1 for the bentonite concentration alongside the design code panel a the design code values were as follows maximum point 2 1 central point 0 1 and minimum point 2 the results of each experiment were represented in terms of four dependent variables or also known as responses which are zeta potential turbidity removal percentage floc size and ph the selection of the optimum conditions for the designed process was based on the analyzed data of the four responses and predicted using the following second order quadratic equation 46 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β i i x i 2 i i j k j k β i j x i x j e where i j and β are the linear the quadratic and the regression coefficients respectively while k is the number of independent variables of the designed experiment and e is the random error 39 the relationship between the two variables and the responses in addition to the significance of the model was evaluated using the p value with a confidence interval of 95 therefore models and interactions between the variables and the responses with p value below 5 0 05 are identified as significant on the other hand when the p value is higher than 0 05 this indicates that the studied variable or relationship is insignificant and does not have an effect on the process 47 furthermore the quality of the fit of the experimental data to the polynomial model was assessed through the correlation coefficient r2 and adjusted r2 the closer the value of r2 to unity the better the fit of the produced model 2 2 5 coagulation jar test to study the performance of the three tested coagulants chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca two solid concentrations were employed for the preparation of bentonite suspension 1 5 gl 1 to study the reduction in turbidity and negative zeta potential and 3 gl 1 to determine the change in the floc size bentonite was homogenized with one liter of deionized water using a homogenizer fisher scientific 1000 for five minutes the coagulation test was conducted in a jar test apparatus with six compartments stuart flocculator sw6 the required dosage of the coagulants was added to the corresponding suspension followed by a high mixing at 180 rmp for 30 s to uniformly disperse the coagulant then for 20 min a slow mixing stage at 50 rmp took place to promote flocs formation 48 in addition the effect of the constituent components of chch la nades were studied as a mixture chcl la and individually chcl or la as a function of concentration fig 1 explains the difference in the addition mechanisms for the different coagulants fig 1b shows the addition steps and jar test for any chcl la mixture where the la was added to the suspensions followed by high mixing for 30 s then chcl was added and mixed at high rotational speed for 30 s after which slow mixing took place multiple addition mechanisms for the mixture were analyzed including the addition of lactic acid first followed by choline chloride choline chloride followed by lactic acid or the addition of both components at the same time the addition of lactic acid followed by choline chloride showed the best performance as the acid partially neutralizes the negative charge on the bentonite s surface by changing the medium ph from 9 0 3 2 then choline chloride brings the particles together and larger flocs start forming on the other hand for the optimization study bentonite suspensions were prepared by mixing the appropriate amount of bentonite provided in table 2 in one liter of deionized water the mixture was homogenized using a fisher scientific homogenizer the required dosage of the coagulant was added according to table 2 to the corresponding suspension followed by the same steps for the coagulation test using the jar test apparatus 2 2 6 responses measurements the effects of the studied variables coagulant dosage and bentonite concentration were examined in terms of four responses which are zeta potential turbidity floc size and ph after the coagulation test was completed a settling time of two minutes was recorded before the extraction of the supernatant for turbidity and zeta potential measurements 50 ml samples of the supernatant were extracted from a location 150 ml above the interface layer between the sediment and the supernatant using a micropipette thermo scientific finnpipette f2 turbidity and zeta potential were measured on the same day of conducting the experiment at room temperature with a turbidity meter hach 2100 n and a zetasizer zen3600 respectively the obtained values for both residual turbidity and reduction in negative zeta potential serve as an indicator of the coagulant removal efficiency for floc size measurements the flocs were allowed to completely settle 10 15 minutes before taking samples of the flocs from near the bottom of the beaker using a pipette the particle size distribution test was conducted 24 h after the experiment to ensure the stabilization of the flocs the measurements were performed through mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments with a rotational speed of 1500 rpm floc size is usually interpreted in terms of the median diameter d50 which provides the flocs diameter at a cumulative distribution of 50 this measurement in combination with zeta potential can provide a better understanding of the coagulation mechanism exhibited by the system and the strength of the resultant flocs ph readings were recorded using hach hq11d ph meter the treated suspension was stirred continuously using a magnetic stirrer while taking the reading to guarantee the uniform distribution of the system components to ensure the reproducibility of the result replicates measurements of each parameter were taken with an error percentage lower than 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 density and thermal stability the change in density of the studied nades systems as a function of temperature in addition to their thermal gravimetric analysis are shown in fig 2 at a room temperature of around 298 15 k and atmospheric pressure 1 bar the density for chcl la and chcl ma were measured to be 1 159 gcm 3 and 1 278 gcm 3 respectively on the other hand chcl ca at 298 15 k was solid and density measurement was not possible to perform at 318 18 k the density was found to be 1 31 gcm 3 furthermore from fig 2a the density is observed to exhibit a linear decrease with a regression coefficient of 0 99 with increasing the temperature the reduction in density is attributed to the increase in volume as a result of higher molecular activities in the system consequently comparing the overall trend between the three studied systems chcl ca shows the highest density values followed by chcl ma and lastly chcl la nades stability is a function of their constituent components hba and hbd and their molar ratio studying the thermal stability of nades and determining their decomposition temperature is an essential step for optimizing the operational temperature of the process utilizing nades the thermal stability of chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca was analyzed over a wide range of temperatures 203 k 1050 k and presented in fig 2b the decomposition process of the systems can be described as a single step degradation with a decomposition temperature td of 460 k 480 k and 440 k for chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca respectively multiple studies are available in the literature showing the physiochemical properties of chcl la chcl ma and chch ca including their density and thermal stability elhamarnah et al 24 studied the thermochemical and rheological characteristics of chcl ma nades it was found that the density at a temperature of 313 k was found to be 1 27 gcm 3 while the decomposition temperature was measured to be 207 480 15 k consequently altamash et al 23 investigated the properties of several nades including chcl ca and chcl la the obtained results for the two systems from the density measurements and thermogravimetric analysis were as follows 1 16 gcm 3 at 298 15 and a decomposition temperature of for chcl la and 1 31 gcm 3 at 323 15 and a decomposition temperature of 440 15 k for chcl ca the obtained experimental results for the density measurements and the decomposition trends and temperatures were aligned with values from the literature 3 2 ft ir analysis in the present study structure analysis and functional groups identification were conducted through fourier transform infrared ft ir analysis fig 3 illustrates the ft ir spectrums for the raw components choline chloride lactic acid malic acid and citric acid in fig 3a several peaks can be distinguished at 3200 2850 1300 1150 957 816 and 623 m 1 the first two peaks represent the hydroxy group h stretching and the alkane groups c h stretching in the tertiary amine salt respectively the peaks over a wavenumber range from 1300 to 1000 c m 1 demonstrate the c n stretching in the amine c h bending in the alkane group and c o stretching in primary alcohol 49 lastly the wavenumber ranging from 800 to 500 indicates the presence of the chloride ions c l 50 the sharp and the trough peaks in fig 3b c and d ranging between 3500 and 2500 c m 1 represent the o h stretching in the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the acid structures while the peaks at 1750 1690 c m 1 correspond to the carboxylic groups c o multiple peaks are shown in fig 3c and d due to the presence of more than one c o in the structure of malic acid and citric acid acid respectively the vibrations from 1450 to 800 c m 1 are indication of c o stretching o h bending and c h stretching from the hydroxyl and alkane groups in the acids structures in order to identify the changes in the structure and the new interactions between the compounds in the synthesized nadess a comparison between the spectrums nades and its constituent components is required the ft ir spectrums of the synthesized nadess chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca are shown in fig 4 by comparing the spectrums an upward shift in the carboxylic group from 1710 c m 1 in lactic acid fig 4b to 1742 c m 1 in chcl la nades fig 4a in addition to the shift in peaks of the carboxylic groups to 1724 c m 1 and 1721 c m 1 can be observed in chcl ma and chcl ca nadess fig 4b and c respectively consequently the formation of broader peaks in fig 4a b and c between 3500 and 2500 c m 1 indicates the formation of a hydrogen bond between the nitrogen in the amine group and the hydrogen from the carboxyl group in the acids furthermore by comparing the vibrations in the constituent components and the nadess it can be noticed that both the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor have retained their structure as some of the peaks can be observed in both spectrums for example the peak at 623 c m 1 which represents the halogen compound in choline chloride can be observed in all of the nadess spectrums as well the obtained results show good agreement with the data available in the literature 49 54 and prove the formation of the new hydrogen bonding in the synthesized des in this work 3 3 performance analysis several factors influence the destabilization process of colloidal particles including type and dosage of the used coagulants colloids concentration and ph of the system 55 under basic conditions i e p h 7 colloidal suspensions are very stable due to domination of repulsion forces between the particles on the other hand lowering the ph values play a major role in the destabilization process by reducing the repulsion forces between them and hence the reducing overall negative charge and promotes further aggregation 48 therefore in this study the performance of three acidic choline chloride based nadess i e chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca as coagulants for highly stable bentonite suspension was analyzed in terms of the reduction in negative zeta potential the turbidity of the supernatant and the floc size of the resultant sediment this analysis was conducted in order to study the effect of nades with different hbd on the destabilizing process 3 3 1 turbidity and zeta potential zeta potential and turbidity measurements for the treated bentonite dispersion using different choline chloride based nades coagulants chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca are shown in fig 5 the turbidity and zeta potential for bentonite suspension were measured as 350 ntu and 40 mv respectively fig 5a represents the variation in the turbidity of the supernatant as a function of the coagulant type and dosage it can be observed that for all investigated coagulants the turbidity decreases with increasing the coagulant concentration at the lowest coagulant dosage 2 98 10 3 m 0 25 v v chcl la attained supernatant turbidity of below 5 ntu while the achieved reduction by the remaining two coagulants was below 100 ntu the turbidity continued to gradually decrease until it reached a minimum of below 1 ntu by chcl la and chcl ca at a concentration of 1 78 10 2 which corresponds to the coagulant dosage for maximum reduction in turbidity for the studied systems while at the same dosage of 1 78 10 2 m the turbidity for system treated with chcl ma was around 2 5 ntu which is close to the final turbidity value for the lowest dosage when chcl la was used hence chcl ma is effective as a coagulant however larger dosage are required to achieve better results compared to chcl la and chcl ca these reductions in the turbidity of the supernatant are associated with an increase in the corresponding zeta potential from fig 5b it is shown that the maximum reduction in the magnitude of the negative zeta potential was achieved at a concentration of 1 78 10 2 m by chcl ca with a zeta potential of around 16 mv followed by chcl la and chcl ma with a magnitude of 18 mv and 22 mv respectively furthermore it is worthy to mention that the system s ph was not changed before the coagulant addition and the drop of the ph was a result of the organic acids in the used nades to clarify the effect of nades on the destabilization and separation of stable bentonite fig 6 a shows high molecular weight cationic polyacrylamide pam and choline chloride chcl structures the cationic properties of the polymer come from the quaternary ammonium group giving it an advantage over anionic and amphoteric polymers 48 fig 6b shows the chemical structure of choline chloride chcl which is a green material and widely used in various applications including animal feed human nutrition and the pharmaceutical industry animal feed poultry swine ruminant is the largest end product user with around 94 of the total annual production chcl is used as an additive to the animal feed as it helps in the development and accelerating the growth rate 56 57 the similarity in structure between pam and chcl especially in the presence of the quaternary ammonium group which play a vital role in the destabilizing process rose our attention to the potential use of choline chloride based deep eutectic solvents des as a destabilizing agent and as an alternative for inorganic coagulants such as multivalent metal salts represented in aluminum sulfate ferrous sulfate ferric chloride and ferric chloro sulfate which have a potential environmental risk due to the presence of residual metals in the treated water therefore the reduction in turbidity and increase in the magnitude of zeta potential can be attributed to the positive charges presented in the nadess structure which get attracted by the negative charges on the surface of the bentonite particles resulting in partially neutralizing some of the charges and thus reduces the surface negative zeta potential furthermore the negative zeta potential alongside the high reduction in turbidity is mainly due to the electrostatic patch coagulation mechanism which is observed when a coagulant with a low molecular weight is employed to destabilize suspended clay particles 58 59 3 3 2 particle size distribution the effect of the three investigated coagulants on the destabilization and coagulation of bentonite suspension was analyzed in terms of the median diameter d50 of the produced flocs from fig 7 it can be observed that the addition of nades to the bentonite suspension leads to a significant increase in the flocs size consequently fig 7 shows the influence of varying the coagulant concentration on the floc size untreated bentonite suspension has a median diameter of 2 5 μm demonstrating a slight swelling in the particles upon mixing it with water increasing the concentration from 3 48 10 2 m 3 0 v v to 6 76 10 2 m 5 6 v v led to an increase in the floc size from 18 4 μm 21 8 μm and 29 1 μm to 22 3 μm 36 7 μm and 36 2 μm for chcl ma chcl la and chcl ca respectively at the same coagulant concentration the difference in the median diameter of the flocs is due to the different adsorption capacity of each coagulant on the surface of the particle 48 the increase in the floc size as a result of the coagulant addition to the suspension is mainly due to the decrease in the electrostatic repulsion forces between the particles rising from partially neutralizing some of the negative surface charges on the bentonite particles thus it encouraged the particle to come closer to each other promoting flocs formation higher coagulant dosage leads to a further reduction in the repulsion forces and hence larger flocs 48 the generated flocs can be described as a micro scale loose floc as their formation is a result of destabilization using a short chain coagulant through electrostatic patch coagulation epc mechanism 58 59 from the conducted analysis on chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca it can be concluded that the performance efficiency of the three investigated coagulants is relatively similar in terms of maximizing the zeta potential and reducing the turbidity in addition to the floc size however both chcl la and chcl ca have slightly better performance efficiency than chcl ma consequently the synthesis of chcl la is simpler and more time efficient maximum 1 h compared to chcl ca which its preparation can take up to 24 h for both components to completely dissolve in each other according to d agostino et al 60 the dissociation degree of deep eutectic solvents in water relies on the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor of the synthesized solvent furthermore in a study conducted by hammond et al 61 it was proven that above 42 wt of water the des des interactions in the studied system start to weaken and above 52 wt of water the des water interactions become stronger and dominant in the system and it can be described as an aqueous solution of des components therefore to analyze the effect of water on the prepared chcl la nades and its efficiency as a destabilizing agent choline chloride lactic acid and a mixture of both components chcl la were examined as destabilizing agents for bentonite suspension suspension treated with la did not show any significant changes in turbidity or floc size even at a high dosage compared to untreated suspension for example at 6 76 10 2 m the suspension had a floc size of 3 3 μ m and turbidity removal percentage less than 4 fig 8a and b demonstrate the effects of the coagulants understudy i e chcl la nades chcl and chcl la on the turbidity and floc size as a function of concentration respectively it can be observed from fig 8a that at the lowest dosage of almost 3 0 10 3 m chcl la nades showed the highest reduction in turbidity of around 98 9 while chcl and chcl la illustrated a reduction of 40 and 60 respectively the lowest turbidity value of below 1 ntu was obtained from bentonite suspension treated with chcl la nades at 1 78 10 2 m consequently it can be observed from fig 8b that the floc size increases gradually with concentration upon the addition of chcl the mixture of chcl la or nades at the same coagulant dosage it is clear that nades forms the largest flocs with a median diameter of 36 7 μ m due to the stronger interaction between the bentonite particles and the nades chains therefore it can be concluded that chcl la nades shows the best performance as a destabilizing agent even at lower concentrations compared to chcl la and the chcl la mixture furthermore it is worth mentioning that even though some studies showed that above 52 wt of water the des system will be described as an aqueous solution of des components however the destabilization process of colloids and floc formation are very fast and occur within seconds therefore the addition of nades to the bentonite suspension results in better outcomes compared to the mixture of chcl and la chcl la this supports the hypothesis that nades still retain their structure within the first seconds of addition and their superior effect is clear on bentonite suspension stability hence for the optimization study in the following section the destabilization and process conditions of colloidal bentonite suspension in terms of the coagulant dosage and the bentonite concentration of the system is optimized using chcl la nades as it is efficient easy to prepare and remains liquid at room temperature where the other two studied nadess are highly viscous and require pre heating before using them in the coagulation process 3 4 statistical analysis experiments were conducted according to the run order from table 3 and the full result of the responses for the experimental design is presented in table 4 the relationship between the studied variables of the destabilization and separation process which are the chcl la dosage and the bentonite concentration and the responses turbidity zeta potential floc size and ph was analyzed through response surface methodology rsm table 5 shows the significance of each developed model and the variation of the fitted data around the model through lack of fit lof which was evaluated through the p value with a confidence level of 5 if the p value was lower than 0 05 it indicates the significance of the data otherwise it is insignificant it can be observed from table 5 that all the models except the turbidity model are significant with a p value below 5 consequently except for the turbidity measurement the lack of fit of each response was insignificant 5 indicating the significance of the correlation between the variables and responses 62 the insignificance presented in the turbidity model is mainly due to the constant turbidity removal percentage 99 which leads to the absence of variation in the turbidity values and therefore the lack of fit of the resultant model another experimental study was performed by generating an experimental design using rsm and ccd with a wider range for the bentonite concentration it was desired to investigate the effect of the chcl la dosage on a highly concentrated colloidal system and the coagulation process however the design resulted in an insignificant model for the turbidity as well since the removal percentage varied between 97 and 99 thus the turbidity as a response was excluded from the study 3 5 optimization of the zeta potential and ph the experimental values of zeta potential and ph for the coagulation process are presented in table 4 the regression models of zeta potential and ph are described by eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 y z p 24 53 0 197 x 1 0 17 x 2 0 000928 x 1 2 0 018 x 2 2 0 0102

bentonite concentration in gl 1 from the above equations variables with positives sign imply a synergistic effect is observed while an antagonistic effect is donated by variables with negative sign 63 for the zeta potential model the correlation coefficient r 2 0 929 alongside the adjusted correlation coefficient adj r 2 0 878 imply that around 12 of the experimental data deviate from the implemented model similar to the zeta potential model the high correlation coefficient 1 of the ph regression model indicates the good fit between the experimental data and the second order polynomial model 45 table 6 illustrates the significance of each term in the produced models according to the obtained p value for the ph model it can be observed that both the chcl la dosage x1 and the bentonite concentration x2 in the system in addition to the square term x1 2 are highly significant where their p values are less than 0 05 while the remaining square and interaction terms are insignificant with a p value higher than 5 on the other hand only the chcl la dosage x1 is significant for the zeta potential model and the remaining terms can be excluded as their effect is insignificant on the magnitude of the system electric potential 64 according to eq 2 the optimum conditions to obtain the maximum reduction in negative zeta potential are 70 0 mm for the chcl la dosage and 1 5 gl 1 for the bentonite concentration which will result in zeta potential of 6 97 mv on the other hand it is desired to minimize the ph of the system as lower ph enhances the destabilization process therefore from eq 3 the optimal design conditions for minimizing the ph of the system are 64 3 mm for the chcl la dosage and 1 5 gl 1 for the bentonite concentration giving a ph of 2 05 with zeta potential and ph as responses for the designed experiment fig 9 shows the surface plot of both responses as a function of the chcl la dosage x1 and the bentonite concentration x2 it is noted that the optimum conditions for minimizing the ph value and maximizing the zeta potential both fall within the selected range for the study furthermore it is observed that both responses are primarily affected by the variation in the chcl la dosage as increasing the dosage reduces the ph and hence increases the zeta potential 48 the effect of the bentonite concentration on the responses is limited and unfavorable as at a constant chcl la dosage for example at a constant chcl la dosage x1 of 67 72 mm a higher bentonite concentration leads to a slight decrease in the zeta potential from 7 67 mv at 1 5 gl 1 to 9 41 mv at 6 gl 1 whereas for the ph at the same bentonite concentration of 1 5 gl 1 the ph decreases from 2 495 at 35 8 mm to 2 051 at 64 87 mm while increasing the x2 in the system from 1 5 gl 1 to 6 gl 1 at a constant chcl la dosage of 64 87 mm leads to increasing the ph from 2 051 to 2 233 respectively to further assess the quality of the fit and the reliability of the model the predicted values generated from the designed models should show a satisfactory result when compared to the experimental values 65 therefore plots of the predicted values from the models eqs 2 and 3 versus the experimental values are shown in fig 10 according to the regression coefficients r2 the predicted values of both the zeta potential and ph model are in good agreement with the obtained experimental results 3 6 optimization of the sediment floc size the floc size of the resultant sediment was described by the particle diameter at 50 of the cumulative distribution curve where half of the flocs have a diameter below d50 it is also known as the median diameter and used to describe the average floc size of the sediment moreover it was described by d90 which indicates that 10 of the produced flocs have a diameter higher than d90 the experimental values of the floc size d50 and d90 for the destabilization and separation process are presented in table 4 the regression models of d50 and d90 are described by eqs 4 and 5 respectively 4 y d 50 9 53 0 945 x 1 4 28 x 2 0 00562 x 1 2 0 121 x 2 2 0 0442 x 1 x 2 r 2 0 909 adjusted r 2 0 845 5 y d 90 19 1 2 210 x 1 11 48 x 2 0 01530 x 1 2 0 354 x 2 2 0 1199 x 1 x 2 r 2 0 889 adjusted r 2 0 811 the correlation coefficients and the adjusted correlation coefficient of the regression models show the accuracy of the model prediction eq 4 describing the median floc size d50 shows an accuracy of around 85 implying that around 15 of the experimental data variation could not be explained by the produced models consequently eq 5 have lower estimation accuracy of the results and only around 19 of the predicted data deviate from the experimental values 66 table 7 demonstrates the p values of the linear x1 and x2 square x1 2 and x2 2 and interaction x1x2 terms of the obtained models from table 7 both d50 and d90 models expressed by equations 5 and 6 respectively are significant in respect of both linear terms x1 and x2 in addition to the square term of the chcl la dosage x1 2 however for x2 2 and x1x2 the models are insignificant thus they do not have a dominant influence on the size of the resultant flocs it is generally desired to maximize the d values as the larger the flocs the easier the dewatering and treatment processes of the obtained sludge therefore from eq 4 and the optimum conditions for maximizing the values of d50 and d90 are as the following 60 3 mm and 6 gl 1 and 48 9 mm and 6 gl 1 respectively treating bentonite suspension systems with the stated conditions will results in flocs with d50 of 32 35 μm and d90 of 73 34 μm fig 11 shows the surface plots of the floc size d50 and d90 as a function of the chcl la dosage and the bentonite concentration of the system the optimum conditions that maximize the two d values all fall within the selected range for the optimization study furthermore fig 11a and 11b illustrate the surface plots for d50 and d90 respectively both surface plots exhibit a concavity which indicates the sensitivity of the responses to both variables the chcl la dosage x1 and the bentonite concentration x2 in the observed systems 46 nevertheless it can be observed from fig 11b that after reaching a maximum value of 73 μm at 6 gl 1 and an x1 of almost 49 mm the d90 value starts to decrease gradually with increasing the coagulant dosage to 71 1 μm at 60 3 mm and 66 4 μm at 70 mm this behavior can be attributed to the fact that the bentonite particles surface becomes saturated with the coagulant and can connect with other particles through limited sites only 48 for the verification of the produced models for the floc size and to check their reliability a graphical comparison between the predicted values from the model and the experimental results are represented in fig 12 it can be noticed from the regression coefficient r2 for the linear fit that the relation between the predicted values from the models and the experimental results are showing similar trends with eqs 4 and 5 where d50 model showed a better prediction accuracy with an r2 of 0 91 followed by d90 and with r2 of 0 89 3 7 multiple response optimization in the previous sections the optimum conditions were found for each response individually without taking into consideration the results of the remaining responses therefore in this section optimization of the destabilization and coagulation process variables with respect to all responses is conducted using multiple response optimization function in minitab the optimization results were evaluated using the composite desirability value composite desirability evaluates the ability of the designed model to satisfy the optimization conditions its value ranges from zero to one to be able to achieve the desired target composite desirability close to unity is required 47 67 by using multiple response optimization function to achieve maximum reduction in negative zeta potential and ph in addition to maximizing the floc size the obtained composite desirability was 0 978 therefore the optimum condition of the destabilization and separation process of bentonite suspension was found to be as following bentonite concentration of 3 48 gl 1 and a chcl la dosage of 77 mm which will result in zeta potential of 5 8 mv floc size of 31 5 μm and 63 8 μm for d50 and d90 respectively and a ph of 2 2 fig 13 shows the overlaid contour plot of the responses as a function of the two variables the shaded area represents the unfeasible region where the optimization of all responses together is not possible on the other hand the white area is the feasible region where it is possible to optimize all responses at the same time 68 it can be noticed that the feasible region includes the optimized conditions of the process 3 48 gl 1 and 77 mm implying the validity of the results additional three experimental runs using both chcl la dosage and bentonite concentration as the independent variables with one run within the optimum region shown in fig 13 were conducted to confirms the validity of the designed experiments table 8 shows the conditions experimental results and the error percentage with the predicted values from the model as shown in table 8 the experimental results of zeta potential ph and floc size d50 and d90 are close to the predicted model with an error percentage varying from 2 to 11 with the highest percentages were due to variation in zeta potential values 4 conclusions choline chloride nades was proved to be an effective coagulant for the destabilization and separation of stable colloidal suspension in this study choline chloride based nadess with malic acid and citric acid as the hbd chcl ma and chcl ca were employed as a coagulant alongside chcl la nades to investigate the effect of the organic acid side of the nades the following conclusions were drawn the three nadess were evaluated in terms of the removal percentage of the supernatant s turbidity the reduction in zeta potential and the floc size of the resultant sediments both chcl la and chcl ca showed very efficient performance as a destabilizing agent with almost similar results in all the evaluated parameters with a reduction in the turbidity to below 1 ntu floc size of 36 μm and a zeta potential of 18 mv and 16 mv respectively chcl la was designated the most suitable and convenient coagulant in terms of efficiency and simplicity of the synthesis method compared to chcl ca therefore the optimization study was conducted using chcl la the experimental design through rsm presented three main parameters that significantly affect the destabilization of colloidal particles which are the zeta potential ph and the floc size d50 and d90 by varying the nades and bentonite concentration in the system the optimum condition for the coagulation process of bentonite colloidal suspension using chcl la nades was found to be as following 77 mm for the chcl la dosage and 3 48 gl 1 for the bentonite concentration in the system resulting in 5 8 mv 31 5 μm 63 8 μm and 2 2 for the zeta potential floc size d50 and d90 and ph

13603,choline chloride chcl based natural deep eutectic solvents nades were synthesized and tested as coagulant for stable bentonite colloidal suspensions in this work three chcl based natural deep eutectic solvent nades were synthesized by mixing choline chloride as the hydrogen bond acceptor hba with lactic acid la malic acid ma and citric acid ca as the hydrogen bond donors hbd with a molar ratio of 1 1 the analysis showed that there is no significant difference in the result however chcl la was the easiest to synthesize and showed slightly higher efficiency at low dosage for the determination of the optimum conditions response surface methodology with central composite design was employed to generate an experimental design with two controlled variables the chcl la dosage and the bentonite solid content the turbidity removal percentage the reduction in zeta potential the variation in the floc size of the sediments and ph of the system were the design responses however due to the high turbidity removal percentage even at lower dosage of the coagulant and the constant removal percentage of almost 99 led to excluding the turbidity as a response as it proves to be insignificant by performing a multiple response optimization on the designed experiment the optimum condition for the destabilization and separation process that results in a zeta potential of 5 8 mv a ph of 2 2 d50 of 31 5 μm and a d90 63 8 μm was found to be 77 mm and 3 48 g l 1 for the chcl la dosage and the bentonite solid content respectively keywords choline chloride nades colloids coagulation response surface methodology bentonite 1 introduction bentonite is a clay mineral that forms as a result of natural phenomena of volcanic ash weathering in the presence of water 1 it is mainly composed of montmorillonite which represents the major structure in addition to other minerals such as illite quartz pyrite calcite feldspars iron oxides hydroxides and other types of minerals depending on the composition of bentonite mineralogical properties of the clay vary making it suitable for a wide range of applications 2 3 generally bentonite consists of three layers one octahedral layer of aluminum oxide al2o3 between two tetrahedral sheets of silicon oxide sio2 bentonite particles have a platelet like structure with a negative net charge as a result of the isomorphic substitution of al 3 ions in the octahedral layer with lower valence ions like mg 2 and fe 2 and the substitution of si 4 in the tetrahedral layer with al 3 ion 4 5 bentonite has micro particles d50 2 μm leading to a very high surface area with negative zeta potential ζ 35 mv hence when dispersed in aqueous media it forms a highly stable suspension with the help of brownian motion known as colloidal dispersion 6 large amounts of wastewater containing stable colloidal dispersions are being generated continuously in many industrial applications because of the high consumption of clay minerals in general colloids in wastewater are very fine particles of less than 2 μm size and are described as a highly stable suspension that is difficult to separate due to its small size and the repulsion forces between the particles hindering their ability to settle 7 several solid liquid separation methods can be employed to clarify colloidal wastewater however some constraints including efficiency cost and energy requirements limit their application for colloidal wastewater treatment 8 11 coagulation and flocculation are the most suitable solid liquid separation techniques for the treatment of colloidal suspension as they are highly efficient economical and have low cost and energy requirements 12 coagulant or flocculant or a combination of both are used in order to destabilize the clay particles by inducing attractive forces van der waals forces helping the particles to come together and form aggregates or flocs in aqueous media colloidal particles develop an electrical double layer edl around the particle s surface the edl consists of two chief layers the inner stern layer where the charges on the particle s surface usually negative attract ions opposite in nature forming a rigid stationary layer due to the high density of counter ions and the outer diffused layer where co and counter ions are dispersed and can move freely due to diffusion 13 14 the difference in the electrical potential between the inner stern layer and the outer diffused layer is known as the zeta potential ζ potential ζ potential is an essential parameter in investigating the colloidal stability as it provides an indication on the magnitude of the repulsion forces between the particles a highly positive or a highly negative zeta potential ζ 30 m v o r ζ 30 m v implies greater repulsion between the colloidal particles and hence more stable suspension 5 as the ζ potential values approach zero the repulsion forces between the particles decrease reducing the stability of the system destabilization of colloidal systems through the reduction of the negative or positive zeta potential values with the assistant of a destabilizing agent is considered as the key principle in the coagulation and flocculation processes 12 different types of chemicals were used as destabilizing agents for coagulation and flocculation of colloidal suspension including metal salts such as aluminum and iron salts and polyelectrolytes 15 in recent years the use of polyelectrolytes as a flocculant has become a common practice due to their efficiency in treating colloidal suspension through bridging mechanism 12 polyelectrolyte such as polyacrylamide pam has been widely used for the separation of colloidal particles from industrial wastewater 7 16 18 flocculation of fine colloidal particles using polyelectrolytes such as polyacrylamide pam may occur through different mechanisms polymer adsorption and bridging charge neutralization particle surface complex formation and depletion flocculation or by a combination of these mechanisms 19 the flocculation negative colloidal particle using cationic pam is widely used in destabilization and separation of stable colloidal particles and this occurs through the cationic polymer chains adsorption via hydrogen bonding interactions between the particle surface and polymer s primary amide functional groups thus charge neutralization becomes a major mechanism where the cationic polyacrylamides will locally reverse the particle surface charge 12 deep eutectic solvents des were reported for the first time in 2003 by abbot et al 20 as a possible alternative for ionic liquids il dess are described as a combination of two components at least at a certain molar ration forming eutectic mixture the constituent components are defined as hydrogen bond donor and acceptor hbd and hba hence they associate together through the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds 21 22 the term deep in des comes from the deep depression in the melting point of both hba and hbd leading to the formation of a liquid mixture at room temperature 23 25 des has a very simple preparation technique that depends on continuously heating the components at moderate temperatures coupled with vigorous mixing until a clear homogenous liquid is formed when des is formed from natural components mainly primary metabolites such as organic acids sugars amino acids choline salts and alcohols the resultant des is defined as natural deep eutectic solvents nades 26 nadess have favorable characteristics as they are composed of non toxic and widely abundant materials consequently the synthesis process of such solvents is very simple time efficient and economical making them a potential green alternative for some industrial solvents 27 furthermore nades properties are tunable through the manipulation of their composition by varying the molar ratio of the components and the water content making them a suitable industrial solvent for a wide range of applications such as gas absorption co2 and so2 lead removal fuel purification and nanoparticle fabrication 23 28 33 furthermore dess can be used in the removal of metal oxides and heavy metal in addition to the preparation production and purification of bio diesel 34 38 the appropriate implementation of the destabilization and separation process is essential in order to achieve the desired results of the maximum reduction in negative zeta potential and turbidity and maximizing the produced flocs size which is important for further handling and treatment the right execution depends mainly on the concentration of the selected coagulant ph and the suspended solid content initial turbidity 39 in traditional practices process optimization is done by optimizing each variable individually where one variable is changing while the rest remains constant however it is a time consuming and unreliable process as it does not take into consideration the interactions between the different variables therefore using a computational method to study the relation between the variables and their effect on the studied responses is necessary to find the optimum operating conditions that attain the targeted results 40 response surface methodology rsm is a statistical and mathematical method that combines experimental design regression analysis and optimization methods to optimize the process conditions by providing an experimental design with a specified number of experiments thus reducing the required time and improving the accuracy of the obtained results 40 41 generally rsm is employed for modeling and optimization of processes with a number of independent variables that influence the behavior and the performance of the system 42 rsm can be conducted by different sampling methods such as central composite design full factorial and box behnken central composite design ccd is a sampling design method commonly used in rsm to generate a quadratic second order model by selecting central axial and corner points without the need to perform a full factorial design according to eq 1 the design will have a total of nine experiments one run at the central point 0 0 four runs at the axial points 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 and another four runs at the corner points 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 n 2 k 2 k 1 where n is the total experimental runs and k is the number of the studied variables however in ccd designs additional replicate runs of the central point are required usually four resulting in increasing the total number of experiments to exceed n 43 in our recent study chcl la based nades was proven to be highly efficient for destabilization and aggregation of colloidal particles in suspension 44 the coagulation was proposed to take place through electrostatic patch mechanism esp patches of the negatively charged colloids were neutralized by adsorption of the cationic coagulant resulting in high turbidity removal of 99 8 with a negative zeta potential of 18 8 m v and loose micro flocs 44 therefore this paper further investigates the use of choline chloride based nades as a destabilizing agent for stable colloids under different conditions a comparative study was performed to analyze the performance of three choline chloride based nades with different hydrogen bond donors lactic acid malic acid and citric acid as a coagulant for highly stable bentonite suspension furthermore response surface methodology rsm and central composite design ccd were used to design a set of experiments to investigate the effect of the coagulant dosage and the suspension s solid content on the destabilization process of bentonite suspension using choline chloride lactic acid based chcl la nades the effects of these two variables were recorded in terms of zeta potential ph and turbidity reduction in addition to the variation in the size of the formed flocs furthermore the experimental results in combination with the computational methods were employed to determine the optimum operating conditions for the process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study were purchased from sigma aldrich table 1 shows the utilized chemicals with their specification including the structure purity molecular weight melting point and their cas number bentonite cas number 1302 78 9 was used with deionized water at room temperature of 25 to prepare the bentonite suspension 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 synthesis of nades three different choline chloride based natural deep eutectic solvents were prepared with the lactic acid chcl la malic acid chcl ma and citric acid chcl ca as the hydrogen bond donors with a molar ratio of 1 1 for hba to hbd the appropriate amount of each component was measured using an analytical balance isolab and placed in a pear shaped flask the flask was attached to a rotatory evaporator heidolph 2 g3 hei vap precision where the synthesis of nades was carried out at atmospheric pressure with vigorous mixing at 200 rpm and continuous heating using an oil bath at 80 the preparation time varied from 1 h to 24 h depending on the selected hbd after the formation of a transparent homogenous liquid nades was stored in an airtight container at room temperature 2 2 2 density and thermogravimetric analysis tga density measurement and thermogravimetric analysis tga for chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca nadess samples were performed and compared with the literature the density was measured with an anton paar dma 4500 m densitometer calibrated with water as a reference the density for each sample was measured with respect to temperature at atmospheric pressure over a range from room temperature up to 363 15 k however for chcl ca the measurements were conducted over a temperature varying from 318 15 k to 338 15 k as it is solid at room temperature and has a relatively high melting temperature of 316 15 1 5 k compared to the other nadess perkinelmer pyris 6 tga instrument calibrated with calcium oxalate sample was employed to conduct a thermogravimetric analysis on the studied nades systems chcl la chcl ma chcl ca the measurements were conducted with temperature ranging from 303 k to 1050 k with an increase rate of 5 k per minute to analyze the thermal behavior and determine the decomposition and onset temperatures the measurements were done under an environment of nitrogen gas to generate a weight loss curve 2 2 3 ft ir spectroscopy nicolet is10 thermo scientific ftir spectrometer was used to create the fourier transform infrared spectrums for all raw components chcl la ma and ca in addition to the spectrum of the three synthesized nadess chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca the spectrums were generated by running 24 scans for each sample over a wavenumber between 400 c m 1 and 4000 c m 1 and a resolution of 16 c m 1 2 2 4 response surface methodology experimental design and analysis of the obtained data were done through minitab software version 17 the design was generated using response surface methodology rsm in combination with the central composite design method ccd in order to find the optimized conditions for the coagulation process using choline chloride based nades as a coagulant the bentonite concentration in water and the chcl la dosage were selected as the two dominating variables in the studied process the ranges of both independent variables with the corresponding level for each are presented in table 2 the ranges of the independent variables were selected according to a set of experiments conducted to roughly estimate the operating conditions that maximize the turbidity removal floc size and zeta potential reduction separately table 3 shows the full factorial ccd design 9 experiments in addition to four replicate experiments for the central points run number 3 6 7 and 11 which are required to estimate the percentage error involved in the developed model 45 the two independent variables are expressed in terms of their original units in panel b mm for the chcl la dosage and gl 1 for the bentonite concentration alongside the design code panel a the design code values were as follows maximum point 2 1 central point 0 1 and minimum point 2 the results of each experiment were represented in terms of four dependent variables or also known as responses which are zeta potential turbidity removal percentage floc size and ph the selection of the optimum conditions for the designed process was based on the analyzed data of the four responses and predicted using the following second order quadratic equation 46 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β i i x i 2 i i j k j k β i j x i x j e where i j and β are the linear the quadratic and the regression coefficients respectively while k is the number of independent variables of the designed experiment and e is the random error 39 the relationship between the two variables and the responses in addition to the significance of the model was evaluated using the p value with a confidence interval of 95 therefore models and interactions between the variables and the responses with p value below 5 0 05 are identified as significant on the other hand when the p value is higher than 0 05 this indicates that the studied variable or relationship is insignificant and does not have an effect on the process 47 furthermore the quality of the fit of the experimental data to the polynomial model was assessed through the correlation coefficient r2 and adjusted r2 the closer the value of r2 to unity the better the fit of the produced model 2 2 5 coagulation jar test to study the performance of the three tested coagulants chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca two solid concentrations were employed for the preparation of bentonite suspension 1 5 gl 1 to study the reduction in turbidity and negative zeta potential and 3 gl 1 to determine the change in the floc size bentonite was homogenized with one liter of deionized water using a homogenizer fisher scientific 1000 for five minutes the coagulation test was conducted in a jar test apparatus with six compartments stuart flocculator sw6 the required dosage of the coagulants was added to the corresponding suspension followed by a high mixing at 180 rmp for 30 s to uniformly disperse the coagulant then for 20 min a slow mixing stage at 50 rmp took place to promote flocs formation 48 in addition the effect of the constituent components of chch la nades were studied as a mixture chcl la and individually chcl or la as a function of concentration fig 1 explains the difference in the addition mechanisms for the different coagulants fig 1b shows the addition steps and jar test for any chcl la mixture where the la was added to the suspensions followed by high mixing for 30 s then chcl was added and mixed at high rotational speed for 30 s after which slow mixing took place multiple addition mechanisms for the mixture were analyzed including the addition of lactic acid first followed by choline chloride choline chloride followed by lactic acid or the addition of both components at the same time the addition of lactic acid followed by choline chloride showed the best performance as the acid partially neutralizes the negative charge on the bentonite s surface by changing the medium ph from 9 0 3 2 then choline chloride brings the particles together and larger flocs start forming on the other hand for the optimization study bentonite suspensions were prepared by mixing the appropriate amount of bentonite provided in table 2 in one liter of deionized water the mixture was homogenized using a fisher scientific homogenizer the required dosage of the coagulant was added according to table 2 to the corresponding suspension followed by the same steps for the coagulation test using the jar test apparatus 2 2 6 responses measurements the effects of the studied variables coagulant dosage and bentonite concentration were examined in terms of four responses which are zeta potential turbidity floc size and ph after the coagulation test was completed a settling time of two minutes was recorded before the extraction of the supernatant for turbidity and zeta potential measurements 50 ml samples of the supernatant were extracted from a location 150 ml above the interface layer between the sediment and the supernatant using a micropipette thermo scientific finnpipette f2 turbidity and zeta potential were measured on the same day of conducting the experiment at room temperature with a turbidity meter hach 2100 n and a zetasizer zen3600 respectively the obtained values for both residual turbidity and reduction in negative zeta potential serve as an indicator of the coagulant removal efficiency for floc size measurements the flocs were allowed to completely settle 10 15 minutes before taking samples of the flocs from near the bottom of the beaker using a pipette the particle size distribution test was conducted 24 h after the experiment to ensure the stabilization of the flocs the measurements were performed through mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments with a rotational speed of 1500 rpm floc size is usually interpreted in terms of the median diameter d50 which provides the flocs diameter at a cumulative distribution of 50 this measurement in combination with zeta potential can provide a better understanding of the coagulation mechanism exhibited by the system and the strength of the resultant flocs ph readings were recorded using hach hq11d ph meter the treated suspension was stirred continuously using a magnetic stirrer while taking the reading to guarantee the uniform distribution of the system components to ensure the reproducibility of the result replicates measurements of each parameter were taken with an error percentage lower than 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 density and thermal stability the change in density of the studied nades systems as a function of temperature in addition to their thermal gravimetric analysis are shown in fig 2 at a room temperature of around 298 15 k and atmospheric pressure 1 bar the density for chcl la and chcl ma were measured to be 1 159 gcm 3 and 1 278 gcm 3 respectively on the other hand chcl ca at 298 15 k was solid and density measurement was not possible to perform at 318 18 k the density was found to be 1 31 gcm 3 furthermore from fig 2a the density is observed to exhibit a linear decrease with a regression coefficient of 0 99 with increasing the temperature the reduction in density is attributed to the increase in volume as a result of higher molecular activities in the system consequently comparing the overall trend between the three studied systems chcl ca shows the highest density values followed by chcl ma and lastly chcl la nades stability is a function of their constituent components hba and hbd and their molar ratio studying the thermal stability of nades and determining their decomposition temperature is an essential step for optimizing the operational temperature of the process utilizing nades the thermal stability of chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca was analyzed over a wide range of temperatures 203 k 1050 k and presented in fig 2b the decomposition process of the systems can be described as a single step degradation with a decomposition temperature td of 460 k 480 k and 440 k for chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca respectively multiple studies are available in the literature showing the physiochemical properties of chcl la chcl ma and chch ca including their density and thermal stability elhamarnah et al 24 studied the thermochemical and rheological characteristics of chcl ma nades it was found that the density at a temperature of 313 k was found to be 1 27 gcm 3 while the decomposition temperature was measured to be 207 480 15 k consequently altamash et al 23 investigated the properties of several nades including chcl ca and chcl la the obtained results for the two systems from the density measurements and thermogravimetric analysis were as follows 1 16 gcm 3 at 298 15 and a decomposition temperature of for chcl la and 1 31 gcm 3 at 323 15 and a decomposition temperature of 440 15 k for chcl ca the obtained experimental results for the density measurements and the decomposition trends and temperatures were aligned with values from the literature 3 2 ft ir analysis in the present study structure analysis and functional groups identification were conducted through fourier transform infrared ft ir analysis fig 3 illustrates the ft ir spectrums for the raw components choline chloride lactic acid malic acid and citric acid in fig 3a several peaks can be distinguished at 3200 2850 1300 1150 957 816 and 623 m 1 the first two peaks represent the hydroxy group h stretching and the alkane groups c h stretching in the tertiary amine salt respectively the peaks over a wavenumber range from 1300 to 1000 c m 1 demonstrate the c n stretching in the amine c h bending in the alkane group and c o stretching in primary alcohol 49 lastly the wavenumber ranging from 800 to 500 indicates the presence of the chloride ions c l 50 the sharp and the trough peaks in fig 3b c and d ranging between 3500 and 2500 c m 1 represent the o h stretching in the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the acid structures while the peaks at 1750 1690 c m 1 correspond to the carboxylic groups c o multiple peaks are shown in fig 3c and d due to the presence of more than one c o in the structure of malic acid and citric acid acid respectively the vibrations from 1450 to 800 c m 1 are indication of c o stretching o h bending and c h stretching from the hydroxyl and alkane groups in the acids structures in order to identify the changes in the structure and the new interactions between the compounds in the synthesized nadess a comparison between the spectrums nades and its constituent components is required the ft ir spectrums of the synthesized nadess chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca are shown in fig 4 by comparing the spectrums an upward shift in the carboxylic group from 1710 c m 1 in lactic acid fig 4b to 1742 c m 1 in chcl la nades fig 4a in addition to the shift in peaks of the carboxylic groups to 1724 c m 1 and 1721 c m 1 can be observed in chcl ma and chcl ca nadess fig 4b and c respectively consequently the formation of broader peaks in fig 4a b and c between 3500 and 2500 c m 1 indicates the formation of a hydrogen bond between the nitrogen in the amine group and the hydrogen from the carboxyl group in the acids furthermore by comparing the vibrations in the constituent components and the nadess it can be noticed that both the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor have retained their structure as some of the peaks can be observed in both spectrums for example the peak at 623 c m 1 which represents the halogen compound in choline chloride can be observed in all of the nadess spectrums as well the obtained results show good agreement with the data available in the literature 49 54 and prove the formation of the new hydrogen bonding in the synthesized des in this work 3 3 performance analysis several factors influence the destabilization process of colloidal particles including type and dosage of the used coagulants colloids concentration and ph of the system 55 under basic conditions i e p h 7 colloidal suspensions are very stable due to domination of repulsion forces between the particles on the other hand lowering the ph values play a major role in the destabilization process by reducing the repulsion forces between them and hence the reducing overall negative charge and promotes further aggregation 48 therefore in this study the performance of three acidic choline chloride based nadess i e chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca as coagulants for highly stable bentonite suspension was analyzed in terms of the reduction in negative zeta potential the turbidity of the supernatant and the floc size of the resultant sediment this analysis was conducted in order to study the effect of nades with different hbd on the destabilizing process 3 3 1 turbidity and zeta potential zeta potential and turbidity measurements for the treated bentonite dispersion using different choline chloride based nades coagulants chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca are shown in fig 5 the turbidity and zeta potential for bentonite suspension were measured as 350 ntu and 40 mv respectively fig 5a represents the variation in the turbidity of the supernatant as a function of the coagulant type and dosage it can be observed that for all investigated coagulants the turbidity decreases with increasing the coagulant concentration at the lowest coagulant dosage 2 98 10 3 m 0 25 v v chcl la attained supernatant turbidity of below 5 ntu while the achieved reduction by the remaining two coagulants was below 100 ntu the turbidity continued to gradually decrease until it reached a minimum of below 1 ntu by chcl la and chcl ca at a concentration of 1 78 10 2 which corresponds to the coagulant dosage for maximum reduction in turbidity for the studied systems while at the same dosage of 1 78 10 2 m the turbidity for system treated with chcl ma was around 2 5 ntu which is close to the final turbidity value for the lowest dosage when chcl la was used hence chcl ma is effective as a coagulant however larger dosage are required to achieve better results compared to chcl la and chcl ca these reductions in the turbidity of the supernatant are associated with an increase in the corresponding zeta potential from fig 5b it is shown that the maximum reduction in the magnitude of the negative zeta potential was achieved at a concentration of 1 78 10 2 m by chcl ca with a zeta potential of around 16 mv followed by chcl la and chcl ma with a magnitude of 18 mv and 22 mv respectively furthermore it is worthy to mention that the system s ph was not changed before the coagulant addition and the drop of the ph was a result of the organic acids in the used nades to clarify the effect of nades on the destabilization and separation of stable bentonite fig 6 a shows high molecular weight cationic polyacrylamide pam and choline chloride chcl structures the cationic properties of the polymer come from the quaternary ammonium group giving it an advantage over anionic and amphoteric polymers 48 fig 6b shows the chemical structure of choline chloride chcl which is a green material and widely used in various applications including animal feed human nutrition and the pharmaceutical industry animal feed poultry swine ruminant is the largest end product user with around 94 of the total annual production chcl is used as an additive to the animal feed as it helps in the development and accelerating the growth rate 56 57 the similarity in structure between pam and chcl especially in the presence of the quaternary ammonium group which play a vital role in the destabilizing process rose our attention to the potential use of choline chloride based deep eutectic solvents des as a destabilizing agent and as an alternative for inorganic coagulants such as multivalent metal salts represented in aluminum sulfate ferrous sulfate ferric chloride and ferric chloro sulfate which have a potential environmental risk due to the presence of residual metals in the treated water therefore the reduction in turbidity and increase in the magnitude of zeta potential can be attributed to the positive charges presented in the nadess structure which get attracted by the negative charges on the surface of the bentonite particles resulting in partially neutralizing some of the charges and thus reduces the surface negative zeta potential furthermore the negative zeta potential alongside the high reduction in turbidity is mainly due to the electrostatic patch coagulation mechanism which is observed when a coagulant with a low molecular weight is employed to destabilize suspended clay particles 58 59 3 3 2 particle size distribution the effect of the three investigated coagulants on the destabilization and coagulation of bentonite suspension was analyzed in terms of the median diameter d50 of the produced flocs from fig 7 it can be observed that the addition of nades to the bentonite suspension leads to a significant increase in the flocs size consequently fig 7 shows the influence of varying the coagulant concentration on the floc size untreated bentonite suspension has a median diameter of 2 5 μm demonstrating a slight swelling in the particles upon mixing it with water increasing the concentration from 3 48 10 2 m 3 0 v v to 6 76 10 2 m 5 6 v v led to an increase in the floc size from 18 4 μm 21 8 μm and 29 1 μm to 22 3 μm 36 7 μm and 36 2 μm for chcl ma chcl la and chcl ca respectively at the same coagulant concentration the difference in the median diameter of the flocs is due to the different adsorption capacity of each coagulant on the surface of the particle 48 the increase in the floc size as a result of the coagulant addition to the suspension is mainly due to the decrease in the electrostatic repulsion forces between the particles rising from partially neutralizing some of the negative surface charges on the bentonite particles thus it encouraged the particle to come closer to each other promoting flocs formation higher coagulant dosage leads to a further reduction in the repulsion forces and hence larger flocs 48 the generated flocs can be described as a micro scale loose floc as their formation is a result of destabilization using a short chain coagulant through electrostatic patch coagulation epc mechanism 58 59 from the conducted analysis on chcl la chcl ma and chcl ca it can be concluded that the performance efficiency of the three investigated coagulants is relatively similar in terms of maximizing the zeta potential and reducing the turbidity in addition to the floc size however both chcl la and chcl ca have slightly better performance efficiency than chcl ma consequently the synthesis of chcl la is simpler and more time efficient maximum 1 h compared to chcl ca which its preparation can take up to 24 h for both components to completely dissolve in each other according to d agostino et al 60 the dissociation degree of deep eutectic solvents in water relies on the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor of the synthesized solvent furthermore in a study conducted by hammond et al 61 it was proven that above 42 wt of water the des des interactions in the studied system start to weaken and above 52 wt of water the des water interactions become stronger and dominant in the system and it can be described as an aqueous solution of des components therefore to analyze the effect of water on the prepared chcl la nades and its efficiency as a destabilizing agent choline chloride lactic acid and a mixture of both components chcl la were examined as destabilizing agents for bentonite suspension suspension treated with la did not show any significant changes in turbidity or floc size even at a high dosage compared to untreated suspension for example at 6 76 10 2 m the suspension had a floc size of 3 3 μ m and turbidity removal percentage less than 4 fig 8a and b demonstrate the effects of the coagulants understudy i e chcl la nades chcl and chcl la on the turbidity and floc size as a function of concentration respectively it can be observed from fig 8a that at the lowest dosage of almost 3 0 10 3 m chcl la nades showed the highest reduction in turbidity of around 98 9 while chcl and chcl la illustrated a reduction of 40 and 60 respectively the lowest turbidity value of below 1 ntu was obtained from bentonite suspension treated with chcl la nades at 1 78 10 2 m consequently it can be observed from fig 8b that the floc size increases gradually with concentration upon the addition of chcl the mixture of chcl la or nades at the same coagulant dosage it is clear that nades forms the largest flocs with a median diameter of 36 7 μ m due to the stronger interaction between the bentonite particles and the nades chains therefore it can be concluded that chcl la nades shows the best performance as a destabilizing agent even at lower concentrations compared to chcl la and the chcl la mixture furthermore it is worth mentioning that even though some studies showed that above 52 wt of water the des system will be described as an aqueous solution of des components however the destabilization process of colloids and floc formation are very fast and occur within seconds therefore the addition of nades to the bentonite suspension results in better outcomes compared to the mixture of chcl and la chcl la this supports the hypothesis that nades still retain their structure within the first seconds of addition and their superior effect is clear on bentonite suspension stability hence for the optimization study in the following section the destabilization and process conditions of colloidal bentonite suspension in terms of the coagulant dosage and the bentonite concentration of the system is optimized using chcl la nades as it is efficient easy to prepare and remains liquid at room temperature where the other two studied nadess are highly viscous and require pre heating before using them in the coagulation process 3 4 statistical analysis experiments were conducted according to the run order from table 3 and the full result of the responses for the experimental design is presented in table 4 the relationship between the studied variables of the destabilization and separation process which are the chcl la dosage and the bentonite concentration and the responses turbidity zeta potential floc size and ph was analyzed through response surface methodology rsm table 5 shows the significance of each developed model and the variation of the fitted data around the model through lack of fit lof which was evaluated through the p value with a confidence level of 5 if the p value was lower than 0 05 it indicates the significance of the data otherwise it is insignificant it can be observed from table 5 that all the models except the turbidity model are significant with a p value below 5 consequently except for the turbidity measurement the lack of fit of each response was insignificant 5 indicating the significance of the correlation between the variables and responses 62 the insignificance presented in the turbidity model is mainly due to the constant turbidity removal percentage 99 which leads to the absence of variation in the turbidity values and therefore the lack of fit of the resultant model another experimental study was performed by generating an experimental design using rsm and ccd with a wider range for the bentonite concentration it was desired to investigate the effect of the chcl la dosage on a highly concentrated colloidal system and the coagulation process however the design resulted in an insignificant model for the turbidity as well since the removal percentage varied between 97 and 99 thus the turbidity as a response was excluded from the study 3 5 optimization of the zeta potential and ph the experimental values of zeta potential and ph for the coagulation process are presented in table 4 the regression models of zeta potential and ph are described by eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 y z p 24 53 0 197 x 1 0 17 x 2 0 000928 x 1 2 0 018 x 2 2 0 0102 x 1 x 2 r 2 0 929 adjusted r 2 0 878 3 y p h 4 392 0 07165 x 1 0 0594 x 2 0 000550 x 1 2 0 00760 x 2 2 0 000661 x 1 x 2 r 2 0 995 adjusted r 2 0 991 where x1 is the chcl la dosage in mm and x2 is the bentonite concentration in gl 1 from the above equations variables with positives sign imply a synergistic effect is observed while an antagonistic effect is donated by variables with negative sign 63 for the zeta potential model the correlation coefficient r 2 0 929 alongside the adjusted correlation coefficient adj r 2 0 878 imply that around 12 of the experimental data deviate from the implemented model similar to the zeta potential model the high correlation coefficient 1 of the ph regression model indicates the good fit between the experimental data and the second order polynomial model 45 table 6 illustrates the significance of each term in the produced models according to the obtained p value for the ph model it can be observed that both the chcl la dosage x1 and the bentonite concentration x2 in the system in addition to the square term x1 2 are highly significant where their p values are less than 0 05 while the remaining square and interaction terms are insignificant with a p value higher than 5 on the other hand only the chcl la dosage x1 is significant for the zeta potential model and the remaining terms can be excluded as their effect is insignificant on the magnitude of the system electric potential 64 according to eq 2 the optimum conditions to obtain the maximum reduction in negative zeta potential are 70 0 mm for the chcl la dosage and 1 5 gl 1 for the bentonite concentration which will result in zeta potential of 6 97 mv on the other hand it is desired to minimize the ph of the system as lower ph enhances the destabilization process therefore from eq 3 the optimal design conditions for minimizing the ph of the system are 64 3 mm for the chcl la dosage and 1 5 gl 1 for the bentonite concentration giving a ph of 2 05 with zeta potential and ph as responses for the designed experiment fig 9 shows the surface plot of both responses as a function of the chcl la dosage x1 and the bentonite concentration x2 it is noted that the optimum conditions for minimizing the ph value and maximizing the zeta potential both fall within the selected range for the study furthermore it is observed that both responses are primarily affected by the variation in the chcl la dosage as increasing the dosage reduces the ph and hence increases the zeta potential 48 the effect of the bentonite concentration on the responses is limited and unfavorable as at a constant chcl la dosage for example at a constant chcl la dosage x1 of 67 72 mm a higher bentonite concentration leads to a slight decrease in the zeta potential from 7 67 mv at 1 5 gl 1 to 9 41 mv at 6 gl 1 whereas for the ph at the same bentonite concentration of 1 5 gl 1 the ph decreases from 2 495 at 35 8 mm to 2 051 at 64 87 mm while increasing the x2 in the system from 1 5 gl 1 to 6 gl 1 at a constant chcl la dosage of 64 87 mm leads to increasing the ph from 2 051 to 2 233 respectively to further assess the quality of the fit and the reliability of the model the predicted values generated from the designed models should show a satisfactory result when compared to the experimental values 65 therefore plots of the predicted values from the models eqs 2 and 3 versus the experimental values are shown in fig 10 according to the regression coefficients r2 the predicted values of both the zeta potential and ph model are in good agreement with the obtained experimental results 3 6 optimization of the sediment floc size the floc size of the resultant sediment was described by the particle diameter at 50 of the cumulative distribution curve where half of the flocs have a diameter below d50 it is also known as the median diameter and used to describe the average floc size of the sediment moreover it was described by d90 which indicates that 10 of the produced flocs have a diameter higher than d90 the experimental values of the floc size d50 and d90 for the destabilization and separation process are presented in table 4 the regression models of d50 and d90 are described by eqs 4 and 5 respectively 4 y d 50 9 53 0 945 x 1 4 28 x 2 0 00562 x 1 2 0 121 x 2 2 0 0442 x 1 x 2 r 2 0 909 adjusted r 2 0 845 5 y d 90 19 1 2 210 x 1 11 48 x 2 0 01530 x 1 2 0 354 x 2 2 0 1199 x 1 x 2 r 2 0 889 adjusted r 2 0 811 the correlation coefficients and the adjusted correlation coefficient of the regression models show the accuracy of the model prediction eq 4 describing the median floc size d50 shows an accuracy of around 85 implying that around 15 of the experimental data variation could not be explained by the produced models consequently eq 5 have lower estimation accuracy of the results and only around 19 of the predicted data deviate from the experimental values 66 table 7 demonstrates the p values of the linear x1 and x2 square x1 2 and x2 2 and interaction x1x2 terms of the obtained models from table 7 both d50 and d90 models expressed by equations 5 and 6 respectively are significant in respect of both linear terms x1 and x2 in addition to the square term of the chcl la dosage x1 2 however for x2 2 and x1x2 the models are insignificant thus they do not have a dominant influence on the size of the resultant flocs it is generally desired to maximize the d values as the larger the flocs the easier the dewatering and treatment processes of the obtained sludge therefore from eq 4 and the optimum conditions for maximizing the values of d50 and d90 are as the following 60 3 mm and 6 gl 1 and 48 9 mm and 6 gl 1 respectively treating bentonite suspension systems with the stated conditions will results in flocs with d50 of 32 35 μm and d90 of 73 34 μm fig 11 shows the surface plots of the floc size d50 and d90 as a function of the chcl la dosage and the bentonite concentration of the system the optimum conditions that maximize the two d values all fall within the selected range for the optimization study furthermore fig 11a and 11b illustrate the surface plots for d50 and d90 respectively both surface plots exhibit a concavity which indicates the sensitivity of the responses to both variables the chcl la dosage x1 and the bentonite concentration x2 in the observed systems 46 nevertheless it can be observed from fig 11b that after reaching a maximum value of 73 μm at 6 gl 1 and an x1 of almost 49 mm the d90 value starts to decrease gradually with increasing the coagulant dosage to 71 1 μm at 60 3 mm and 66 4 μm at 70 mm this behavior can be attributed to the fact that the bentonite particles surface becomes saturated with the coagulant and can connect with other particles through limited sites only 48 for the verification of the produced models for the floc size and to check their reliability a graphical comparison between the predicted values from the model and the experimental results are represented in fig 12 it can be noticed from the regression coefficient r2 for the linear fit that the relation between the predicted values from the models and the experimental results are showing similar trends with eqs 4 and 5 where d50 model showed a better prediction accuracy with an r2 of 0 91 followed by d90 and with r2 of 0 89 3 7 multiple response optimization in the previous sections the optimum conditions were found for each response individually without taking into consideration the results of the remaining responses therefore in this section optimization of the destabilization and coagulation process variables with respect to all responses is conducted using multiple response optimization function in minitab the optimization results were evaluated using the composite desirability value composite desirability evaluates the ability of the designed model to satisfy the optimization conditions its value ranges from zero to one to be able to achieve the desired target composite desirability close to unity is required 47 67 by using multiple response optimization function to achieve maximum reduction in negative zeta potential and ph in addition to maximizing the floc size the obtained composite desirability was 0 978 therefore the optimum condition of the destabilization and separation process of bentonite suspension was found to be as following bentonite concentration of 3 48 gl 1 and a chcl la dosage of 77 mm which will result in zeta potential of 5 8 mv floc size of 31 5 μm and 63 8 μm for d50 and d90 respectively and a ph of 2 2 fig 13 shows the overlaid contour plot of the responses as a function of the two variables the shaded area represents the unfeasible region where the optimization of all responses together is not possible on the other hand the white area is the feasible region where it is possible to optimize all responses at the same time 68 it can be noticed that the feasible region includes the optimized conditions of the process 3 48 gl 1 and 77 mm implying the validity of the results additional three experimental runs using both chcl la dosage and bentonite concentration as the independent variables with one run within the optimum region shown in fig 13 were conducted to confirms the validity of the designed experiments table 8 shows the conditions experimental results and the error percentage with the predicted values from the model as shown in table 8 the experimental results of zeta potential ph and floc size d50 and d90 are close to the predicted model with an error percentage varying from 2 to 11 with the highest percentages were due to variation in zeta potential values 4 conclusions choline chloride nades was proved to be an effective coagulant for the destabilization and separation of stable colloidal suspension in this study choline chloride based nadess with malic acid and citric acid as the hbd chcl ma and chcl ca were employed as a coagulant alongside chcl la nades to investigate the effect of the organic acid side of the nades the following conclusions were drawn the three nadess were evaluated in terms of the removal percentage of the supernatant s turbidity the reduction in zeta potential and the floc size of the resultant sediments both chcl la and chcl ca showed very efficient performance as a destabilizing agent with almost similar results in all the evaluated parameters with a reduction in the turbidity to below 1 ntu floc size of 36 μm and a zeta potential of 18 mv and 16 mv respectively chcl la was designated the most suitable and convenient coagulant in terms of efficiency and simplicity of the synthesis method compared to chcl ca therefore the optimization study was conducted using chcl la the experimental design through rsm presented three main parameters that significantly affect the destabilization of colloidal particles which are the zeta potential ph and the floc size d50 and d90 by varying the nades and bentonite concentration in the system the optimum condition for the coagulation process of bentonite colloidal suspension using chcl la nades was found to be as following 77 mm for the chcl la dosage and 3 48 gl 1 for the bentonite concentration in the system resulting in 5 8 mv 31 5 μm 63 8 μm and 2 2 for the zeta potential floc size d50 and d90 and ph

13604,a novel highly water dispersible polymer based adsorbent hcp bpa na was synthesized by using bisphenol a bpa containing polar functional group as raw material via cross linking reaction and subsequently treated with alkali solution owing to its abundant oxygen groups hcp bpa na displays large uptake capacity 645 16 and 268 09 mg g 1 and fast adsorption rates 5 92 10 3 and 9 90 10 3 g mg 1 min 1for methylene blue mb and tetracycline tc respectively besides it s nh3 uptake capacity can reach 7 2 mmol g 1 at 298 k and1 bar the removal mechanism for mb and tc was primarily caused by electrostatic attraction and ion exchange and for the uptake of nh3 was mainly attributed to the high affinity between the basic nh3 molecule and acidic sites of the hcp bpa na additionally hcp bpa na possesses the higher adsorption performance for mb and tc in real wastewater because of the promotion effect of dissolved organic matter and exhibited excellent adsorption ability towards mb and mo due to the synergistic enhanced effects of multi mechanisms in binary mb mo dye solutions this study introduces a green and simple strategy for designing an oxygen rich functional adsorbent with versatile adsorption properties high efficiency and fast rate which can be applied as a promising sorbent to eliminate water soluble contaminants from the real wastewater and ammonia in the air keywords hyper cross linked polymer organic pollutants ammonia adsorption 1 introduction water and air pollution are becoming increasingly serious environmental issues and have garnered considerable attention organic pollutants such as dyes and antibiotics are known to cause threats to human health owing to their potential carcinogenic property 1 at low concentrations they also pose a risk to ecosystem equilibrium because of their toxic effects on organisms and long term persistence in the ecosystem 2 air pollution such as ammonia nh3 have a significant impact on animal and human activities at high concentrations 3 for environmental protection adsorption is often considered a simple low cost and highly efficient separation and purification technique for disposing of contaminants the normal adsorbents including zeolites 4 activated carbons 5 6 metal oxides 7 10 metal organic framework mof materials 11 and covalent organic framework cof materials 12 have been suggested to remove organic pollutes from wastewater however these materials were inadequate owing to their low adsorption rate the limited removal ability for only single component or same type pollutants therefore the development of advanced multi functional absorbents for eliminating organic pollutants and nh3 is crucial to aid water and air purification recently hyper cross linked polymers hcps are considered promising organic polymer based adsorbents for wastewater treatment owing to the hydrophobic properties of hcps emanating from enriched aromatic systems in their skeletons they can effectively remove oleophilic hydrophobic contaminants primarily using the hydrophobic interaction van der waals interaction and π π interaction between the target pollutant molecules and adsorbents 13 14 however when hcps react with hydrophilic or water soluble contaminants such as metal iron water soluble dye and antibiotics their adsorption capacity is considerably reduced for example in order to remove phenol and methylene blue mb zhang et al 15 synthesized a hyper cross linked resin adsorbent zch 101 and found that the adsorption capacity was 384 6 mg g 1 for phenol but for mb its capacity was only 20 9 mg g 1 which can be attributed to the hydrophobic property of the aromatic structure of zch 101 hence it is imperative to develop a novel hydrophilic adsorbent that can efficiently remove water soluble contaminants so far considerable research focusing on the enhancement of hydrophilic properties of polymers has employed two methods the first method involves the addition of certain hydrophilic group contained monomers and the second method involves post functionalisation to modify some hydrophilic groups in the polymers 16 18 huang et al 19 prepared a series of gallic acid modified hcps by post functionalisation to improve the hydrophilic properties the adsorbent hj d55 exhibited a high adsorption capacity 444 4 mg g 1 for separating salicylic acid sa from an aqueous solution which was attributed to the crucial influence of hydrogen bonding and the fact that the introduction of gallic acid groups enhances the adsorption of sa however the adsorption rate of this adsorbent hj d55 was relatively low 1 477 10 4 g mg 1 min 1 therefore synthesising a material exhibiting high adsorption capacity and adsorption rate as well as showing potential for commercial production in the field of water treatment remains a challenge generally the modification of sulphonic acid is regarded as the common post functionalisation method for porous materials 20 21 sulphonic acid modified hcps sam hcps were synthesised for the removal of toxic metal ions from wastewater 22 the maximum adsorption capacity of cu2 in hcps was 51 45 mg g 1 the low adsorption capacity of this absorbent can be ascribed to the low content of sulphonated functional groups moreover the sulphonation reaction requires harsh reaction conditions which are accompanied by the production of a large amount of acid contained wastewater these drawbacks limit the large scale use of the sulphonation approach in contrast alkalisation reaction revealed obvious advantages such as easy preparation conditions and facile synthetic routes on the other hand gas storage is an important application of hcps owing to its abundant micropores it has been widely used to adsorb h2 and co2 23 but rarely used for the removal of polar molecules in air pollutants such as nh3 some researchers have reported acidic functional groups such as co2h so3h and po3h2 for the purpose of the enhancement of the uptake of nh3 kang et al 24 obtained a type of functional hcp named 1 tcs using double acidification including post oxidation and post sulphonation and used it for nh3 uptake results showed that the nh3 capture capacity of 1 t before modification was less than 3 8 mmol g 1 at 298 k and 1 bar following post oxidation and post sulphonation the adsorption capacities dramatically increased to 6 41 and 8 52 mmol g 1 respectively which was attributed to the high content of carboxylic and sulphonic acid groups on the surface of hcps 0 92 mmol g 1 hence it could be predicted that hcps was modified by a facile and green approach alkalization reaction accompanied by the enhancement of oxygen functional groups could exhibit excellent adsorption property for the uptake of ammonia in this study we developed a highly efficient and environmentally friendly method for synthesising oxygen rich functional hcp bisphenol a bpa na to remove water soluble contaminants and nh3 a series characterisation of the obtained polymer material was conducted then the adsorption experiments were performed using mb and tetracycline tc as water soluble contaminants further the application of hcp bpa na in real tc or mb contained wastewater was discussed and the adsorption behaviour of binary solution systems tc mb mb methyl orange mo on hcp bpa na were performed meanwhile nh3 adsorption experiments were conducted to explore the ability of hcp bpa na in air pollution treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials anhydrous fecl3 bpa mb mo and tc were

12 h to reach equilibrium the residual concentrations of tc and mb were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer at their maximum wavelengths λmax of 358 and 664 nm respectively the uptakes of tc and mb at equilibrium time defined as equilibrium adsorption capability qe were calculated as 1 q e v c o c e m where co and ce mg l 1 denote the initial and final concentrations of the tc and mb solutions respectively v ml is the volume of the adsorbate solution and m mg is the mass of the adsorbent 2 5 adsorption kinetics and isotherm models to understand the adsorption rate and mechanism pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics and their corresponding equations were used to evaluate and analyse the experimental data the equations of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics are expressed as follows 2 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt and qe mg g 1 denote the amounts of pollutant adsorbed at equilibrium and time t min respectively k1 and k2 min 1 are the rate constants of pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption respectively the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are the two most commonly used equilibrium isotherm models for analysing the adsorption equilibrium data the langmuir and freundlich isotherm equations are expressed as follows 4 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q e 5 l n q e l n k f 1 n l n c e where qm mg g 1 denotes the maximum adsorption capacity ce mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration of tc and mb qe mg g 1 is the equilibrium adsorption capacity of tc and mb adsorbed by the sample and kl is the langmuir constant kf and 1 n are the freundlich parameters involved in adsorption capacity and intensity respectively these values can be determined using the two isotherms 2 6 adsorption thermodynamics to understand the energy change between the adsorbent and adsorbate we employed adsorption thermodynamics and calculated the obtained thermodynamic parameters such as standard free energy δ g θ standard enthalpy change δ h θ and standard entropy change δ s θ using the following equations 6 δ g θ r t ln k c 7 ln k c δ s θ r δ h θ r t where kc is distribution coefficient 28 29 r and t represent the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and system temperature k respectively 2 7 nh3 adsorption experiments and in situ ft ir spectroscopy adsorption equilibrium experiments were carried out by a static volumetric method before sorption analysis the samples were degassed in a vacuum oven at 120 c for 10 h nh3 adsorption experiments were conducted using 99 9995 purity nh3 bsd ps ps2 0949 beishide instrument technology co ltd china was used to measure the nh3 adsorption desorption isotherms at 298 k in a pressure range of 0 100 kpa the nh3 adsorption mechanism of the sample was recorded in the range of 400 3000 cm 1 and evaluated by in situ ft ir spectroscopy using a diamond atr unit bruker vertex70tgs detector resolution 4 cm 1 the system of situ ft ir spectroscopy first was purged with nitrogen for 30 min and then collected data every 60 s for 10 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of hcps sem was used to study the morphology of hcps fig 1 sem results revealed that both hcp bpa and hcp bpa na were comprised of particles that adhered to each other resulting in the formation of a three dimensional porous structure 30 simultaneously it was evident that the roughness of the hcp bpa na particle surface decreased and the pore structure of hcp bpa na was damaged owing to alkalisation to further examine the porous structure properties of hcps n2 adsorption desorption isotherm measurements were performed at 77 k figs 2 a and 2b show the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of hcp bpa and hcp bpa na respectively results indicated limited n2 adsorption and a gradually increasing trend in the region of relative pressure p po 0 1 moreover a hysteresis loop was observed above p po 0 4 fig 2a indicating that the hcp bpa sample contained micropores and mesopores 31 after treatment with alkaline solution the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of hcp bpa na fig 2b exhibited an obvious uptake below p po 0 1 and hysteresis loop above p po 0 4 which are characteristics of mesopores the psds of hcp bpa and hcp bpa na obtained using the dft method figs 2c and 2d were similar from 2 to 10 nm although the amount of pore volume was different this is perhaps because some of the micropores were destroyed in the naoh aqueous solution this result can be further confirmed by the specific surface area and pore volume parameters of the two samples table 1 the specific surface area and pore volume of hcp bpa were up to 308 404 m2 g 1 and 0 2057 cm3 g 1 respectively while those of hcp bpa na were approximately 24 7477 m2 g 1 and 0 0407 cm3 g 1 it can be concluded that the corresponding pore structure of hcp bpa was damaged which was consistent with the above sem results in particular carbon atoms between the two molecules of phenols were damaged during treatment with the alkaline solution leading to the collapse of the porous structure 32 33 to further understand the chemical structures of hcp bpa and hcp bpa na as well as the interactions between mb tc and hcp bpa na during the adsorption process the ft ir spectra of hcp bpa na before and after tc and mb adsorption were collected and the results are shown in fig 3 the broad peak at 3423 cm 1 can be assigned to oh stretching the band at 1223 cm 1 was attributed to co stretching vibration and the peak centred at 2931 cm 1 represented methylene stretching vibration 34 all aforementioned peaks revealed that fda successfully cross linked to bpa after modification by alkali treatment it was clear that the peak of co stretching vibration shifted to a smaller wavenumber of 1192 cm 1 this is likely because the polar groups phenolic hydroxyl were transformed into other forms sodium phenolate 35 this result also confirmed the successful synthesis of hcp bpa na additionally after mb adsorption a series of new peaks appeared at 698 863 and 1357 cm 1 in hcp bpa na which mainly belonged to the characteristic absorption peak of mb 36 indicating that mb was loaded on hcp bpa na similarly the peaks observed at 1602 and 1392 cm 1 can be assigned to the nh stretching vibration and carboxyl oc o bending vibration respectively which reveal the successful adsorption of tc on hcp bpa na 37 to gain further insights into the surface composition and interaction mechanism xps fig 4 was employed to characterise the four samples namely hcp bpa hcp bpa na after tc adsorption hcp bpa na tc and after mb adsorption hcp bpa na mb table 2 shows the xps spectra and atomic percentage of c n o and na the wide scan xps of hcp bpa fig 4a revealed a peak binding energy of 1071 0 ev assigned to na 1 s after modification 38 illustrating the successful synthesis of hcp bpa na this result can be further confirmed by the high resolution na 1 s xps spectrum of hcp bpa na fig 4b and the atomic percentage of na table 2 meanwhile compared with hcp bpa fig 4c hcp bpa na fig 4d revealed similar characteristic xps signals of co and coh except the new peak at 535 5 ev 39 this is likely because the phenolic hydroxyl group was converted into sodium phenolate c o na during alkali treatment furthermore in terms of the mass concentration of oxygen compared with hcp bpa 22 10 table 2 hcp bpa na showed an increase of 38 4 which could be ascribed to the following two aspects first solvent dce participated as the external cross linker in the cross linking reaction and introduced the c cl groups that can be hydrolysed by the alkaline solution leading to an increase in the oxygen groups 40 second the original hcp bpa structure was damaged which decreased the carbon atom content and increased the oxygen atom content after mb and tc adsorption the na 1 s peak disappeared fig 4a thus highlighting the key role of cation exchange in the removal of mb and tc by hcp bpa na in other words for mb removal fig 4g shows two peaks at 401 0 and 399 5 ev assigned to the n atoms of adsorbed mb 41 which verifies that mb was observed in hcp bpa na simultaneously the atomic percentage of n table 2 increased from 0 to 7 05 suggesting that mb was successfully adsorbed on the surface of hcp bpa na in the case of tc the following arguments serve to justify the removal of tc from hcp bpa na as shown in fig 4h the appearance of n 1s peaks at 399 90 and 402 23 ev assigned to the n atoms of tc in hcp bpa na tc indicated that tc was removed by the sorbent 42 this finding can be further confirmed by the increase in the relative n and o contents after tc adsorption table 2 to further observe the structure of hcp bpa and hcp bpa na tga and ca were used to determine the thermal stability and surface wettability of the hcp bpa and hcp bpa na respectively as shown in fig 5 a a 10 mass loss of hcp bpa was observed at 380 c in n2 atmosphere in contrast the 10 mass loss of hcp bpa na was evident at 255 c this difference can be attributed to the segment damage of hcp bpa during alkali treatment as shown in figs 5c and 5d the static water ca of hcp bpa was more than 90 indicating that it was essentially hydrophobic however hcp bpa na revealed hydrophilic characteristics with a ca of 88 after alkaline treatment 43 the difference is ascribed to the fact that the phenolic hydroxyl group of polymers was transformed into phenolate ions this result can be confirmed by the dispersal behaviour of two samples in water fig 5b it was obvious that the hcp bpa polymer was deposited in the bottle and scarce dispersed nanoparticles were observed in the water alternatively the hcp bpa na polymer showed good diffusibility in water and only few polymer nanoparticles were precipitated at the bottom of the bottle suggesting that the hcp bpa na surface was equipped with numerous hydrophilic functional groups benefiting from the contact frequency enhancement between the active sites of the adsorbent and target contaminants 44 summary although the porous structure of polymers was damage the content of oxygen rich functional groups and the hydrophilic performance was improved dramatically which was benefited for hcp bpa na to remove water soluble contaminants 3 2 effect of solution ph on tc and mb adsorption the ph of a solution is a crucial controlling parameter in the adsorption process for mb and tc removal the effect of the ph of a solution on the adsorbent and zeta potential trends of hcp bpa and hcp bpa na at various ph values 3 10 were investigated and these results are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6a the zeta potential of hcp bpa na was always negative and hcp bpa exhibited a negative charge from ph 4 10 this difference may be ascribed to the fact that additional oxygen rich functional groups were loaded on the polymer surface by alkali treatment additionally the zeta potentials of hcp bpa na for solutions with ph 7 8 and 9 were very close however the zeta potential value at ph 10 was obviously large the deviation is likely caused by the instability of the polymer nanoparticles owing to an increase in electrostatic repulsion in terms of mb fig 6b reveals that the adsorption capacity of mb significantly increased with an increase in ph value from 3 to 10 i e maximum mb adsorption was obtained at ph 10 with a maximum adsorption capacity of 654 13 mg g 1 this anticipated outcome can be explained by the electrostatic attraction between the positive dye molecules and negatively charged adsorbent surface 45 conversely the maximum mb adsorption capacity of hcp bpa was 175 09 mg g 1 which accounted for only 27 of that of hcp bpa na furthermore the insignificant change in the adsorption capacity of tc by hcp bpa with a change in ph can be attributed to the combination of electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic interaction however the adsorbed tc capacity of hcp bpa na decreased when the ph values increased from 3 to 10 with a maximum tc adsorption capacity of 157 15 mg g 1 at ph 3 this phenomenon can be mainly explained by the electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate in particular tc exists as cations at ph 3 5 as zwitterions at ph 3 5 7 5 and as anions at ph 7 5 46 moreover the surface of hcp bpa na was negatively charged when ph 3 10 hence the electrostatic attraction between the anion tc molecules and adsorbent hcp bpa na was the strongest when ph 3 therefore considering the above discussions and combined with the findings of xps analysis we can propose that the removal mechanism of tc and mb using hcp bpa na is mainly attributed to the electrostatic attraction during the adsorption process 3 3 adsorption kinetic studies to gain further insights into the adsorption of tc and mb onto the adsorbent the kinetic data were fitted using the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics fig s1 and table 3 in terms of tc and mb removal in hcp bpa na the r2 values of the pseudo second order equation are greater than those of the pseudo ﬁrst order equation suggesting that the pseudo second order model can better describe the sorption kinetics of the process these results were also supported by the good agreement between calculated qe cal and experimental qe exp it is suggested that the adsorption process was dependent on surface charges and the surface functional group furthermore it is well recognised that the value of pseudo second order rate constant k2 can be used to evaluate the adsorption rate of different adsorbents under the same experimental conditions 47 the pseudo second order rate constants of tc and mb adsorption in hcp bpa na were 9 90 10 3 and 5 92 10 3 g mg 1 min 1 respectively which were attributed to the good diffusibility and abundant oxygen rich functional groups of hcp bpa na compared with the others adsorbent table 5 hcp bpa na demonstrated higher removal rates 3 4 adsorption isotherm to further understand the adsorption mechanism the langmuir and freundlich models were used to analyse the experimental isotherm data fig s2 shows the equilibrium curve results of the two models and table 4 provides a list of the relevant parameters based on the r2 values the langmuir model best described the adsorption implying that the adsorption of tc and mb onto hcp bpa na was homogeneous and monolayer with the tc and mb qe values of 268 09 and 645 16 mg g 1 respectively it is generally accepted that the value of 0 1 1 n 0 5 denotes easy adsorption 48 for tc and mb removal from hcp bpa na 1 n was 0 3056 and 0 1143 respectively these results indicate that tc and mb were easily adsorbed on the hcp bpa na surface therefore hcp bpa na prepared in this study is expected to be an efficient adsorbent for tc and mb removal on a large scale to further highlight the ultrafast and efficient removal of tc and mb using hcp bpa na table 5 shows the comparison results of the pseudo second order rate constant and maximum adsorption capacity of tc and mb using hcp bpa na and other adsorbents notably the k2 values of tc and mb adsorption onto hcp bpa na were 9 90 10 3 and 5 92 10 3 g mg 1 min 1 respectively which were larger than those reported in previous studies table 5 importantly hcp bpa na also exhibited excellent tc and mb adsorption with maximum adsorption capacities of 268 09 and 645 16 mg g 1 respectively which can be ascribed to the unique feature of hcp bpa na and the presence of numerous oxygenous functional groups these results demonstrated that hcp bpa na exhibited both fast adsorption rate and highly efficient adsorption capacities strongly suggesting that it offers tremendous removal capacity in the tc and mb adsorbents 3 5 thermodynamic analyses fig s3a shows the effect of temperature on tc mb adsorption onto hcp bpa na between 25 c and 45 c with an increase in temperature the tc uptake increased up to 192 24 mg g 1 at 45 c 173 44 mg g 1 at 25 c the adsorption of mb in hcp bpa na revealed a similar trend with the adsorption capacity as high as 533 33 mg g 1 at 45 c 485 52 mg g 1 at 25 c additionally δ h θ and δ s θ values were determined using the slope and intercept of van t hoff plot of ln kc versus 1 t fig s3b table s1 presents the thermodynamic results analysed using the gibbs helmholtz equation where it can be seen that gibbs free energy δ g θ values were negative confirming the spontaneous adsorption of tc mb onto hcp bpa na the δ g θ value increases with temperature suggesting that the relatively high temperature aids adsorption 56 furthermore the δ h θ values were positive 10 31 and 6 73 kj mol 1 for tc and mb respectively indicating that tc mb adsorption onto hcp bpa na was endothermic meanwhile the positive values of δ s θ 52 51 and 46 85 j mol 1 k 1 for tc and mb respectively revealed increased randomness at the solid liquid interface during the adsorption process 3 6 multi compound adsorption in binary solution systems both tc and mb are water soluble pollutants and tc and mb simultaneously persist in industrial wastewater in most cases thus before their release in the environment the combined efficient treatment of these complex contaminants is necessary as shown in fig 7 a the removal rate of tc and mb in hcp bpa na were 11 50 and 45 20 in the single solution system which decreased to 2 90 and 30 00 in the binary solution system respectively the ratio of the adsorption amount rq was defined as qe b binary solution system qe s single solution system for both tc and mb according to a previous study 57 if rq 1 the coexisting contaminant may synergistically enhance the sorption capacity of the pollutants in contrast if rq 1 the adsorption of the pollutant is constrained by the other coexisting contaminant rq 1 indicates no interrelationship between the coexisting contaminants based on the above analysis the rq values fig 7b were calculated to be 0 42 tc and 0 64 mb indicating that the coexisting contaminants revealed a competitive effect conclusively the coexistence of tc and mb reduces the adsorption capacity because they compete for binding sites in hcp bpa na one plausible explanation for this result is that the presence of dyes on the surface of the hcp bpa na networks does not provide sufficient active sites for tc uptake leading to competitiveness for the available adsorption sites 58 furthermore considering that the adsorbent of hcp bpa na can be used as a type of porous anion organic polymer it is necessary to probe whether adsorption selectivity exists in binary dye solutions i e cationic and anionic dyes thus mixed mo mb pollutants were used to evaluate the removal capacity of hcp bpa na fig 7 fig 7a demonstrated that the removal rates of mb and mo in hcp bpa na were 34 and 1 in the single solution system which increased to 79 and 68 in the binary solution system respectively furthermore the calculated rq values were 2 32 and 4 88 fig 7b therefore the removal of mo mb from hcp bpa na revealed a synergetic effect rather than a selective effect in the mo mb binary solution this phenomenon can be also explained based on the following perspectives first the mb removal mechanism was mainly attributed to electrostatic attraction and π π interaction the formation of dimers based on the interaction between mb and mo dyes can enrich the π electrons of mb in the mo mb binary solution which boosts the proportion of π π stacking interactions in the removal process thus enhancing the removal rate second the uptake rate showed an improvement likely because of the presence of additional adsorption sites following the weakening of electronic repulsion between the absorbent and anionic mo in other words most of the mb was rapidly adsorbed reducing electronic repulsion between the absorbent and mo which aided mo uptake via some other interactions such as hydrogen bonding and π π interaction 59 3 7 adsorption mechanism the mb and tc adsorption mechanism on the hcp bpa na polymer was related to multiple interactions first the discussion regarding the effect of ph on the mb and tc removal in combination with a change in the zeta potential of the adsorbent suggested that the electrostatic interaction was significantly influenced the adsorption process second the xps analysis and reduction in the na content from 2 86 pure hcp bpa na to 0 hcp bpa na tc and hcp bpa na mb revealed that sodium ions were removed from the adsorbent surface and molecular contaminants were transferred to the adsorbent surface suggesting that the ion exchange played a crucial role in mb tc uptake additionally as mb and tc structures were all equipped with aromatic backbones and the bpa derived hcp bpa na polymer contained abundant aromatic rings the π π stacking interactions can occur between mb tc molecules and hcp bpa na thus the possible adsorption mechanism including electrostatic interaction ion exchange and π π stacking interactions is schematically illustrated in fig 8 3 8 re usability the re usability of adsorbents is a significant factor for the practical application of the adsorbing material five adsorption desorption cycles were performed to evaluate the re usability of the adsorbent fig 9 based on the above results of the effect of ph on tc mb adsorption using hcp bpa na 0 1 m naoh solution tc and 0 1 m hydrochloric mb were used for the re usability experiment tc and mb exhibited adsorption capabilities of 148 09 and 432 07 mg g 1 respectively which was approximately 70 of the first value of the adsorption experiment 224 43 and 592 75 mg g 1 after five repeated cycles indicating that the polymer revealed outstanding re usability with a slightly decrease therefore the as prepared hcp bpa na can be used as a promising adsorbent to treat tc mb wastewater 3 9 application of hcp bpa na to sstw in terms of practicality the adsorption behaviour of tc and mb onto hcp bpa na was studied using sstw as the source of real water the removal rates of mb 63 31 and tc 30 84 in real water were higher than those of mb 36 85 and tc 16 56 in up water fig 10 a for mb this result can be attributed to the high ph table s2 of real water which was consistent with the results of other studies 60 and our above discussion the section of 3 2 regarding the effect of ph on the removal of mb using hcp bpa na the result of tc removal rates can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the presence of cations ca2 and mg2 61 which can boost the adsorption capability of tc in real water samples another reason can be the formation of natural organic matter complex originating from the interaction between tc and organic matter 62 the uv vis spectra and three dimensional fluorescence 3d eem were used to show the interaction between tc and organic matter in sstw as shown in fig 10b the absorbance curves after introducing tc to the sstw sample differed from those of pure tc illustrating the interaction between tc and dissolved organic matter dom 63 moreover after the addition of tc to the sstw sample the original peak fig 10c shifted to a high wavelength and exhibited a new peak fig 10d suggesting the formation of a novel complex after tc adsorption onto dom these results indicate that hcp bpa na can be used as an adsorbent for removing mb and tc from real wastewater 3 10 nh3 adsorption performance considering that hcp bpa na is a microporous material containing abundant oxygenous groups its nh3 removal efficiency was investigated and the results are shown in fig 11 a the nh3 uptake amount of hcp bpa na was 7 2 mmol g at 1 bar to explore the adsorption mechanism of hcps the situ ft ir spectroscopy analysis was conducted and the results are shown in fig 11b the time variation in the ratio of the ir peak height at 1410 cm 1 increased by 5 min thereafter the value of the ratio remains unchanged after nh3 adsorption which corresponds to nh4 64 the findings of the nh3 adsorption mechanism by hcp bpa na revealed that the obtained polymer can effectively remove nh3 mainly because of the abundant oxygen rich functional groups compared with other hcps the obtained polymer can be fabricated using a simple method while the polymer sorbent also showed excellent nh3 adsorption efficiency 4 conclusions in summary a highly efficient and multi functional sorbent hcp bpa na with oxygen rich functional groups was prepared using bpa and naoh as the phenolic hydroxy contained monomer and chemical modification reagent respectively the synthesised polymer exhibited the following advantages 1 an ultrafast adsorption rate of mb and tc onto hcp bpa na was obtained at 5 92 10 3 and 9 90 10 3 g mg 1 min 1 respectively 2 the hcp bpa na polymer showed outstanding adsorption capacities of 645 16 and 268 09 mg g 1 for mb and tc removal respectively the adsorption mechanism depended on the ion exchange π π interaction and electrostatic interaction 3 the oxygen rich functional hcps exhibited a high capacity for nh3 uptake amounts of 7 2 mmol g at 1 bar moreover the excellent adsorption performance of the polymer towards tc and mb and mb mo in real water and binary solution system respectively was shown conclusively our work introduces a promising adsorbent for the ultrafast and efficient removal of water soluble contaminants as well as excellent nh3 uptake declaration of

13604,a novel highly water dispersible polymer based adsorbent hcp bpa na was synthesized by using bisphenol a bpa containing polar functional group as raw material via cross linking reaction and subsequently treated with alkali solution owing to its abundant oxygen groups hcp bpa na displays large uptake capacity 645 16 and 268 09 mg g 1 and fast adsorption rates 5 92 10 3 and 9 90 10 3 g mg 1 min 1for methylene blue mb and tetracycline tc respectively besides it s nh3 uptake capacity can reach 7 2 mmol g 1 at 298 k and1 bar the removal mechanism for mb and tc was primarily caused by electrostatic attraction and ion exchange and for the uptake of nh3 was mainly attributed to the high affinity between the basic nh3 molecule and acidic sites of the hcp bpa na additionally hcp bpa na possesses the higher adsorption performance for mb and tc in real wastewater because of the promotion effect of dissolved organic matter and exhibited excellent adsorption ability towards mb and mo due to the synergistic enhanced effects of multi mechanisms in binary mb mo dye solutions this study introduces a green and simple strategy for designing an oxygen rich functional adsorbent with versatile adsorption properties high efficiency and fast rate which can be applied as a promising sorbent to eliminate water soluble contaminants from the real wastewater and ammonia in the air keywords hyper cross linked polymer organic pollutants ammonia adsorption 1 introduction water and air pollution are becoming increasingly serious environmental issues and have garnered considerable attention organic pollutants such as dyes and antibiotics are known to cause threats to human health owing to their potential carcinogenic property 1 at low concentrations they also pose a risk to ecosystem equilibrium because of their toxic effects on organisms and long term persistence in the ecosystem 2 air pollution such as ammonia nh3 have a significant impact on animal and human activities at high concentrations 3 for environmental protection adsorption is often considered a simple low cost and highly efficient separation and purification technique for disposing of contaminants the normal adsorbents including zeolites 4 activated carbons 5 6 metal oxides 7 10 metal organic framework mof materials 11 and covalent organic framework cof materials 12 have been suggested to remove organic pollutes from wastewater however these materials were inadequate owing to their low adsorption rate the limited removal ability for only single component or same type pollutants therefore the development of advanced multi functional absorbents for eliminating organic pollutants and nh3 is crucial to aid water and air purification recently hyper cross linked polymers hcps are considered promising organic polymer based adsorbents for wastewater treatment owing to the hydrophobic properties of hcps emanating from enriched aromatic systems in their skeletons they can effectively remove oleophilic hydrophobic contaminants primarily using the hydrophobic interaction van der waals interaction and π π interaction between the target pollutant molecules and adsorbents 13 14 however when hcps react with hydrophilic or water soluble contaminants such as metal iron water soluble dye and antibiotics their adsorption capacity is considerably reduced for example in order to remove phenol and methylene blue mb zhang et al 15 synthesized a hyper cross linked resin adsorbent zch 101 and found that the adsorption capacity was 384 6 mg g 1 for phenol but for mb its capacity was only 20 9 mg g 1 which can be attributed to the hydrophobic property of the aromatic structure of zch 101 hence it is imperative to develop a novel hydrophilic adsorbent that can efficiently remove water soluble contaminants so far considerable research focusing on the enhancement of hydrophilic properties of polymers has employed two methods the first method involves the addition of certain hydrophilic group contained monomers and the second method involves post functionalisation to modify some hydrophilic groups in the polymers 16 18 huang et al 19 prepared a series of gallic acid modified hcps by post functionalisation to improve the hydrophilic properties the adsorbent hj d55 exhibited a high adsorption capacity 444 4 mg g 1 for separating salicylic acid sa from an aqueous solution which was attributed to the crucial influence of hydrogen bonding and the fact that the introduction of gallic acid groups enhances the adsorption of sa however the adsorption rate of this adsorbent hj d55 was relatively low 1 477 10 4 g mg 1 min 1 therefore synthesising a material exhibiting high adsorption capacity and adsorption rate as well as showing potential for commercial production in the field of water treatment remains a challenge generally the modification of sulphonic acid is regarded as the common post functionalisation method for porous materials 20 21 sulphonic acid modified hcps sam hcps were synthesised for the removal of toxic metal ions from wastewater 22 the maximum adsorption capacity of cu2 in hcps was 51 45 mg g 1 the low adsorption capacity of this absorbent can be ascribed to the low content of sulphonated functional groups moreover the sulphonation reaction requires harsh reaction conditions which are accompanied by the production of a large amount of acid contained wastewater these drawbacks limit the large scale use of the sulphonation approach in contrast alkalisation reaction revealed obvious advantages such as easy preparation conditions and facile synthetic routes on the other hand gas storage is an important application of hcps owing to its abundant micropores it has been widely used to adsorb h2 and co2 23 but rarely used for the removal of polar molecules in air pollutants such as nh3 some researchers have reported acidic functional groups such as co2h so3h and po3h2 for the purpose of the enhancement of the uptake of nh3 kang et al 24 obtained a type of functional hcp named 1 tcs using double acidification including post oxidation and post sulphonation and used it for nh3 uptake results showed that the nh3 capture capacity of 1 t before modification was less than 3 8 mmol g 1 at 298 k and 1 bar following post oxidation and post sulphonation the adsorption capacities dramatically increased to 6 41 and 8 52 mmol g 1 respectively which was attributed to the high content of carboxylic and sulphonic acid groups on the surface of hcps 0 92 mmol g 1 hence it could be predicted that hcps was modified by a facile and green approach alkalization reaction accompanied by the enhancement of oxygen functional groups could exhibit excellent adsorption property for the uptake of ammonia in this study we developed a highly efficient and environmentally friendly method for synthesising oxygen rich functional hcp bisphenol a bpa na to remove water soluble contaminants and nh3 a series characterisation of the obtained polymer material was conducted then the adsorption experiments were performed using mb and tetracycline tc as water soluble contaminants further the application of hcp bpa na in real tc or mb contained wastewater was discussed and the adsorption behaviour of binary solution systems tc mb mb methyl orange mo on hcp bpa na were performed meanwhile nh3 adsorption experiments were conducted to explore the ability of hcp bpa na in air pollution treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials anhydrous fecl3 bpa mb mo and tc were

methanol the filtered polymer was washed with methanol and ultra pure up water finally soxhlet extraction using methanol was employed to purify and dry the solids under vacuum at 80 c for 24 h the obtained product was named hcp bpa next 600 mg of naoh was dissolved in 30 ml of water and 300 mg of hcp bpa was added to the above solution the mixture was heated at 80 c for 24 h after cooling water

intervals of 0 5 nm 2 4 adsorption experiments before batch experiments the samples hcp bpa and hcp bpa na were kept in a vacuum oven at 80 c for 12 h and then stored in a desiccator the desired amount of dry sample was introduced to the aqueous solutions of tc and mb with varying concentrations thermodynamic studies were performed by investigating the effect of temperature 25 45 c with tc 0 125 g l 1 ph 3 and mb 0 03 g l 1 original solution the binary component adsorption experiment was carried out using the mixture of tc and mb mb and mo the concentration of binary mixture was 50 mg l 1 single solution added by equal initial volume without adjust of ph and the dosages of adsorbent is 0 05 mg l 1 the mixtures were shaken in an oscillator at a certain temperature and constant speed for 12 h to reach equilibrium the residual concentrations of tc and mb were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer at their maximum wavelengths λmax of 358 and 664 nm respectively the uptakes of tc and mb at equilibrium time defined as equilibrium adsorption capability qe were calculated as 1 q e v c o c e m where co and ce mg l 1 denote the initial and final concentrations of the tc and mb solutions respectively v ml is the volume of the adsorbate solution and m mg is the mass of the adsorbent 2 5 adsorption kinetics and isotherm models to understand the adsorption rate and mechanism pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics and their corresponding equations were used to evaluate and analyse the experimental data the equations of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics are expressed as follows 2 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt and qe mg g 1 denote the amounts of pollutant adsorbed at equilibrium and time t min respectively k1 and k2 min 1 are the rate constants of pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption respectively the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are the two most commonly used equilibrium isotherm models for analysing the adsorption equilibrium data the langmuir and freundlich isotherm equations are expressed as follows 4 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q e 5 l n q e l n k f 1 n l n c e where qm mg g 1 denotes the maximum adsorption capacity ce mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration of tc and mb qe mg g 1 is the equilibrium adsorption capacity of tc and mb adsorbed by the sample and kl is the langmuir constant kf and 1 n are the freundlich parameters involved in adsorption capacity and intensity respectively these values can be determined using the two isotherms 2 6 adsorption thermodynamics to understand the energy change between the adsorbent and adsorbate we employed adsorption thermodynamics and calculated the obtained thermodynamic parameters such as standard free energy δ g θ standard enthalpy change δ h θ and standard entropy change δ s θ using the following equations 6 δ g θ r t ln k c 7 ln k c δ s θ r δ h θ r t where kc is distribution coefficient 28 29 r and t represent the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and system temperature k respectively 2 7 nh3 adsorption experiments and in situ ft ir spectroscopy adsorption equilibrium experiments were carried out by a static volumetric method before sorption analysis the samples were degassed in a vacuum oven at 120 c for 10 h nh3 adsorption experiments were conducted using 99 9995 purity nh3 bsd ps ps2 0949 beishide instrument technology co ltd china was used to measure the nh3 adsorption desorption isotherms at 298 k in a pressure range of 0 100 kpa the nh3 adsorption mechanism of the sample was recorded in the range of 400 3000 cm 1 and evaluated by in situ ft ir spectroscopy using a diamond atr unit bruker vertex70tgs detector resolution 4 cm 1 the system of situ ft ir spectroscopy first was purged with nitrogen for 30 min and then collected data every 60 s for 10 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of hcps sem was used to study the morphology of hcps fig 1 sem results revealed that both hcp bpa and hcp bpa na were comprised of particles that adhered to each other resulting in the formation of a three dimensional porous structure 30 simultaneously it was evident that the roughness of the hcp bpa na particle surface decreased and the pore structure of hcp bpa na was damaged owing to alkalisation to further examine the porous structure properties of hcps n2 adsorption desorption isotherm measurements were performed at 77 k figs 2 a and 2b show the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of hcp bpa and hcp bpa na respectively results indicated limited n2 adsorption and a gradually increasing trend in the region of relative pressure p po 0 1 moreover a hysteresis loop was observed above p po 0 4 fig 2a indicating that the hcp bpa sample contained micropores and mesopores 31 after treatment with alkaline solution the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of hcp bpa na fig 2b exhibited an obvious uptake below p po 0 1 and hysteresis loop above p po 0 4 which are characteristics of mesopores the psds of hcp bpa and hcp bpa na obtained using the dft method figs 2c and 2d were similar from 2 to 10 nm although the amount of pore volume was different this is perhaps because some of the micropores were destroyed in the naoh aqueous solution this result can be further confirmed by the specific surface area and pore volume parameters of the two samples table 1 the specific surface area and pore volume of hcp bpa were up to 308 404 m2 g 1 and 0 2057 cm3 g 1 respectively while those of hcp bpa na were approximately 24 7477 m2 g 1 and 0 0407 cm3 g 1 it can be concluded that the corresponding pore structure of hcp bpa was damaged which was consistent with the above sem results in particular carbon atoms between the two molecules of phenols were damaged during treatment with the alkaline solution leading to the collapse of the porous structure 32 33 to further understand the chemical structures of hcp bpa and hcp bpa na as well as the interactions between mb tc and hcp bpa na during the adsorption process the ft ir spectra of hcp bpa na before and after tc and mb adsorption were collected and the results are shown in fig 3 the broad peak at 3423 cm 1 can be assigned to oh stretching the band at 1223 cm 1 was attributed to co stretching vibration and the peak centred at 2931 cm 1 represented methylene stretching vibration 34 all aforementioned peaks revealed that fda successfully cross linked to bpa after modification by alkali treatment it was clear that the peak of co stretching vibration shifted to a smaller wavenumber of 1192 cm 1 this is likely because the polar groups phenolic hydroxyl were transformed into other forms sodium phenolate 35 this result also confirmed the successful synthesis of hcp bpa na additionally after mb adsorption a series of new peaks appeared at 698 863 and 1357 cm 1 in hcp bpa na which mainly belonged to the characteristic absorption peak of mb 36 indicating that mb was loaded on hcp bpa na similarly the peaks observed at 1602 and 1392 cm 1 can be assigned to the nh stretching vibration and carboxyl oc o bending vibration respectively which reveal the successful adsorption of tc on hcp bpa na 37 to gain further insights into the surface composition and interaction mechanism xps fig 4 was employed to characterise the four samples namely hcp bpa hcp bpa na after tc adsorption hcp bpa na tc and after mb adsorption hcp bpa na mb table 2 shows the xps spectra and atomic percentage of c n o and na the wide scan xps of hcp bpa fig 4a revealed a peak binding energy of 1071 0 ev assigned to na 1 s after modification 38 illustrating the successful synthesis of hcp bpa na this result can be further confirmed by the high resolution na 1 s xps spectrum of hcp bpa na fig 4b and the atomic percentage of na table 2 meanwhile compared with hcp bpa fig 4c hcp bpa na fig 4d revealed similar characteristic xps signals of co and coh except the new peak at 535 5 ev 39 this is likely because the phenolic hydroxyl group was converted into sodium phenolate c o na during alkali treatment furthermore in terms of the mass concentration of oxygen compared with hcp bpa 22 10 table 2 hcp bpa na showed an increase of 38 4 which could be ascribed to the following two aspects first solvent dce participated as the external cross linker in the cross linking reaction and introduced the c cl groups that can be hydrolysed by the alkaline solution leading to an increase in the oxygen groups 40 second the original hcp bpa structure was damaged which decreased the carbon atom content and increased the oxygen atom content after mb and tc adsorption the na 1 s peak disappeared fig 4a thus highlighting the key role of cation exchange in the removal of mb and tc by hcp bpa na in other words for mb removal fig 4g shows two peaks at 401 0 and 399 5 ev assigned to the n atoms of adsorbed mb 41 which verifies that mb was observed in hcp bpa na simultaneously the atomic percentage of n table 2 increased from 0 to 7 05 suggesting that mb was successfully adsorbed on the surface of hcp bpa na in the case of tc the following arguments serve to justify the removal of tc from hcp bpa na as shown in fig 4h the appearance of n 1s peaks at 399 90 and 402 23 ev assigned to the n atoms of tc in hcp bpa na tc indicated that tc was removed by the sorbent 42 this finding can be further confirmed by the increase in the relative n and o contents after tc adsorption table 2 to further observe the structure of hcp bpa and hcp bpa na tga and ca were used to determine the thermal stability and surface wettability of the hcp bpa and hcp bpa na respectively as shown in fig 5 a a 10 mass loss of hcp bpa was observed at 380 c in n2 atmosphere in contrast the 10 mass loss of hcp bpa na was evident at 255 c this difference can be attributed to the segment damage of hcp bpa during alkali treatment as shown in figs 5c and 5d the static water ca of hcp bpa was more than 90 indicating that it was essentially hydrophobic however hcp bpa na revealed hydrophilic characteristics with a ca of 88 after alkaline treatment 43 the difference is ascribed to the fact that the phenolic hydroxyl group of polymers was transformed into phenolate ions this result can be confirmed by the dispersal behaviour of two samples in water fig 5b it was obvious that the hcp bpa polymer was deposited in the bottle and scarce dispersed nanoparticles were observed in the water alternatively the hcp bpa na polymer showed good diffusibility in water and only few polymer nanoparticles were precipitated at the bottom of the bottle suggesting that the hcp bpa na surface was equipped with numerous hydrophilic functional groups benefiting from the contact frequency enhancement between the active sites of the adsorbent and target contaminants 44 summary although the porous structure of polymers was damage the content of oxygen rich functional groups and the hydrophilic performance was improved dramatically which was benefited for hcp bpa na to remove water soluble contaminants 3 2 effect of solution ph on tc and mb adsorption the ph of a solution is a crucial controlling parameter in the adsorption process for mb and tc removal the effect of the ph of a solution on the adsorbent and zeta potential trends of hcp bpa and hcp bpa na at various ph values 3 10 were investigated and these results are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6a the zeta potential of hcp bpa na was always negative and hcp bpa exhibited a negative charge from ph 4 10 this difference may be ascribed to the fact that additional oxygen rich functional groups were loaded on the polymer surface by alkali treatment additionally the zeta potentials of hcp bpa na for solutions with ph 7 8 and 9 were very close however the zeta potential value at ph 10 was obviously large the deviation is likely caused by the instability of the polymer nanoparticles owing to an increase in electrostatic repulsion in terms of mb fig 6b reveals that the adsorption capacity of mb significantly increased with an increase in ph value from 3 to 10 i e maximum mb adsorption was obtained at ph 10 with a maximum adsorption capacity of 654 13 mg g 1 this anticipated outcome can be explained by the electrostatic attraction between the positive dye molecules and negatively charged adsorbent surface 45 conversely the maximum mb adsorption capacity of hcp bpa was 175 09 mg g 1 which accounted for only 27 of that of hcp bpa na furthermore the insignificant change in the adsorption capacity of tc by hcp bpa with a change in ph can be attributed to the combination of electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic interaction however the adsorbed tc capacity of hcp bpa na decreased when the ph values increased from 3 to 10 with a maximum tc adsorption capacity of 157 15 mg g 1 at ph 3 this phenomenon can be mainly explained by the electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate in particular tc exists as cations at ph 3 5 as zwitterions at ph 3 5 7 5 and as anions at ph 7 5 46 moreover the surface of hcp bpa na was negatively charged when ph 3 10 hence the electrostatic attraction between the anion tc molecules and adsorbent hcp bpa na was the strongest when ph 3 therefore considering the above discussions and combined with the findings of xps analysis we can propose that the removal mechanism of tc and mb using hcp bpa na is mainly attributed to the electrostatic attraction during the adsorption process 3 3 adsorption kinetic studies to gain further insights into the adsorption of tc and mb onto the adsorbent the kinetic data were fitted using the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics fig s1 and table 3 in terms of tc and mb removal in hcp bpa na the r2 values of the pseudo second order equation are greater than those of the pseudo ﬁrst order equation suggesting that the pseudo second order model can better describe the sorption kinetics of the process these results were also supported by the good agreement between calculated qe cal and experimental qe exp it is suggested that the adsorption process was dependent on surface charges and the surface functional group furthermore it is well recognised that the value of pseudo second order rate constant k2 can be used to evaluate the adsorption rate of different adsorbents under the same experimental conditions 47 the pseudo second order rate constants of tc and mb adsorption in hcp bpa na were 9 90 10 3 and 5 92 10 3 g mg 1 min 1 respectively which were attributed to the good diffusibility and abundant oxygen rich functional groups of hcp bpa na compared with the others adsorbent table 5 hcp bpa na demonstrated higher removal rates 3 4 adsorption isotherm to further understand the adsorption mechanism the langmuir and freundlich models were used to analyse the experimental isotherm data fig s2 shows the equilibrium curve results of the two models and table 4 provides a list of the relevant parameters based on the r2 values the langmuir model best described the adsorption implying that the adsorption of tc and mb onto hcp bpa na was homogeneous and monolayer with the tc and mb qe values of 268 09 and 645 16 mg g 1 respectively it is generally accepted that the value of 0 1 1 n 0 5 denotes easy adsorption 48 for tc and mb removal from hcp bpa na 1 n was 0 3056 and 0 1143 respectively these results indicate that tc and mb were easily adsorbed on the hcp bpa na surface therefore hcp bpa na prepared in this study is expected to be an efficient adsorbent for tc and mb removal on a large scale to further highlight the ultrafast and efficient removal of tc and mb using hcp bpa na table 5 shows the comparison results of the pseudo second order rate constant and maximum adsorption capacity of tc and mb using hcp bpa na and other adsorbents notably the k2 values of tc and mb adsorption onto hcp bpa na were 9 90 10 3 and 5 92 10 3 g mg 1 min 1 respectively which were larger than those reported in previous studies table 5 importantly hcp bpa na also exhibited excellent tc and mb adsorption with maximum adsorption capacities of 268 09 and 645 16 mg g 1 respectively which can be ascribed to the unique feature of hcp bpa na and the presence of numerous oxygenous functional groups these results demonstrated that hcp bpa na exhibited both fast adsorption rate and highly efficient adsorption capacities strongly suggesting that it offers tremendous removal capacity in the tc and mb adsorbents 3 5 thermodynamic analyses fig s3a shows the effect of temperature on tc mb adsorption onto hcp bpa na between 25 c and 45 c with an increase in temperature the tc uptake increased up to 192 24 mg g 1 at 45 c 173 44 mg g 1 at 25 c the adsorption of mb in hcp bpa na revealed a similar trend with the adsorption capacity as high as 533 33 mg g 1 at 45 c 485 52 mg g 1 at 25 c additionally δ h θ and δ s θ values were determined using the slope and intercept of van t hoff plot of ln kc versus 1 t fig s3b table s1 presents the thermodynamic results analysed using the gibbs helmholtz equation where it can be seen that gibbs free energy δ g θ values were negative confirming the spontaneous adsorption of tc mb onto hcp bpa na the δ g θ value increases with temperature suggesting that the relatively high temperature aids adsorption 56 furthermore the δ h θ values were positive 10 31 and 6 73 kj mol 1 for tc and mb respectively indicating that tc mb adsorption onto hcp bpa na was endothermic meanwhile the positive values of δ s θ 52 51 and 46 85 j mol 1 k 1 for tc and mb respectively revealed increased randomness at the solid liquid interface during the adsorption process 3 6 multi compound adsorption in binary solution systems both tc and mb are water soluble pollutants and tc and mb simultaneously persist in industrial wastewater in most cases thus before their release in the environment the combined efficient treatment of these complex contaminants is necessary as shown in fig 7 a the removal rate of tc and mb in hcp bpa na were 11 50 and 45 20 in the single solution system which decreased to 2 90 and 30 00 in the binary solution system respectively the ratio of the adsorption amount rq was defined as qe b binary solution system qe s single solution system for both tc and mb according to a previous study 57 if rq 1 the coexisting contaminant may synergistically enhance the sorption capacity of the pollutants in contrast if rq 1 the adsorption of the pollutant is constrained by the other coexisting contaminant rq 1 indicates no interrelationship between the coexisting contaminants based on the above analysis the rq values fig 7b were calculated to be 0 42 tc and 0 64 mb indicating that the coexisting contaminants revealed a competitive effect conclusively the coexistence of tc and mb reduces the adsorption capacity because they compete for binding sites in hcp bpa na one plausible explanation for this result is that the presence of dyes on the surface of the hcp bpa na networks does not provide sufficient active sites for tc uptake leading to competitiveness for the available adsorption sites 58 furthermore considering that the adsorbent of hcp bpa na can be used as a type of porous anion organic polymer it is necessary to probe whether adsorption selectivity exists in binary dye solutions i e cationic and anionic dyes thus mixed mo mb pollutants were used to evaluate the removal capacity of hcp bpa na fig 7 fig 7a demonstrated that the removal rates of mb and mo in hcp bpa na were 34 and 1 in the single solution system which increased to 79 and 68 in the binary solution system respectively furthermore the calculated rq values were 2 32 and 4 88 fig 7b therefore the removal of mo mb from hcp bpa na revealed a synergetic effect rather than a selective effect in the mo mb binary solution this phenomenon can be also explained based on the following perspectives first the mb removal mechanism was mainly attributed to electrostatic attraction and π π interaction the formation of dimers based on the interaction between mb and mo dyes can enrich the π electrons of mb in the mo mb binary solution which boosts the proportion of π π stacking interactions in the removal process thus enhancing the removal rate second the uptake rate showed an improvement likely because of the presence of additional adsorption sites following the weakening of electronic repulsion between the absorbent and anionic mo in other words most of the mb was rapidly adsorbed reducing electronic repulsion between the absorbent and mo which aided mo uptake via some other interactions such as hydrogen bonding and π π interaction 59 3 7 adsorption mechanism the mb and tc adsorption mechanism on the hcp bpa na polymer was related to multiple interactions first the discussion regarding the effect of ph on the mb and tc removal in combination with a change in the zeta potential of the adsorbent suggested that the electrostatic interaction was significantly influenced the adsorption process second the xps analysis and reduction in the na content from 2 86 pure hcp bpa na to 0 hcp bpa na tc and hcp bpa na mb revealed that sodium ions were removed from the adsorbent surface and molecular contaminants were transferred to the adsorbent surface suggesting that the ion exchange played a crucial role in mb tc uptake additionally as mb and tc structures were all equipped with aromatic backbones and the bpa derived hcp bpa na polymer contained abundant aromatic rings the π π stacking interactions can occur between mb tc molecules and hcp bpa na thus the possible adsorption mechanism including electrostatic interaction ion exchange and π π stacking interactions is schematically illustrated in fig 8 3 8 re usability the re usability of adsorbents is a significant factor for the practical application of the adsorbing material five adsorption desorption cycles were performed to evaluate the re usability of the adsorbent fig 9 based on the above results of the effect of ph on tc mb adsorption using hcp bpa na 0 1 m naoh solution tc and 0 1 m hydrochloric mb were used for the re usability experiment tc and mb exhibited adsorption capabilities of 148 09 and 432 07 mg g 1 respectively which was approximately 70 of the first value of the adsorption experiment 224 43 and 592 75 mg g 1 after five repeated cycles indicating that the polymer revealed outstanding re usability with a slightly decrease therefore the as prepared hcp bpa na can be used as a promising adsorbent to treat tc mb wastewater 3 9 application of hcp bpa na to sstw in terms of practicality the adsorption behaviour of tc and mb onto hcp bpa na was studied using sstw as the source of real water the removal rates of mb 63 31 and tc 30 84 in real water were higher than those of mb 36 85 and tc 16 56 in up water fig 10 a for mb this result can be attributed to the high ph table s2 of real water which was consistent with the results of other studies 60 and our above discussion the section of 3 2 regarding the effect of ph on the removal of mb using hcp bpa na the result of tc removal rates can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the presence of cations ca2 and mg2 61 which can boost the adsorption capability of tc in real water samples another reason can be the formation of natural organic matter complex originating from the interaction between tc and organic matter 62 the uv vis spectra and three dimensional fluorescence 3d eem were used to show the interaction between tc and organic matter in sstw as shown in fig 10b the absorbance curves after introducing tc to the sstw sample differed from those of pure tc illustrating the interaction between tc and dissolved organic matter dom 63 moreover after the addition of tc to the sstw sample the original peak fig 10c shifted to a high wavelength and exhibited a new peak fig 10d suggesting the formation of a novel complex after tc adsorption onto dom these results indicate that hcp bpa na can be used as an adsorbent for removing mb and tc from real wastewater 3 10 nh3 adsorption performance considering that hcp bpa na is a microporous material containing abundant oxygenous groups its nh3 removal efficiency was investigated and the results are shown in fig 11 a the nh3 uptake amount of hcp bpa na was 7 2 mmol g at 1 bar to explore the adsorption mechanism of hcps the situ ft ir spectroscopy analysis was conducted and the results are shown in fig 11b the time variation in the ratio of the ir peak height at 1410 cm 1 increased by 5 min thereafter the value of the ratio remains unchanged after nh3 adsorption which corresponds to nh4 64 the findings of the nh3 adsorption mechanism by hcp bpa na revealed that the obtained polymer can effectively remove nh3 mainly because of the abundant oxygen rich functional groups compared with other hcps the obtained polymer can be fabricated using a simple method while the polymer sorbent also showed excellent nh3 adsorption efficiency 4 conclusions in summary a highly efficient and multi functional sorbent hcp bpa na with oxygen rich functional groups was prepared using bpa and naoh as the phenolic hydroxy contained monomer and chemical modification reagent respectively the synthesised polymer exhibited the following advantages 1 an ultrafast adsorption rate of mb and tc onto hcp bpa na was obtained at 5 92 10 3 and 9 90 10 3 g mg 1 min 1 respectively 2 the hcp bpa na polymer showed outstanding adsorption capacities of 645 16 and 268 09 mg g 1 for mb and tc removal respectively the adsorption mechanism depended on the ion exchange π π interaction and electrostatic interaction 3 the oxygen rich functional hcps exhibited a high capacity for nh3 uptake amounts of 7 2 mmol g at 1 bar moreover the excellent adsorption performance of the polymer towards tc and mb and mb mo in real water and binary solution system respectively was shown conclusively our work introduces a promising adsorbent for the ultrafast and efficient removal of water soluble contaminants as well as excellent nh3 uptake declaration of
