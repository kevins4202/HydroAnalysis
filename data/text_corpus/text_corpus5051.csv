food webs mcdonald madden et al 2016 in this study we attempted to predict the effect of species removal on aquatic food webs using bbn by focusing on the response of a ubiquitous and abundant group

link between producers and consumers making chironomids excellent model organisms for aquatic food web biomanipulation studies barnard 1993 butakka et al 2016 lilley et al 2012 here we first developed a bbn framework to characterize six aquatic food webs incorporating inter species interaction strengths based on empirical data we quantified the degree of predation pressure among consumers and their resources using dietary information derived from stable isotope signatures 13c and 15n for all components in our food web models second we constructed six empirically derived food webs using bbn to investigate and predict chironomid abundance trends in response to species removal finally we assessed the predictive performance of the bbn food web models using in situ exclosure experiments to simulate predator removal data collected from these experiments were used to validate our food web model predictions we also applied sensitivity analysis to identify influential species on specific target variables from the bbn models to inform prioritization of management actions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection comprehensive surveys of the aquatic communities were carried out in six reservoirs in singapore res1 6 from january 2014 to june 2016 fig 1 these man made reservoirs vary in terms of their species assemblage land use history anthropogenic disturbances and riparian forest cover yeo and lim 2011 survey methods used included electrofishing fish traps cast nets artificial substrate colonizers plankton trawls and hand nets to capture samples of populations of representative taxa in the aquatic community in each reservoir see liew et al 2018 for details isotopic profiles δ 13c and δ 15n of all fish species representative benthic invertebrate taxa zooplankton phytoplankton and riparian plants were investigated with bayesian mixing models using the siar package parnell and jackson 2013 this allowed us to determine the mean dietary contribution of each resource to its respective consumers and construct a network matrix summarizing predator prey associations 2 2 bbn food web construction the bayesian belief network bbn is a probabilistic model that examines the causal interactions among a set of variables generally such causal networks comprise three features nodes links and probabilities in this case the nodes represent living components in the aquatic food web links depict the consumer resource interactions and conditional probabilities describe the dependencies of the presence or absence of a prey or given the state of its predators in contrast to mcdonald madden et al 2016 who examined species persistence bottom up measure of resource availability we focused on the classical top down biomanipulation approach and constructed a predation based bbn food web e g incorporates measure of consumption intensity for each reservoir using the genie modeler software bayesfusion first the probabilistic dependencies among species in the food web prey preference were determined by taking the inverse of the normalized dietary proportion resource i contributes to its consumer d i e t i k as follows p r e d k i d i e t i k w 1 w i d i e t i k where p r e d k i is a relative measure of predation pressure of consumer k on resource i d i e t i k is the dietary contribution of resource i for consumer k and w i is the full suite of consumers on resource i two states increase and decrease were assigned to each node representing predicted changes to the species population based on the conditional probability tables cpts the conditional probability for resource abundance to increase p i i n c r e a s e f k was defined as a function of predation pressure p r e d k i and consumer availability f k where the probability for resource abundance to increase diminishes to zero that is p i i n c r e a s e f k 0 when the full suite of consumers f k are present f k f k conversely the conditional probability p i i n c r e a s e f k 1 when all the consumers are absent f k 0 the initial conditional probability of all species to persist was defined as p i i n c r e a s e 0 5 this implies that at equilibrium i e without any management actions a species has an equal chance to increase or decrease in their relative abundance similarly for apex predators which are independent of any predatory influence their conditional probability of persistence was also assumed to be 0 5 however as sets of predators f k are introduced or removed from the full suite of predators f k the conditional probability of prey abundance will scale proportionally to an increase or decrease in predation pressure eklöf et al 2013 if f k 0 and if f k f k then p i i n c r e a s e f k 1 k f k p r e d k i k f k p r e d k i k f k p r e d k i and p i p e r s i s t 0 0 5 therefore this network provides a probabilistic investigation of the changes to relative abundance in the ecological communities in relation to the top down trophic interactions given the static condition of the stable isotope profiles for each species or functional group during the survey period the predictive ability of the bbn was then evaluated and validated against independent data collected from a biomanipulation experiment of these food webs fig 2 2 3 assessment of prediction accuracy using food web biomanipulation experiment the food web biomanipulation experiment simulated predator removal scenarios based on size class exclusion this experiment was conducted using exclosures measuring 2 2 1 5 m each with netting of three different mesh sizes 100 mm treatment 1 50 mm treatment 2 1 mm treatment 3 and a control i e no exclusion to investigate trophic cascade responses of chironomidae to predator removal in all the reservoirs in total 36 artificial substrate macroinvertebrate colonisers loke et al 2010 comprising three replicates for each exclosure treatment were deployed for 28 days at the end of the deployment period the colonisers were retrieved and brought back to the laboratory for processing in the laboratory the artificial substrate was removed and rinsed under a 400 μm mesh sieve from which chironomidae larvae were subsequently sorted and enumerated conventionally bayesian network predicts the probability of an ecological response to changes in the network i e biomanipulation of species in this study we developed the bbn into an influence diagram by including a decision and utility node to predict and quantify the chironomidae abundance unlike chance nodes decision and utility nodes do not have cpts marcot et al 2001 instead the decision node specifies various mutually exclusive options i e biomanipulation scenarios that set the states of all the nodes in the food web while the utility node will calculate the expected value i e chironomidae abundance in response to the decision outcome marcot et al 2001 to obtain experimentally relevant values we constrained the chironomidae abundance predictions to the interquartile range of the observed abundance for each respective treatment from the biomanipulation experiment and assumed that the chironomidae abundance scales proportionally to the probability of change therefore without any biomanipulation actions i e p i i n c r e a s e o r d e c r e a s e 0 5 the expected chironomidae abundance will be the median values observed in our experiments similarly when p i i n c r e a s e 1 or 0 the expected chironomidae scales proportionally to the 75th and 25th percentile of the observed values respectively refer to supplemental information for the influence diagrams to assess the predictive performance of bbn the bbn predictions on chironomid response to biomanipulation were compared to two other approaches 1 a traditional linear regression model lrm and 2 a topological food web tfw all three modelling approaches were evaluated by cross validating with independent data observed from reservoir specific biomanipulation experiments for 1 reservoir specific linear mixed effects regression models were built using the lmer function of the lme4 package of r bates et al 2015 to identify the relationship between the biomanipulation treatment and chironomidae abundance for each reservoir let y i i control treatment 1 treatment 2 and treatment 3 be the chironomidae abundance for treatment i y i β 0 β x i b t where β 0 is the intercept b t is the time specific random intercept to control for the time the samples were collected x i represents the covariate for each biomanipulation scenario and β is the corresponding regression coefficient for 2 influence diagrams similar to the bbn were applied with one exception weighted species interactions unlike bbn the tfw model assumed evenly distributed interspecific interaction strength for all consumer resource nodes the comparison between bbn and lrm assesses the importance of a network centric approach in modelling of complex food web while the comparison between bbn and tfw tests the importance of weighting species interactions the predictive performance for each model was then assessed using goodness of fit i e coefficient of determination r2 of the regression between predicted and observed values as well as using density plots of the predicted error distribution for each biomanipulation scenario under all three modelling approaches to evaluate and compare the predictive performance among the various models we used several metrics to assess agreement between predicted and observed chironomidae abundance for each management scenarios 1 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc 2 concordance correlation coefficient ccc and 3 root mean square error which were normalized to the range of the observed values nrmse the auc method characterizes tradeoffs between true positive sensitivity and false positive 1 specificity of binary outcomes and the discrimination capability is determined by the area under the curve auc marcot 2012 this metric ranges from 0 5 to 1 with 0 5 denoting random predictions i e purely due to chance and 0 5 suggesting improvement to the model predictions while a value of 1 0 represents perfect discrimination of positive and negative classification fawcett 2006 to evaluate the ability of various models to correctly classify the positive and negative results using auc we discretized our continuous predictions into binary variables by setting a threshold value in this study we selected a discrimination threshold of 1 standard deviation from the observed mean for each treatment based on the signal detection theory poor 1994 hence if the difference between model prediction and observed abundance exceeds the criterion proportion of 1 s d a replicate is classified as negative and vice versa the concordance correlation coefficient ccc which is commonly used to evaluate the agreement between observers on a continuous outcome was used to measure the degree of agreement between predicted and observed data the ccc metric ranges from 1 to 1 with 0 indicating no agreement and 1 or 1 correspond to perfect agreement lin 1989 we calculated the ccc metric using the ccc function of the desctools package of r signorell et al 2018 unlike the auc the ccc applies only to continuous variables and hence discretization was not required lastly the normalized root mean square error nrmse which measures the absolute mean deviation between predictions and observed values divided by the standard deviation of the observed values were expressed as a percentage where the best model was considered to have the lowest nrmse the nrmse can be calculated using the following formula n r m s e i 1 n x o b s e r v e d i x p r e d i c t e d i 2 i 1 n x o b s e r v e d i 2 100 2 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis determines the sensitivity of the target variable by assessing changes in the posterior probabilities of the targeted variable with respect to changes in the values of the parent variables in the network marcot 2012 based on the results we can identify and rank variables that were most influential to the target variable and this is useful in determining and prioritizing management scenarios to best achieve the management objectives we performed one way sensitivity analyses using genie modeler bayesfusion for each reservoir food web with chironomidae abundance as the target species were ranked accordingly based on the derivative value which is a basic measure of sensitivity for each food web the larger the derivative the greater the influence between two variables within the network 3 results 3 1 food web bbns for each reservoir the bbn network structure of the six ecological food webs comprised species and functional groups from three main categories 1 primary producers 2 invertebrates and 3 fishes table 1 supplemental information across all food webs primary producers accounted for 12 5 18 2 of the total nodes intermediate species including benthic macroinvertebrates and zooplanktons 19 2 32 while fish species accounted for 50 66 7 of the total nodes we assumed that all taxa in the food web were not self limited i e absence of cannibalism intra specific competition 3 2 model evaluation bbn and tfw models were assigned three management decisions simulating various fish species removal scenarios supplemental information fig 3 in the first scenario treatment 1 we simulated the management decision of removing between 4 10 large fish species 100 mm in girth the simulated removal of larger fish species consisting of mostly piscivorous apex predators and large diet generalists resulted in higher chance of an increase in abundance of the immediate lower trophic groups made up mostly of insectivorous and planktivorous fish species under this scenario the predicted probabilities for an increase in chironomidae abundance ranged from 35 to 61 with a mean of 47 across all six food webs specifically the probability to observe an increase in chironomidae was highest for the res1 food web at 61 this means that the removal of large fish species will likely increase the chironomidae population from the mean conversely the probabilities of observing an increase in chironomidae population for res2 and res6 food webs were 35 and 38 respectively suggesting that the chironomidae population will likely decrease from the mean under this scenario for the remaining food webs probabilities of observing a change in chironomidae abundance was close to 50 suggesting that removal of large fish in these food webs is unlikely to cause a major shift in chironomidae abundance similarly for other scenarios treatment 2 and 3 we simulated the removal of 9 15 taxa treatment 2 50 mm in girth and 14 17 taxa treatment 3 1 mm in girth from mid higher trophic levels based on respective size classes under the second scenario treatment 2 which simulated the removal of mesopredators such as insectivorous and planktivorous fish species the predicted probabilities for an increase in chironomidae abundance were higher than scenario 1 ranging from 57 to 68 with a mean of 63 5 for all food webs investigated this suggests that the removal of large to medium sized fish species will likely lead to an increase in the chironomidae abundance from the mean furthermore the network also predicted higher chance of an increase in abundance of the immediate lower size taxa which includes invertebrates and primary producers for the final scenario which simulated the removal of all potential predators of chironomidae all models predicted an 100 likelihood to observe an increase in chironomidae abundance in all food webs supplemental information fig 3 based on our evaluation metrics auc ccc and nrmse the overall predictive ability of bbn food web models was better than the tfw framework table 2 this suggests that weighted species interactions is an important component of food web models the mean auc of the three models ranged from 0 678 to 0 907 ccc ranged from 0 746 to 0 832 and nrmse ranged from 14 63 to 18 65 bbn predictive ability was comparable to linear regression model predictions for all metrics evaluated however bbn predictions outperformed other predictive methods for treatment 3 fig 3 3 3 sensitivity analysis overall one way sensitivity analyses identified between 10 16 taxa that were highly influential on the chironomidae abundance in all six food webs we identified and ranked the five most influential species affecting chironomidae abundances based on the derivative values table 3 generally piscivorous fish species e g datnioides microlepis notopterus notopterus cichla temensis and channa striata were positively associated with and were among the most influential species regulating chironomidae abundances our sensitivity analysis results concord with the trophic cascade hypothesis suggesting that the removal of top predators leads to an indirect cascading effect analogous to expected outcomes in a food chain with four trophic levels i e top predator mesopredator chironomidae producer 4 discussion bayesian belief networks bbn have been widely advocated as an effective framework for managing environment and ecosystem services aguilera et al 2011 bohan 2016 landuyt et al 2013 uusitalo 2007 they provide the means to evaluate management decisions on complex ecological network and model causal influences among species amidst ecological uncertainty bohan 2016 franco et al 2016 while a previous food web study involving bbn investigated bottom up effects i e resource depletion on species extinction eklöf et al 2013 here we characterized six empirically derived predation based food webs by applying the bbn framework while accounting for top down effects in the likelihood evaluation for species persistence unlike bioenergetics models stouffer and bascompte 2011 we used stable isotope data of representative taxa collected from singapore s reservoirs to define the topological network structure and the interaction strengths in a static model this allowed us to incorporate biological realism while bypassing complex parameterization procedures central to fully dynamic empirical food web models berlow et al 2004 dunne et al 2002 despite their increased application in ecological modelling assessments of bbn s predictive ability using independent data are lacking in the bbn literature aguilera et al 2011 landuyt et al 2013 by validating the predictions of various biomanipulation decision scenarios using prediction methods against independent data from our biomanipulation experiments we found that the bbn predictions out performed the tfw framework and were comparable to linear regression this highlights the importance of accounting for weighted species interactions and network centric approaches to food web models traditionally the static topological approach i e tfw model considers only the qualitative network structure but this has limited applicability in real world food webs eklöf et al 2013 livi et al 2011 for example under the topological framework secondary species extinctions risks are insensitive to resource availability and extinction occurs only when they lose all their resources i e extinction risk is either 100 or 0 eklöf et al 2013 however ecological features such as species abundance and extinction rates are dynamic processes that are dependent on the complex interactions within food webs as well as associated population dynamics which changes accordingly with the resource availability or predation pressure montoya 2015 furthermore the topological framework also assumed an even distribution of baseline feeding links among all consumers although this is unrealistic in natural systems where predator prey interactions are often highly skewed de ruiter et al 1995 we incorporated weighted interaction strengths in the food webs constructed using bbn and our results suggest that this is a better predictive tool than topological approaches while our current bayesian belief network only captured a snap shot of the trophic interactions in the food web as defined by the stable isotope profiles of each consumers and resources the interactions and causal associations among the nodes within the network may be adjusted or updated as new information becomes available consequently the bayesian belief network can be reviewed improved upon or even updated into a dynamic bayesian belief network dbns that accounts for temporal dynamics where networks are typically replicated for several time steps and the variables can be linked together over adjacent time steps shihab 2008 notably our bbn model which was developed using independent stable isotope data performed comparatively well to the linear regression model lrm fitted with observed data from the biomanipulation experiments this demonstrated one of the key advantages of the bbn framework which is the flexibility of the bbn to be extended as a regression model yet allowing an accurate prediction of the response variable without having to know the value of every explanatory variable aguilera et al 2011 another useful feature of bbn is that it can be used as a participatory modelling framework by incorporating expert knowledge or involving stakeholders to evaluate consequences of management decisions aguilera et al 2011 uusitalo 2007 furthermore through bayesian inferences marginal probabilities of the nodes in the food web can be computed simultaneously and instantaneously for all consumers and resources even for large food webs 20 nodes as we show in our study aguilera et al 2011 landuyt et al 2013 this makes bbn an excellent tool for exploring different management scenarios and communicating the effects of complex interactions of multiple stressors to resource managers visually through the simplistic graphical user interface see supplmentary information the importance of top down regulation on community stability and secondary species extinctions via indirect cascade effects has been demonstrated in several food web studies carpenter et al 2001 eklöf et al 2013 pace et al 1999 however owing to network complexity in natural food webs patterns of such cascading effects are difficult to elucidate since it can ripple across the food web simultaneously through long indirect pathways lynam et al 2017 through the use of bayesian belief network we were able to simulate various biomanipulation scenarios such as predator removals to predict changes in probabilities based on the trophic interactions within the ecological communities and visually assess the network for trophic cascade effect furthermore our sensitivity analyses also identified key influential species to be piscivores apex fish predators and this supports the trophic cascade hypothesis the identification of influential variables and understanding of their interactions in the food web will therefore allow end users to identify and prioritize effective management strategies to conserve or control a species e g protecting an endangered species or reducing the risk of cyanobacteria blooms however the identity of the influential species are context dependent and may lead to an entirely different set of influential species depending on the management objective i e target variable or the threshold level i e m species abundance in conclusion we highlighted the potential benefits of using a bbn approach to evaluate dynamic food web models which allowed the incorporation of weighted interaction strengths using empirical information i e stable isotopes from natural systems this approach enabled us to overcome the need for an extensive set of complex empirical parameters typical of bioenergetics models and also helped to resolve the topology of the network moreover validation against independent data demonstrated the robustness of bbn models as predictive tools which can be used to facilitate communication with stakeholders the intuitive visual diagrams and graphical representation of the bbn also optimizes accessibility to scientifically inform management decisions acknowledgements we

influence their conditional probability of persistence was also assumed to be 0 5 however as sets of predators f k are introduced or removed from the full suite of predators f k the conditional probability of prey abundance will scale proportionally to an increase or decrease in predation pressure eklöf et al 2013 if f k 0 and if f k f k then p i i n c r e a s e f k 1 k f k p r e d k i k f k p r e d k i k f k p r e d k i and p i p e r s i s t 0 0 5 therefore this network provides a probabilistic investigation of the changes to relative abundance in the ecological communities in relation to the top down trophic interactions given the static condition of the stable isotope profiles for each species or functional group during the survey period the predictive ability of the bbn was then evaluated and validated against independent data collected from a biomanipulation experiment of these food webs fig 2 2 3 assessment of prediction accuracy using food web biomanipulation experiment the food web biomanipulation experiment simulated predator removal scenarios based on size class exclusion this experiment was conducted using exclosures measuring 2 2 1 5 m each with netting of three different mesh sizes 100 mm treatment 1 50 mm treatment 2 1 mm treatment 3 and a control i e no exclusion to investigate trophic cascade responses of chironomidae to predator removal in all the reservoirs in total 36 artificial substrate macroinvertebrate colonisers loke et al 2010 comprising three replicates for each exclosure treatment were deployed for 28 days at the end of the deployment period the colonisers were retrieved and brought back to the laboratory for processing in the laboratory the artificial substrate was removed and rinsed under a 400 μm mesh sieve from which chironomidae larvae were subsequently sorted and enumerated conventionally bayesian network predicts the probability of an ecological response to changes in the network i e biomanipulation of species in this study we developed the bbn into an influence diagram by including a decision and utility node to predict and quantify the chironomidae abundance unlike chance nodes decision and utility nodes do not have cpts marcot et al 2001 instead the decision node specifies various mutually exclusive options i e biomanipulation scenarios that set the states of all the nodes in the food web while the utility node will calculate the expected value i e chironomidae abundance in response to the decision outcome marcot et al 2001 to obtain experimentally relevant values we constrained the chironomidae abundance predictions to the interquartile range of the observed abundance for each respective treatment from the biomanipulation experiment and assumed that the chironomidae abundance scales proportionally to the probability of change therefore without any biomanipulation actions i e p i i n c r e a s e o r d e c r e a s e 0 5 the expected chironomidae abundance will be the median values observed in our experiments similarly when p i i n c r e a s e 1 or 0 the expected chironomidae scales proportionally to the 75th and 25th percentile of the observed values respectively refer to supplemental information for the influence diagrams to assess the predictive performance of bbn the bbn predictions on chironomid response to biomanipulation were compared to two other approaches 1 a traditional linear regression model lrm and 2 a topological food web tfw all three modelling approaches were evaluated by cross validating with independent data observed from reservoir specific biomanipulation experiments for 1 reservoir specific linear mixed effects regression models were built using the lmer function of the lme4 package of r bates et al 2015 to identify the relationship between the biomanipulation treatment and chironomidae abundance for each reservoir let y i i control treatment 1 treatment 2 and treatment 3 be the chironomidae abundance for treatment i y i β 0 β x i b t where β 0 is the intercept b t is the time specific random intercept to control for the time the samples were collected x i represents the covariate for each biomanipulation scenario and β is the corresponding regression coefficient for 2 influence diagrams similar to the bbn were applied with one exception weighted species interactions unlike bbn the tfw model assumed evenly distributed interspecific interaction strength for all consumer resource nodes the comparison between bbn and lrm assesses the importance of a network centric approach in modelling of complex food web while the comparison between bbn and tfw tests the importance of weighting species interactions the predictive performance for each model was then assessed using goodness of fit i e coefficient of determination r2 of the regression between predicted and observed values as well as using density plots of the predicted error distribution for each biomanipulation scenario under all three modelling approaches to evaluate and compare the predictive performance among the various models we used several metrics to assess agreement between predicted and observed chironomidae abundance for each management scenarios 1 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc 2 concordance correlation coefficient ccc and 3 root mean square error which were normalized to the range of the observed values nrmse the auc method characterizes tradeoffs between true positive sensitivity and false positive 1 specificity of binary outcomes and the discrimination capability is determined by the area under the curve auc marcot 2012 this metric ranges from 0 5 to 1 with 0 5 denoting random predictions i e purely due to chance and 0 5 suggesting improvement to the model predictions while a value of 1 0 represents perfect discrimination of positive and negative classification fawcett 2006 to evaluate the ability of various models to correctly classify the positive and negative results using auc we discretized our continuous predictions into binary variables by setting a threshold value in this study we selected a discrimination threshold of 1 standard deviation from the observed mean for each treatment based on the signal detection theory poor 1994 hence if the difference between model prediction and observed abundance exceeds the criterion proportion of 1 s d a replicate is classified as negative and vice versa the concordance correlation coefficient ccc which is commonly used to evaluate the agreement between observers on a continuous outcome was used to measure the degree of agreement between predicted and observed data the ccc metric ranges from 1 to 1 with 0 indicating no agreement and 1 or 1 correspond to perfect agreement lin 1989 we calculated the ccc metric using the ccc function of the desctools package of r signorell et al 2018 unlike the auc the ccc applies only to continuous variables and hence discretization was not required lastly the normalized root mean square error nrmse which measures the absolute mean deviation between predictions and observed values divided by the standard deviation of the observed values were expressed as a percentage where the best model was considered to have the lowest nrmse the nrmse can be calculated using the following formula n r m s e i 1 n x o b s e r v e d i x p r e d i c t e d i 2 i 1 n x o b s e r v e d i 2 100 2 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis determines the sensitivity of the target variable by assessing changes in the posterior probabilities of the targeted variable with respect to changes in the values of the parent variables in the network marcot 2012 based on the results we can identify and rank variables that were most influential to the target variable and this is useful in determining and prioritizing management scenarios to best achieve the management objectives we performed one way sensitivity analyses using genie modeler bayesfusion for each reservoir food web with chironomidae abundance as the target species were ranked accordingly based on the derivative value which is a basic measure of sensitivity for each food web the larger the derivative the greater the influence between two variables within the network 3 results 3 1 food web bbns for each reservoir the bbn network structure of the six ecological food webs comprised species and functional groups from three main categories 1 primary producers 2 invertebrates and 3 fishes table 1 supplemental information across all food webs primary producers accounted for 12 5 18 2 of the total nodes intermediate species including benthic macroinvertebrates and zooplanktons 19 2 32 while fish species accounted for 50 66 7 of the total nodes we assumed that all taxa in the food web were not self limited i e absence of cannibalism intra specific competition 3 2 model evaluation bbn and tfw models were assigned three management decisions simulating various fish species removal scenarios supplemental information fig 3 in the first scenario treatment 1 we simulated the management decision of removing between 4 10 large fish species 100 mm in girth the simulated removal of larger fish species consisting of mostly piscivorous apex predators and large diet generalists resulted in higher chance of an increase in abundance of the immediate lower trophic groups made up mostly of insectivorous and planktivorous fish species under this scenario the predicted probabilities for an increase in chironomidae abundance ranged from 35 to 61 with a mean of 47 across all six food webs specifically the probability to observe an increase in chironomidae was highest for the res1 food web at 61 this means that the removal of large fish species will likely increase the chironomidae population from the mean conversely the probabilities of observing an increase in chironomidae population for res2 and res6 food webs were 35 and 38 respectively suggesting that the chironomidae population will likely decrease from the mean under this scenario for the remaining food webs probabilities of observing a change in chironomidae abundance was close to 50 suggesting that removal of large fish in these food webs is unlikely to cause a major shift in chironomidae abundance similarly for other scenarios treatment 2 and 3 we simulated the removal of 9 15 taxa treatment 2 50 mm in girth and 14 17 taxa treatment 3 1 mm in girth from mid higher trophic levels based on respective size classes under the second scenario treatment 2 which simulated the removal of mesopredators such as insectivorous and planktivorous fish species the predicted probabilities for an increase in chironomidae abundance were higher than scenario 1 ranging from 57 to 68 with a mean of 63 5 for all food webs investigated this suggests that the removal of large to medium sized fish species will likely lead to an increase in the chironomidae abundance from the mean furthermore the network also predicted higher chance of an increase in abundance of the immediate lower size taxa which includes invertebrates and primary producers for the final scenario which simulated the removal of all potential predators of chironomidae all models predicted an 100 likelihood to observe an increase in chironomidae abundance in all food webs supplemental information fig 3 based on our evaluation metrics auc ccc and nrmse the overall predictive ability of bbn food web models was better than the tfw framework table 2 this suggests that weighted species interactions is an important component of food web models the mean auc of the three models ranged from 0 678 to 0 907 ccc ranged from 0 746 to 0 832 and nrmse ranged from 14 63 to 18 65 bbn predictive ability was comparable to linear regression model predictions for all metrics evaluated however bbn predictions outperformed other predictive methods for treatment 3 fig 3 3 3 sensitivity analysis overall one way sensitivity analyses identified between 10 16 taxa that were highly influential on the chironomidae abundance in all six food webs we identified and ranked the five most influential species affecting chironomidae abundances based on the derivative values table 3 generally piscivorous fish species e g datnioides microlepis notopterus notopterus cichla temensis and channa striata were positively associated with and were among the most influential species regulating chironomidae abundances our sensitivity analysis results concord with the trophic cascade hypothesis suggesting that the removal of top predators leads to an indirect cascading effect analogous to expected outcomes in a food chain with four trophic levels i e top predator mesopredator chironomidae producer 4 discussion bayesian belief networks bbn have been widely advocated as an effective framework for managing environment and ecosystem services aguilera et al 2011 bohan 2016 landuyt et al 2013 uusitalo 2007 they provide the means to evaluate management decisions on complex ecological network and model causal influences among species amidst ecological uncertainty bohan 2016 franco et al 2016 while a previous food web study involving bbn investigated bottom up effects i e resource depletion on species extinction eklöf et al 2013 here we characterized six empirically derived predation based food webs by applying the bbn framework while accounting for top down effects in the likelihood evaluation for species persistence unlike bioenergetics models stouffer and bascompte 2011 we used stable isotope data of representative taxa collected from singapore s reservoirs to define the topological network structure and the interaction strengths in a static model this allowed us to incorporate biological realism while bypassing complex parameterization procedures central to fully dynamic empirical food web models berlow et al 2004 dunne et al 2002 despite their increased application in ecological modelling assessments of bbn s predictive ability using independent data are lacking in the bbn literature aguilera et al 2011 landuyt et al 2013 by validating the predictions of various biomanipulation decision scenarios using prediction methods against independent data from our biomanipulation experiments we found that the bbn predictions out performed the tfw framework and were comparable to linear regression this highlights the importance of accounting for weighted species interactions and network centric approaches to food web models traditionally the static topological approach i e tfw model considers only the qualitative network structure but this has limited applicability in real world food webs eklöf et al 2013 livi et al 2011 for example under the topological framework secondary species extinctions risks are insensitive to resource availability and extinction occurs only when they lose all their resources i e extinction risk is either 100 or 0 eklöf et al 2013 however ecological features such as species abundance and extinction rates are dynamic processes that are dependent on the complex interactions within food webs as well as associated population dynamics which changes accordingly with the resource availability or predation pressure montoya 2015 furthermore the topological framework also assumed an even distribution of baseline feeding links among all consumers although this is unrealistic in natural systems where predator prey interactions are often highly skewed de ruiter et al 1995 we incorporated weighted interaction strengths in the food webs constructed using bbn and our results suggest that this is a better predictive tool than topological approaches while our current bayesian belief network only captured a snap shot of the trophic interactions in the food web as defined by the stable isotope profiles of each consumers and resources the interactions and causal associations among the nodes within the network may be adjusted or updated as new information becomes available consequently the bayesian belief network can be reviewed improved upon or even updated into a dynamic bayesian belief network dbns that accounts for temporal dynamics where networks are typically replicated for several time steps and the variables can be linked together over adjacent time steps shihab 2008 notably our bbn model which was developed using independent stable isotope data performed comparatively well to the linear regression model lrm fitted with observed data from the biomanipulation experiments this demonstrated one of the key advantages of the bbn framework which is the flexibility of the bbn to be extended as a regression model yet allowing an accurate prediction of the response variable without having to know the value of every explanatory variable aguilera et al 2011 another useful feature of bbn is that it can be used as a participatory modelling framework by incorporating expert knowledge or involving stakeholders to evaluate consequences of management decisions aguilera et al 2011 uusitalo 2007 furthermore through bayesian inferences marginal probabilities of the nodes in the food web can be computed simultaneously and instantaneously for all consumers and resources even for large food webs 20 nodes as we show in our study aguilera et al 2011 landuyt et al 2013 this makes bbn an excellent tool for exploring different management scenarios and communicating the effects of complex interactions of multiple stressors to resource managers visually through the simplistic graphical user interface see supplmentary information the importance of top down regulation on community stability and secondary species extinctions via indirect cascade effects has been demonstrated in several food web studies carpenter et al 2001 eklöf et al 2013 pace et al 1999 however owing to network complexity in natural food webs patterns of such cascading effects are difficult to elucidate since it can ripple across the food web simultaneously through long indirect pathways lynam et al 2017 through the use of bayesian belief network we were able to simulate various biomanipulation scenarios such as predator removals to predict changes in probabilities based on the trophic interactions within the ecological communities and visually assess the network for trophic cascade effect furthermore our sensitivity analyses also identified key influential species to be piscivores apex fish predators and this supports the trophic cascade hypothesis the identification of influential variables and understanding of their interactions in the food web will therefore allow end users to identify and prioritize effective management strategies to conserve or control a species e g protecting an endangered species or reducing the risk of cyanobacteria blooms however the identity of the influential species are context dependent and may lead to an entirely different set of influential species depending on the management objective i e target variable or the threshold level i e m species abundance in conclusion we highlighted the potential benefits of using a bbn approach to evaluate dynamic food web models which allowed the incorporation of weighted interaction strengths using empirical information i e stable isotopes from natural systems this approach enabled us to overcome the need for an extensive set of complex empirical parameters typical of bioenergetics models and also helped to resolve the topology of the network moreover validation against independent data demonstrated the robustness of bbn models as predictive tools which can be used to facilitate communication with stakeholders the intuitive visual diagrams and graphical representation of the bbn also optimizes accessibility to scientifically inform management decisions acknowledgements we

25256,with access to collections of continuous satellite imagery over a 40 year period spectral temporal patterns extracted from multi temporal imagery offer a potential new tool to model mechanisms of forest succession and monitor changes in forested landscapes specifically spectral temporal trajectories associated with successional forest change occurring over prolonged periods of time may enhance periodic snapshot monitoring methods especially for species that exhibit complex and non linear dynamics in this paper landsat time series are used to examine the spectral temporal signatures of bamboo dominated forest succession occurring within the critically threatened araucaria forest a pine dominated subtype of the atlantic forest in southern brazil alteration of canopy structure through ongoing anthropogenic disturbance has increased understorey light climate and given opportunity for native invasive bamboos to flourish resulting in drastic reduction of tree regeneration and loss of biodiversity we aimed to evaluate how spectral temporal signatures could be used to 1 characterize stages of bamboo dominated forest succession 2 identify synchrony of bamboo lifecycle dynamics and 3 classify regions of bamboo dominated forest changepoint analysis was performed using an extracted sample spectral temporal signature and trajectories were fit to the resulting segments using linear regression based on slope values of the fitted segments a novel description incorporating temporal information of bamboo dominated forest succession was developed which identified four broad phases pioneer predominance mature bamboo dieback and pioneer regeneration to determine the spatial and temporal synchrony of bamboo dominated forest succession a hybrid model was developed by combining the modelled segments and compared to a 32 year landsat time series of vegetation indices by calculating root mean square error between each pixel in the study area the hybrid model proficiently classified regions of bamboo dominance achieving between 77 and 90 accuracy which also indicated lifecycle synchrony of bamboo populations within the study area to further assess the performance of the hybrid model a time weighted dynamic time warping model approach was used to determine synchrony and classify regions of bamboo the time weighted dynamic time warping classifier had lower overall accuracy 68 82 but is still considered a useful tool for automated classification purposes that take advantage of multi temporal imagery to compare classification performance between snapshot and multi temporal imagery classifiers a maximum likelihood classification was performed which attained lower overall accuracies than the hybrid model 75 84 overall the use of spectral temporal signatures offers a novel and effective approach to both describing and modelling bamboo dominated forest succession and forest successional processes more generally on a landscape scale keywords landsat time series spectral temporal modelling bamboo succession atlantic forest 1 introduction the atlantic forest which is considered one of the world s twenty five biodiversity hotspots myers et al 2000 mittermeier et al 2004 has been reduced to less than 10 of its original area and is considered the most devastated and threatened ecosystem in the world leal and de camara 2003 the remaining forest is host to more than 8000 endemic species with over 530 species officially designated as threatened myers et al 2000 as a subtype of the atlantic forest the subtropical humid forests of southern brazil fao 2005 locally known as araucaria forest ibge 2012 has been subjected to intensive fragmentation resulting in forest fragments of less than 50 ha which have been heavily altered lacerda 2016 the degradation of the remaining forests has drastically altered canopy structure allowing native bamboos to dominate the forest understorey forming dense clumps which exclude surrounding plant communities budke et al 2010 lacerda and kellermann 2017 contributing to further degrade the remaining araucaria forest fragments lacerda 2016 merostachys skvortzovii is a pervasive bamboo species found throughout araucaria forest m skvortzovii is characterized by a 31 to 33 year lifecycle pereira 1941 during which it may dominate the forest understory continuously and terminate with a dieback event of synchronized mast flowering griscom and ashton 2006 lacerda and kellermann 2017 once m skvortzovii populations establish themselves in the forest understorey their monocarpic dieback events have been found to act as disturbance events by opening the canopy and releasing soil nutrients and space taylor and qin 1992 abe et al 2002 taylor 2004 rother et al 2009 enabling regeneration of pioneer specie to occur within araucaria forest mimosa scabrella a prominent pioneer species will initially recruit and dominate the canopy followed by secondary succession species vernonanthura discolor and m skvortzovii kellermann 2011 lacerda and kellermann 2017 once m skvortzovii recruits it will continuously replace itself by clonal growth throughout its lifecycle growing denser as it matures while simultaneously further suppressing regeneration the way in which pioneer and m skvortzovii population dynamics coincide is hypothesized to be a synchronized process which controls forest succession due to similar lifecycle lengths of m skvortzovii 31 to 33 years m scabrella 20 to 25 years and v discolor 30 to 60 years gaps created by treefall from senescent pioneer populations enables incoming solar radiation to reach the bamboo dominated understorey increasing bamboo growth while impeding the development of tree species this synchronized process has resulted in a perpetuated bamboo dominance cycle which has been observed to arrest forest succession in the region lacerda and kellermann 2017 a phenomenon which has also been observed in the amazon forest griscom and ashton 2006 in forested regions where canopy structure has been altered due to ongoing anthropogenic disturbances it has been observed that increased understorey light climate has enabled native invasive bamboos to flourish resulting in reduction of tree regeneration and loss of biodiversity lacerda and kellermann 2017 with increasing threat to ecologically sensitive regions such as the atlantic forest of southern brazil increased knowledge regarding the impact of bamboo dominance on surrounding plant communities will assist in improving current forest management techniques by emphasizing the need for silvicultural intervention to enable and promote the growth and regeneration of threatened and endangered plant species the use of landsat time series stacks has proven to serve as an effective tool to observe continuous change and improve understanding of ecological processes occurring at a landscape scale kennedy et al 2007 methods have been developed in recent years which exploit the use of spectral temporal signatures to observe mechanisms of forest succession broich et al 2011 lehmann et al 2013 identify distinct disturbance events and recovery rates huang et al 2009 vogelmann et al 2009 kennedy et al 2010 griffiths et al 2014 devries et al 2015 senf et al 2015 and classify various landcover types maus et al 2016a the premise of these methods is the underlying assumption that many natural systems exhibit a distinct temporal progression which can be observed in spectral space kennedy et al 2007 to analyze ecological processes of bamboo dominated forests we developed a semi empirical spatially explicit hybrid spectral temporal model hybrid model from a 32 year landsat time series to characterize the successional phases of bamboo dominated forests and determine whether the perpetuated bamboo dominance cycle is a synchronous process occurring on a landscape scale while the lifecycle of m skvortzovii has been only recently discovered on a local scale research interest now centres on identifying the spatial scale and synchrony of these processes occurring across the landscape utilizing remotely sensed imagery to derive bamboo successional dynamics will support the development of synoptic mapping tools for the atlantic forest which will directly support conservation and adaptive management planning accordingly this paper aims to 1 identify and characterize the spectral temporal signature of bamboo dominated forest succession 2 determine whether the perpetuated bamboo dominance cycle is a synchronous process occurring on a landscape scale by comparing a 32 year landsat time series stack to a hybrid model 3 compare performance of the hybrid model to a time weighted dynamic time warping model approach to assess the effectiveness of the hybrid model and more generally spectral temporal signatures to determine bamboo lifecycle synchrony and identify regions of bamboo dominance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the embrapa research station in caçador ersc is a 1157 hectare research area located in caçador santa catarina brazil fig 1 the study area is part of the subtropical humid forest of the atlantic forest in southern brazil locally known as araucaria forest which is a mixture of temperate and tropical floras ibge 2012 leite and klein 1990 occurring in subtropical highland climate cfb with high annual precipitation of approximately 1400 mm however extensive colonization in the 19th century has reduced the biome to 5 of the original forest cover as primary forest with 20 25 as secondary forest lacerda 2016 the region is characterized by the predominance of the critically endangered late successional species araucaria angustifolia and ocotea porosa ibge 2012 ersc is one of the most well preserved remaining fragments of the subtropical humid forest and has not received any silvicultural intervention in the past 20 years lacerda et al 2012 prior to that the forests in the ersc were subjected to selective logging significantly reducing areas where the canopy is dominated by a angustifolia lacerda 2016 in 1948 ersc was established as a forest reserve although the east end continued to be heavily logged until 1974 which enabled the invasion of bamboo in the forest understorey in the area the ersc has previously been classified into three forest types which include 1 araucaria predominance 2 degraded forest and 3 bamboo dominated forest lacerda 2016 araucaria predominance describes areas of forest where canopy is dominated by araucaria angustifolia degraded forests are areas of the ersc that experienced intensive logging in the past and may have been impacted by forest fires resulting in significant alteration of forest structure and floristic composition these forests are characterized by open canopies which enables invasion of bamboo bamboo dominated forests are areas within the ersc that have been submitted to historical clearcutting in which bamboo populations are dominant with significant suppression of regeneration occurring in the understory lacerda et al 2012 lacerda and kellermann 2017 the landscape surrounding the ersc is primarily farmland commercial forest plantations and small forest fragments resulting from fragmentation or regeneration of abandoned agriculture land lacerda 2016 2 2 data 2 2 1 reference data collection one hundred and ten field samples were used as reference data sixty nine of the field samples were plot data collected in 2006 as part of a forest inventory which was carried out by stratified random sampling and considered 13 different strata at different slope and elevation classes based on photo interpretation of a 2004 ikonos image rivera 2007 the 69 temporary plots were distributed proportionally to the strata areas 62 of which were 500 m2 and the remaining seven 250 m2 for each plot all trees 10 cm dbh were identified and height and dbh were recorded these 69 plots were later divided into four broad management units which included araucaria predominance structured forest degraded forest and bamboo dominated forest lacerda et al 2012 structured forest and degraded forest were aggregated into one forest type and designated as degraded forest following lacerda 2016 mapping of the ersc an additional 41 field samples were collected in 2016 during a field campaign field sampling regions for the campaign were selected using high resolution imagery from 2004 2006 and 2014 areas of homogeneous forest types araucaria predominance degraded forest and bamboo dominated forest were selected to avoid edge effects with accessibility also influencing selection several of these field samples were taken in proximity to clusters of regeneration plots used for other studies lacerda and kellermann 2017 in total the dataset consists of 24 araucaria predominance 47 degraded forest and 39 bamboo dominated forest samples 2 2 2 imagery and processing landsat imagery was used to examine the spectral temporal patterns of the esrc over the 30 year lifecycle of bamboo which was acquired using google earth engine the landsat time series stack used for this study consisted of 35 cloud free images acquired between the months of may and september to reduce spectral variation caused by seasonality years with multiple images were averaged together to create annual composites with omission of the years 1989 1992 1994 1998 and 2012 due to poor quality imagery to produce a continuous timeline raster values were linearly interpolated for each missing year all cloud free images from 1984 to 2011 were acquired from the landsat 5 tm surface reflectance image collection and images from 2013 to 2015 were acquired from the landsat 8 oli surface reflectance image collection due to the landsat 7 etm scan line corrector problem imagery from this sensor were not used surface reflectance is required to accurately derive the enhanced vegetation index evi which was calculated over the landsat time series stack using google earth engine code editor evi is a canopy reflectance measure developed to optimize the vegetation signal by separating the canopy background signal while simultaneously reducing atmosphere influences huete et al 2002 evi values have been found to outperform ndvi in tropical and sub tropical environments huete et al 2002 as the index has been observed to be more responsive to variation in canopy structure including leaf area index lai canopy type and architecture and plant physiognomy gao et al 2000 surface reflectance

landsat data and entered into second simulation of a satellite signal in the solar spectrum 6s radiative transfer models to produce multiple climate data records which include surface reflectance ju et al 2012 a 32 year landsat time series of evi values was created and a savitzky golay smoothing filter was applied to the time series stack to reduce year to year noise savitzky and golay 1964 a savitzky golay filter aims to increase signal to noise ratio without reducing the signal by employing a least squares fit convolution chen et al 2004 smoothing is achieved by fitting polynomials to segments of a larger dataset a small window preceding and following a value of interest is fit to a polynomial of a certain degree to derive a new smoothed value to replace the value of interest chen et al 2004 as forest succession is a gradual process it is important to identify a trend occurring over a prolonged period of time which is achieved by reducing year to year noise by employing a filter chen et al 2004 any disturbance events which may occur would still be visible in the smoothed time series so long as the smoothing parameters selected do not overgeneralize the time series and create a bias 2 3 overview of characterization of successional phases and development of the hybrid model the overall strategy to characterize bamboo dominated forest succession and observe its synchrony involved three main steps fig 2 first the spectral temporal signature of bamboo dominated forest succession was identified 2 3 1 using this spectral temporal signature a changepoint analysis was applied to identify vertices which were used to fit trajectories to determine phases of bamboo dominated forest succession 2 3 2 the resulting modelled segments from the changepoint analysis were then assembled to create a hybrid model 2 3 3 2 3 1 determining bamboo dominated forest succession spectral temporal signature twenty eight training points were selected using 2004 ikonos imagery 2006 alos imagery and 2014 worldview2 imagery based on previous classifications published using these three images criteria for selecting these training points were 1 bamboo or v discolor are visible in the canopy in the 2004 image dlugosz et al 2005 2 senescent biomass resulting from dieback is visible in the 2006 image luz 2009 and 3 pioneers are visible in the canopy of the 2014 image maran 2016 landsat pixels in the middle of these regions were selected to reduce edge effects or spectral mixing the individual spectral temporal patterns of each selected pixel were then averaged to generate a representative spectral temporal signature of bamboo dominated forest succession 2 3 2 characterizing bamboo dominated forest succession spectral temporal signature a changepoint analysis was applied to the spectral temporal signature using the changepoint r package to identify significant changes in variance that distinguish phases of bamboo dominated forest succession killick and eckley 2014 fig 3 the distribution of the time series data is non parametric therefore a cumulative sum of squares css binary segmentation changepoint analysis was employed css binary segmentation determines approximate changepoints in a time series by systematically splitting data into clusters and summing the squared distances between sets of points and dividing the sum by n with the two resulting segments being treated as individual time series to be subsequently analysed edwards and cavalli sforza 1965 the optimal split of the data is to maximize the between clusters sum of squares and consequently to minimize the within clusters sum of squares edwards and cavalli sforza 1965 when working with a non parametric dataset traditional penalty values e g aic type i error etc applied to reduce model overfitting are often inappropriate to define significant changepoints killick and eckley 2014 as an alternative approach the number of changepoints to be identified can be user defined central to the development of the hybrid model was determining the appropriate number of changepoints to be detected this was achieved through iteration and comparison to empirical evidence one to ten changepoints were tested with five changepoints serving to identify the most relevant changepoints within the time series which also corroborated with regeneration data collected from 2007 to 2014 lacerda and kellermann 2017 table 1 years of drastic population change such as m scabrella seedling establishment self thinning of m scabrella juvenile populations and emergence of m scabrella adult populations into the canopy coincided with statistically significant changepoints as there were no field data available prior to 2006 a priori expectations regarding successional phases from 1984 to 2005 were inferred based on ecological knowledge of pioneer species m scabrella and v discolor lifecycle dynamics m scabrella is known to have a lifecycle of 20 25 years with approximately 75 of adult populations expected to die off before the age of 20 with the remaining trees showing signs of senescence steenbock et al 2011 v discolor is known to occur with m scabrella growing in the understorey as juveniles and emerging into the canopy as the m scabrella adult population thins v discolor has been found to live up to 60 years santos et al 2011 with a decline in population after 45 50 years as the previous bamboo lifecycle occurred from approximately 1974 to 2006 it could be expected that pioneer populations would be present in the canopy from 1984 to 2005 but would be in a state of senescence using the changepoints as vertices trajectories of each segment were fit using linear regression and were subsequently compared to forest succession temporal trajectories hypothesized by kennedy et al 2007 and vogelmann et al 2009 based on the slope of the fitted values information regarding the phase of forest succession was extrapolated kennedy et al 2007 hypothesized the spectral temporal trajectories of four phases of forest succession which included disturbance disturbance and revegetation revegetation revegetation to stable state and vogelmann et al 2009 identified the spectral temporal trajectory of senescent populations a disturbance event is characterized by an abrupt decrease in index values which is followed by either a continued state of disturbance i e land conversion or revegetation which is identified by an initial spike in index values followed by a more gradual increase over time revegetation is identified by a continuous gradual increase in index values and followed by a stable state which is characterized by a prolonged period of stable index values senescent or damaged populations are identified by a gradual decrease in index values over a prolonged period of time vogelmann et al 2009 the modelled segments were aggregated into four broad successional phases which include mature senescence pioneer predominance mature bamboo bamboo dieback and juvenile pioneer regeneration based on the observed slope of the modelled segment trajectories 2 3 3 development of hybrid spectral temporal model hybrid model to evaluate whether the hypothesized perpetuated bamboo dominance cycle was occurring on a landscape scale we developed a semi empirical spatially explicit hybrid spectral temporal model representative of bamboo dominated forest succession from the time series of landsat images the 32 modelled values of the hybrid model were converted into a 32 year hybrid model raster time series stack which was then compared to the 32 year landsat time series of smoothed evi values to determine whether the hybrid model effectively described bamboo dominated forest succession fig 4 bias and root mean square error rmse between each pixel in the study area and the hybrid model were computed and summarized creating raster outputs of both bias and rmse values a local getis ord gi statistic was calculated for the rmse output to identify spatial clustering of errors which simultaneously identifies synchrony and serves to classify regions of bamboo dominated forest using a local getis ord gi statistic clustering output of rmse values is a non traditional classification method typically this statistic is used to detect statistically significant hot and cold spots of spatially clustered high and low values getis and ord 1992 getis and aldstadt 2010 remotely sensed data is often highly spatially auto correlated due the regularization of continuous landscapes into a pixelated grid resulting in clusters of pixels with similar spectral values based on the existing spatial pattern of landcover features wulder and boots 1998 an example of this phenomenon are the assemblages of species across forested landscapes which results in unique spatial clusters of pixels which share similar spectral values wulder and boots 1998 used a local getis ord gi statistic to examine spatial dependency within a forested landscape and found that the spatial structure of the landsat channel 4 gi was similar to the output of a maximum likelihood classification performed using the same landsat image however it was found that the use of neighbourhood information by the getis ord gi statistic created fuzzy boundaries between species assemblages which is thought to more closely reflect the subtle and gradual change of spectral values between objects unlike the discrete boundaries introduced by the maximum likelihood classification for this reason we chose to take advantage of the temporal information available from landsat time series stacks and subsequently employ a spatial statistical approach to improve the classification by incorporating spatial information in this study spatial autocorrelation of rmse values associated with bamboo dominated forest was assumed based on the 1 existing spatial pattern of bamboo in the ersc and 2 the rmse value spread demonstrated by boxplots generated for the three forest types through observation of satellite and aerial imagery it has been observed that approximately a third of the ersc is visibly occupied by bamboo dominated forest the majority of which is coalesced on the eastern edge of the ersc with this knowledge it was assumed that these regions would be characterized by low rmse values and other areas as higher rmse values boxplots generated to demonstrate rmse value spread for the three forest types exemplified this assumption bamboo dominated forest exhibited a narrow value spread of low values while both araucaria predominance and degraded forest typically possessed a wider spread of higher rmse values based on these preliminary findings it was hypothesized that the getis ord gi statistic cold spots would generate spatial clusters of bamboo dominated forest exclusive from other forest types for the getis ord gi cluster analysis queen s case contiguity was used to define the spatial neighbourhood for each pixel the local sum for each pixel s neighbours is proportionally compared to the sum of all pixels in a dataset resulting in a statistically significant z score if the local sum is substantially higher or lower than the expected local sum getis and ord 1992 a simple form of the gi statistic is 1 g i j 1 n w i j x j j 1 n x j where wij are the spatial weights between pixel i and j and xj is the rmse value of the jth neighbour of pixel i the numerator is the sum of all contiguous neighbouring attributes and the denominator is the sum of all features in the dataset the sum of both the numerator and the denominator do not include the feature under observation the same hybrid modelling workflow was then used to determine the ability of the hybrid model to identify regions of bamboo dominated forest for each of the four broad phases of the bamboo dominated forest succession as well as a 15 year time period from 2001 to 2015 this time period represents the time frame which encapsulates three lifecycle phases mature bamboo dieback and pioneer regeneration which is the portion of the spectral temporal signature that exhibits the most distinct temporal trajectory based on rmse values of the modelled segments definitions of cold spots were based on significance thresholds based on preliminary analysis of the z score frequencies but all p values were less than 0 05 2 4 time weighted dynamic time warping the r package dtwsat was used as a comparison to assess the performance of the hybrid model as it employs spectral temporal signatures to classify different landcover types and provides further insight into bamboo lifecycle synchrony maus et al 2016b the package requires a landsat time series stack and a set of training points used to extract time series information from temporal patterns traditionally dynamic time warping dtw is typically used to match two time dependent sequences x x1 x2 xn of length n and y y1 y2 ym of length m to evaluate the alignment of the sequences certain conditions must be met 1 the start and end points of x and y must align 2 monotonicity must be maintained and 3 continuity is ensured by x and y possessing the same number of nodes all of which align müller 2007 the inclusion of the time weighted constraint in the twdtw algorithm allows these conditions to be omitted enabling temporal patterns with different start and end points and number of nodes to classify segments of a longer time series a feature of the program is that the twdtw algorithm employs a logistic weight function as a time constraint which governs the way in which nodes align the logistic weight permits more flexibility with temporal patterns that may vary in length e g crop cycles that range from 90 to 120 days maus et al 2016a and therefore allows the hypothesized synchrony of the perpetuated bamboo dominance cycle to be tested if the bamboo dieback events are out of phase then this algorithm will yield higher accuracies in classifying regions of bamboo dominated forest than the hybrid model the logistic weight function is as follows 2 ω 1 1 e a g t 1 t 2 β where α is steepness g is the absolute difference in days between t 1 t 2 and β is the midpoint maus et al 2016b to use twdtw as a method to classify different forest types a set of time series samples qc u1 u2 uq where u u1 un is a sample of a time series pattern and c is class is then used to classify vx y v1 v2 vm which is a time series of pixel locations x y all the satellite spatial coverage are then combined into a set of time series s v1 v2 vs each qc is compared to each vx y and the local cost is measured the cost or twdtw distance between qc and vx y will determine the classification of vx y maus et al 2016a 2 4 1 time weighted dynamic time warping parameters the 32 year smoothed landsat time series stack required further processing to improve the program s performance using changepoints of the four broad successional phases as vertices linear models were imposed on the 32 year smoothed landsat time series stack rendering annual modelled values for each pixel in the study area fig 5 this was done in an attempt to further reduce year to year noise as the original smoothed time series did not yield acceptable results training point data were manually selected to create sample spectral temporal patterns for the three prominent landcover types of the study area araucaria predominance degraded forest and bamboo dominated forest the same 28 training points used to develop the hybrid model were used to generate the sample spectral temporal patterns for bamboo dominated forest with an additional 14 araucaria predominance and 34 degraded forest training points selected based on the approximate proportion of forest types within the ersc to create sample patterns maus et al 2016a tested a range of time delays to determine β as a parameter for the twdtw equation for this study the program was found to produce the most accurate outputs when the parameters were set to α 0 01 and β 1 which enables minimal time warping but still serves as a necessary constraint to maintain the temporal structure both 32 year 1984 2015 and 16 year time series 2000 2015 were evaluated a 16 year time period was chosen over the 15 year time period as samples taken in the same time intervals improve model performance the twdtw classifier was run three times table 2 both the 32 year and 16 year time series were run separately to determine which time series yielded superior results for both each time series was treated as a singular temporal pattern e g 1984 2015 2000 2015 an additional classification was performed to identify whether the 16 year temporal pattern could successfully classify regions of bamboo dominance when applied to the 32 year time series stack which yields two classified maps from the time periods of 1984 to 1999 and 2000 to 2015 2 5 maximum likelihood classification to compare efficacy of both the hybrid model and twdtw algorithm as classification methods a maximum likelihood classification was employed on four satellite images representative of each of the four lifecycle phases 2000 pioneer predominance 2004 mature bamboo 2008 dieback 2015 pioneer regeneration these four time periods were selected to provide snapshots of the progression of bamboo dominated forest succession with each date being the last date of the four phase s time intervals maximum likelihood is one of the most prominent classification algorithms used in remote sensing the algorithm uses probability densities of user defined classes to predict the inclusion of a pixel in each class category strahler 1980 based on multivariate normality each pixel is assigned to the class that maximizes the probability when class probability densities overlap the classification of the pixel is determined by which probability density s centre it is closest to strahler 1980 the same training samples used for both the hybrid model and the twdtw classification were used for the maximum likelihood classification 2 6 validation to determine the initial accuracy of the hybrid model boxplots were created for six relevant time periods which included the 32 year time series 1984 2015 15 year time series 2001 2015 and each of the four lifecycle phases using the extracted bias and rmse values from the field sample reference data to demonstrate response variability of other forest types to the hybrid model both araucaria predominance and degraded forest were included as variables for the boxplots as the purpose of this study is to identify regions of bamboo dominated forest to assess the accuracy of the hybrid model twdtw model and maximum likelihood classification output maps both araucaria predominance and degraded forest field samples were combined and designated as secondary forest creating a presence absence output of bamboo dominated regions overall agreement and the allocation and quantity disagreement were calculated using a method developed by pontius and millones 2011 the underlying assumption of this method is that both reference data and classification output data are a perfect match as opposed to kappa coefficient which assumes randomness between both datasets this method mathematically converts sample error matrices into estimated unbiased population matrices a step which is often overlooked when performing an accuracy assessment pontius and millones 2011 quantity disagreement refers to the less than perfect match in the proportions of classes e g secondary forest and bamboo dominated forest between reference data and classification output data allocation disagreement refers to the omission and commission of pixels between classes e g secondary forest and bamboo dominated forest of reference data and classification output data total disagreement is calculated by summing quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement and overall agreement is derived from subtracting total disagreement from 100 3 results 3 1 characterization of bamboo dominated forest succession based on the modelled segments distinct phases of bamboo dominated forest succession can be observed which include senescence disturbance and subsequent regeneration between 1984 2000 the time series has a negative slope showing gradual decrease in evi values with a rapid decrease occurring between 1984 and 1988 and a more gradual decrease between 1989 and 2000 the two segments are thought to 1 represent the die off of m scabrella populations and 2 the subsequent emergence of v discolor into the canopy alongside the remaining senescent m scabrella population resulting in a gradual decrease in evi values until 2000 in 2001 a positive slope indicates an increase in evi values which is thought to be the emergence of mature bamboo into the canopy as a result of gap formation from treefall of senescent m scabrella and v discolor populations in 2005 there is a sharp drop in evi values with a corresponding negative slope which characterizes a dieback event subsequently slope becomes positive and a spike in evi values occur indicating pioneer regeneration based on these spectral temporal trajectories bamboo dominated forest succession can be characterized into four broad phases which include pioneer predominance mature bamboo bamboo dieback and pioneer regeneration fig 6 table 3 however it is important to note that between 2007 and 2008 in the dieback phase 2005 2008 there is a positive slope which indicates regeneration therefore the actual dieback and detection of senescent bamboo biomass occurs between 2005 2007 with 2007 2008 being the first year of regeneration 3 2 hybrid model performance all boxplots generated for the six time periods indicated that bamboo dominated forest consistently had median values closest to zero compared to both araucaria predominance and degraded forest for both bias and rmse outputs and generally exhibited a value spread with strong central tendency in all cases bamboo dominated forest had the smallest value range and spread between the first and third quartile the value spread of the bias boxplots indicate that the hybrid model consistently overpredicts which is shown by negative median values for all time periods and a value range that is predominantly negative values with exception to dieback fig 7 the 15 year time period had the smallest and most unbiased first to third quartile spread pioneer predominance and mature bamboo had the first and second largest value range between the first and third quartile respectively comparing bamboo dominated forest value spread to the other two forest types it is noted that generally only the fourth quartile group of araucaria predominance overlaps with the range of bamboo dominated forest whereas consistently the third quartile group of degraded forest aligns with the second quartile group of bamboo dominated forest the rmse boxplots show that the six time periods share similar median values fig 8 the 15 year hybrid model dieback and the 32 year time series have the smallest first to third quartile range respectively and do not overlap with both araucaria predominance and degraded forest mature bamboo has the largest first to third quartile spread with the third quartile group overlapping the most with the second quartile group of the degraded forest both pioneer predominance and pioneer regeneration have similar first to third quartile value ranges but it can be observed that pioneer predominance overlaps with degraded forest similarly to mature bamboo whereas pioneer regeneration has less overlap with the second quartile group with the resulting z scores from the local getis ord gi unique threshold values were selected for each of the six hybrid model outputs based on visual assessment of z score frequency histograms table 4 as rmse serves as a measure of model fit the resulting z scores are indicative of model performance suggesting that regions of rmse values closest to zero would be representative of bamboo dominance therefore the resulting spatial clustering demonstrates the hybrid model s distance from being able to perfectly predict regions of bamboo dominance an accuracy assessment was performed for the six getis ord gi maps fig 9 table 5 the 15 year hybrid model achieved the highest overall agreement of 90 the dieback phase had the second highest overall agreement which was 87 and both the 32 year hybrid model and pioneer regeneration had an overall agreement of 85 pioneer predominance and mature bamboo had the lowest accuracies receiving an overall agreement of 82 and 77 respectively 3 3 time weighted dynamic time warping performance the accuracy assessment revealed that the 16 year time series was more effective at identifying regions of bamboo dominated forest than the 32 year time series fig 10 table 6 model run 1 32 year time series yielded an overall agreement of 77 while model run 2 16 year time series achieved an overall agreement of 82 the two outputs from model run 3 yielded very different results the time period from 1984 to 1999 pioneer predominance yielded and overall agreement of 68 whereas the following time period 2000 2015 yielded an accuracy of 80 3 4 maximum likelihood classification performance it was found that the maximum likelihood classification was most successful at classifying the 2008 image dieback garnering an overall accuracy of 84 both the 2000 pioneer predominance and 2015 pioneer regeneration images achieved a fairly accurate overall agreement of 79 fig 11 table 7 comparatively the 2004 image classification received a lower overall accuracy of 75 3 5 comparison of classification performances overall the hybrid model consistently outperformed the twdtw and maximum likelihood classifiers with the twdtw model achieving the lowest overall accuracies of the three classifiers generally the three classifiers consistently produced outputs which possessed two specific configurations which affected the estimated area occupied by bamboo the two models which had the highest accuracies had an estimated area of approximately 170 ha and maintained a similar configuration the other model outputs shared a similar configuration in which two large areas of degraded forest were consistently misclassified as bamboo dominated forest resulting in an estimated total area ranging from 226 to 300 ha 4 discussion 4 1 hybrid model development and in situ observations the hybrid modelling approach was derived from kennedy et al 2010 which developed an unsupervised temporal segmentation algorithm that aimed to characterize historical landcover dynamics the approach has been used successfully to map an array of change events including insect infestation meigs et al 2011 mining activities yang et al 2018 and forest cover change in floodplains fragal et al 2016 and the segmentation workflow is considered a key component to processing landsat time series and developing change metrics hermosilla et al 2015 these metrics provide valuable information regarding change events which include change year magnitude persistence and rate hermosilla et al 2015 this research employs a similar approach which involves time series segmentation and trajectory fitting but varies in that it also incorporates seven years of regeneration data and a priori ecological knowledge to create a single semi empirical spatially explicit ecological process model to characterize the entire lifecycle of a pervasive bamboo species found throughout the araucaria forest and examine population synchrony within the ersc the hybrid model was developed and validated by 1 comparing changepoints to locally known successional dynamics and empirical evidence and 2 performing a trajectory analysis by using changepoints as vertices to fit linear models to segments of the time series first following the changepoint analysis regeneration data collected in the ersc from 2007 to 2014 were compared to the identified changepoints which occurred in 2009 and 2012 based on the dataset it was found that from 2007 to 2009 dense seedling populations of m scabrella established and quickly developed into homogeneous juvenile tree populations with re colonization of bamboo occurring in the understorey lacerda and kellermann 2017 from 2009 to 2011 a self thinning process occurred which significantly reduced m scabrella populations and enabled the development of the secondary succession species v discolor finally from 2012 to 2014 a vigorous m scabrella adult population emerged into the canopy which was determined by sampled trees transitioning from a juvenile tree class to an adult tree class lacerda and kellermann 2017 based on the agreement between the changepoint analysis and the regeneration data a trajectory analysis was performed to determine bamboo dominated forest succession phases for the entire 32 year time series forest succession phases from 1984 to 2000 were verified based on the trajectory analysis as well as a priori knowledge of pioneer population dynamics the negative slope and the changepoint identified in 1989 coincided with the expected die off of the m scabrella population and the subsequent persistent negative slope and changepoint identified in 2001 coincided with the expected gradual decline in v discolor populations the trajectories associated with dieback and regeneration were also reflective of the regeneration data dieback had a distinct drop in evi values resulting from the detection of the senescent bamboo population and pioneer regeneration had an increase in evi values resulting from the formation of a homogeneous juvenile canopy the process to develop the hybrid model was rigorous and involved long term datasets and in depth knowledge of local pioneer population dynamics therefore it is thought that the hybrid model is an accurate depiction of bamboo dominated forest succession based on its ability to capture and classify the four phases of bamboo dominated forest succession and map them as discrete events additionally based on the overall agreement of 85 for the 32 year hybrid model the model validates the observed ecological processes that are causing arrested forest succession and confirms that the phenomenon is synchronous and occurring throughout the ersc the hybrid model also provides some qualitative information regarding canopy characteristics and pioneer population dynamics based on the overall agreement of the hybrid model outputs for each phase pioneer regeneration achieved an overall accuracy of 85 which suggests that canopy characteristics are homogeneous during this phase with a distinct spectral response the pioneer predominance and mature bamboo phases had the lowest overall agreement of 82 and 77 respectively indicating that these two phases possess heterogeneous canopies composed of senescent pioneer populations and mature bamboo during pioneer predominance the canopy is composed mainly of senescent m scabrella and v discolor with the canopy of the mature bamboo phase being increasingly composed of bamboos as gaps are formed due to senescent pioneer treefall spectral mixing is thought to be the result of non uniform aging and dying of pioneer populations and subsequent emergence of mature bamboo into the canopy resulting in patches of decreased and increased evi values across the study area additionally other species specifically the pioneer sapium glandulatum vell pax and early successional ocotea puberula rich nees also develop in these young forests although in much lower abundances which also results in spectral mixing inconsistency causing year to year noise 4 2 hybrid model performance the aim of this work was to develop a singular model which describes local bamboo ecological processes causing arrested succession as observed in the ersc by lacerda and kellermann 2017 and suspected as a main driver of ecological change across the atlantic forest our approach is therefore to first detect and quantify the system s spectral temporal characteristics at a local scale and then deploy the model across larger more heterogeneous regions of the atlantic forest the model here reports a detailed study of local spectral temporal processes in ersc before commenting on future work to scale the model up the hybrid model developed here represents an idealized synchronized ecological lifecycle as identified in our field campaigns in the ersc it is important to acknowledge that throughout the ersc bamboo populations are found in the understorey of canopies of varying density for example bamboo populations arresting forest succession have been found in regions of araucaria predominance but went undetected by passive satellite imagery due to the closed canopy however it has been observed that the most abundant bamboo populations are associated with regions of the ersc which have historically undergone intensive timber extraction resulting in a sparse open canopy sparse canopy typically consisting of mature v discolor the hybrid model was therefore developed to describe forest succession of regions within the ersc considered most impacted by bamboo and thus aiming to identify regions in a perpetuated bamboo dominance cycle the 32 year hybrid model had an overall agreement of 85 indicating that the observed in situ bamboo ecological processes are synchronous throughout the ersc and coincide with historical anthropogenic disturbances the overall agreement of 90 for the 15 year hybrid model which encapsulates the phases of mature bamboo dieback and pioneer regeneration demonstrates the efficacy of the 15 year hybrid model to detect bamboo dominated regions it is thought that the 15 year hybrid model outperformed the 32 year hybrid model due to the spectral mixing which occurs from 1984 to 2000 because of asynchronous die off of pioneer populations present in the canopy additionally the 15 year hybrid model encapsulates the dieback event which is characterized by an abrupt drop in index values which is easily distinguishable from other spectral temporal signals thus reducing error associated with year to year noise when each of the three phases was individually used to classify regions of bamboo dominated forest overall agreement for each phase was lower than the 15 year hybrid model which demonstrates the importance of including long term temporal information regarding a system s processes as supplementary information when performing landcover classification wulder et al 2018 for the pioneer predominance mature bamboo and pioneer regeneration hybrid models certain portions of the study area representative of degraded forest were consistently misclassified which was also observed by an increase in total estimated area of almost 100 ha misclassification of bamboo dominated regions could be caused by spectral mixing similarity between bamboo dominated forest and degraded forest the rmse boxplots of the three phases show that there is considerable overlap between bamboo dominated forest and degraded forest indicating that both forest types share similar values which could be the reason for the consistent misclassification similar to the three previously mentioned hybrid models the canopy of degraded forest is heterogeneous in nature possessing a wide variation in structure and diversity the 32 year spectral temporal patterns of the regions prone to misclassification were extracted and the evi values for each phase were examined it was found that patterns generally consisted of high evi values and were fairly stable with some year to year noise however these high evi values are characteristic of pioneer spectral response therefore it is thought that misclassification resulting from the pioneer predominance mature bamboo and pioneer regeneration hybrid models is occurring due to the lack of temporal information provided by the dieback event therefore it is evident that the dieback response which is captured in the 15 year hybrid model provides important temporal information which has been found to improve model performance 4 3 comparison of model performances the hybrid model is novel in that it employs the spectral and temporal properties of a landsat time series stack and incorporates spatial information of neighbouring pixels by using a getis ord gi statistical analysis to classify regions of bamboo dominated forest the inclusion of the gi statistic was an important step from an ecological standpoint as spectral mixing resulting from the presence of mature v discolor in the canopy impacted the spectral temporal signal causing contaminated pixels to be assigned a higher rmse value without the use of the gi statistic these contaminated pixels may have been excluded from the classification spatial dependency is inherent in forested landscapes based on tree assemblages which possess unique spectral responses and spatial pattern research has shown that the gi statistic can serve as important ancillary data that introduces fuzzy boundaries which more closely emulates the natural transition of landcover types than the discrete boundaries introduced in pixel based classifications wulder and boots 1998 previous use of gi statistic on landsat imagery has been restricted to singular images wulder and boots 1998 2001 ghimire et al 2010 and to the best of our knowledge has not been used on metrics derived from landsat time series for purposes of classification by comparing the results of the hybrid model with the twdtw model it is evident that the inclusion of spatial information with a classifier that employs pixel based spectral temporal signatures has the potential to substantially improve classification accuracy the twdtw model yielded lower overall agreement than the hybrid model model run 2 16 year temporal pattern applied to a 16 year time series achieved an accuracy of 82 and model run 3 16 year temporal pattern applied to a 32 year time series had an accuracy of 80 compared to 85 accuracy for the 32 year hybrid model and 90 accuracy for the 15 year hybrid model both the hybrid model and the twdtw outputs yielded similar classification configurations but it can be noted that there is much more noise associated with the twdtw classification whereas the hybrid model outputs have a much cleaner classification of cohesive segments with fuzzier boundaries which is a result of the gi statistic in a remote sensing context the getis ord gi statistic analysis acts as a moving filter by considering pixel values of the local neighbourhood of a focus pixel which assists with reducing misclassification caused by noisy data wulder and boots 1998 as landsat time series often possess year to year noise resulting from contaminated pixels or spectral mixing due to spatial resolution rmse values calculated for the hybrid model may be imprecise therefore by calculating a gi statistic neighbourhood information will include or exclude certain pixels based on their adjacency to other pixels of a similar rmse value it is thought that the use of the gi statistic could act as an important tool to reduce information loss resulting from edge effects an example of edge effects can be observed when examining the twdtw classification the classification consists of many patches which does not necessarily reflect the transition between presence absence of bamboo as often low density bamboo populations will exist on the periphery of regions highly populated with bamboo however there are inherent trade offs and loss of information when using a filtering process for classification it can be argued that by performing a getis ord gi statistical analysis sub pixel bamboo populations may be omitted from the classification araujo et al 2008 although this information is important for forecasting regions at risk of bamboo infestation for the scope of this study our focus is centered on identifying relatively large regions within the ersc in a state of arrested forest succession additionally the gi statistic assumes normal distribution of the dataset under observation therefore using this statistical approach may not be appropriate for non parametric datasets however it has been suggested that if a minimum of 8 pixels are used to compute the gi statistic the resulting distribution of gi values will be normal griffin et al 1996 wulder and boots 1998 based on the existing spatial pattern of the ersc it was thought that data were normally distributed therefore using a gi statistic was an acceptable approach for this study the importance of including temporal information is highlighted when the hybrid model is compared to the maximum likelihood classifications both the 2000 and 2004 maximum likelihood classifications which represent the last year of each of the bamboo dominated forest succession phases obtained lower accuracies 79 for pioneer predominance and 75 for mature bamboo than the hybrid model 82 for pioneer predominance and 77 for mature bamboo and possess substantial noise in comparison to the hybrid model outputs as previously discussed both these phases of bamboo dominated forest succession are known to have pioneer populations present in the canopy therefore these two phases are likely to share a similar spectral response to other regions of degraded forest by incorporating multi year imagery it is evident that the noise introduced by the maximum likelihood classification is substantially reduced and the classification configuration of bamboo dominated regions more closely resembles that of the existing spatial pattern found within the ersc although the maximum likelihood classifier acquired reasonable overall accuracies the use of snapshot classifiers gives limited insight into the history of forest development with complete access to the landsat archives use of multi temporal imagery to derive temporal metrics has now become an integral component of landcover classification wulder et al 2018 the use of temporal metrics provides important information on landcover change and ecological succession and are now readily used as ancillary datasets for model inputs wulder et al 2018 use of multi temporal imagery was particularly important when examining the lifecycle dynamics of m skvortzovii as this species of bamboo occupies the forest understorey for the majority of its lifecycle making it very challenging to detect during the pioneer predominance and pioneer regeneration phases therefore by extracting spectral temporal signatures from multi temporal imagery it is possible to determine whether bamboo exists in the understorey based on the temporal progression of the pixel under investigation this is an example of the importance of using multi temporal imagery and based on current technologies it is thought that metrics derived from time series is a necessary step in the process of performing landcover classification wulder et al 2018 4 4 mapping bamboo in the araucaria forest based on the validation process involved in developing the hybrid model it is thought that metrics derived from the hybrid model will function as a valuable model input for current mapping efforts being developed to monitor brazilian forests batista da luz et al 2015 state wide records of synchronized monocarpic dieback events of m skvortzovii from 1843 to 1876 1877 1909 1910 1938 1940 1973 1975 pereira 1941 sendulsky 1995 2003 2006 liebsch and reginato 2009 kellermann 2011 and a recent santa catarina state forest inventory vibrans et al 2013 indicate that m skvortzovii populations are present throughout the araucaria forest based on this information it is thought that the hybrid model will serve as valuable ancillary data which can be incorporated into classification models in this study z scores resulting from a getis ord gi statistical analysis were used as thresholds which can be used to map bamboo in various regions throughout the araucaria forest the getis ord gi statistic calculates the z score for each pixel within the study area which indicates the degree of autocorrelation of a neighbourhood of pixels surrounding a given pixel and the magnitude of these values relative to the entire dataset wulder and boots 1998 a z score is considered statistically significant if it is 1 65 or 1 65 p value less than 0 1 for this analysis we found that p values less than 0 05 all accurately defined regions of bamboo dominated forest succession based on visual examination of z score histograms and knowledge of existing bamboo population distribution within the ersc as previously mentioned normal distribution of a dataset is assumed when using a gi statistic therefore the use of the statistic on non parametric datasets may be considered inappropriate alternatively if non parametric datasets are being used a threshold can be employed to define regions of bamboo populations based on the boxplot quartile rmse values extracted from the study area it is advised that the median rmse 0 06 or upper quartile rmse 0 07 be used as a threshold currently bamboo dominated forest is not included as a forest class in brazilian forest classifications and more specifically within araucaria forest classifications a recent classification workflow developed by brazilian national forest inventory nfi br employs a hybrid approach which integrates pixel based multi data and object oriented analysis to perform state wide classifications batista da luz et al 2015 it is thought that the incorporation of pixel based rmse metrics derived from hybrid modelling into current forest classification methods would 1 improve forest classification by distinguishing between forest and bamboo dominated forest and 2 provide valuable information regarding the health status of remaining forest fragments based on their composition of bamboo populations 4 5 bamboo as a biological invasion and hybrid modelling although bamboo ecological processes described by the hybrid model are unique to m skvortzovii many bamboo species have been found to impact forest succession in a similar way lifecycle length varies amongst bamboo species but all populations terminate with a monocarpic dieback event of mass seeding dieback events are comparable to a large scale disturbance opening the canopy and releasing resources such as light availability soil nutrients and space required for tree recruitment taylor and qin 1992 abe et al 2002 taylor 2004 rother et al 2009 studies have shown that although seedling recruitment may be improved immediately following dieback events the aggressive regeneration strategies of certain bamboo species results in arrested succession by means of resource competition and mechanical damage gratzer et al 1999 abe et al 2002 griscom 2002 narukawa and yamamoto 2002 griscom and ashton 2006 lacerda and kellermann 2017 these ecological processes coincide with a forest succession mechanism model referred to as the inhibition model connell and slatyer 1977 this model designates that forest succession has the potential to be governed by early colonists by means of securing space and resources which subsequently inhibits the growth and or replacement of later successional species lacerda and kellermann 2017 observed this process and determined that bamboo populations were able to recover following a dieback event despite the subsequent development of a dense tree canopy dominated by pioneer species by homogeneously occupying the understorey and emerging into the canopy as pioneer populations died off bamboo ecological processes are light driven and as a result of human induced forest fragmentation change in the understorey light climate caused by canopy structure alteration and increased edge has left remaining forest fragments vulnerable to bamboo invasion with ongoing forest fragmentation baccini et al 2017 and the widespread presence of bamboo throughout tropical and sub tropical forests scurlock et al 2000 it is important to understand how bamboo ecological processes are being driven by anthropogenic disturbances and simultaneously contributing to forest degradation most previous analyses of bamboo ecological processes have been restricted to in situ sampling which often only examine a portion of bamboo lifecycle abe et al 2002 liebsch and reginato 2009 budke et al 2010 however the use of spectral temporal modelling presents the opportunity to undertake long term landscape scale spatial temporal analyses of the ecological processes of various bamboo species for this reason it is thought that developing spectral temporal models which describe bamboo ecological processes is an important and viable approach to monitoring and mapping populations throughout tropical and sub tropical forests the hybrid model was developed using a simple workflow for ease of reproducibility and produced an easily interpretable metric i e rmse previous studies have been performed which use landsat time series to depict and characterize the lifecycle of other native invasive bamboos guadua weberbaueri and guadua sarcocarpa found in the amazon forest but relied on manual photo interpretation and visual assessment to describe phases of bamboo dominated forest succession not taking advantage of spectral temporal properties de carvalho et al 2013 nelson and bianchini 2005 it was determined that the presence of guadua weberbaueri and guadua sarcocarpa was arresting forest succession as a result of intensive mechanical damage to juvenile trees and that both bamboo species had three broad lifecycle phases live mature cohort dead post flowering cohort and juvenile cohort confined to the understory griscom and ashton 2006 de carvalho et al 2013 although important information was generated from this research it is thought that developing a hybrid model would enhance information regarding lifecycle phases such as phase persistence and specific start and end dates of each phase additionally using the hybrid model to map regions of bamboo would be much more efficient it is hoped that this research will demonstrate the utility of spectral temporal modelling to both analyze bamboo lifecycle dynamics and map bamboo populations at a landscape scale 5 conclusion in this paper we identified the spectral temporal signature of bamboo dominated forest succession identified four broad lifecycle phases of bamboo and developed a hybrid model to examine bamboo ecological processes at a landscape scale the hybrid model validated that in situ observed ecological processes arresting forest succession were synchronous and occurring throughout the ersc additionally the hybrid model proved to be an effective tool for mapping bamboo populations and it is thought that metrics derived from the hybrid model can be incorporated into current forest classification methods being used to map brazilian forests the hybrid model was compared to both a twdtw model and a maximum likelihood classifier and was found to outperform both models consistently which is thought to be the result of the hybrid model incorporating multi temporal imagery and spatial information from the gi statistic the hybrid model has the potential to detect m skvortzovii in other fragments of araucaria forest which would provide valuable information regarding the health status of the remaining araucaria forest fragments and emphasize the need for silvicultural intervention in regions impacted by bamboo future research could use these methods to perform a state wide detection of m skvortzovii in the remaining araucaria forest fragments for which it is recommended that the 15 year hybrid model 2001 to 2015 is used it is hoped that knowledge gained from this research will assist in evaluating the state of bamboo dominated forests throughout the remaining araucaria forest enabling improved management and conservation efforts additionally it is thought that the methodologies applied in this study have the potential to be used in other bamboo dominated forest ecosystems to extrapolate information regarding the ecological processes of other bamboo species and their impact

25256,with access to collections of continuous satellite imagery over a 40 year period spectral temporal patterns extracted from multi temporal imagery offer a potential new tool to model mechanisms of forest succession and monitor changes in forested landscapes specifically spectral temporal trajectories associated with successional forest change occurring over prolonged periods of time may enhance periodic snapshot monitoring methods especially for species that exhibit complex and non linear dynamics in this paper landsat time series are used to examine the spectral temporal signatures of bamboo dominated forest succession occurring within the critically threatened araucaria forest a pine dominated subtype of the atlantic forest in southern brazil alteration of canopy structure through ongoing anthropogenic disturbance has increased understorey light climate and given opportunity for native invasive bamboos to flourish resulting in drastic reduction of tree regeneration and loss of biodiversity we aimed to evaluate how spectral temporal signatures could be used to 1 characterize stages of bamboo dominated forest succession 2 identify synchrony of bamboo lifecycle dynamics and 3 classify regions of bamboo dominated forest changepoint analysis was performed using an extracted sample spectral temporal signature and trajectories were fit to the resulting segments using linear regression based on slope values of the fitted segments a novel description incorporating temporal information of bamboo dominated forest succession was developed which identified four broad phases pioneer predominance mature bamboo dieback and pioneer regeneration to determine the spatial and temporal synchrony of bamboo dominated forest succession a hybrid model was developed by combining the modelled segments and compared to a 32 year landsat time series of vegetation indices by calculating root mean square error between each pixel in the study area the hybrid model proficiently classified regions of bamboo dominance achieving between 77 and 90 accuracy which also indicated lifecycle synchrony of bamboo populations within the study area to further assess the performance of the hybrid model a time weighted dynamic time warping model approach was used to determine synchrony and classify regions of bamboo the time weighted dynamic time warping classifier had lower overall accuracy 68 82 but is still considered a useful tool for automated classification purposes that take advantage of multi temporal imagery to compare classification performance between snapshot and multi temporal imagery classifiers a maximum likelihood classification was performed which attained lower overall accuracies than the hybrid model 75 84 overall the use of spectral temporal signatures offers a novel and effective approach to both describing and modelling bamboo dominated forest succession and forest successional processes more generally on a landscape scale keywords landsat time series spectral temporal modelling bamboo succession atlantic forest 1 introduction the atlantic forest which is considered one of the world s twenty five biodiversity hotspots myers et al 2000 mittermeier et al 2004 has been reduced to less than 10 of its original area and is considered the most devastated and threatened ecosystem in the world leal and de camara 2003 the remaining forest is host to more than 8000 endemic species with over 530 species officially designated as threatened myers et al 2000 as a subtype of the atlantic forest the subtropical humid forests of southern brazil fao 2005 locally known as araucaria forest ibge 2012 has been subjected to intensive fragmentation resulting in forest fragments of less than 50 ha which have been heavily altered lacerda 2016 the degradation of the remaining forests has drastically altered canopy structure allowing native bamboos to dominate the forest understorey forming dense clumps which exclude surrounding plant communities budke et al 2010 lacerda and kellermann 2017 contributing to further degrade the remaining araucaria forest fragments lacerda 2016 merostachys skvortzovii is a pervasive bamboo species found throughout araucaria forest m skvortzovii is characterized by a 31 to 33 year lifecycle pereira 1941 during which it may dominate the forest understory continuously and terminate with a dieback event of synchronized mast flowering griscom and ashton 2006 lacerda and kellermann 2017 once m skvortzovii populations establish themselves in the forest understorey their monocarpic dieback events have been found to act as disturbance events by opening the canopy and releasing soil nutrients and space taylor and qin 1992 abe et al 2002 taylor 2004 rother et al 2009 enabling regeneration of pioneer specie to occur within araucaria forest mimosa scabrella a prominent pioneer species will initially recruit and dominate the canopy followed by secondary succession species vernonanthura discolor and m skvortzovii kellermann 2011 lacerda and kellermann 2017 once m skvortzovii recruits it will continuously replace itself by clonal growth throughout its lifecycle growing denser as it matures while simultaneously further suppressing regeneration the way in which pioneer and m skvortzovii population dynamics coincide is hypothesized to be a synchronized process which controls forest succession due to similar lifecycle lengths of m skvortzovii 31 to 33 years m scabrella 20 to 25 years and v discolor 30 to 60 years gaps created by treefall from senescent pioneer populations enables incoming solar radiation to reach the bamboo dominated understorey increasing bamboo growth while impeding the development of tree species this synchronized process has resulted in a perpetuated bamboo dominance cycle which has been observed to arrest forest succession in the region lacerda and kellermann 2017 a phenomenon which has also been observed in the amazon forest griscom and ashton 2006 in forested regions where canopy structure has been altered due to ongoing anthropogenic disturbances it has been observed that increased understorey light climate has enabled native invasive bamboos to flourish resulting in reduction of tree regeneration and loss of biodiversity lacerda and kellermann 2017 with increasing threat to ecologically sensitive regions such as the atlantic forest of southern brazil increased knowledge regarding the impact of bamboo dominance on surrounding plant communities will assist in improving current forest management techniques by emphasizing the need for silvicultural intervention to enable and promote the growth and regeneration of threatened and endangered plant species the use of landsat time series stacks has proven to serve as an effective tool to observe continuous change and improve understanding of ecological processes occurring at a landscape scale kennedy et al 2007 methods have been developed in recent years which exploit the use of spectral temporal signatures to observe mechanisms of forest succession broich et al 2011 lehmann et al 2013 identify distinct disturbance events and recovery rates huang et al 2009 vogelmann et al 2009 kennedy et al 2010 griffiths et al 2014 devries et al 2015 senf et al 2015 and classify various landcover types maus et al 2016a the premise of these methods is the underlying assumption that many natural systems exhibit a distinct temporal progression which can be observed in spectral space kennedy et al 2007 to analyze ecological processes of bamboo dominated forests we developed a semi empirical spatially explicit hybrid spectral temporal model hybrid model from a 32 year landsat time series to characterize the successional phases of bamboo dominated forests and determine whether the perpetuated bamboo dominance cycle is a synchronous process occurring on a landscape scale while the lifecycle of m skvortzovii has been only recently discovered on a local scale research interest now centres on identifying the spatial scale and synchrony of these processes occurring across the landscape utilizing remotely sensed imagery to derive bamboo successional dynamics will support the development of synoptic mapping tools for the atlantic forest which will directly support conservation and adaptive management planning accordingly this paper aims to 1 identify and characterize the spectral temporal signature of bamboo dominated forest succession 2 determine whether the perpetuated bamboo dominance cycle is a synchronous process occurring on a landscape scale by comparing a 32 year landsat time series stack to a hybrid model 3 compare performance of the hybrid model to a time weighted dynamic time warping model approach to assess the effectiveness of the hybrid model and more generally spectral temporal signatures to determine bamboo lifecycle synchrony and identify regions of bamboo dominance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the embrapa research station in caçador ersc is a 1157 hectare research area located in caçador santa catarina brazil fig 1 the study area is part of the subtropical humid forest of the atlantic forest in southern brazil locally known as araucaria forest which is a mixture of temperate and tropical floras ibge 2012 leite and klein 1990 occurring in subtropical highland climate cfb with high annual precipitation of approximately 1400 mm however extensive colonization in the 19th century has reduced the biome to 5 of the original forest cover as primary forest with 20 25 as secondary forest lacerda 2016 the region is characterized by the predominance of the critically endangered late successional species araucaria angustifolia and ocotea porosa ibge 2012 ersc is one of the most well preserved remaining fragments of the subtropical humid forest and has not received any silvicultural intervention in the past 20 years lacerda et al 2012 prior to that the forests in the ersc were subjected to selective logging significantly reducing areas where the canopy is dominated by a angustifolia lacerda 2016 in 1948 ersc was established as a forest reserve although the east end continued to be heavily logged until 1974 which enabled the invasion of bamboo in the forest understorey in the area the ersc has previously been classified into three forest types which include 1 araucaria predominance 2 degraded forest and 3 bamboo dominated forest lacerda 2016 araucaria predominance describes areas of forest where canopy is dominated by araucaria angustifolia degraded forests are areas of the ersc that experienced intensive logging in the past and may have been impacted by forest fires resulting in significant alteration of forest structure and floristic composition these forests are characterized by open canopies which enables invasion of bamboo bamboo dominated forests are areas within the ersc that have been submitted to historical clearcutting in which bamboo populations are dominant with significant suppression of regeneration occurring in the understory lacerda et al 2012 lacerda and kellermann 2017 the landscape surrounding the ersc is primarily farmland commercial forest plantations and small forest fragments resulting from fragmentation or regeneration of abandoned agriculture land lacerda 2016 2 2 data 2 2 1 reference data collection one hundred and ten field samples were used as reference data sixty nine of the field samples were plot data collected in 2006 as part of a forest inventory which was carried out by stratified random sampling and considered 13 different strata at different slope and elevation classes based on photo interpretation of a 2004 ikonos image rivera 2007 the 69 temporary plots were distributed proportionally to the strata areas 62 of which were 500 m2 and the remaining seven 250 m2 for each plot all trees 10 cm dbh were identified and height and dbh were recorded these 69 plots were later divided into four broad management units which included araucaria predominance structured forest degraded forest and bamboo dominated forest lacerda et al 2012 structured forest and degraded forest were aggregated into one forest type and designated as degraded forest following lacerda 2016 mapping of the ersc an additional 41 field samples were collected in 2016 during a field campaign field sampling regions for the campaign were selected using high resolution imagery from 2004 2006 and 2014 areas of homogeneous forest types araucaria predominance degraded forest and bamboo dominated forest were selected to avoid edge effects with accessibility also influencing selection several of these field samples were taken in proximity to clusters of regeneration plots used for other studies lacerda and kellermann 2017 in total the dataset consists of 24 araucaria predominance 47 degraded forest and 39 bamboo dominated forest samples 2 2 2 imagery and processing landsat imagery was used to examine the spectral temporal patterns of the esrc over the 30 year lifecycle of bamboo which was acquired using google earth engine the landsat time series stack used for this study consisted of 35 cloud free images acquired between the months of may and september to reduce spectral variation caused by seasonality years with multiple images were averaged together to create annual composites with omission of the years 1989 1992 1994 1998 and 2012 due to poor quality imagery to produce a continuous timeline raster values were linearly interpolated for each missing year all cloud free images from 1984 to 2011 were acquired from the landsat 5 tm surface reflectance image collection and images from 2013 to 2015 were acquired from the landsat 8 oli surface reflectance image collection due to the landsat 7 etm scan line corrector problem imagery from this sensor were not used surface reflectance is required to accurately derive the enhanced vegetation index evi which was calculated over the landsat time series stack using google earth engine code editor evi is a canopy reflectance measure developed to optimize the vegetation signal by separating the canopy background signal while simultaneously reducing atmosphere influences huete et al 2002 evi values have been found to outperform ndvi in tropical and sub tropical environments huete et al 2002 as the index has been observed to be more responsive to variation in canopy structure including leaf area index lai canopy type and architecture and plant physiognomy gao et al 2000 surface reflectance

landsat data and entered into second simulation of a satellite signal in the solar spectrum 6s radiative transfer models to produce multiple climate data records which include surface reflectance ju et al 2012 a 32 year landsat time series of evi values was created and a savitzky golay smoothing filter was applied to the time series stack to reduce year to year noise savitzky and golay 1964 a savitzky golay filter aims to increase signal to noise ratio without reducing the signal by employing a least squares fit convolution chen et al 2004 smoothing is achieved by fitting polynomials to segments of a larger dataset a small window preceding and following a value of interest is fit to a polynomial of a certain degree to derive a new smoothed value to replace the value of interest chen et al 2004 as forest succession is a gradual process it is important to identify a trend occurring over a prolonged period of time which is achieved by reducing year to year noise by employing a filter chen et al 2004 any disturbance events which may occur would still be visible in the smoothed time series so long as the smoothing parameters selected do not overgeneralize the time series and create a bias 2 3 overview of characterization of successional phases and development of the hybrid model the overall strategy to characterize bamboo dominated forest succession and observe its synchrony involved three main steps fig 2 first the spectral temporal signature of bamboo dominated forest succession was identified 2 3 1 using this spectral temporal signature a changepoint analysis was applied to identify vertices which were used to fit trajectories to determine phases of bamboo dominated forest succession 2 3 2 the resulting modelled segments from the changepoint analysis were then assembled to create a hybrid model 2 3 3 2 3 1 determining bamboo dominated forest succession spectral temporal signature twenty eight training points were selected using 2004 ikonos imagery 2006 alos imagery and 2014 worldview2 imagery based on previous classifications published using these three images criteria for selecting these training points were 1 bamboo or v discolor are visible in the canopy in the 2004 image dlugosz et al 2005 2 senescent biomass resulting from dieback is visible in the 2006 image luz 2009 and 3 pioneers are visible in the canopy of the 2014 image maran 2016 landsat pixels in the middle of these regions were selected to reduce edge effects or spectral mixing the individual spectral temporal patterns of each selected pixel were then averaged to generate a representative spectral temporal signature of bamboo dominated forest succession 2 3 2 characterizing bamboo dominated forest succession spectral temporal signature a changepoint analysis was applied to the spectral temporal signature using the changepoint r package to identify significant changes in variance that distinguish phases of bamboo dominated forest succession killick and eckley 2014 fig 3 the distribution of the time series data is non parametric therefore a cumulative sum of squares css binary segmentation changepoint analysis was employed css binary segmentation determines approximate changepoints in a time series by systematically splitting data into clusters and summing the squared distances between sets of points and dividing the sum by n with the two resulting segments being treated as individual time series to be subsequently analysed edwards and cavalli sforza 1965 the optimal split of the data is to maximize the between clusters sum of squares and consequently to minimize the within clusters sum of squares edwards and cavalli sforza 1965 when working with a non parametric dataset traditional penalty values e g aic type i error etc applied to reduce model overfitting are often inappropriate to define significant changepoints killick and eckley 2014 as an alternative approach the number of changepoints to be identified can be user defined central to the development of the hybrid model was determining the appropriate number of changepoints to be detected this was achieved through iteration and comparison to empirical evidence one to ten changepoints were tested with five changepoints serving to identify the most relevant changepoints within the time series which also corroborated with regeneration data collected from 2007 to 2014 lacerda and kellermann 2017 table 1 years of drastic population change such as m scabrella seedling establishment self thinning of m scabrella juvenile populations and emergence of m scabrella adult populations into the canopy coincided with statistically significant changepoints as there were no field data available prior to 2006 a priori expectations regarding successional phases from 1984 to 2005 were inferred based on ecological knowledge of pioneer species m scabrella and v discolor lifecycle dynamics m scabrella is known to have a lifecycle of 20 25 years with approximately 75 of adult populations expected to die off before the age of 20 with the remaining trees showing signs of senescence steenbock et al 2011 v discolor is known to occur with m scabrella growing in the understorey as juveniles and emerging into the canopy as the m scabrella adult population thins v discolor has been found to live up to 60 years santos et al 2011 with a decline in population after 45 50 years as the previous bamboo lifecycle occurred from approximately 1974 to 2006 it could be expected that pioneer populations would be present in the canopy from 1984 to 2005 but would be in a state of senescence using the changepoints as vertices trajectories of each segment were fit using linear regression and were subsequently compared to forest succession temporal trajectories hypothesized by kennedy et al 2007 and vogelmann et al 2009 based on the slope of the fitted values information regarding the phase of forest succession was extrapolated kennedy et al 2007 hypothesized the spectral temporal trajectories of four phases of forest succession which included disturbance disturbance and revegetation revegetation revegetation to stable state and vogelmann et al 2009 identified the spectral temporal trajectory of senescent populations a disturbance event is characterized by an abrupt decrease in index values which is followed by either a continued state of disturbance i e land conversion or revegetation which is identified by an initial spike in index values followed by a more gradual increase over time revegetation is identified by a continuous gradual increase in index values and followed by a stable state which is characterized by a prolonged period of stable index values senescent or damaged populations are identified by a gradual decrease in index values over a prolonged period of time vogelmann et al 2009 the modelled segments were aggregated into four broad successional phases which include mature senescence pioneer predominance mature bamboo bamboo dieback and juvenile pioneer regeneration based on the observed slope of the modelled segment trajectories 2 3 3 development of hybrid spectral temporal model hybrid model to evaluate whether the hypothesized perpetuated bamboo dominance cycle was occurring on a landscape scale we developed a semi empirical spatially explicit hybrid spectral temporal model representative of bamboo dominated forest succession from the time series of landsat images the 32 modelled values of the hybrid model were converted into a 32 year hybrid model raster time series stack which was then compared to the 32 year landsat time series of smoothed evi values to determine whether the hybrid model effectively described bamboo dominated forest succession fig 4 bias and root mean square error rmse between each pixel in the study area and the hybrid model were computed and summarized creating raster outputs of both bias and rmse values a local getis ord gi statistic was calculated for the rmse output to identify spatial clustering of errors which simultaneously identifies synchrony and serves to classify regions of bamboo dominated forest using a local getis ord gi statistic clustering output of rmse values is a non traditional classification method typically this statistic is used to detect statistically significant hot and cold spots of spatially clustered high and low values getis and ord 1992 getis and aldstadt 2010 remotely sensed data is often highly spatially auto correlated due the regularization of continuous landscapes into a pixelated grid resulting in clusters of pixels with similar spectral values based on the existing spatial pattern of landcover features wulder and boots 1998 an example of this phenomenon are the assemblages of species across forested landscapes which results in unique spatial clusters of pixels which share similar spectral values wulder and boots 1998 used a local getis ord gi statistic to examine spatial dependency within a forested landscape and found that the spatial structure of the landsat channel 4 gi was similar to the output of a maximum likelihood classification performed using the same landsat image however it was found that the use of neighbourhood information by the getis ord gi statistic created fuzzy boundaries between species assemblages which is thought to more closely reflect the subtle and gradual change of spectral values between objects unlike the discrete boundaries introduced by the maximum likelihood classification for this reason we chose to take advantage of the temporal information available from landsat time series stacks and subsequently employ a spatial statistical approach to improve the classification by incorporating spatial information in this study spatial autocorrelation of rmse values associated with bamboo dominated forest was assumed based on the 1 existing spatial pattern of bamboo in the ersc and 2 the rmse value spread demonstrated by boxplots generated for the three forest types through observation of satellite and aerial imagery it has been observed that approximately a third of the ersc is visibly occupied by bamboo dominated forest the majority of which is coalesced on the eastern edge of the ersc with this knowledge it was assumed that these regions would be characterized by low rmse values and other areas as higher rmse values boxplots generated to demonstrate rmse value spread for the three forest types exemplified this assumption bamboo dominated forest exhibited a narrow value spread of low values while both araucaria predominance and degraded forest typically possessed a wider spread of higher rmse values based on these preliminary findings it was hypothesized that the getis ord gi statistic cold spots would generate spatial clusters of bamboo dominated forest exclusive from other forest types for the getis ord gi cluster analysis queen s case contiguity was used to define the spatial neighbourhood for each pixel the local sum for each pixel s neighbours is proportionally compared to the sum of all pixels in a dataset resulting in a statistically significant z score if the local sum is substantially higher or lower than the expected local sum getis and ord 1992 a simple form of the gi statistic is 1 g i j 1 n w i j x j j 1 n x j where wij are the spatial weights between pixel i and j and xj is the rmse value of the jth neighbour of pixel i the numerator is the sum of all contiguous neighbouring attributes and the denominator is the sum of all features in the dataset the sum of both the numerator and the denominator do not include the feature under observation the same hybrid modelling workflow was then used to determine the ability of the hybrid model to identify regions of bamboo dominated forest for each of the four broad phases of the bamboo dominated forest succession as well as a 15 year time period from 2001 to 2015 this time period represents the time frame which encapsulates three lifecycle phases mature bamboo dieback and pioneer regeneration which is the portion of the spectral temporal signature that exhibits the most distinct temporal trajectory based on rmse values of the modelled segments definitions of cold spots were based on significance thresholds based on preliminary analysis of the z score frequencies but all p values were less than 0 05 2 4 time weighted dynamic time warping the r package dtwsat was used as a comparison to assess the performance of the hybrid model as it employs spectral temporal signatures to classify different landcover types and provides further insight into bamboo lifecycle synchrony maus et al 2016b the package requires a landsat time series stack and a set of training points used to extract time series information from temporal patterns traditionally dynamic time warping dtw is typically used to match two time dependent sequences x x1 x2 xn of length n and y y1 y2 ym of length m to evaluate the alignment of the sequences certain conditions must be met 1 the start and end points of x and y must align 2 monotonicity must be maintained and 3 continuity is ensured by x and y possessing the same number of nodes all of which align müller 2007 the inclusion of the time weighted constraint in the twdtw algorithm allows these conditions to be omitted enabling temporal patterns with different start and end points and number of nodes to classify segments of a longer time series a feature of the program is that the twdtw algorithm employs a logistic weight function as a time constraint which governs the way in which nodes align the logistic weight permits more flexibility with temporal patterns that may vary in length e g crop cycles that range from 90 to 120 days maus et al 2016a and therefore allows the hypothesized synchrony of the perpetuated bamboo dominance cycle to be tested if the bamboo dieback events are out of phase then this algorithm will yield higher accuracies in classifying regions of bamboo dominated forest than the hybrid model the logistic weight function is as follows 2 ω 1 1 e a g t 1 t 2 β where α is steepness g is the absolute difference in days between t 1 t 2 and β is the midpoint maus et al 2016b to use twdtw as a method to classify different forest types a set of time series samples qc u1 u2 uq where u u1 un is a sample of a time series pattern and c is class is then used to classify vx y v1 v2 vm which is a time series of pixel locations x y all the satellite spatial coverage are then combined into a set of time series s v1 v2 vs each qc is compared to each vx y and the local cost is measured the cost or twdtw distance between qc and vx y will determine the classification of vx y maus et al 2016a 2 4 1 time weighted dynamic time warping parameters the 32 year smoothed landsat time series stack required further processing to improve the program s performance using changepoints of the four broad successional phases as vertices linear models were imposed on the 32 year smoothed landsat time series stack rendering annual modelled values for each pixel in the study area fig 5 this was done in an attempt to further reduce year to year noise as the original smoothed time series did not yield acceptable results training point data were manually selected to create sample spectral temporal patterns for the three prominent landcover types of the study area araucaria predominance degraded forest and bamboo dominated forest the same 28 training points used to develop the hybrid model were used to generate the sample spectral temporal patterns for bamboo dominated forest with an additional 14 araucaria predominance and 34 degraded forest training points selected based on the approximate proportion of forest types within the ersc to create sample patterns maus et al 2016a tested a range of time delays to determine β as a parameter for the twdtw equation for this study the program was found to produce the most accurate outputs when the parameters were set to α 0 01 and β 1 which enables minimal time warping but still serves as a necessary constraint to maintain the temporal structure both 32 year 1984 2015 and 16 year time series 2000 2015 were evaluated a 16 year time period was chosen over the 15 year time period as samples taken in the same time intervals improve model performance the twdtw classifier was run three times table 2 both the 32 year and 16 year time series were run separately to determine which time series yielded superior results for both each time series was treated as a singular temporal pattern e g 1984 2015 2000 2015 an additional classification was performed to identify whether the 16 year temporal pattern could successfully classify regions of bamboo dominance when applied to the 32 year time series stack which yields two classified maps from the time periods of 1984 to 1999 and 2000 to 2015 2 5 maximum likelihood classification to compare efficacy of both the hybrid model and twdtw algorithm as classification methods a maximum likelihood classification was employed on four satellite images representative of each of the four lifecycle phases 2000 pioneer predominance 2004 mature bamboo 2008 dieback 2015 pioneer regeneration these four time periods were selected to provide snapshots of the progression of bamboo dominated forest succession with each date being the last date of the four phase s time intervals maximum likelihood is one of the most prominent classification algorithms used in remote sensing the algorithm uses probability densities of user defined classes to predict the inclusion of a pixel in each class category strahler 1980 based on multivariate normality each pixel is assigned to the class that maximizes the probability when class probability densities overlap the classification of the pixel is determined by which probability density s centre it is closest to strahler 1980 the same training samples used for both the hybrid model and the twdtw classification were used for the maximum likelihood classification 2 6 validation to determine the initial accuracy of the hybrid model boxplots were created for six relevant time periods which included the 32 year time series 1984 2015 15 year time series 2001 2015 and each of the four lifecycle phases using the extracted bias and rmse values from the field sample reference data to demonstrate response variability of other forest types to the hybrid model both araucaria predominance and degraded forest were included as variables for the boxplots as the purpose of this study is to identify regions of bamboo dominated forest to assess the accuracy of the hybrid model twdtw model and maximum likelihood classification output maps both araucaria predominance and degraded forest field samples were combined and designated as secondary forest creating a presence absence output of bamboo dominated regions overall agreement and the allocation and quantity disagreement were calculated using a method developed by pontius and millones 2011 the underlying assumption of this method is that both reference data and classification output data are a perfect match as opposed to kappa coefficient which assumes randomness between both datasets this method mathematically converts sample error matrices into estimated unbiased population matrices a step which is often overlooked when performing an accuracy assessment pontius and millones 2011 quantity disagreement refers to the less than perfect match in the proportions of classes e g secondary forest and bamboo dominated forest between reference data and classification output data allocation disagreement refers to the omission and commission of pixels between classes e g secondary forest and bamboo dominated forest of reference data and classification output data total disagreement is calculated by summing quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement and overall agreement is derived from subtracting total disagreement from 100 3 results 3 1 characterization of bamboo dominated forest succession based on the modelled segments distinct phases of bamboo dominated forest succession can be observed which include senescence disturbance and subsequent regeneration between 1984 2000 the time series has a negative slope showing gradual decrease in evi values with a rapid decrease occurring between 1984 and 1988 and a more gradual decrease between 1989 and 2000 the two segments are thought to 1 represent the die off of m scabrella populations and 2 the subsequent emergence of v discolor into the canopy alongside the remaining senescent m scabrella population resulting in a gradual decrease in evi values until 2000 in 2001 a positive slope indicates an increase in evi values which is thought to be the emergence of mature bamboo into the canopy as a result of gap formation from treefall of senescent m scabrella and v discolor populations in 2005 there is a sharp drop in evi values with a corresponding negative slope which characterizes a dieback event subsequently slope becomes positive and a spike in evi values occur indicating pioneer regeneration based on these spectral temporal trajectories bamboo dominated forest succession can be characterized into four broad phases which include pioneer predominance mature bamboo bamboo dieback and pioneer regeneration fig 6 table 3 however it is important to note that between 2007 and 2008 in the dieback phase 2005 2008 there is a positive slope which indicates regeneration therefore the actual dieback and detection of senescent bamboo biomass occurs between 2005 2007 with 2007 2008 being the first year of regeneration 3 2 hybrid model performance all boxplots generated for the six time periods indicated that bamboo dominated forest consistently had median values closest to zero compared to both araucaria predominance and degraded forest for both bias and rmse outputs and generally exhibited a value spread with strong central tendency in all cases bamboo dominated forest had the smallest value range and spread between the first and third quartile the value spread of the bias boxplots indicate that the hybrid model consistently overpredicts which is shown by negative median values for all time periods and a value range that is predominantly negative values with exception to dieback fig 7 the 15 year time period had the smallest and most unbiased first to third quartile spread pioneer predominance and mature bamboo had the first and second largest value range between the first and third quartile respectively comparing bamboo dominated forest value spread to the other two forest types it is noted that generally only the fourth quartile group of araucaria predominance overlaps with the range of bamboo dominated forest whereas consistently the third quartile group of degraded forest aligns with the second quartile group of bamboo dominated forest the rmse boxplots show that the six time periods share similar median values fig 8 the 15 year hybrid model dieback and the 32 year time series have the smallest first to third quartile range respectively and do not overlap with both araucaria predominance and degraded forest mature bamboo has the largest first to third quartile spread with the third quartile group overlapping the most with the second quartile group of the degraded forest both pioneer predominance and pioneer regeneration have similar first to third quartile value ranges but it can be observed that pioneer predominance overlaps with degraded forest similarly to mature bamboo whereas pioneer regeneration has less overlap with the second quartile group with the resulting z scores from the local getis ord gi unique threshold values were selected for each of the six hybrid model outputs based on visual assessment of z score frequency histograms table 4 as rmse serves as a measure of model fit the resulting z scores are indicative of model performance suggesting that regions of rmse values closest to zero would be representative of bamboo dominance therefore the resulting spatial clustering demonstrates the hybrid model s distance from being able to perfectly predict regions of bamboo dominance an accuracy assessment was performed for the six getis ord gi maps fig 9 table 5 the 15 year hybrid model achieved the highest overall agreement of 90 the dieback phase had the second highest overall agreement which was 87 and both the 32 year hybrid model and pioneer regeneration had an overall agreement of 85 pioneer predominance and mature bamboo had the lowest accuracies receiving an overall agreement of 82 and 77 respectively 3 3 time weighted dynamic time warping performance the accuracy assessment revealed that the 16 year time series was more effective at identifying regions of bamboo dominated forest than the 32 year time series fig 10 table 6 model run 1 32 year time series yielded an overall agreement of 77 while model run 2 16 year time series achieved an overall agreement of 82 the two outputs from model run 3 yielded very different results the time period from 1984 to 1999 pioneer predominance yielded and overall agreement of 68 whereas the following time period 2000 2015 yielded an accuracy of 80 3 4 maximum likelihood classification performance it was found that the maximum likelihood classification was most successful at classifying the 2008 image dieback garnering an overall accuracy of 84 both the 2000 pioneer predominance and 2015 pioneer regeneration images achieved a fairly accurate overall agreement of 79 fig 11 table 7 comparatively the 2004 image classification received a lower overall accuracy of 75 3 5 comparison of classification performances overall the hybrid model consistently outperformed the twdtw and maximum likelihood classifiers with the twdtw model achieving the lowest overall accuracies of the three classifiers generally the three classifiers consistently produced outputs which possessed two specific configurations which affected the estimated area occupied by bamboo the two models which had the highest accuracies had an estimated area of approximately 170 ha and maintained a similar configuration the other model outputs shared a similar configuration in which two large areas of degraded forest were consistently misclassified as bamboo dominated forest resulting in an estimated total area ranging from 226 to 300 ha 4 discussion 4 1 hybrid model development and in situ observations the hybrid modelling approach was derived from kennedy et al 2010 which developed an unsupervised temporal segmentation algorithm that aimed to characterize historical landcover dynamics the approach has been used successfully to map an array of change events including insect infestation meigs et al 2011 mining activities yang et al 2018 and forest cover change in floodplains fragal et al 2016 and the segmentation workflow is considered a key component to processing landsat time series and developing change metrics hermosilla et al 2015 these metrics provide valuable information regarding change events which include change year magnitude persistence and rate hermosilla et al 2015 this research employs a similar approach which involves time series segmentation and trajectory fitting but varies in that it also incorporates seven years of regeneration data and a priori ecological knowledge to create a single semi empirical spatially explicit ecological process model to characterize the entire lifecycle of a pervasive bamboo species found throughout the araucaria forest and examine population synchrony within the ersc the hybrid model was developed and validated by 1 comparing changepoints to locally known successional dynamics and empirical evidence and 2 performing a trajectory analysis by using changepoints as vertices to fit linear models to segments of the time series first following the changepoint analysis regeneration data collected in the ersc from 2007 to 2014 were compared to the identified changepoints which occurred in 2009 and 2012 based on the dataset it was found that from 2007 to 2009 dense seedling populations of m scabrella established and quickly developed into homogeneous juvenile tree populations with re colonization of bamboo occurring in the understorey lacerda and kellermann 2017 from 2009 to 2011 a self thinning process occurred which significantly reduced m scabrella populations and enabled the development of the secondary succession species v discolor finally from 2012 to 2014 a vigorous m scabrella adult population emerged into the canopy which was determined by sampled trees transitioning from a juvenile tree class to an adult tree class lacerda and kellermann 2017 based on the agreement between the changepoint analysis and the regeneration data a trajectory analysis was performed to determine bamboo dominated forest succession phases for the entire 32 year time series forest succession phases from 1984 to 2000 were verified based on the trajectory analysis as well as a priori knowledge of pioneer population dynamics the negative slope and the changepoint identified in 1989 coincided with the expected die off of the m scabrella population and the subsequent persistent negative slope and changepoint identified in 2001 coincided with the expected gradual decline in v discolor populations the trajectories associated with dieback and regeneration were also reflective of the regeneration data dieback had a distinct drop in evi values resulting from the detection of the senescent bamboo population and pioneer regeneration had an increase in evi values resulting from the formation of a homogeneous juvenile canopy the process to develop the hybrid model was rigorous and involved long term datasets and in depth knowledge of local pioneer population dynamics therefore it is thought that the hybrid model is an accurate depiction of bamboo dominated forest succession based on its ability to capture and classify the four phases of bamboo dominated forest succession and map them as discrete events additionally based on the overall agreement of 85 for the 32 year hybrid model the model validates the observed ecological processes that are causing arrested forest succession and confirms that the phenomenon is synchronous and occurring throughout the ersc the hybrid model also provides some qualitative information regarding canopy characteristics and pioneer population dynamics based on the overall agreement of the hybrid model outputs for each phase pioneer regeneration achieved an overall accuracy of 85 which suggests that canopy characteristics are homogeneous during this phase with a distinct spectral response the pioneer predominance and mature bamboo phases had the lowest overall agreement of 82 and 77 respectively indicating that these two phases possess heterogeneous canopies composed of senescent pioneer populations and mature bamboo during pioneer predominance the canopy is composed mainly of senescent m scabrella and v discolor with the canopy of the mature bamboo phase being increasingly composed of bamboos as gaps are formed due to senescent pioneer treefall spectral mixing is thought to be the result of non uniform aging and dying of pioneer populations and subsequent emergence of mature bamboo into the canopy resulting in patches of decreased and increased evi values across the study area additionally other species specifically the pioneer sapium glandulatum vell pax and early successional ocotea puberula rich nees also develop in these young forests although in much lower abundances which also results in spectral mixing inconsistency causing year to year noise 4 2 hybrid model performance the aim of this work was to develop a singular model which describes local bamboo ecological processes causing arrested succession as observed in the ersc by lacerda and kellermann 2017 and suspected as a main driver of ecological change across the atlantic forest our approach is therefore to first detect and quantify the system s spectral temporal characteristics at a local scale and then deploy the model across larger more heterogeneous regions of the atlantic forest the model here reports a detailed study of local spectral temporal processes in ersc before commenting on future work to scale the model up the hybrid model developed here represents an idealized synchronized ecological lifecycle as identified in our field campaigns in the ersc it is important to acknowledge that throughout the ersc bamboo populations are found in the understorey of canopies of varying density for example bamboo populations arresting forest succession have been found in regions of araucaria predominance but went undetected by passive satellite imagery due to the closed canopy however it has been observed that the most abundant bamboo populations are associated with regions of the ersc which have historically undergone intensive timber extraction resulting in a sparse open canopy sparse canopy typically consisting of mature v discolor the hybrid model was therefore developed to describe forest succession of regions within the ersc considered most impacted by bamboo and thus aiming to identify regions in a perpetuated bamboo dominance cycle the 32 year hybrid model had an overall agreement of 85 indicating that the observed in situ bamboo ecological processes are synchronous throughout the ersc and coincide with historical anthropogenic disturbances the overall agreement of 90 for the 15 year hybrid model which encapsulates the phases of mature bamboo dieback and pioneer regeneration demonstrates the efficacy of the 15 year hybrid model to detect bamboo dominated regions it is thought that the 15 year hybrid model outperformed the 32 year hybrid model due to the spectral mixing which occurs from 1984 to 2000 because of asynchronous die off of pioneer populations present in the canopy additionally the 15 year hybrid model encapsulates the dieback event which is characterized by an abrupt drop in index values which is easily distinguishable from other spectral temporal signals thus reducing error associated with year to year noise when each of the three phases was individually used to classify regions of bamboo dominated forest overall agreement for each phase was lower than the 15 year hybrid model which demonstrates the importance of including long term temporal information regarding a system s processes as supplementary information when performing landcover classification wulder et al 2018 for the pioneer predominance mature bamboo and pioneer regeneration hybrid models certain portions of the study area representative of degraded forest were consistently misclassified which was also observed by an increase in total estimated area of almost 100 ha misclassification of bamboo dominated regions could be caused by spectral mixing similarity between bamboo dominated forest and degraded forest the rmse boxplots of the three phases show that there is considerable overlap between bamboo dominated forest and degraded forest indicating that both forest types share similar values which could be the reason for the consistent misclassification similar to the three previously mentioned hybrid models the canopy of degraded forest is heterogeneous in nature possessing a wide variation in structure and diversity the 32 year spectral temporal patterns of the regions prone to misclassification were extracted and the evi values for each phase were examined it was found that patterns generally consisted of high evi values and were fairly stable with some year to year noise however these high evi values are characteristic of pioneer spectral response therefore it is thought that misclassification resulting from the pioneer predominance mature bamboo and pioneer regeneration hybrid models is occurring due to the lack of temporal information provided by the dieback event therefore it is evident that the dieback response which is captured in the 15 year hybrid model provides important temporal information which has been found to improve model performance 4 3 comparison of model performances the hybrid model is novel in that it employs the spectral and temporal properties of a landsat time series stack and incorporates spatial information of neighbouring pixels by using a getis ord gi statistical analysis to classify regions of bamboo dominated forest the inclusion of the gi statistic was an important step from an ecological standpoint as spectral mixing resulting from the presence of mature v discolor in the canopy impacted the spectral temporal signal causing contaminated pixels to be assigned a higher rmse value without the use of the gi statistic these contaminated pixels may have been excluded from the classification spatial dependency is inherent in forested landscapes based on tree assemblages which possess unique spectral responses and spatial pattern research has shown that the gi statistic can serve as important ancillary data that introduces fuzzy boundaries which more closely emulates the natural transition of landcover types than the discrete boundaries introduced in pixel based classifications wulder and boots 1998 previous use of gi statistic on landsat imagery has been restricted to singular images wulder and boots 1998 2001 ghimire et al 2010 and to the best of our knowledge has not been used on metrics derived from landsat time series for purposes of classification by comparing the results of the hybrid model with the twdtw model it is evident that the inclusion of spatial information with a classifier that employs pixel based spectral temporal signatures has the potential to substantially improve classification accuracy the twdtw model yielded lower overall agreement than the hybrid model model run 2 16 year temporal pattern applied to a 16 year time series achieved an accuracy of 82 and model run 3 16 year temporal pattern applied to a 32 year time series had an accuracy of 80 compared to 85 accuracy for the 32 year hybrid model and 90 accuracy for the 15 year hybrid model both the hybrid model and the twdtw outputs yielded similar classification configurations but it can be noted that there is much more noise associated with the twdtw classification whereas the hybrid model outputs have a much cleaner classification of cohesive segments with fuzzier boundaries which is a result of the gi statistic in a remote sensing context the getis ord gi statistic analysis acts as a moving filter by considering pixel values of the local neighbourhood of a focus pixel which assists with reducing misclassification caused by noisy data wulder and boots 1998 as landsat time series often possess year to year noise resulting from contaminated pixels or spectral mixing due to spatial resolution rmse values calculated for the hybrid model may be imprecise therefore by calculating a gi statistic neighbourhood information will include or exclude certain pixels based on their adjacency to other pixels of a similar rmse value it is thought that the use of the gi statistic could act as an important tool to reduce information loss resulting from edge effects an example of edge effects can be observed when examining the twdtw classification the classification consists of many patches which does not necessarily reflect the transition between presence absence of bamboo as often low density bamboo populations will exist on the periphery of regions highly populated with bamboo however there are inherent trade offs and loss of information when using a filtering process for classification it can be argued that by performing a getis ord gi statistical analysis sub pixel bamboo populations may be omitted from the classification araujo et al 2008 although this information is important for forecasting regions at risk of bamboo infestation for the scope of this study our focus is centered on identifying relatively large regions within the ersc in a state of arrested forest succession additionally the gi statistic assumes normal distribution of the dataset under observation therefore using this statistical approach may not be appropriate for non parametric datasets however it has been suggested that if a minimum of 8 pixels are used to compute the gi statistic the resulting distribution of gi values will be normal griffin et al 1996 wulder and boots 1998 based on the existing spatial pattern of the ersc it was thought that data were normally distributed therefore using a gi statistic was an acceptable approach for this study the importance of including temporal information is highlighted when the hybrid model is compared to the maximum likelihood classifications both the 2000 and 2004 maximum likelihood classifications which represent the last year of each of the bamboo dominated forest succession phases obtained lower accuracies 79 for pioneer predominance and 75 for mature bamboo than the hybrid model 82 for pioneer predominance and 77 for mature bamboo and possess substantial noise in comparison to the hybrid model outputs as previously discussed both these phases of bamboo dominated forest succession are known to have pioneer populations present in the canopy therefore these two phases are likely to share a similar spectral response to other regions of degraded forest by incorporating multi year imagery it is evident that the noise introduced by the maximum likelihood classification is substantially reduced and the classification configuration of bamboo dominated regions more closely resembles that of the existing spatial pattern found within the ersc although the maximum likelihood classifier acquired reasonable overall accuracies the use of snapshot classifiers gives limited insight into the history of forest development with complete access to the landsat archives use of multi temporal imagery to derive temporal metrics has now become an integral component of landcover classification wulder et al 2018 the use of temporal metrics provides important information on landcover change and ecological succession and are now readily used as ancillary datasets for model inputs wulder et al 2018 use of multi temporal imagery was particularly important when examining the lifecycle dynamics of m skvortzovii as this species of bamboo occupies the forest understorey for the majority of its lifecycle making it very challenging to detect during the pioneer predominance and pioneer regeneration phases therefore by extracting spectral temporal signatures from multi temporal imagery it is possible to determine whether bamboo exists in the understorey based on the temporal progression of the pixel under investigation this is an example of the importance of using multi temporal imagery and based on current technologies it is thought that metrics derived from time series is a necessary step in the process of performing landcover classification wulder et al 2018 4 4 mapping bamboo in the araucaria forest based on the validation process involved in developing the hybrid model it is thought that metrics derived from the hybrid model will function as a valuable model input for current mapping efforts being developed to monitor brazilian forests batista da luz et al 2015 state wide records of synchronized monocarpic dieback events of m skvortzovii from 1843 to 1876 1877 1909 1910 1938 1940 1973 1975 pereira 1941 sendulsky 1995 2003 2006 liebsch and reginato 2009 kellermann 2011 and a recent santa catarina state forest inventory vibrans et al 2013 indicate that m skvortzovii populations are present throughout the araucaria forest based on this information it is thought that the hybrid model will serve as valuable ancillary data which can be incorporated into classification models in this study z scores resulting from a getis ord gi statistical analysis were used as thresholds which can be used to map bamboo in various regions throughout the araucaria forest the getis ord gi statistic calculates the z score for each pixel within the study area which indicates the degree of autocorrelation of a neighbourhood of pixels surrounding a given pixel and the magnitude of these values relative to the entire dataset wulder and boots 1998 a z score is considered statistically significant if it is 1 65 or 1 65 p value less than 0 1 for this analysis we found that p values less than 0 05 all accurately defined regions of bamboo dominated forest succession based on visual examination of z score histograms and knowledge of existing bamboo population distribution within the ersc as previously mentioned normal distribution of a dataset is assumed when using a gi statistic therefore the use of the statistic on non parametric datasets may be considered inappropriate alternatively if non parametric datasets are being used a threshold can be employed to define regions of bamboo populations based on the boxplot quartile rmse values extracted from the study area it is advised that the median rmse 0 06 or upper quartile rmse 0 07 be used as a threshold currently bamboo dominated forest is not included as a forest class in brazilian forest classifications and more specifically within araucaria forest classifications a recent classification workflow developed by brazilian national forest inventory nfi br employs a hybrid approach which integrates pixel based multi data and object oriented analysis to perform state wide classifications batista da luz et al 2015 it is thought that the incorporation of pixel based rmse metrics derived from hybrid modelling into current forest classification methods would 1 improve forest classification by distinguishing between forest and bamboo dominated forest and 2 provide valuable information regarding the health status of remaining forest fragments based on their composition of bamboo populations 4 5 bamboo as a biological invasion and hybrid modelling although bamboo ecological processes described by the hybrid model are unique to m skvortzovii many bamboo species have been found to impact forest succession in a similar way lifecycle length varies amongst bamboo species but all populations terminate with a monocarpic dieback event of mass seeding dieback events are comparable to a large scale disturbance opening the canopy and releasing resources such as light availability soil nutrients and space required for tree recruitment taylor and qin 1992 abe et al 2002 taylor 2004 rother et al 2009 studies have shown that although seedling recruitment may be improved immediately following dieback events the aggressive regeneration strategies of certain bamboo species results in arrested succession by means of resource competition and mechanical damage gratzer et al 1999 abe et al 2002 griscom 2002 narukawa and yamamoto 2002 griscom and ashton 2006 lacerda and kellermann 2017 these ecological processes coincide with a forest succession mechanism model referred to as the inhibition model connell and slatyer 1977 this model designates that forest succession has the potential to be governed by early colonists by means of securing space and resources which subsequently inhibits the growth and or replacement of later successional species lacerda and kellermann 2017 observed this process and determined that bamboo populations were able to recover following a dieback event despite the subsequent development of a dense tree canopy dominated by pioneer species by homogeneously occupying the understorey and emerging into the canopy as pioneer populations died off bamboo ecological processes are light driven and as a result of human induced forest fragmentation change in the understorey light climate caused by canopy structure alteration and increased edge has left remaining forest fragments vulnerable to bamboo invasion with ongoing forest fragmentation baccini et al 2017 and the widespread presence of bamboo throughout tropical and sub tropical forests scurlock et al 2000 it is important to understand how bamboo ecological processes are being driven by anthropogenic disturbances and simultaneously contributing to forest degradation most previous analyses of bamboo ecological processes have been restricted to in situ sampling which often only examine a portion of bamboo lifecycle abe et al 2002 liebsch and reginato 2009 budke et al 2010 however the use of spectral temporal modelling presents the opportunity to undertake long term landscape scale spatial temporal analyses of the ecological processes of various bamboo species for this reason it is thought that developing spectral temporal models which describe bamboo ecological processes is an important and viable approach to monitoring and mapping populations throughout tropical and sub tropical forests the hybrid model was developed using a simple workflow for ease of reproducibility and produced an easily interpretable metric i e rmse previous studies have been performed which use landsat time series to depict and characterize the lifecycle of other native invasive bamboos guadua weberbaueri and guadua sarcocarpa found in the amazon forest but relied on manual photo interpretation and visual assessment to describe phases of bamboo dominated forest succession not taking advantage of spectral temporal properties de carvalho et al 2013 nelson and bianchini 2005 it was determined that the presence of guadua weberbaueri and guadua sarcocarpa was arresting forest succession as a result of intensive mechanical damage to juvenile trees and that both bamboo species had three broad lifecycle phases live mature cohort dead post flowering cohort and juvenile cohort confined to the understory griscom and ashton 2006 de carvalho et al 2013 although important information was generated from this research it is thought that developing a hybrid model would enhance information regarding lifecycle phases such as phase persistence and specific start and end dates of each phase additionally using the hybrid model to map regions of bamboo would be much more efficient it is hoped that this research will demonstrate the utility of spectral temporal modelling to both analyze bamboo lifecycle dynamics and map bamboo populations at a landscape scale 5 conclusion in this paper we identified the spectral temporal signature of bamboo dominated forest succession identified four broad lifecycle phases of bamboo and developed a hybrid model to examine bamboo ecological processes at a landscape scale the hybrid model validated that in situ observed ecological processes arresting forest succession were synchronous and occurring throughout the ersc additionally the hybrid model proved to be an effective tool for mapping bamboo populations and it is thought that metrics derived from the hybrid model can be incorporated into current forest classification methods being used to map brazilian forests the hybrid model was compared to both a twdtw model and a maximum likelihood classifier and was found to outperform both models consistently which is thought to be the result of the hybrid model incorporating multi temporal imagery and spatial information from the gi statistic the hybrid model has the potential to detect m skvortzovii in other fragments of araucaria forest which would provide valuable information regarding the health status of the remaining araucaria forest fragments and emphasize the need for silvicultural intervention in regions impacted by bamboo future research could use these methods to perform a state wide detection of m skvortzovii in the remaining araucaria forest fragments for which it is recommended that the 15 year hybrid model 2001 to 2015 is used it is hoped that knowledge gained from this research will assist in evaluating the state of bamboo dominated forests throughout the remaining araucaria forest enabling improved management and conservation efforts additionally it is thought that the methodologies applied in this study have the potential to be used in other bamboo dominated forest ecosystems to extrapolate information regarding the ecological processes of other bamboo species and their impact

fruits and seeds have the following characteristics a the fruit is a legume a dry dehiscent fruit with a sheath that opens in two valves size 7 12 3 6 mm b the seed contains a large embryo with or without endosperm c the seeds are ejected violently with an explosion to open the leaflets of the legume this phenomenon is because the shells are dried and tend to be wound helically about themselves along the lines of dehiscence this opening phenomenon occurs in moments of heat pulses and spreads the seeds around the fruiting period takes place during the months of december to february may at the latest 6 leaf characteristics it is a glabrescent shrub with leaves reduced to small scales at the base of the spines less than 1 mm diameter green ash simple and small leaves 7 most common method of pollination the most common method of pollination is insect pollination the study of pollination of ulex parviflorus corroborates other studies which also states that the optimal pollination period occurs during the day between 08 00 and 18 00 so the time available for pollination of any flower can be as much as 10 h a day for up to eight days but is more effective for 4 days richards 1986 the flowering of this species is early and there is a very large decrease in competitiveness with other species and consequent effectiveness in seed formation when pollinated by bees 8 method seed dispersion by studying the dispersion of the seeds of ulex parviflorus it is found that the structure of the fruit is intimately related to the way it spreads that is making an explosive dehiscence autochory the seeds of ulex parviflorus are violently expelled from their fruits explosive dehiscence then falling to the ground by gravity the seeds of ulex benefit then from two processes of dispersion one primary and another secondary by the ants the prominence of the ant and their density in the local ecology may condition the appearance of new plants of ulex 9 phytosociological associations gorse lives in thermomediterranean and mesomediterranean floors gorse appears in degraded areas of the garrigue which leads to the appearance of kermes oak with mastic querco lentiscetum and rosemary rosmarino ericion in which the rosemary rosmarinus officinalis heather erica multiflora the crown friar globularia alypum gorse ulex parviflorus and albada anthyllis cytisoides are the most common species 2 2 importance of this species as pyrophite ulex parviflorus is considered a very flammable species during the summer since it conserves its dry elements in branches stems etc the caloric power energy that can be released in a combustion of ulex parviflorus would be found in a mid point along with cistus lavandula quercus stipa thymus etc it is a species that presents a great amount of necromass accumulated at the plant s foot in advanced stages of maturity the proportion of necromass may exceed 50 of the total biomass the distribution of the necromass in height also poses many problems since in these conditions the height reached by the flames in the fire is much greater it is a forced germinating species which is never regenerated by regrowth only under mild pruning conditions can the biomass levels be restored after the passage of fire a high germination rate can be observed that at three months after the fire can be of 60 seedlings per m2 decreasing to an average of 7 3 individuals per m2 17 years later a mass of the gorse land is easily installed in the area occupied by other crops abandoned after the fire in these conditions the other species have been removed for the installation of the next crop after the passage of the fire ulex parviflorus does not find any type of competition and displaces the rest of germinators except for the arboreal ones like in the case of pines in mature pine forests with higher levels of shade the growth of ulex parviflorus are very poor and with lower seed yields however after the fire the seeds that germinate produce vigorous individuals that will form a high density of gorse plants the seed banks studied show that there are no differences in the seed banks of two formations with different stages of development the number of seeds per square meter is 319 s m2 in the 3 year old brood and 324 s m2 in 9 year old plants the fact of having an equal number of seeds in juvenile formations which had not yet flowered compared to mature formations in which there have been several blooms indicates that ulex parviflorus presents a permanent bank of seeds in the soil which is not exhausted at the first germination after the disturbance in the case of ulex europaeus l the seeds may remain latent and viable in the soil for a period of at least 30 years due to the presence of a hard waterproof cover preliminary evidence indicates that seed production in the 5 to 7 year old formations is much higher than in the more mature ones this greater production will contribute to increase the seed banks stabilizing when the production reaches the stage of maturity therefore control treatments of the gorse in intermediate ages before the maximum seed production could contribute to reduce the seed bank and the regenerative capacity of the species the low percentage of changes observed in plant remains dropped from ulex parviflorus together with the low input of fresh organic matter suggests that the decomposition and humidification of the soil material on the soil surface is not the main process involved in the recycling of nutrients which are stored in the biomass of the shrub in studies carried out in mediterranean shrublands frequently subjected to fire this is proven to be an important factor in nutrient restitution since the rapid mineralization of large amounts of organic matter as a result of a fire increases the productivity of ecosystems up to a certain level of mineral elements 3 the study area the plot studied are located within the province of castellón comunidad valenciana spain fig 2 the experimentation plot is in the desert de les palmes monte bartolo fig 3 this plot is 100 m2 and selected so that the number of plants around ulex parviflorus was the smallest possible in order to achieve better sampling and reduce interference all specimens present inside the plot were placed on a plane table 1 4 methodology 4 1 theory of point process a point process is a stochastic model that governs the locations of events si in a certain set x we speak of marked point process if each location is added associated measures or marks generally x can be any locally compact hausdorff space whose topology has an accounting basis cressie 1985 examples of specific processes shrubs of a forest cities in a geographic region or epicenters of earthquakes the corresponding marks could be respectively biomass population or magnitude of the earthquakes we assume that the locations of events si and their corresponding marks z si are an embodiment of a stochastic process of the form z s s d where z and d are random the theoretical definition of an unmarked point process is as follows let x χ ν be a measurable space with ν x and μ be a poisson process in x with intensity measure λ we are interested in those processes that have densities with respect to μ let x n x x x n factors be the set of collections of n not necessarily distinct elements of x let x 0 ϕ be further if n k then x n and x k they are disjointed let x e be the disjoint union of all finite cartesian products x n 1 x e n 0 x n each set b x e can be expressed in a unique way as the union of disjoint sets that is b n 0 b n where b n b x n let χ n be the smallest algebra σ in x n that contains all the product sets b 1 b 2 b n such that b i χ i 1 n let χ e be the class of all sets n 0 b n in x e such that b n χ n n 0 1 so χ e is the lowest algebra σ of the sets in χ e generated by the sets b n definition 1 the pair x e χ e is called exponential space carter and prenter 1972 let ν n be the product of the n th variety of ν over x n for n 1 and let λ 0 be the measure on x 0 that gives probability one to the point ϕ then μ defined by 2 μ b n 0 ν n b x n n b χ e is a measure of probability in x e χ e an element s x n represents a pattern of n points in x the element ϕ x 0 will represent a pattern without points on the other hand a marked point process is defined in the following terms let ω λ ρ be a space of measurement such that ρ ω let ω x f be with x x ℜ d and f ℜ λ χ ξ where χ is the σ borel algebra of x and ξ is a borel set of f finally ρ ν π where ν is a finite measure in x usually the lebesgue measure and π is a measure in f corresponding to the distribution of the marks let μ be the poisson measure marked with intensity ρ the exponential space will be denoted by ω e with its corresponding σ algebra λ e both marked and unmarked processes can be defined by random measurements in the following we assume that we have a marked process taking into account that in the unmarked case it suffices not to consider the elements associated with the marks let φ be a counting measure in x f then φ a b is the number of events in a with marks belonging to b where a χ and b ξ let ω λ p be a probability space and φ a collection of finite counting measures in x f we define φ n as the smallest σ algebra generated by sets of the form ϕ φ ϕ a b n a χ b ξ and n 0 1 2 definition 2 a point process marked n is a point process in x f that is a measurable function ω λ p in φ n a marked on time process defined on ω λ p induces a probability measure n y p n y y n this will be the distribution of a marked point process in this work a marked point process will be denoted by 3 n s z s s 1 z s 1 s 2 z s 2 s n z s n and the corresponding unmarked punctual process will be denoted by n 0 two important concepts in the theory of point processes are those of stationarity and isotropy definition 3 we say that a marked point process is stationary if its distribution is invariant against translations that is if the number of points lying depends on the size of s but not its location t that is n and ns s t z s t have the same distribution for all t in x definition 4 we say that a marked point process is isotropic if its distribution is invariant versus rotations that is n and nr rs z rs have the same distribution for any rotation r with respect to the origin definition 5 if the process is both stationary and isotropic we say that it is invariant against movements and in this case the transferred process will have the same distribution as that of the original process for any euclidean movement of the points the point process theory offers several characteristics for the quantitative description of the interaction between individuals eg trees in a forest one of them is the pair correlation function which is in some way analogous to the correlation function of a stochastic process it characterizes the variability of the spatial system the correlation between the marks is described by the mark correlation function this function characterizes the relationships between the marks of different locations conditioning the distances between the points these two functions pair correlation and mark correlation are important because they can solve at least three problems of interest in for example the field of forest statistics 1 for the exploratory analysis of the interaction between trees e g type of interaction determination of range of interaction and estimation of their influence 2 to model and simulate forest behaviors 3 to determine the reliability of estimators of global characteristics such as density or basal area 4 2 statistical analysis of growth curves growth is a fundamental property of biological systems which takes place at the level of individual populations animals and plants and in general in living organisms unfortunately most of these growth processes cannot be measured continuously so it is preferable to model the measurements by mathematical functions this gives us the opportunity to interpolate at uncalculated intervals moreover a uniformity of the measured values can be produced and random errors can be eliminated at least in part they can also be calculated characteristics of the growth curve such as growth rate and turning points finally a compression of the information can be obtained since the whole process can be described with a few parameters growth curves consist of repetitions of observations of a given continuous variable over a period of time in the case of the present study the height and maximum diameter of the plant are measured for different individuals of ulex parviflorus pourret located on a surface of 10 m2 it is assumed that repeated measures of a continuous response variable are observed over a given period of time for each of the m individuals let y i y i 1 y i n i be the vector of ni measures performed on the i th individual and let t i t i 1 t i n i be the corresponding vector of temporary measures the set of temporal measures in the study is represented as t 1 t 2 t m time measurements may be different and may vary from one individual to another if measures of time are common to all individuals i e if t 1 t 2 t m then the set of measures is said to be rectangular and then denote the common number of measures performed a covariance vector x ij associated with y ij may also be used the covariance may have some dependence on time may be totally independent or may even be the case that there is a mixture of the two previous cases if we are in the case of independence between covariances and time we can write x i x ij in this model three assumptions are taken into account a the independence of the answers between the different individuals b the normal distribution of responses c the lack of data loss or at most that the lost answers are negligible with these three assumptions the general model is written as 4 y i n μ i σ i i 1 2 m independent where μ i is a vector n i 1 with the j th element μ t i j x i j and σ i is a positive matrix n i n i defined by the elements j k th σ t i j t i k x i j x i k being μ and σ functions with real values with this structure the modeling of growth curves essentially requires the choice of a function for the mean μ and a function for covariance σ these functions can be parametric or non parametric accordingly the function for the mean can be written as μ t x β and the function of covariance as σ t u x ω θ where β is a p vector and θ is a q vector of unknown parameters the gompertz curve is a particular case of the generalized logistic curve in the case that the parameter t is very small or very large i e when t approaches zero or infinity bowers et al 1997 the general equation for the gompertz curve is as follows 5 y a c e e b x m where y is the height or diameter corresponding to the individual ulex and the variable x is the time expressed in weeks as can be seen a gompertz curve is defined as a function of parameters a c b and m parameter a controls the lower asymptote parameter c controls the upper asymptote parameter b regulates the growth factor or rate and finally the parameter m controls the time of maximum growth the upper asymptote is given by the sum of the parameters a and c statgraphics estimates the values of parameters a c b and m from the initial values provided in some cases the program does not optimize the parameters and gives very wide confidence intervals in these cases new initial values are given to the parameters and finally the program converges and gives the optimized values there are also individuals for whom one of the parameters cannot be optimized such as the height of the ulex 14 or the diameters of the ulex 3 15 and 16 after obtaining the values of the parameters the empirical growth curve real curves obtained from the experimental measurements and the curve obtained by the mathematical model are plotted together it is observed that for the heights the modelled curves faithfully reproduce the experimental curves in the case of diameters the situation is very different because there is not so much agreement between the graphs once the parameters that characterize the gompertz curves have been obtained we proceed to find out if the parameters are significantly equal among the different individuals for this the confidence intervals for the parameters a c b m for the 21 ulex parviflorus plants are represented in an excel graph and are taken to be statistically equal meaning not different in the case that the confidence interval of a ulex parviflorus is included within the confidence interval of another ulex parviflorus thus it is observed that for the parameters b and m there exists a large number of ulex parviflorus plants with these parameters being statistically equal this fact can be seen more clearly in the comparative tables where it is observed that for the parameters b and m of the heights the tables show a great number of equalities when the parameters are statistically equal for two ulex plants is indicated with a quotation x 4 2 1 the growth curve of the heights then the empirical growth curve of the heights real curves obtained from the experimental measurements and the curve obtained by the mathematical model are plotted together the x axis shows the experimentation time in weeks and in the y axis the heights in centimetres blue colour is the height obtained and pink colour the calculated height they have been made for the 21 specimens of ulex ulex 1 to 4 are shown as example represented for fig s1 to s4 see the supplementary material the gompertz curve is defined as a function of parameters a c b and m parameter a fig s5 controls the lower asymptote parameter c fig s6 controls the upper asymptote parameter b fig s7 regulates the growth factor or speed and finally the parameter m fig s8 controls the time of maximum growth once the parameters that characterize the gompertz curves have been obtained we proceed to find out if the parameters are significantly equal among the different individuals for this the confidence intervals for the parameters a c b m for the 21 ulex plants are plotted in a graph and are said to be statistically equal in the case that the confidence interval of ulex is included within the confidence interval of another ulex 4 2 2 the growth curve of the diameters joint representation of the empirical growth curve of the diameters actual curves obtained from the experimental measurements and the curve obtained by the mathematical model the x axis shows the experimental time in weeks and in the y axis the diameters in centimetres blue color the obtained diameter and pink colour the calculated diameter they have been made for the 21 specimens of ulex parviflorus ulex 1 to 4 are represented as example represented from fig s9 to s12 see the supplementary material the gompertz curve is defined as a function of parameters a c b and m parameter a fig s13 controls the lower bound parameter c fig s14 controls the upper asymptote parameter b fig s15 regulates the growth factor or speed and finally the parameter m fig s16 controls the time of maximum growth confidence intervals for these parameters are in the supplementary material we proceed to look for if the parameters are significantly equal for the diameters as we have done previously for the case of heights 5 results and discussion fig 4 represents a kernel estimate of the intensity function number of elements per unit area of the point pattern given by the positions of the 21 ulex parviflorus in the quadrangular region of 100 square meters figs 5 and 6 represent certain features of functions that depend on certain types of distances under the hypothesis of randomness poisson process both functions have certain specific forms and are represented in both figures it is observed that the empirical functions associated with the positions of the 21 ulex parviflorus of the theoretical ones do not differ much which would indicate a certain randomness in the spatial structure of the ulex parviflorus however this hypothesis is rejected when evaluating the function of ripley or k function which represents a second order characteristic that is it analyzes the interdependence structure between the locations fig 7 shows the empirical k function calculated on the data of the ulex parviflorus the theoretical under the poisson assumption and the sheaths that play the role of confidence intervals on the value of the k function under spatial randomness in this sense this figure is more representative than the previous ones because we can directly accept or reject this hypothesis observing this figure we can conclude that the spatial pattern of the ulex parviflorus is not random and is governed by some biological mechanism that provides a structure of inhibition at small distances between 1 and 2 m combining a certain aggregation structure at distances between 3 and 4 m this is corroborated in fig 8 by representing empirical pcf pair correlation function and theoretical under randomness if the pattern of the ulex parviflorus was random its pcf should be around 1 without significant variations with respect to the shape of the pcf under poisson however pcf shows a significant negative peak around 1 5 m indicative of inhibition repulsion between ulex parviflorus and another positive peak around 3 3 m indicative of an aggregation or cluster structure 6 conclusions the spatial pattern of the ulex parviflorus is not random but is governed by some biological mechanism that provides a structure of inhibition at small distances between 1 and 2 m combining a certain aggregation structure at distances between 3 and 4 m if the ulex parviflorus pattern was random its pcf should be around 1 without significant variations with respect to the shape of the pcf under poisson however the pcf shows a significant negative peak around 1 5 m indicative of inhibition repulsion between the ulex parviflorus and another positive peak around 3 3 m indicative of an aggregation or cluster structure it is observed that for the heights the modelled curves faithfully reproduce the experimental curves in the case of diameters the situation is very different because there is not so much agreement between the graphs taking into account that the spatial pattern of the ulex parviflorus is not random but is governed by some biological mechanism that provides a structure of inhibition at small distances between 1 and 2 m combining a certain aggregation structure at distances between 3 and 4 m the seeds of ulex parviflorus undergo two processes of dispersion one primary and the other secondary by ants the position of the anthills and their density could condition the appearance of new plants of ulex parviflorus the evaluation of the species ulex parviflorus table 2 with respect to the different factors studied is as follows the work methodology that has been followed gives results in the actual casuistry and can be used in other species similar to the one studied taking this study to the dominant species of this ecosystem could be made a macro predictive of the ecosystem in question and interrelate them between them the application of these models of predictive character allows to relate the interventionist management in the ecosystem in this sense we can know how to manage the populations of ulex parviflorus to minimize the negative impact it exerts as a pyrophite in the ecosystem that is we can know if at any given time the populations must be respected or controlled all

of the mediterranean region the ulex parviflorus pourret is a pyrophite species and is the first colonizer in post fire stages of ecological regeneration fig 1 the study of their behavior can provide important conclusions that can have a significant impact on sound management of the territory both before the fire prevention and after it regeneration these plants are very important for 1 holding the soil and preventing erosion 2 they are excellent nitrogen fixers 3 they provide seed banks at very shallow depths 4 the fundamental role of the species ulex parviflorus pourret is manifested in its close relationship with forest fires and together with the pinus halepensis is the most important pyrophite species of the mediterranean forest baeza et al 2006 de luis et al 2004 dimitrakopoulos

gradually dies out as it progresses into the country and stops feeling the influence of wind from the sea it is indifferent to the nature of the substrate soil but vegetates best in soils rich in bases and like most of perennials of the family prefers deep soils 2 habitat the ulex parviflorus pourret is a nanophanerophyte plant it lives at an altitude of 0 1250 meters 3 soil types it is a

class of all sets n 0 b n in x e such that b n χ n n 0 1 so χ e is the lowest algebra σ of the sets in χ e generated by the sets b n definition 1 the pair x e χ e is called exponential space carter and prenter 1972 let ν n be the product of the n th variety of ν over x n for n 1 and let λ 0 be the measure on x 0 that gives probability one to the point ϕ then μ defined by 2 μ b n 0 ν n b x n n b χ e is a measure of probability in x e χ e an element s x n represents a pattern of n points in x the element ϕ x 0 will represent a pattern without points on the other hand a marked point process is defined in the following terms let ω λ ρ be a space of measurement such that ρ ω let ω x f be with x x ℜ d and f ℜ λ χ ξ where χ is the σ borel algebra of x and ξ is a borel set of f finally ρ ν π where ν is a finite measure in x usually the lebesgue measure and π is a measure in f corresponding to the distribution of the marks let μ be the poisson measure marked with intensity ρ the exponential space will be denoted by ω e with its corresponding σ algebra λ e both marked and unmarked processes can be defined by random measurements in the following we assume that we have a marked process taking into account that in the unmarked case it suffices not to consider the elements associated with the marks let φ be a counting measure in x f then φ a b is the number of events in a with marks belonging to b where a χ and b ξ let ω λ p be a probability space and φ a collection of finite counting measures in x f we define φ n as the smallest σ algebra generated by sets of the form ϕ φ ϕ a b n a χ b ξ and n 0 1 2 definition 2 a point process marked n is a point process in x f that is a measurable function ω λ p in φ n a marked on time process defined on ω λ p induces a probability measure n y p n y y n this will be the distribution of a marked point process in this work a marked point process will be denoted by 3 n s z s s 1 z s 1 s 2 z s 2 s n z s n and the corresponding unmarked punctual process will be denoted by n 0 two important concepts in the theory of point processes are those of stationarity and isotropy definition 3 we say that a marked point process is stationary if its distribution is invariant against translations that is if the number of points lying depends on the size of s but not its location t that is n and ns s t z s t have the same distribution for all t in x definition 4 we say that a marked point process is isotropic if its distribution is invariant versus rotations that is n and nr rs z rs have the same distribution for any rotation r with respect to the origin definition 5 if the process is both stationary and isotropic we say that it is invariant against movements and in this case the transferred process will have the same distribution as that of the original process for any euclidean movement of the points the point process theory offers several characteristics for the quantitative description of the interaction between individuals eg trees in a forest one of them is the pair correlation function which is in some way analogous to the correlation function of a stochastic process it characterizes the variability of the spatial system the correlation between the marks is described by the mark correlation function this function characterizes the relationships between the marks of different locations conditioning the distances between the points these two functions pair correlation and mark correlation are important because they can solve at least three problems of interest in for example the field of forest statistics 1 for the exploratory analysis of the interaction between trees e g type of interaction determination of range of interaction and estimation of their influence 2 to model and simulate forest behaviors 3 to determine the reliability of estimators of global characteristics such as density or basal area 4 2 statistical analysis of growth curves growth is a fundamental property of biological systems which takes place at the level of individual populations animals and plants and in general in living organisms unfortunately most of these growth processes cannot be measured continuously so it is preferable to model the measurements by mathematical functions this gives us the opportunity to interpolate at uncalculated intervals moreover a uniformity of the measured values can be produced and random errors can be eliminated at least in part they can also be calculated characteristics of the growth curve such as growth rate and turning points finally a compression of the information can be obtained since the whole process can be described with a few parameters growth curves consist of repetitions of observations of a given continuous variable over a period of time in the case of the present study the height and maximum diameter of the plant are measured for different individuals of ulex parviflorus pourret located on a surface of 10 m2 it is assumed that repeated measures of a continuous response variable are observed over a given period of time for each of the m individuals let y i y i 1 y i n i be the vector of ni measures performed on the i th individual and let t i t i 1 t i n i be the corresponding vector of temporary measures the set of temporal measures in the study is represented as t 1 t 2 t m time measurements may be different and may vary from one individual to another if measures of time are common to all individuals i e if t 1 t 2 t m then the set of measures is said to be rectangular and then denote the common number of measures performed a covariance vector x ij associated with y ij may also be used the covariance may have some dependence on time may be totally independent or may even be the case that there is a mixture of the two previous cases if we are in the case of independence between covariances and time we can write x i x ij in this model three assumptions are taken into account a the independence of the answers between the different individuals b the normal distribution of responses c the lack of data loss or at most that the lost answers are negligible with these three assumptions the general model is written as 4 y i n μ i σ i i 1 2 m independent where μ i is a vector n i 1 with the j th element μ t i j x i j and σ i is a positive matrix n i n i defined by the elements j k th σ t i j t i k x i j x i k being μ and σ functions with real values with this structure the modeling of growth curves essentially requires the choice of a function for the mean μ and a function for covariance σ these functions can be parametric or non parametric accordingly the function for the mean can be written as μ t x β and the function of covariance as σ t u x ω θ where β is a p vector and θ is a q vector of unknown parameters the gompertz curve is a particular case of the generalized logistic curve in the case that the parameter t is very small or very large i e when t approaches zero or infinity bowers et al 1997 the general equation for the gompertz curve is as follows 5 y a c e e b x m where y is the height or diameter corresponding to the individual ulex and the variable x is the time expressed in weeks as can be seen a gompertz curve is defined as a function of parameters a c b and m parameter a controls the lower asymptote parameter c controls the upper asymptote parameter b regulates the growth factor or rate and finally the parameter m controls the time of maximum growth the upper asymptote is given by the sum of the parameters a and c statgraphics estimates the values of parameters a c b and m from the initial values provided in some cases the program does not optimize the parameters and gives very wide confidence intervals in these cases new initial values are given to the parameters and finally the program converges and gives the optimized values there are also individuals for whom one of the parameters cannot be optimized such as the height of the ulex 14 or the diameters of the ulex 3 15 and 16 after obtaining the values of the parameters the empirical growth curve real curves obtained from the experimental measurements and the curve obtained by the mathematical model are plotted together it is observed that for the heights the modelled curves faithfully reproduce the experimental curves in the case of diameters the situation is very different because there is not so much agreement between the graphs once the parameters that characterize the gompertz curves have been obtained we proceed to find out if the parameters are significantly equal among the different individuals for this the confidence intervals for the parameters a c b m for the 21 ulex parviflorus plants are represented in an excel graph and are taken to be statistically equal meaning not different in the case that the confidence interval of a ulex parviflorus is included within the confidence interval of another ulex parviflorus thus it is observed that for the parameters b and m there exists a large number of ulex parviflorus plants with these parameters being statistically equal this fact can be seen more clearly in the comparative tables where it is observed that for the parameters b and m of the heights the tables show a great number of equalities when the parameters are statistically equal for two ulex plants is indicated with a quotation x 4 2 1 the growth curve of the heights then the empirical growth curve of the heights real curves obtained from the experimental measurements and the curve obtained by the mathematical model are plotted together the x axis shows the experimentation time in weeks and in the y axis the heights in centimetres blue colour is the height obtained and pink colour the calculated height they have been made for the 21 specimens of ulex ulex 1 to 4 are shown as example represented for fig s1 to s4 see the supplementary material the gompertz curve is defined as a function of parameters a c b and m parameter a fig s5 controls the lower asymptote parameter c fig s6 controls the upper asymptote parameter b fig s7 regulates the growth factor or speed and finally the parameter m fig s8 controls the time of maximum growth once the parameters that characterize the gompertz curves have been obtained we proceed to find out if the parameters are significantly equal among the different individuals for this the confidence intervals for the parameters a c b m for the 21 ulex plants are plotted in a graph and are said to be statistically equal in the case that the confidence interval of ulex is included within the confidence interval of another ulex 4 2 2 the growth curve of the diameters joint representation of the empirical growth curve of the diameters actual curves obtained from the experimental measurements and the curve obtained by the mathematical model the x axis shows the experimental time in weeks and in the y axis the diameters in centimetres blue color the obtained diameter and pink colour the calculated diameter they have been made for the 21 specimens of ulex parviflorus ulex 1 to 4 are represented as example represented from fig s9 to s12 see the supplementary material the gompertz curve is defined as a function of parameters a c b and m parameter a fig s13 controls the lower bound parameter c fig s14 controls the upper asymptote parameter b fig s15 regulates the growth factor or speed and finally the parameter m fig s16 controls the time of maximum growth confidence intervals for these parameters are in the supplementary material we proceed to look for if the parameters are significantly equal for the diameters as we have done previously for the case of heights 5 results and discussion fig 4 represents a kernel estimate of the intensity function number of elements per unit area of the point pattern given by the positions of the 21 ulex parviflorus in the quadrangular region of 100 square meters figs 5 and 6 represent certain features of functions that depend on certain types of distances under the hypothesis of randomness poisson process both functions have certain specific forms and are represented in both figures it is observed that the empirical functions associated with the positions of the 21 ulex parviflorus of the theoretical ones do not differ much which would indicate a certain randomness in the spatial structure of the ulex parviflorus however this hypothesis is rejected when evaluating the function of ripley or k function which represents a second order characteristic that is it analyzes the interdependence structure between the locations fig 7 shows the empirical k function calculated on the data of the ulex parviflorus the theoretical under the poisson assumption and the sheaths that play the role of confidence intervals on the value of the k function under spatial randomness in this sense this figure is more representative than the previous ones because we can directly accept or reject this hypothesis observing this figure we can conclude that the spatial pattern of the ulex parviflorus is not random and is governed by some biological mechanism that provides a structure of inhibition at small distances between 1 and 2 m combining a certain aggregation structure at distances between 3 and 4 m this is corroborated in fig 8 by representing empirical pcf pair correlation function and theoretical under randomness if the pattern of the ulex parviflorus was random its pcf should be around 1 without significant variations with respect to the shape of the pcf under poisson however pcf shows a significant negative peak around 1 5 m indicative of inhibition repulsion between ulex parviflorus and another positive peak around 3 3 m indicative of an aggregation or cluster structure 6 conclusions the spatial pattern of the ulex parviflorus is not random but is governed by some biological mechanism that provides a structure of inhibition at small distances between 1 and 2 m combining a certain aggregation structure at distances between 3 and 4 m if the ulex parviflorus pattern was random its pcf should be around 1 without significant variations with respect to the shape of the pcf under poisson however the pcf shows a significant negative peak around 1 5 m indicative of inhibition repulsion between the ulex parviflorus and another positive peak around 3 3 m indicative of an aggregation or cluster structure it is observed that for the heights the modelled curves faithfully reproduce the experimental curves in the case of diameters the situation is very different because there is not so much agreement between the graphs taking into account that the spatial pattern of the ulex parviflorus is not random but is governed by some biological mechanism that provides a structure of inhibition at small distances between 1 and 2 m combining a certain aggregation structure at distances between 3 and 4 m the seeds of ulex parviflorus undergo two processes of dispersion one primary and the other secondary by ants the position of the anthills and their density could condition the appearance of new plants of ulex parviflorus the evaluation of the species ulex parviflorus table 2 with respect to the different factors studied is as follows the work methodology that has been followed gives results in the actual casuistry and can be used in other species similar to the one studied taking this study to the dominant species of this ecosystem could be made a macro predictive of the ecosystem in question and interrelate them between them the application of these models of predictive character allows to relate the interventionist management in the ecosystem in this sense we can know how to manage the populations of ulex parviflorus to minimize the negative impact it exerts as a pyrophite in the ecosystem that is we can know if at any given time the populations must be respected or controlled all

25258,in this review article we trace the history of events leading to the development of individual based models ibms to represent aquatic organisms in rivers and streams as a metaphor we present this history as a series of confluences between individual scientists tributaries sharing ideas we describe contributions of these models to science and management one iconic feature of river ibms is the linkage between flow and the physical habitat experienced by individual animals and the first model that focused on this linkage is briefly described we continue by reviewing the contributions of riverine ibms to eight broad areas of scientific inquiry the first four areas include research to understand 1 the effects of flow regimes on fish populations 2 species interactions e g size mediated competition and predation 3 fish movement and habitat selection and 4 contaminant and water quality impacts on populations next we review research using ibms 5 to guide conservation biology of imperiled taxa through population viability analysis including research 6 to understand river fragmentation by dams and reconnection 7 to understand genetic outcomes for riverine metapopulations and 8 to anticipate the future effects of temperature and climate change this rich body of literature has contributed to both theoretical insights e g about animal behavior and life history and applied insights e g population level effects of flow regimes temperature and the effects of hydropower and other industries that share rivers with aquatic biota we finish by exploring promising branches that lie ahead in the braided downstream channel that represents future river modeling research keywords individual based model agent based model dendritic river network hydropower ecosystem robotics population level 1 individual confluences passing streams of memes ideas in science rarely emerge intact rather the conditions leading to new ideas or memes spring up in different places and follow independent paths that then converge merge and spread this was true for individual based modeling ibm and later the development of ibms for biota in rivers and streams ideas flowing out of tributaries carried advances in computer science theoretical ecology e g optimal foraging theory forest gap modeling and physical modeling of dynamic stream habitat these ideas co mingled to generate a diverse braided complex of downstream channels that continues to bring new insights fig 1 these downstream channels are different in size a large productive instream modeling community of users is an important example in addition the initial electric power research institute epri models fed into genetic ibms ibm g and other variants and these have been used to address a wide variety of basic and applied scientific questions the use of individual based modeling in ecology as depicted in fig 1 emerged initially at the confluence between silvicultural problems one tributary branch and technological progress another tributary in the early 1970 s the technological advance was the increasing power of computers while the motivating problems involved how to optimize planted forests e g what trees to plant and how to space them shugart et al 2018 shugart and woodward 2011 computational power allowed yale ecologist daniel botkin botkin et al 1972 to model a forest in the way that he thought it really worked mechanistically working with james wallis and james janak of ibm s thomas j watson research center botkin simulated the growth of individual trees of different species as accurately as possible given their basic traits and local soil and climate conditions and then let trees from different species interact on a small plot through mutual competition for light this general type of model was termed an individual based model or coincidentally ibm jabowa was called a gap phase replacement model because the spatial area simulated was about the size of a gap left by the death of a large canopy tree botkin et al 1972 jabowa predicted the successional dynamics of tree communities in a new hampshire forest so well that forest ecologists such as bormann and likens 1979 used it to derive their ideas about biomass accumulation in aggrading forests hank shugart and darrell west then research ecologists at oak ridge national laboratory soon developed a version of a gap phase replacement ibm named foret shugart and west 1977 and other models followed as reviewed by bugmann 2001 by now scores of different forest simulation platforms with a high degree of detail and sophistication exist and are applied world wide two factors made fish the next candidate for extensive application of individual based modeling the first factor is that individual size is an important characteristic for piscivorous fish as it was for trees as gape limited predators size influences the foraging success of fish and their ability to escape predation by other fishes individual differences in size within a cohort could therefore influence the dynamics of that cohort deangelis et al 1980 demonstrated this for young of the year largemouth bass micropterus salmoides in an aquarium depending on the initial size distribution varying degrees of cannibalism could occur within the cohort leading to a final number of surviving fish after a couple of months the ibm which followed every fish in the cohort through time was able to predict the outcomes of two successive aquarium experiments surprisingly well the second factor favoring development of ibms for fish was the need to understand the effects of mortality of fish though entrainment and impingement by nuclear power plant cooling systems fig 1 a key question was to what extent compensatory mechanisms in the fish populations could mitigate the loss of perhaps billions of eggs larval and other early life stage fish at high densities few offspring of such species survive to adulthood due to density dependent mortality the loss of some fish by non natural factors such as power plants increases resources available to others the argument made by some scientists was that increased mortality of juveniles imposed by anthropogenic sources had little net effect on recruitment to the adult stage mcfadden 1977 to understand and quantify how such compensatory mechanisms work in fish populations the epri funded a 10 year project compensatory mechanisms in young of the year fish at oak ridge national laboratory ornl which already had a long history of studying the effects of power plants on fish barnthouse et al 1984 boreman et al 1981 coutant 1971 the project led by dr webster van winkle and stimulated by the success of ibm forest simulations by colleagues at ornl used the ibm approach to understand growth and risk of mortality of young of year yoy fish of species impacted by nuclear power plants at universities across north america phd students funded by epri developed such models in the process training a generation of fish ecologists in modeling following the wisconsin school of fish modeling the bioenergetics of each fish was modeled in these ibms and large numbers of young of year fish were simulated along with food resources and predation to estimate the effects of power plants and other mortality factors early papers were published by deangelis et al 1990 madenjian et al 1991 and deangelis et al 1991 for fish in lakes deangelis et al 1993 predicted patterns of recruitment vs egg density and the transition from density dependent to density independent mortality in yoy fish that agreed well with empirical patterns scheffer et al 1995 introduced the key ibm modeling technique of super individuals to efficiently simulate huge numbers of yoy most of which die in the first year of life applications of ibms to fishes were reviewed by van winkle et al 1993 and more recently by sibly et al 2013 the growth in ibms during the late 1980s in all areas of ecology and across taxa stimulated both a review paper of individual based modeling huston et al 1988 and a workshop at the university of tennessee in 1990 published as a proceedings deangelis and gross 1992 editors in a subsequent review deangelis and mooij 2005 counted over 900 manuscripts using ibms over 100 of which were applied to fish though these numbers were surely underestimates the monograph of grimm and railsback 2005 advanced the theoretical foundations for individual based modeling modeling of individual activities was influenced by bioenergetics modeling e g the wisconsin school for fishes mostly centered on lake fishes optimal foraging theory and theories related to habitat selection and movement fig 1 these component sub models used to represent individual activities formed the backbone of ibms other early papers described ibms of riverine populations petersen and deangelis 1992 simulated northern pike fish formerly squawfish esox lucius predation on juvenile salmon addressing the question of how schooling of downstream swimming smolts reduced predation risk in a columbia river reservoir and rose and cowan 1993 simulated striped bass in the potomac river arguably river ibms differ from those applied to organisms in other ecosystems because the dynamic and directional changes in river habitat are such an important influence on species life histories thus the ability to simulate population level responses to flow as an outcome of individual behaviors is a defining characteristic and development of river ibms depended on the convergence of two tributary ideas one tributary carried the biological ibm and the other carried the instream flow incremental methodology or ifim orth and maughan 1982 used to establish minimum flows for fishes below dams in the u s the ifim has two components 1 physical habitat modeling for the variables depth velocity and substrate and 2 representation of species preferences for these three habitat variables bovee 1982 thomas and bovee 1993 because preference curves are not flow invariant and do not necessarily reflect a species habitat requirements over time well the ifim generated controversy from its inception mathur et al 1985 railsback 2016 in the confluence of the 1980s dr michael sale a recently hired environmental engineer brought his experience with ifim models to oak ridge where he recognized the potential for applying ibms in river ecosystems the confluence of ideas among theoretical modelers environmental engineers and aquatic ecologists in east tennessee spawned many applications of ifim models using ibms to study riverine fishes these tools have produced numerous insights not just in understanding flow responses by fishes and reducing uncertainty in instream flow standards van winkle et al 1997 but also in understanding biological processes below we will highlight aspects specific to lotic habitats over the years individual or agent based modeling has evolved deangelis and grimm 2014 for example computation times were reduced through the use of various cloning methods for representing meta individuals rose et al 1993 an attractive feature of ibms as mechanistic process based models is the ability to validate by parts and to compare against intermediate outputs new techniques were adopted for model data comparison one is to compare patterns produced by the model against those observed e g the use of pattern oriented model evaluation grimm and railsback 2012 grimm et al 2005 which is similar to functional validation jager et al 2000 the pattern oriented approach can be used to select among alternative model structures that differ in complexity a protocol for documenting ibms was developed grimm et al 2010 in addition significant advances have been made in developing new methods for incorporating historical data and producing a distribution of model outcomes from a likelihood weighted joint distribution of input parameters e g approximate bayesian computational methods piou et al 2009 developments specific to riverine ibms include alternative approaches to representing dynamic stream habitat hydrodynamics stream temperature and water quality simulation of animal movement in a directional flow environment and models that use network theory as a basis for representing dendritic riverine metapopulations these advances are described in the sections below in this paper we trace the ideas leading to modeling of river fish populations using ibms we highlight some of the key contributions ibms have made to understanding aquatic populations in river habitat and we suggest future opportunities for new discoveries 2 headwaters of riverine ibms one of the first ibms applied to riverine populations in the early 1990 s sought to understand the effects of regulated flow regimes on fish in the north anna river virginia usa this early model focused on smallmouth bass m dolomieu was published in the journal rivers that is no longer in existence jager et al 1993 see supplemental information this model evolved from a version developed by deangelis et al 1991 for lakes fig 1 the lake model simulated gape limited optimal foraging on a spectrum of invertebrate e g zooplankton prey ontogenetic size based shifts in optimal diet smallmouth bass bioenergetics as well as nesting and reproduction to represent fish in a river environment other processes became important to include representation of physical habitat linking time series of flow and temperature to 2 dimensional fields of depth and velocity and the responses of each biological process to those fields is depicted in fig 2 and described below 2 1 physical habitat flow is such an important driver of habitat for fishes and other river biota that much more attention to dynamic simulation of habitat was required this was achieved by coupling hydraulic simulation portion of the physical habitat simulation system phabsim directly with an individual based model for nesting reproduction and yoy dynamics fig 2 to represent hydrodynamics the data requirements were significantly higher than those of previous ibms phabsim relies on measurements of depth and velocity along fixed transects at different flows as well as substrate and cover a representative stream reach was partitioned into spatial cells containing measurement stations from a phabsim survey of the reach the model required daily predictions of average depth and velocity for each grid cell in the representative reach as a function of daily average flow fig 2 in later models changes in velocity with depth and presence of cover were represented as well van winkle et al 1998 water temperature was also simulated influencing fish growth and development 2 2 movement the smallmouth bass ibm uses departure rules to simulate fish movement jager and tyler 2001 each individual fish s growth over time is tracked in a time for space substitution movement is initiated when growth falls below the fish s long term expectation 2 3 foraging foraging differs substantially in flowing rivers compared with lentic habitats regeneration of prey is affected by flow and by the local habitat s carrying capacity setting an upper limit on standing biomass larger invertebrate prey items and crayfish are simulated because these can be important in streams especially for larger bass the model was able to reproduce fish growth in the north anna river 2 4 mortality mortality factors in rivers and streams differ from those in lakes because of the risk of being swept away by high flows or dewatered during non mobile life stages i e eggs and larvae during nesting one insight produced from this river ibm is a recognition that non mobile life stages are the most vulnerable when examining responses to disturbance regimes 2 5 reproduction reproduction and early development are affected by different abiotic effects in rivers than in lakes nesting and guarding of nests by males is represented in both the lake and versions of the model however to understand nesting success in dynamic rivers it is important not only to simulate disturbance of nests by flow extremes e g floods or dewatering but also to provide the opportunity for renesting if disturbance is early in the season the authors compared simulated reproductive success and first year growth with field observations from the north anna river in virginia the timing of nesting was well simulated based on water temperature see supplemental information and renesting occurred on three occasions in 2 year simulations in summary this first ibm linking river habitat dynamics to fish populations explored previously unappreciated facets of riverine fish responses and adaptation to flow but more importantly it laid the groundwork for subsequent modeling efforts to evaluate the influence of alternative flow regimes as the authors continued to deploy river ibms with the next applications focused on trout van winkle et al 1998 and chinook salmon jager et al 1997 as well as numerous others reviewed below 3 how have river ibms contributed to ecology since the early models described above river ibms have fanned out to address a varied set of questions illustrated by the braided channel in fig 1 yielding different kinds of insights spatially explicit ibms are well suited for many questions involving aquatic populations in river habitats for several reasons first as noted by anderson et al 2013b properties that emerge from transient non equilibrium dynamics are particularly important in disturbance dominated ecosystems like rivers strange et al 1993 second risks are dependent on attributes of individuals in addition to size dependent predation risk in regulated rivers entrainment and survival of turbine passage both depend on fish size hij conducted a web of science search of individual based model in the title and river or stream which found 54 publications with an average of 25 citations per publication when individual based was not required to be in the title and extraneous topics were excluded just under 200 papers were identified between 1992 and 2018 and these produced an average of 36 2 citations per item the number of publications increased near linearly over time many of these publications were produced by a few individuals dr steve railsback with coauthor dr brett harvey authored 8 2 and 7 1 of papers based on the instream model other authors represented many countries with more than half from the usa roughly 10 each from england canada and france followed by germany the netherlands china japan and norway and twelve other countries papers were published in the journal ecological modeling 16 fisheries journals 28 and general ecology and conservation journals 16 especially plos one and ecological applications with the remaining journals represented by fewer than two papers each two studies were published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa processes in rivers as in most ecosystems span multiple scales anderson et al 2005 likewise riverine ibms with different purposes fall along a range of scales from a focus on spatial questions related to fish responses to flow and temperature mediated variation in habitat lower left in fig 3 to questions related to metapopulation dynamics in river networks upper right in fig 3 the specific questions which river ibms have been used to address fig 4 have evolved over time but at least one general purpose e g understanding the effects of river regulation has remained an active area of research throughout one significant shift in emphasis has been from models to manage stream habitat for fisheries to population viability analysis pva models designed to guide recovery of rare species of high conservation concern below we briefly discuss four categories of ibm studies focused on single tailwaters or reaches in which higher spatial resolution is used bottom left in fig 3 and four categories of ibm modeling studies involving long term projections of meta populations over broader spatial scales upper right portion of fig 3 these studies relate to the questions depicted in fig 4 3 1 research to understand the effects of flow regimes on fish populations understanding how flow regimes influence fishes is a fundamental area of river research has been and continues to be explored by ibms fig 4a from an early emphasis on determining how much flow a river needs through setting minimum flow standards to the more recent emphasis on flow variability a mechanistic understanding of the linkages between flow regimes is needed and spatially explicit ibms provide this capability some of the more recent research is described in section 3 3 under research to understand habitat selection and movement the purpose of early river ibms was to improve the fish preference curves used in ifim although ifim is typically used in a regulatory context to set minimum flows ibms made it possible to address questions about flow regimes for example optimization flow releases from reservoirs was used to benefit downstream fishes such as chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha jager and rose 2003 a key finding has been that thermal effects tend to have more biological importance than those of flow alone jager et al 1997 tyler and rutherford 2007 xu et al 2010 in addition ibms have enabled researchers to evaluate the mechanisms behind ecological riverflow i e properties of flow regimes including variation in flows that benefit tailwater fish populations tyler and rutherford 2007 as well as ways in which natural flows can be improved on for example one non ibm study found that timing of releases earlier in spring than the natural snow melt pulse produced floodplain inundation that allowed juvenile salmon to grow faster and exit the system before river temperatures became dangerously warm jager 2014 thus an unnatural flow regime performed better than the way that the river was historically regulated which usually produced suboptimal flows for fishes moving from an initial focus on setting minimum flow regulations river managers now also focus on understanding elements of flow regimes that have high ecological value and these are often the seasonal pulse flows for example produced by snowmelt to which native species are adapted in temperate rivers in regulated rivers flow augmentation ensures that high flows are available to downstream biota when needed these pulse flows may facilitate migration and improve temperatures below dams for example cold augmentation flows from dworshak reservoir are an important part of a strategy to facilitate salmon and steelhead migration through the hydrosystem of the lower columbia river in spring augmentation may also be needed to provide flow in cases of extreme dewatering in a more arid climate pine et al 2017 used a population viability analysis pva ibm model to evaluate the potential benefits of augmenting flows to two federally listed fish species in a new mexico usa stream another important research area for regulated rivers is to understand trade offs between operating in peaking or load following mode whereby flows are released when electricity demand and value is high rapid fluctuations in flow can have adverse effects on biota and these can be modeled by ibms that simulate influences on bioenergetics and on non mobile life stages for example an ibm of the green river below flaming gorge dam predicted the effects of flow fluctuations on nursery habitats of the colorado pikeminnow ptychocheilus lucius grand et al 2006 3 2 research to understand species interactions ibms can be used effectively to study species interactions fig 4b for example the spread of invasive aquatic species is a significant threat to native species worldwide and one associated with human activity leprieur et al 2008 stream ibms can be used to understand biologically mediated invasion dynamics for example topological properties of river networks and the spatial distribution of larval habitat within them controlled the spread of sea lamprey neeson et al 2012 the use of an ibm is particularly important when individual characteristics influence the outcome of individual interactions for example representing individual size differences among fishes was an early emphasis because it highlighted the role of size based gape limited predation rice et al 1993 size was also the focus of the first application of an ibm to fish stocking as resource managers became aware that releasing fish at a larger size could enhance survival madenjian et al 1991 in situations when spatial resources can be defended e g drift feeding territories high quality spawning habitat size based competition for space occurs this has been represented in models for salmonids similarly competition for mates and female fecundity are functions of size or condition van winkle et al 1998 the need to grow beyond a certain size prior to a stressful period e g winter and the population resilience created by contest competition van noordwijk and de jong 1986 and compensatory density dependent mortality were two insights gained through individual based modeling deangelis et al 1993 in rivers the first application with a focus on size mediated effects simulated predation on migrating salmon smolts petersen and deangelis 1992 2000 these size based algorithms were later incorporated into models of bass predation on salmon juveniles in rivers particularly deep pools jager et al 1997 the interaction between warming rivers and predation by warm water fishes on cold water salmonids remains an important concern for species listed under the endangered species act in rivers of the western us trophic dynamics in rivers have been represented by ibms anderson et al 2012 giacomini et al 2009 railsback and harvey 2013 robson et al 2017 simulating predation required some changes when applied to species in flowing rivers in lentic habitats modelers typically assume that the geometry defined by the reaction distance of the fish and its speed define a cylindrical volume of pelagic prey or a truncated volume of benthic prey available to foraging fishes in rivers a strategy of sit and wait drift feeding becomes possible fausch 2014 therefore at low and high velocities individuals are predicted to adopt a search strategy whereas at intermediate velocities profitability of a drift feeding strategy is higher van winkle et al 1998 another consideration is the relationship between flow and turbidity for visual feeding fishes increased turbidity can lead to reduced feeding and subsequent starvation harvey and railsback 2009 3 3 research to understand fish movement and habitat selection one of the most important reasons for adopting an individual based approach is the need to represent movement at a relatively fine resolution i e multiple reaches or patches within reaches versus a few different habitats understanding animal behavior fig 6c including movement and habitat selection has been studied by postulating and testing movement rules rohlf and davenport 1969 and this was greatly facilitated by using ibms this research was initially influenced by the wealth of literature in ecology on optimal foraging theory and decision rules for switching prey and habitat departure economic concepts such as the marginal value theorem were used in deciding when model organisms should leave a patch when searching for food or other resource rashleigh and grossman 2005 tyler and brandt 2001 early stream ibms partitioned the day into resting and foraging portions based on reaching a maximum daily ration within daylight hours van winkle et al 1998 an individual s departure from a patch was simulated to occur when its expectation of a higher ratio of growth to predation risk or product of growth and survival exceeded the value in the current stream cell jager et al 1993 railsback and harvey 2002 van winkle et al 1998 later models have identified situations in which the distribution of individuals does not reflect the fitness landscape as is expected under an ideal free distribution produced by departure rules that optimize fitness railsback et al 2003 the limited perceptual ability of individuals to sense conditions beyond their current location is one factor that can negatively influence the ability of a population to produce a distribution that tracks the fitness landscape jager and tyler 2001 pe er and kramer schadt 2008 railsback et al 1999 2001 understanding movement is not merely a theoretical exercise the use of spatially explicit ibms can help resource managers by providing more sophisticated movement algorithms to understand how management decisions influence fish populations railsback 2016 in one example simulation of flow responses by two carp species in china suggested relatively little effect of regulation but did suggest improved timing of reservoir water releases during spring li et al 2010 understanding the effects of dams on downstream migration by juvenile salmon has been a strong area of applied research in the columbia river basin where a large proportion of us hydropower is generated computational fluid dynamics has been used to understand juvenile salmonid movements through passage facilities gao et al 2016 romero gomez and richmond 2014 weber et al 2006 typically a combined eulerian lagrangian agent elam approach i e fish trajectories modeled through a fixed gridded physical habitat representation of a river is employed goodwin et al 2006 a hypothesis to explain the navigation of juvenile salmonids downstream through surface collectors and other devices at dams was the strain velocity pressure hypothesis whereby juveniles are assumed to minimize total hydraulic strain nestler et al 2008 this hypothesis has since been supplanted as water acceleration alone appears to do a better job of predicting the movements of salmon the resulting models simulate the ability of salmon to navigate safely through passage routes at large dams by modulating their swimming orientation and speed to water acceleration goodwin et al 2014 the elam model differs from earlier phabsim models in that fish are simulated on a dynamic habitat represented by high resolution computational fluid dynamics models weber et al 2006 the approaches above make sense for animals that can control their movements however for some species and life stages movement is passive and determined by flow fields fonseca 1999 used an ibm to examine the consequences of movement rules related to drift of blackfly larvae in a fluid medium and was able to reproduce spatial patterns of settling in depositional zones in fragmented rivers downstream drift of larvae was found to be an important effect on upstream population persistence thus the most vulnerable life stages are those that are incapable of directed movement whether because they are sessile eggs mussels or because they lack apparatus for swimming well one situation where ibms suggest that passive drift can be important is in coastal rivers where salinity can play a role in movement and survival of early life stages that are not yet salt water tolerant jager et al 2013a rose et al 2014 premature exposure to salinity was a leading cause of mortality for juvenile shortnose sturgeon acipenser brevirostrum in an ibm for a river in coastal georgia usa jager et al 2013a this risk will increase as sea level rises canals and water diversions can also influence exposure to high salinity in coastal rivers as can intrusion of saltwater due to excessive groundwater pumping 3 4 research to understand contaminant and water quality impacts one important ecosystem service provided by rivers is to transport and purify waste water from watersheds that support human activities riverine populations are affected along the way and the population level effects of individual exposure to contaminants and poor water quality have been quantified by using ibms fig 4d as stochastic models ibms represent realistic variation in exposure research in this area involves linking ibms with dynamic and spatial models of water quality and past examples have focused on reservoirs for example in the us particle based lagrangian approaches have been used to simulate fish movements in a 2 dimensional reservoir nestler et al 2002 scheibe and richmond 2002 blueback herring alosa aestivalis were simulated in strom thurmond reservoir in the southeastern us by using rules to simulate swimming in the direction of optimal habitat quality nestler et al 2002 reservoir habitat was represented by a laterally averaged ce qual w2 model of hydrodynamics temperature and dissolved oxygen nestler et al 2002 nestler et al 2002 adjusted the parameters of conditional movement rules to produce reasonable seasonal responses in another particle based model a vertically averaged representation of a reservoir was used to evaluate exposure of juvenile salmon to dissolved gases while migrating near the water s surface through dams on the columbia river scheibe and richmond 2002 sullivan et al 2003 used a eulerian approach to simulating movements of white sturgeon a transmontanus in response to dissolved oxygen and temperature in the bottom layer of a snake river reservoir two studies of fish movements have pointed to interactions between predation and dissolved oxygen in one study juveniles were spatially concentrated and therefore increasingly vulnerable to predation breitburg et al 2003 another study of simulated movement indicated how depending on its location hypoxia can create a barrier in reservoirs as well as an ecological sink for scavengers attracted to carcasses sullivan et al 2003 survival estimates for individuals produced by these ibms can then be used to project population level responses a handful of studies have used ibms to evaluate contaminant effects at the population level and a few examples pertain to rivers salice et al 2011 evaluated alternative strategies for polychlorinated biphenyl pcb cleanup on mink the study determined that early cleanup was the best option a study to rank threats to shortnose sturgeon used an ibm to evaluate risk from mercury jager et al 2013b recently dohmen et al 2016 compared toxicity from farm chemicals in ditches at the edge of a field using models representing hydrodynamics as a moving stream versus a deep pool in shallow waters toxicity was found to be higher primarily because of higher temperatures another comparison found drift in flowing waters to have an influence on population recovery van den brink et al 2007 in another recent example brito et al 2017 evaluated sewage treatment options to select one most likely to protect the silver catfish rhamdia quelen the considerable research on contaminant transformation fate and transport within rivers floodplains and reservoirs has not been married with the mechanistic power of river ibms to aggregate individual level exposure and effects to the population level for riverine species the studies above did not simulate detailed adverse outcome pathways experienced by individuals to this end a working group hosted by the national institute for mathematical and biological synthesis is currently evaluating ways to combine dynamic energy budget deb models with ibms to scale the effects of contaminant exposure to understand effects at the population level forbes et al 2016 3 5 research to understand the conservation biology of rare fishes and other taxa perhaps it is ironic that understanding density dependence and compensatory mechanisms led to the development of ibms for fish populations because applications to understand threats to rare or endangered species are now more prominent peterseni et al 2008 at the low end of the population density spectrum allee effects are as important as compensatory effects at high densities when developing ibms for small populations in conservation biology questions about minimum population sizes for persistence emerge and this is related to the question of whether there is sufficient habitat to support a viable population in advective river environments downstream drift is a dominant feature that influences population persistence kolpas and nisbet 2010 generally speaking species evolve spatial life histories that counteract this tendency fragmentation by dams can interrupt conveyer belt life histories characteristic of rivers and prevent access to the variety of habitat required to sustain viable populations therefore assessing long term viability involves understanding spatial metapopulation structure and mechanisms by which genetic structure is maintained an important use of pvas is to rank threats to small populations caughley 1994 fig 6e ibms used for pva accomplish this by comparing scenarios with different assumptions about potential threats loos et al 2010 peterseni et al 2008 the response variables in pva s are those associated with population recovery i e the likelihood of extirpation or persistence population trends spatial diversity and genetic diversity therefore genetic models are appropriate for example an ibm g pva model was developed to rank risks linked to white sturgeon a transmontanus populations in the middle snake river jager et al 2007 pva studies typically require summarizing results from a large number of replicate meta populations and projecting many generations into the future fig 3 top right the combination of simulating many individuals and running monte carlo simulations is a significant computational challenge applications of ibms in conservation biology is especially important for river species because freshwater ecosystems contain some of the most imperilled taxa dudgeon et al 2006 jelks et al 2008 johnson et al 2013 richman et al 2015 warren and burr 1994 freshwater mussels are a particularly vulnerable group that provides important water filtration services layzer et al 1993 in addition to being sessile and therefore unable to move to avoid disturbance many mussels depend on fishes to colonize new sites as larvae glochidia they attach to the gills of a host fish where they develop during transport to a new site in rivers upstream colonization is particularly important for these taxa terui et al 2014 lee and deangelis 1997 developed a structured model to study the spatial spread of mussel populations the model showed that colonization patterns resembled a traveling wave front with a faster velocity for mussel species maturing at an earlier age lee and deangelis 1997 understanding colonization rates is important to predicting recovery from disturbances such as dredging sedimentation or chemical spills in a subsequent paper lee et al 1998 evaluated metapopulation dynamics of various unionid mussels a key result was that mussel species associated with a fish host having a restricted movement range require a high success rate of finding fish host to achieve at least an intermediate level of abundance mussel species with fish hosts having a limited range coupled with a low success rate of finding a host tend to be rare in numbers and sparsely distributed lee et al 1998 3 6 research to understand the effects of river fragmentation and reconnection many rivers are fragmented by dams ibms have been used to understand the potential costs and benefits of reconnection options including translocation and passage fig 6f one result is that fish in upstream reaches are more likely to experience higher risk of extirpation than those in downstream reaches when barriers prevent upstream movement harvey and railsback 2012 an important finding is that export of larvae from short segments to downstream reaches can deplete upstream segments a general result in physical systems where migration is asymmetric jager et al 2001 these results emphasize the general idea that upstream recolonization is a fundamental problem for organisms in directional advection dominated systems a series of simulation experiments to compare reconnection options were conducted with an ibm of white sturgeon in the middle snake river translocation was found to be most successful when adults were transported upstream as far as possible to a reach with good habitat conditions jager 2006b in addition a strategy of screening upstream reaches to prevent downstream movement was shown to be successful for simulated white sturgeon jager 2006b conditions under which passage jager 2006a and translocation jager 2006b were beneficial depended on whether the reach to which sturgeon were moved was upstream having sufficiently large amount of habitat and whether screening by trash racks to prevent large objects including sturgeon from entering turbine intakes was sufficiently narrow to prevent entrainment into turbines during downstream migration thus mortality risk during migration through dams is an important consideration in another study a pva model was used to evaluate the benefits of translocation for the humpback chub gila cypha in the colorado river usa pine et al 2013 the success of translocation depended on the relative survival in the donor and recipient reaches pine et al 2013 3 7 research to understand genetics in riverine metapopulations simulating population and metapopulation spawning populations linked by infrequent migration genetics is an important reason for choosing to use ibms fig 4g although a substantial literature exists that uses non ibm models these typically require either an assumption of two important alleles or many alleles with small effects i e statistical models that rely on a normal distribution of trait values the earliest ibms were more akin to genetic algorithms motivated by the need to examine mutation effects e g mutation meltdown in small populations gabriel et al 1993 lynch et al 1995 these models used in conservation biology focused strictly on neutral inheritance and not on selection resulting from decisions or activities of organisms the first genetic ibm ibm g model was applied to the question of selection on fish size due to fishing martinez garmendia 1998 in rivers the first ibm g quantified the effects of population isolation of white sturgeon between dams in the snake river jager 2001 these models simulated both selection and neutral genetics they have many advantages over non ibm population genetic models including the flexibility to represent different genetic systems e g polyploidy intermediate numbers of alleles interactions among loci control genes and effects of mating systems and other behaviors e g homing migration jager 2001 in many cases ibm gs are used to understand the genetic effects of anthropogenic influences e g harvest size selection hatchery operation fragmentation by dams reconnection climate change models of hatchery influences for example have shown that supplementation of lake sturgeon had little effect on allele retention and inbreeding schueller and hayes 2011 modifying the numbers released to reduce selection was shown not to be effective once introduced to a growing population such as one supported by supplementation a few alien alleles can quickly increase in frequency until they reach an equilibrium jager 2005 results from these ibm gs confirm that ensuring demographic health of populations often alleviates genetic concerns another purpose has been to explore the risk of hybridization for example between pallid scaphirhynchus alba and shovelnose sturgeon s platorynchus jager unpublished data one exciting research direction is to understand how dendritic network properties influence riverine metapopulations this has been explored using ibm gs labonne et al 2008 landguth et al 2014 in one case the combined effects of asymmetric dispersal along river networks combined with overland movement e g for amphibians or for fishes transported through floodplain inundation or being carried by non aquatic organisms was considered chaput bardy et al 2009 the role played by traits that control homing behavior and spawning fidelity have not been fully explored however studies that simulate selection and genetic adaptation have been performed these have shown that local adaptation can rescue isolated populations in stream networks coombs et al 2010 letcher et al 2007 network properties were found to influence chinook salmon growth in warmer thermal regimes fullerton et al 2017 juveniles in the least complex network grew faster and were ready to smolt earlier than those in more complex river networks fullerton et al 2017 other studies using ibm g models to explore the ability of fishes to adapt to climate warming are discussed in the section below 3 8 research to understand the effects of warming and flow shifts under climate change modeling research using ibms has addressed the potential effects of warming stream temperatures as well as the effects of shifts in hydrology and timing of flows a hypothesis has been that populations would shift toward cooler headwaters in response to warming and concerns have been raised about barriers e g dams preventing such movements one study of potential effects of climate change evaluated interactions between shifts in flow early snowmelt and warming on a fall and a spring spawning trout jager et al 1999 fig 4h an unexpected result was earlier maturation of the spring spawning rainbow trout life history under warming similar results have been observed in currently forested streams where wildfire has removed canopy cover and warmed stream temperatures rosenberger et al 2015 simulating interactions between warming and changes in flow can produce complex effects for example brown trout a fall spawning species was not impacted as expected by scouring of redds nests when high flows shifted from spring to winter warming benefited both species in the upstream but not the downstream reach this supports the idea that climate warming will cause movement toward cooler headwaters jager et al 1999 this result was also produced by a study of brook s fontinalis and rainbow trout o mykiss in the appalachian mountains usa clark et al 2001 more recently an ibm g developed from instream determined that declines in biomass and extinction risks were substantially larger under combined warming and flow reduction scenarios despite stronger evolutionary responses ayllon et al 2016 the traits that varied in this study were size at emergence and size at maturity ayllon et al 2016 ultimately it will be important to use ibm gs to address questions about adaptation to climate change for example climate adaptation via plasticity in growth has been explored for atlantic salmon populations piou and prevost 2012 2013 in another study anderson et al 2013a simulated phenotypic plasticity in adapting to shifts in seasonal events using an ibm model results suggested that population extinction can occur if the rate of change in the bioclimatic envelope exceeds the rate at which the population s phenology can change or if the variability in the envelope exceeds the population s inherent capacity for withstanding climate variability the perceptual abilities of individuals again play a role in framing the ability of populations to adapt for example a population with migration timing cued by photoperiod exhibited weaker phenotypic plasticity than one cued by temperature anderson et al 2013a anderson et al also found that a threshold leading to population extinction was foreshadowed by increased variability in average individual condition across years one concern is that climate change will have a genetic bottleneck effect on populations whereby decreased population size and the associated decrease in genetic diversity will prevent adaptation a landscape genetics ibm of bull trout salvelinus confluentus suggested that populations isolated by low flows under climate warming will face a risk of losing genetic diversity landguth et al 2014 not all studies using ibms to simulate population level responses to climate change have predicted large effects for example clark et al 2001 found that species differences in fecundity explained their competitive outcomes better than the influence of climate another notable feature of that study was the use of a geographic information system to allow the model to be distributed across streams in a large region more recently an ibm was used to examine interactions between forest harvest and climate change in the pacific northwest usa penaluna et al 2015 individual and population level responses were variable in some cases forest harvest countered the effect of climate change through increased summer flow the most consistent response was earlier emergence of fry but this change in timing did not necessarily result in population level differences penaluna et al 2015 4 where will the flow of ideas go next dendritic networks one directional flows and adaptations to predictable and unpredictable features of flow and temperature are defining characteristics of river habitats used by aquatic biota increasingly questions about the viability of fish and mussel populations in river networks are being asked thomaz et al 2016 and riverine ibms are a logical tool to apply advances in network theory and modeling tools used in conjunction with ibms can be used to understand basic questions e g how organisms maintain distributions in river networks and applied questions e g what is the optimal placement and management of dams clearly the mechanisms by which riverine metapopulations in dendritic directional networks recolonize tributaries are fundamental to understanding river ecology and integrating network modeling frameworks with ibm gs will be required to address these questions the literature reviewed here reveals a strong bias toward ibms describing fishes few examples exist of ibms applied to aquatic species at risk other than fishes suggesting an opportunity for future modeling research to rank threats and guide restoration efforts for mussels gastropods crayfishes and other imperiled taxa jelks et al 2008 johnson et al 2013 richman et al 2015 we see opportunities to help evaluate strategies for conserving these taxa as well by capitalizing on the ability of ibms to represent species interactions that depend on species densities and individual encounters in flowing media e g those between mussels broadcasting glochidia and their migrating fish hosts a strength of ibms is the ability to simulate the decisions by individual organisms in response to the environment and each other capitalizing on this strength we see considerable opportunity for implementing ibm algorithms for movement in robotic fishes used for research to understand the effects of hydropower and other industries that rely on rivers garcia magarino et al 2017 by applying our knowledge about animal and group social behavior motivation and responses to environmental fields and our understanding of animal perceptual limitations and capabilities which are often different from ours pe er and kramer schadt 2008 we see opportunities for advancement in this area on a related theme we see integration between social agent based models for human actors and ibms for the riverine biota that are affected by their decisions is another frontier in applied research for example agent based modeling has been used to allocate waste loads and water ding et al 2016 models fully integrating human decision makers with animals in downstream ecosystems have not been explored we see this as part of a general trend toward integrating human and societal systems with ecological systems finally a frontier of research that remains is to integrate individual based models with biogeochemical models and functionally defined ecosystem states requiring mass balance grimm et al 2017 this challenge is starting to be addressed by merging ibms with dynamic ecosystem models strauss et al 2017 the science to understand carbon and nutrient dynamics is increasingly focused on the incidence of hot spots and hot moments at the terrestrial aquatic interface although biotic processes strongly mediate biogeochemical cycles at the terrestrial aquatic interface the challenge of developing hybrid models that combine these conceptually distinct approaches remains for our metaphorical downstream researchers these are a few examples of many possible future directions or unwinding braids in the channel of riverine ecology aided by ibms undoubtedly many others will emerge fig 1 acknowledgments we appreciate a helpful review by dr james nutaro ornl by jacques labonne pole d hydrobiologie inra and by an anonymous reviewer this

25258,in this review article we trace the history of events leading to the development of individual based models ibms to represent aquatic organisms in rivers and streams as a metaphor we present this history as a series of confluences between individual scientists tributaries sharing ideas we describe contributions of these models to science and management one iconic feature of river ibms is the linkage between flow and the physical habitat experienced by individual animals and the first model that focused on this linkage is briefly described we continue by reviewing the contributions of riverine ibms to eight broad areas of scientific inquiry the first four areas include research to understand 1 the effects of flow regimes on fish populations 2 species interactions e g size mediated competition and predation 3 fish movement and habitat selection and 4 contaminant and water quality impacts on populations next we review research using ibms 5 to guide conservation biology of imperiled taxa through population viability analysis including research 6 to understand river fragmentation by dams and reconnection 7 to understand genetic outcomes for riverine metapopulations and 8 to anticipate the future effects of temperature and climate change this rich body of literature has contributed to both theoretical insights e g about animal behavior and life history and applied insights e g population level effects of flow regimes temperature and the effects of hydropower and other industries that share rivers with aquatic biota we finish by exploring promising branches that lie ahead in the braided downstream channel that represents future river modeling research keywords individual based model agent based model dendritic river network hydropower ecosystem robotics population level 1 individual confluences passing streams of memes ideas in science rarely emerge intact rather the conditions leading to new ideas or memes spring up in different places and follow independent paths that then converge merge and spread this was true for individual based modeling ibm and later the development of ibms for biota in rivers and streams ideas flowing out of tributaries carried advances in computer science theoretical ecology e g optimal foraging theory forest gap modeling and physical modeling of dynamic stream habitat these ideas co mingled to generate a diverse braided complex of downstream channels that continues to bring new insights fig 1 these downstream channels are different in size a large productive instream modeling community of users is an important example in addition the initial electric power research institute epri models fed into genetic ibms ibm g and other variants and these have been used to address a wide variety of basic and applied scientific questions the use of individual based modeling in ecology as depicted in fig 1 emerged initially at the confluence between silvicultural problems one tributary branch and technological progress another tributary in the early 1970 s the technological advance was the increasing power of computers while the motivating problems involved how to optimize planted forests e g what trees to plant and how to space them shugart et al 2018 shugart and woodward 2011 computational power allowed yale ecologist daniel botkin botkin et al 1972 to model a forest in the way that he thought it really worked mechanistically working with james wallis and james janak of ibm s thomas j watson research center botkin simulated the growth of individual trees of different species as accurately as possible given their basic traits and local soil and climate conditions and then let trees from different species interact on a small plot through mutual competition for light this general type of model was termed an individual based model or coincidentally ibm jabowa was called a gap phase replacement model because the spatial area simulated was about the size of a gap left by the death of a large canopy tree botkin et al 1972 jabowa predicted the successional dynamics of tree communities in a new hampshire forest so well that forest ecologists such as bormann and likens 1979 used it to derive their ideas about biomass accumulation in aggrading forests hank shugart and darrell west then research ecologists at oak ridge national laboratory soon developed a version of a gap phase replacement ibm named foret shugart and west 1977 and other models followed as reviewed by bugmann 2001 by now scores of different forest simulation platforms with a high degree of detail and sophistication exist and are applied world wide two factors made fish the next candidate for extensive application of individual based modeling the first factor is that individual size is an important characteristic for piscivorous fish as it was for trees as gape limited predators size influences the foraging success of fish and their ability to escape predation by other fishes individual differences in size within a cohort could therefore influence the dynamics of that cohort deangelis et al 1980 demonstrated this for young of the year largemouth bass micropterus salmoides in an aquarium depending on the initial size distribution varying degrees of cannibalism could occur within the cohort leading to a final number of surviving fish after a couple of months the ibm which followed every fish in the cohort through time was able to predict the outcomes of two successive aquarium experiments surprisingly well the second factor favoring development of ibms for fish was the need to understand the effects of mortality of fish though entrainment and impingement by nuclear power plant cooling systems fig 1 a key question was to what extent compensatory mechanisms in the fish populations could mitigate the loss of perhaps billions of eggs larval and other early life stage fish at high densities few offspring of such species survive to adulthood due to density dependent mortality the loss of some fish by non natural factors such as power plants increases resources available to others the argument made by some scientists was that increased mortality of juveniles imposed by anthropogenic sources had little net effect on recruitment to the adult stage mcfadden 1977 to understand and quantify how such compensatory mechanisms work in fish populations the epri funded a 10 year project compensatory mechanisms in young of the year fish at oak ridge national laboratory ornl which already had a long history of studying the effects of power plants on fish barnthouse et al 1984 boreman et al 1981 coutant 1971 the project led by dr webster van winkle and stimulated by the success of ibm forest simulations by colleagues at ornl used the ibm approach to understand growth and risk of mortality of young of year yoy fish of species impacted by nuclear power plants at universities across north america phd students funded by epri developed such models in the process training a generation of fish ecologists in modeling following the wisconsin school of fish modeling the bioenergetics of each fish was modeled in these ibms and large numbers of young of year fish were simulated along with food resources and predation to estimate the effects of power plants and other mortality factors early papers were published by deangelis et al 1990 madenjian et al 1991 and deangelis et al 1991 for fish in lakes deangelis et al 1993 predicted patterns of recruitment vs egg density and the transition from density dependent to density independent mortality in yoy fish that agreed well with empirical patterns scheffer et al 1995 introduced the key ibm modeling technique of super individuals to efficiently simulate huge numbers of yoy most of which die in the first year of life applications of ibms to fishes were reviewed by van winkle et al 1993 and more recently by sibly et al 2013 the growth in ibms during the late 1980s in all areas of ecology and across taxa stimulated both a review paper of individual based modeling huston et al 1988 and a workshop at the university of tennessee in 1990 published as a proceedings deangelis and gross 1992 editors in a subsequent review deangelis and mooij 2005 counted over 900 manuscripts using ibms over 100 of which were applied to fish though these numbers were surely underestimates the monograph of grimm and railsback 2005 advanced the theoretical foundations for individual based modeling modeling of individual activities was influenced by bioenergetics modeling e g the wisconsin school for fishes mostly centered on lake fishes optimal foraging theory and theories related to habitat selection and movement fig 1 these component sub models used to represent individual activities formed the backbone of ibms other early papers described ibms of riverine populations petersen and deangelis 1992 simulated northern pike fish formerly squawfish esox lucius predation on juvenile salmon addressing the question of how schooling of downstream swimming smolts reduced predation risk in a columbia river reservoir and rose and cowan 1993 simulated striped bass in the potomac river arguably river ibms differ from those applied to organisms in other ecosystems because the dynamic and directional changes in river habitat are such an important influence on species life histories thus the ability to simulate population level responses to flow as an outcome of individual behaviors is a defining characteristic and development of river ibms depended on the convergence of two tributary ideas one tributary carried the biological ibm and the other carried the instream flow incremental methodology or ifim orth and maughan 1982 used to establish minimum flows for fishes below dams in the u s the ifim has two components 1 physical habitat modeling for the variables depth velocity and substrate and 2 representation of species preferences for these three habitat variables bovee 1982 thomas and bovee 1993 because preference curves are not flow invariant and do not necessarily reflect a species habitat requirements over time well the ifim generated controversy from its inception mathur et al 1985 railsback 2016 in the confluence of the 1980s dr michael sale a recently hired environmental engineer brought his experience with ifim models to oak ridge where he recognized the potential for applying ibms in river ecosystems the confluence of ideas among theoretical modelers environmental engineers and aquatic ecologists in east tennessee spawned many applications of ifim models using ibms to study riverine fishes these tools have produced numerous insights not just in understanding flow responses by fishes and reducing uncertainty in instream flow standards van winkle et al 1997 but also in understanding biological processes below we will highlight aspects specific to lotic habitats over the years individual or agent based modeling has evolved deangelis and grimm 2014 for example computation times were reduced through the use of various cloning methods for representing meta individuals rose et al 1993 an attractive feature of ibms as mechanistic process based models is the ability to validate by parts and to compare against intermediate outputs new techniques were adopted for model data comparison one is to compare patterns produced by the model against those observed e g the use of pattern oriented model evaluation grimm and railsback 2012 grimm et al 2005 which is similar to functional validation jager et al 2000 the pattern oriented approach can be used to select among alternative model structures that differ in complexity a protocol for documenting ibms was developed grimm et al 2010 in addition significant advances have been made in developing new methods for incorporating historical data and producing a distribution of model outcomes from a likelihood weighted joint distribution of input parameters e g approximate bayesian computational methods piou et al 2009 developments specific to riverine ibms include alternative approaches to representing dynamic stream habitat hydrodynamics stream temperature and water quality simulation of animal movement in a directional flow environment and models that use network theory as a basis for representing dendritic riverine metapopulations these advances are described in the sections below in this paper we trace the ideas leading to modeling of river fish populations using ibms we highlight some of the key contributions ibms have made to understanding aquatic populations in river habitat and we suggest future opportunities for new discoveries 2 headwaters of riverine ibms one of the first ibms applied to riverine populations in the early 1990 s sought to understand the effects of regulated flow regimes on fish in the north anna river virginia usa this early model focused on smallmouth bass m dolomieu was published in the journal rivers that is no longer in existence jager et al 1993 see supplemental information this model evolved from a version developed by deangelis et al 1991 for lakes fig 1 the lake model simulated gape limited optimal foraging on a spectrum of invertebrate e g zooplankton prey ontogenetic size based shifts in optimal diet smallmouth bass bioenergetics as well as nesting and reproduction to represent fish in a river environment other processes became important to include representation of physical habitat linking time series of flow and temperature to 2 dimensional fields of depth and velocity and the responses of each biological process to those fields is depicted in fig 2 and described below 2 1 physical habitat flow is such an important driver of habitat for fishes and other river biota that much more attention to dynamic simulation of habitat was required this was achieved by coupling hydraulic simulation portion of the physical habitat simulation system phabsim directly with an individual based model for nesting reproduction and yoy dynamics fig 2 to represent hydrodynamics the data requirements were significantly higher than those of previous ibms phabsim relies on measurements of depth and velocity along fixed transects at different flows as well as substrate and cover a representative stream reach was partitioned into spatial cells containing measurement stations from a phabsim survey of the reach the model required daily predictions of average depth and velocity for each grid cell in the representative reach as a function of daily average flow fig 2 in later models changes in velocity with depth and presence of cover were represented as well van winkle et al 1998 water temperature was also simulated influencing fish growth and development 2 2 movement the smallmouth bass ibm uses departure rules to simulate fish movement jager and tyler 2001 each individual fish s growth over time is tracked in a time for space substitution movement is initiated when growth falls below the fish s long term expectation 2 3 foraging foraging differs substantially in flowing rivers compared with lentic habitats regeneration of prey is affected by flow and by the local habitat s carrying capacity setting an upper limit on standing biomass larger invertebrate prey items and crayfish are simulated because these can be important in streams especially for larger bass the model was able to reproduce fish growth in the north anna river 2 4 mortality mortality factors in rivers and streams differ from those in lakes because of the risk of being swept away by high flows or dewatered during non mobile life stages i e eggs and larvae during nesting one insight produced from this river ibm is a recognition that non mobile life stages are the most vulnerable when examining responses to disturbance regimes 2 5 reproduction reproduction and early development are affected by different abiotic effects in rivers than in lakes nesting and guarding of nests by males is represented in both the lake and versions of the model however to understand nesting success in dynamic rivers it is important not only to simulate disturbance of nests by flow extremes e g floods or dewatering but also to provide the opportunity for renesting if disturbance is early in the season the authors compared simulated reproductive success and first year growth with field observations from the north anna river in virginia the timing of nesting was well simulated based on water temperature see supplemental information and renesting occurred on three occasions in 2 year simulations in summary this first ibm linking river habitat dynamics to fish populations explored previously unappreciated facets of riverine fish responses and adaptation to flow but more importantly it laid the groundwork for subsequent modeling efforts to evaluate the influence of alternative flow regimes as the authors continued to deploy river ibms with the next applications focused on trout van winkle et al 1998 and chinook salmon jager et al 1997 as well as numerous others reviewed below 3 how have river ibms contributed to ecology since the early models described above river ibms have fanned out to address a varied set of questions illustrated by the braided channel in fig 1 yielding different kinds of insights spatially explicit ibms are well suited for many questions involving aquatic populations in river habitats for several reasons first as noted by anderson et al 2013b properties that emerge from transient non equilibrium dynamics are particularly important in disturbance dominated ecosystems like rivers strange et al 1993 second risks are dependent on attributes of individuals in addition to size dependent predation risk in regulated rivers entrainment and survival of turbine passage both depend on fish size hij conducted a web of science search of individual based model in the title and river or stream which found 54 publications with an average of 25 citations per publication when individual based was not required to be in the title and extraneous topics were excluded just under 200 papers were identified between 1992 and 2018 and these produced an average of 36 2 citations per item the number of publications increased near linearly over time many of these publications were produced by a few individuals dr steve railsback with coauthor dr brett harvey authored 8 2 and 7 1 of papers based on the instream model other authors represented many countries with more than half from the usa roughly 10 each from england canada and france followed by germany the netherlands china japan and norway and twelve other countries papers were published in the journal ecological modeling 16 fisheries journals 28 and general ecology and conservation journals 16 especially plos one and ecological applications with the remaining journals represented by fewer than two papers each two studies were published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa processes in rivers as in most ecosystems span multiple scales anderson et al 2005 likewise riverine ibms with different purposes fall along a range of scales from a focus on spatial questions related to fish responses to flow and temperature mediated variation in habitat lower left in fig 3 to questions related to metapopulation dynamics in river networks upper right in fig 3 the specific questions which river ibms have been used to address fig 4 have evolved over time but at least one general purpose e g understanding the effects of river regulation has remained an active area of research throughout one significant shift in emphasis has been from models to manage stream habitat for fisheries to population viability analysis pva models designed to guide recovery of rare species of high conservation concern below we briefly discuss four categories of ibm studies focused on single tailwaters or reaches in which higher spatial resolution is used bottom left in fig 3 and four categories of ibm modeling studies involving long term projections of meta populations over broader spatial scales upper right portion of fig 3 these studies relate to the questions depicted in fig 4 3 1 research to understand the effects of flow regimes on fish populations understanding how flow regimes influence fishes is a fundamental area of river research has been and continues to be explored by ibms fig 4a from an early emphasis on determining how much flow a river needs through setting minimum flow standards to the more recent emphasis on flow variability a mechanistic understanding of the linkages between flow regimes is needed and spatially explicit ibms provide this capability some of the more recent research is described in section 3 3 under research to understand habitat selection and movement the purpose of early river ibms was to improve the fish preference curves used in ifim although ifim is typically used in a regulatory context to set minimum flows ibms made it possible to address questions about flow regimes for example optimization flow releases from reservoirs was used to benefit downstream fishes such as chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha jager and rose 2003 a key finding has been that thermal effects tend to have more biological importance than those of flow alone jager et al 1997 tyler and rutherford 2007 xu et al 2010 in addition ibms have enabled researchers to evaluate the mechanisms behind ecological riverflow i e properties of flow regimes including variation in flows that benefit tailwater fish populations tyler and rutherford 2007 as well as ways in which natural flows can be improved on for example one non ibm study found that timing of releases earlier in spring than the natural snow melt pulse produced floodplain inundation that allowed juvenile salmon to grow faster and exit the system before river temperatures became dangerously warm jager 2014 thus an unnatural flow regime performed better than the way that the river was historically regulated which usually produced suboptimal flows for fishes moving from an initial focus on setting minimum flow regulations river managers now also focus on understanding elements of flow regimes that have high ecological value and these are often the seasonal pulse flows for example produced by snowmelt to which native species are adapted in temperate rivers in regulated rivers flow augmentation ensures that high flows are available to downstream biota when needed these pulse flows may facilitate migration and improve temperatures below dams for example cold augmentation flows from dworshak reservoir are an important part of a strategy to facilitate salmon and steelhead migration through the hydrosystem of the lower columbia river in spring augmentation may also be needed to provide flow in cases of extreme dewatering in a more arid climate pine et al 2017 used a population viability analysis pva ibm model to evaluate the potential benefits of augmenting flows to two federally listed fish species in a new mexico usa stream another important research area for regulated rivers is to understand trade offs between operating in peaking or load following mode whereby flows are released when electricity demand and value is high rapid fluctuations in flow can have adverse effects on biota and these can be modeled by ibms that simulate influences on bioenergetics and on non mobile life stages for example an ibm of the green river below flaming gorge dam predicted the effects of flow fluctuations on nursery habitats of the colorado pikeminnow ptychocheilus lucius grand et al 2006 3 2 research to understand species interactions ibms can be used effectively to study species interactions fig 4b for example the spread of invasive aquatic species is a significant threat to native species worldwide and one associated with human activity leprieur et al 2008 stream ibms can be used to understand biologically mediated invasion dynamics for example topological properties of river networks and the spatial distribution of larval habitat within them controlled the spread of sea lamprey neeson et al 2012 the use of an ibm is particularly important when individual characteristics influence the outcome of individual interactions for example representing individual size differences among fishes was an early emphasis because it highlighted the role of size based gape limited predation rice et al 1993 size was also the focus of the first application of an ibm to fish stocking as resource managers became aware that releasing fish at a larger size could enhance survival madenjian et al 1991 in situations when spatial resources can be defended e g drift feeding territories high quality spawning habitat size based competition for space occurs this has been represented in models for salmonids similarly competition for mates and female fecundity are functions of size or condition van winkle et al 1998 the need to grow beyond a certain size prior to a stressful period e g winter and the population resilience created by contest competition van noordwijk and de jong 1986 and compensatory density dependent mortality were two insights gained through individual based modeling deangelis et al 1993 in rivers the first application with a focus on size mediated effects simulated predation on migrating salmon smolts petersen and deangelis 1992 2000 these size based algorithms were later incorporated into models of bass predation on salmon juveniles in rivers particularly deep pools jager et al 1997 the interaction between warming rivers and predation by warm water fishes on cold water salmonids remains an important concern for species listed under the endangered species act in rivers of the western us trophic dynamics in rivers have been represented by ibms anderson et al 2012 giacomini et al 2009 railsback and harvey 2013 robson et al 2017 simulating predation required some changes when applied to species in flowing rivers in lentic habitats modelers typically assume that the geometry defined by the reaction distance of the fish and its speed define a cylindrical volume of pelagic prey or a truncated volume of benthic prey available to foraging fishes in rivers a strategy of sit and wait drift feeding becomes possible fausch 2014 therefore at low and high velocities individuals are predicted to adopt a search strategy whereas at intermediate velocities profitability of a drift feeding strategy is higher van winkle et al 1998 another consideration is the relationship between flow and turbidity for visual feeding fishes increased turbidity can lead to reduced feeding and subsequent starvation harvey and railsback 2009 3 3 research to understand fish movement and habitat selection one of the most important reasons for adopting an individual based approach is the need to represent movement at a relatively fine resolution i e multiple reaches or patches within reaches versus a few different habitats understanding animal behavior fig 6c including movement and habitat selection has been studied by postulating and testing movement rules rohlf and davenport 1969 and this was greatly facilitated by using ibms this research was initially influenced by the wealth of literature in ecology on optimal foraging theory and decision rules for switching prey and habitat departure economic concepts such as the marginal value theorem were used in deciding when model organisms should leave a patch when searching for food or other resource rashleigh and grossman 2005 tyler and brandt 2001 early stream ibms partitioned the day into resting and foraging portions based on reaching a maximum daily ration within daylight hours van winkle et al 1998 an individual s departure from a patch was simulated to occur when its expectation of a higher ratio of growth to predation risk or product of growth and survival exceeded the value in the current stream cell jager et al 1993 railsback and harvey 2002 van winkle et al 1998 later models have identified situations in which the distribution of individuals does not reflect the fitness landscape as is expected under an ideal free distribution produced by departure rules that optimize fitness railsback et al 2003 the limited perceptual ability of individuals to sense conditions beyond their current location is one factor that can negatively influence the ability of a population to produce a distribution that tracks the fitness landscape jager and tyler 2001 pe er and kramer schadt 2008 railsback et al 1999 2001 understanding movement is not merely a theoretical exercise the use of spatially explicit ibms can help resource managers by providing more sophisticated movement algorithms to understand how management decisions influence fish populations railsback 2016 in one example simulation of flow responses by two carp species in china suggested relatively little effect of regulation but did suggest improved timing of reservoir water releases during spring li et al 2010 understanding the effects of dams on downstream migration by juvenile salmon has been a strong area of applied research in the columbia river basin where a large proportion of us hydropower is generated computational fluid dynamics has been used to understand juvenile salmonid movements through passage facilities gao et al 2016 romero gomez and richmond 2014 weber et al 2006 typically a combined eulerian lagrangian agent elam approach i e fish trajectories modeled through a fixed gridded physical habitat representation of a river is employed goodwin et al 2006 a hypothesis to explain the navigation of juvenile salmonids downstream through surface collectors and other devices at dams was the strain velocity pressure hypothesis whereby juveniles are assumed to minimize total hydraulic strain nestler et al 2008 this hypothesis has since been supplanted as water acceleration alone appears to do a better job of predicting the movements of salmon the resulting models simulate the ability of salmon to navigate safely through passage routes at large dams by modulating their swimming orientation and speed to water acceleration goodwin et al 2014 the elam model differs from earlier phabsim models in that fish are simulated on a dynamic habitat represented by high resolution computational fluid dynamics models weber et al 2006 the approaches above make sense for animals that can control their movements however for some species and life stages movement is passive and determined by flow fields fonseca 1999 used an ibm to examine the consequences of movement rules related to drift of blackfly larvae in a fluid medium and was able to reproduce spatial patterns of settling in depositional zones in fragmented rivers downstream drift of larvae was found to be an important effect on upstream population persistence thus the most vulnerable life stages are those that are incapable of directed movement whether because they are sessile eggs mussels or because they lack apparatus for swimming well one situation where ibms suggest that passive drift can be important is in coastal rivers where salinity can play a role in movement and survival of early life stages that are not yet salt water tolerant jager et al 2013a rose et al 2014 premature exposure to salinity was a leading cause of mortality for juvenile shortnose sturgeon acipenser brevirostrum in an ibm for a river in coastal georgia usa jager et al 2013a this risk will increase as sea level rises canals and water diversions can also influence exposure to high salinity in coastal rivers as can intrusion of saltwater due to excessive groundwater pumping 3 4 research to understand contaminant and water quality impacts one important ecosystem service provided by rivers is to transport and purify waste water from watersheds that support human activities riverine populations are affected along the way and the population level effects of individual exposure to contaminants and poor water quality have been quantified by using ibms fig 4d as stochastic models ibms represent realistic variation in exposure research in this area involves linking ibms with dynamic and spatial models of water quality and past examples have focused on reservoirs for example in the us particle based lagrangian approaches have been used to simulate fish movements in a 2 dimensional reservoir nestler et al 2002 scheibe and richmond 2002 blueback herring alosa aestivalis were simulated in strom thurmond reservoir in the southeastern us by using rules to simulate swimming in the direction of optimal habitat quality nestler et al 2002 reservoir habitat was represented by a laterally averaged ce qual w2 model of hydrodynamics temperature and dissolved oxygen nestler et al 2002 nestler et al 2002 adjusted the parameters of conditional movement rules to produce reasonable seasonal responses in another particle based model a vertically averaged representation of a reservoir was used to evaluate exposure of juvenile salmon to dissolved gases while migrating near the water s surface through dams on the columbia river scheibe and richmond 2002 sullivan et al 2003 used a eulerian approach to simulating movements of white sturgeon a transmontanus in response to dissolved oxygen and temperature in the bottom layer of a snake river reservoir two studies of fish movements have pointed to interactions between predation and dissolved oxygen in one study juveniles were spatially concentrated and therefore increasingly vulnerable to predation breitburg et al 2003 another study of simulated movement indicated how depending on its location hypoxia can create a barrier in reservoirs as well as an ecological sink for scavengers attracted to carcasses sullivan et al 2003 survival estimates for individuals produced by these ibms can then be used to project population level responses a handful of studies have used ibms to evaluate contaminant effects at the population level and a few examples pertain to rivers salice et al 2011 evaluated alternative strategies for polychlorinated biphenyl pcb cleanup on mink the study determined that early cleanup was the best option a study to rank threats to shortnose sturgeon used an ibm to evaluate risk from mercury jager et al 2013b recently dohmen et al 2016 compared toxicity from farm chemicals in ditches at the edge of a field using models representing hydrodynamics as a moving stream versus a deep pool in shallow waters toxicity was found to be higher primarily because of higher temperatures another comparison found drift in flowing waters to have an influence on population recovery van den brink et al 2007 in another recent example brito et al 2017 evaluated sewage treatment options to select one most likely to protect the silver catfish rhamdia quelen the considerable research on contaminant transformation fate and transport within rivers floodplains and reservoirs has not been married with the mechanistic power of river ibms to aggregate individual level exposure and effects to the population level for riverine species the studies above did not simulate detailed adverse outcome pathways experienced by individuals to this end a working group hosted by the national institute for mathematical and biological synthesis is currently evaluating ways to combine dynamic energy budget deb models with ibms to scale the effects of contaminant exposure to understand effects at the population level forbes et al 2016 3 5 research to understand the conservation biology of rare fishes and other taxa perhaps it is ironic that understanding density dependence and compensatory mechanisms led to the development of ibms for fish populations because applications to understand threats to rare or endangered species are now more prominent peterseni et al 2008 at the low end of the population density spectrum allee effects are as important as compensatory effects at high densities when developing ibms for small populations in conservation biology questions about minimum population sizes for persistence emerge and this is related to the question of whether there is sufficient habitat to support a viable population in advective river environments downstream drift is a dominant feature that influences population persistence kolpas and nisbet 2010 generally speaking species evolve spatial life histories that counteract this tendency fragmentation by dams can interrupt conveyer belt life histories characteristic of rivers and prevent access to the variety of habitat required to sustain viable populations therefore assessing long term viability involves understanding spatial metapopulation structure and mechanisms by which genetic structure is maintained an important use of pvas is to rank threats to small populations caughley 1994 fig 6e ibms used for pva accomplish this by comparing scenarios with different assumptions about potential threats loos et al 2010 peterseni et al 2008 the response variables in pva s are those associated with population recovery i e the likelihood of extirpation or persistence population trends spatial diversity and genetic diversity therefore genetic models are appropriate for example an ibm g pva model was developed to rank risks linked to white sturgeon a transmontanus populations in the middle snake river jager et al 2007 pva studies typically require summarizing results from a large number of replicate meta populations and projecting many generations into the future fig 3 top right the combination of simulating many individuals and running monte carlo simulations is a significant computational challenge applications of ibms in conservation biology is especially important for river species because freshwater ecosystems contain some of the most imperilled taxa dudgeon et al 2006 jelks et al 2008 johnson et al 2013 richman et al 2015 warren and burr 1994 freshwater mussels are a particularly vulnerable group that provides important water filtration services layzer et al 1993 in addition to being sessile and therefore unable to move to avoid disturbance many mussels depend on fishes to colonize new sites as larvae glochidia they attach to the gills of a host fish where they develop during transport to a new site in rivers upstream colonization is particularly important for these taxa terui et al 2014 lee and deangelis 1997 developed a structured model to study the spatial spread of mussel populations the model showed that colonization patterns resembled a traveling wave front with a faster velocity for mussel species maturing at an earlier age lee and deangelis 1997 understanding colonization rates is important to predicting recovery from disturbances such as dredging sedimentation or chemical spills in a subsequent paper lee et al 1998 evaluated metapopulation dynamics of various unionid mussels a key result was that mussel species associated with a fish host having a restricted movement range require a high success rate of finding fish host to achieve at least an intermediate level of abundance mussel species with fish hosts having a limited range coupled with a low success rate of finding a host tend to be rare in numbers and sparsely distributed lee et al 1998 3 6 research to understand the effects of river fragmentation and reconnection many rivers are fragmented by dams ibms have been used to understand the potential costs and benefits of reconnection options including translocation and passage fig 6f one result is that fish in upstream reaches are more likely to experience higher risk of extirpation than those in downstream reaches when barriers prevent upstream movement harvey and railsback 2012 an important finding is that export of larvae from short segments to downstream reaches can deplete upstream segments a general result in physical systems where migration is asymmetric jager et al 2001 these results emphasize the general idea that upstream recolonization is a fundamental problem for organisms in directional advection dominated systems a series of simulation experiments to compare reconnection options were conducted with an ibm of white sturgeon in the middle snake river translocation was found to be most successful when adults were transported upstream as far as possible to a reach with good habitat conditions jager 2006b in addition a strategy of screening upstream reaches to prevent downstream movement was shown to be successful for simulated white sturgeon jager 2006b conditions under which passage jager 2006a and translocation jager 2006b were beneficial depended on whether the reach to which sturgeon were moved was upstream having sufficiently large amount of habitat and whether screening by trash racks to prevent large objects including sturgeon from entering turbine intakes was sufficiently narrow to prevent entrainment into turbines during downstream migration thus mortality risk during migration through dams is an important consideration in another study a pva model was used to evaluate the benefits of translocation for the humpback chub gila cypha in the colorado river usa pine et al 2013 the success of translocation depended on the relative survival in the donor and recipient reaches pine et al 2013 3 7 research to understand genetics in riverine metapopulations simulating population and metapopulation spawning populations linked by infrequent migration genetics is an important reason for choosing to use ibms fig 4g although a substantial literature exists that uses non ibm models these typically require either an assumption of two important alleles or many alleles with small effects i e statistical models that rely on a normal distribution of trait values the earliest ibms were more akin to genetic algorithms motivated by the need to examine mutation effects e g mutation meltdown in small populations gabriel et al 1993 lynch et al 1995 these models used in conservation biology focused strictly on neutral inheritance and not on selection resulting from decisions or activities of organisms the first genetic ibm ibm g model was applied to the question of selection on fish size due to fishing martinez garmendia 1998 in rivers the first ibm g quantified the effects of population isolation of white sturgeon between dams in the snake river jager 2001 these models simulated both selection and neutral genetics they have many advantages over non ibm population genetic models including the flexibility to represent different genetic systems e g polyploidy intermediate numbers of alleles interactions among loci control genes and effects of mating systems and other behaviors e g homing migration jager 2001 in many cases ibm gs are used to understand the genetic effects of anthropogenic influences e g harvest size selection hatchery operation fragmentation by dams reconnection climate change models of hatchery influences for example have shown that supplementation of lake sturgeon had little effect on allele retention and inbreeding schueller and hayes 2011 modifying the numbers released to reduce selection was shown not to be effective once introduced to a growing population such as one supported by supplementation a few alien alleles can quickly increase in frequency until they reach an equilibrium jager 2005 results from these ibm gs confirm that ensuring demographic health of populations often alleviates genetic concerns another purpose has been to explore the risk of hybridization for example between pallid scaphirhynchus alba and shovelnose sturgeon s platorynchus jager unpublished data one exciting research direction is to understand how dendritic network properties influence riverine metapopulations this has been explored using ibm gs labonne et al 2008 landguth et al 2014 in one case the combined effects of asymmetric dispersal along river networks combined with overland movement e g for amphibians or for fishes transported through floodplain inundation or being carried by non aquatic organisms was considered chaput bardy et al 2009 the role played by traits that control homing behavior and spawning fidelity have not been fully explored however studies that simulate selection and genetic adaptation have been performed these have shown that local adaptation can rescue isolated populations in stream networks coombs et al 2010 letcher et al 2007 network properties were found to influence chinook salmon growth in warmer thermal regimes fullerton et al 2017 juveniles in the least complex network grew faster and were ready to smolt earlier than those in more complex river networks fullerton et al 2017 other studies using ibm g models to explore the ability of fishes to adapt to climate warming are discussed in the section below 3 8 research to understand the effects of warming and flow shifts under climate change modeling research using ibms has addressed the potential effects of warming stream temperatures as well as the effects of shifts in hydrology and timing of flows a hypothesis has been that populations would shift toward cooler headwaters in response to warming and concerns have been raised about barriers e g dams preventing such movements one study of potential effects of climate change evaluated interactions between shifts in flow early snowmelt and warming on a fall and a spring spawning trout jager et al 1999 fig 4h an unexpected result was earlier maturation of the spring spawning rainbow trout life history under warming similar results have been observed in currently forested streams where wildfire has removed canopy cover and warmed stream temperatures rosenberger et al 2015 simulating interactions between warming and changes in flow can produce complex effects for example brown trout a fall spawning species was not impacted as expected by scouring of redds nests when high flows shifted from spring to winter warming benefited both species in the upstream but not the downstream reach this supports the idea that climate warming will cause movement toward cooler headwaters jager et al 1999 this result was also produced by a study of brook s fontinalis and rainbow trout o mykiss in the appalachian mountains usa clark et al 2001 more recently an ibm g developed from instream determined that declines in biomass and extinction risks were substantially larger under combined warming and flow reduction scenarios despite stronger evolutionary responses ayllon et al 2016 the traits that varied in this study were size at emergence and size at maturity ayllon et al 2016 ultimately it will be important to use ibm gs to address questions about adaptation to climate change for example climate adaptation via plasticity in growth has been explored for atlantic salmon populations piou and prevost 2012 2013 in another study anderson et al 2013a simulated phenotypic plasticity in adapting to shifts in seasonal events using an ibm model results suggested that population extinction can occur if the rate of change in the bioclimatic envelope exceeds the rate at which the population s phenology can change or if the variability in the envelope exceeds the population s inherent capacity for withstanding climate variability the perceptual abilities of individuals again play a role in framing the ability of populations to adapt for example a population with migration timing cued by photoperiod exhibited weaker phenotypic plasticity than one cued by temperature anderson et al 2013a anderson et al also found that a threshold leading to population extinction was foreshadowed by increased variability in average individual condition across years one concern is that climate change will have a genetic bottleneck effect on populations whereby decreased population size and the associated decrease in genetic diversity will prevent adaptation a landscape genetics ibm of bull trout salvelinus confluentus suggested that populations isolated by low flows under climate warming will face a risk of losing genetic diversity landguth et al 2014 not all studies using ibms to simulate population level responses to climate change have predicted large effects for example clark et al 2001 found that species differences in fecundity explained their competitive outcomes better than the influence of climate another notable feature of that study was the use of a geographic information system to allow the model to be distributed across streams in a large region more recently an ibm was used to examine interactions between forest harvest and climate change in the pacific northwest usa penaluna et al 2015 individual and population level responses were variable in some cases forest harvest countered the effect of climate change through increased summer flow the most consistent response was earlier emergence of fry but this change in timing did not necessarily result in population level differences penaluna et al 2015 4 where will the flow of ideas go next dendritic networks one directional flows and adaptations to predictable and unpredictable features of flow and temperature are defining characteristics of river habitats used by aquatic biota increasingly questions about the viability of fish and mussel populations in river networks are being asked thomaz et al 2016 and riverine ibms are a logical tool to apply advances in network theory and modeling tools used in conjunction with ibms can be used to understand basic questions e g how organisms maintain distributions in river networks and applied questions e g what is the optimal placement and management of dams clearly the mechanisms by which riverine metapopulations in dendritic directional networks recolonize tributaries are fundamental to understanding river ecology and integrating network modeling frameworks with ibm gs will be required to address these questions the literature reviewed here reveals a strong bias toward ibms describing fishes few examples exist of ibms applied to aquatic species at risk other than fishes suggesting an opportunity for future modeling research to rank threats and guide restoration efforts for mussels gastropods crayfishes and other imperiled taxa jelks et al 2008 johnson et al 2013 richman et al 2015 we see opportunities to help evaluate strategies for conserving these taxa as well by capitalizing on the ability of ibms to represent species interactions that depend on species densities and individual encounters in flowing media e g those between mussels broadcasting glochidia and their migrating fish hosts a strength of ibms is the ability to simulate the decisions by individual organisms in response to the environment and each other capitalizing on this strength we see considerable opportunity for implementing ibm algorithms for movement in robotic fishes used for research to understand the effects of hydropower and other industries that rely on rivers garcia magarino et al 2017 by applying our knowledge about animal and group social behavior motivation and responses to environmental fields and our understanding of animal perceptual limitations and capabilities which are often different from ours pe er and kramer schadt 2008 we see opportunities for advancement in this area on a related theme we see integration between social agent based models for human actors and ibms for the riverine biota that are affected by their decisions is another frontier in applied research for example agent based modeling has been used to allocate waste loads and water ding et al 2016 models fully integrating human decision makers with animals in downstream ecosystems have not been explored we see this as part of a general trend toward integrating human and societal systems with ecological systems finally a frontier of research that remains is to integrate individual based models with biogeochemical models and functionally defined ecosystem states requiring mass balance grimm et al 2017 this challenge is starting to be addressed by merging ibms with dynamic ecosystem models strauss et al 2017 the science to understand carbon and nutrient dynamics is increasingly focused on the incidence of hot spots and hot moments at the terrestrial aquatic interface although biotic processes strongly mediate biogeochemical cycles at the terrestrial aquatic interface the challenge of developing hybrid models that combine these conceptually distinct approaches remains for our metaphorical downstream researchers these are a few examples of many possible future directions or unwinding braids in the channel of riverine ecology aided by ibms

25259,one third of contemporary tropical forests is designated by national forest services for timber production tropical forests are also increasingly affected by anthropogenic disturbances however there is still much uncertainty around the capacity of tropical forests to recover their timber volume after logging as well as other disturbances such as fires large blow downs and extreme droughts and thus on the long term sustainability of logging we developed an original bayesian hierarchical model of volume dynamics with differential equations vdde to infer the dynamic of timber volumes as the result of two ecosystem processes volume gains from tree growth and volume losses from tree mortality both processes are expressed as explicit functions of the forest maturity i e the overall successional stage of the forest that primarily depends on the frequency and severity of the disturbances that the forest has undergone as a case study the vdde model was calibrated with data from paracou a long term disturbance experiment in a neotropical forest where over 56 ha of permanent forest plots were logged with different intensities and censused for 31 years with this model we could predict timber recovery at paracou at the end of a cutting cycle depending on the logging intensity the rotation cycle length and the proportion of commercial volume the vdde modelling framework developed presents three main advantages i it can be calibrated with large tree inventories which are widely available from national forest inventories or logging concession management plans and are easy to measure both on the field and with remote sensing ii it depends on only a few input parameters which can be an advantage in tropical regions where data availability is scarce iii the modelling framework is flexible enough to explicitly include the effect of other types of disturbances both natural and anthropogenic e g blow downs fires and climate change on the forest maturity and thus to predict future timber provision in the tropics in a context of global changes keywords disturbance recovery tropical forest management sustainability ecosystem modelling 1 introduction tropical forests are increasingly prone to anthropogenic disturbances in 2017 only 20 of the remaining tropical forests were considered as undisturbed and structurally intact potapov et al 2017 and this proportion is likely to decrease under future human pressure lewis et al 2015 disturbances here defined as occasional events provoking sharp biomass losses rykiel 1985 alter forest structure notably average tree height tyukavina et al 2016 rutishauser et al 2016 thus decreasing in turn carbon and timber stocks espírito santo et al 2014 human activities are increasing the frequency and severity of disturbances in tropical forests both directly e g through logging and fires potapov et al 2017 and indirectly e g through climate change and forest fragmentation laurance and williamson 2001 in this context assessing the effect of disturbances on the recovery of tropical forests is of paramount importance to better estimate future timber provision the latter is predominantly done through selective logging that consists in harvesting a few high value tree species and leaving the rest of the forest to natural recovery such forest management is widespread it has been estimated that between 2005 and 2010 more than 50 of carbon emissions from tropical forest degradation were caused by selective logging pearson et al 2017 and 425 mha c 30 of the world wet tropical forests are currently intended for timber production by national forest services blaser et al 2011 pan et al 2013 though most of the forest cover is maintained after selective logging typically 50 90 asner et al 2002 cannon et al 1994 laporte et al 2007 opening the forest and felling trees has deep environmental consequences such as an obvious reduction of timber stocks keller et al 2004 but also large carbon

sufficient to recover c stocks but not the volume of commercial species rutishauser et al 2015 roopsind et al 2017 leading to unsustainable wood production on the long run there has been a strong debate over the past two decades on the role of selective logging in production forests as a tool for tropical forest conservation rice et al 1997 bawa and seidler 1998 putz et al 2001 edwards et al 2014 if logged forests are to be considered as a piece of an integrative conservation scheme they should at least retain most of their environmental and economical values in time this is the main challenge for modern tropical forest management sustainable forest management is indeed defined by the international tropical timber organisation as the process of managing forest to achieve one or more clearly specified objectives of management without undue reduction of its inherent values and future productivity and without undue undesirable effects on the physical and social environment itto 1992 due to the social and economical benefits it brings sustainable timber harvest is even considered to be an efficient tool that gives additional value to forests that would else be cleared for agriculture edwards et al 2014 one of the cornerstone of sustainability in forest management is the maintenance of high productivity itto 1992 to allow the recovery of timber stocks at the end of a cutting cycle this is a critical point as in most selectively logged forests this criterion is not achieved and many studies report a drop in total volume at the end of the first cutting cycle putz et al 2012 previous studies simulating post logging timber recovery have made large uses of individual based models huth and ditzer 2001 kammesheidt et al 2001 valle et al 2007 sebbenn et al 2008 or transition matrix models macpherson et al 2010 gourlet fleury et al 2005a b such models perform well at locally predicting forest dynamics liang and picard 2013 but their high level of complexity and data requirements make the understanding of emergent patterns uneasy grimm 2005 furthermore recruitment of small trees is a key process for long term prediction in transition matrix models as well as in individual based models liang and picard 2013 berger et al 2008 fischer et al 2016 and requires data from permanent sample plots with measurements of trees from relatively low size classes typically above 10 cm of diameter at breast height dbh or less gourlet fleury et al 2005a b phillips et al 2004 because small trees are particularly numerous in tropical forests measuring them is costly picard et al 2010 kiyono et al 2011 for example it takes approximately 10 15 times longer to measure all trees above 10 cm dbh than only trees above 50 cm dbh alder and synnott 1992 in this context high quality data coming from long running permanent sample plots remain scarce in the tropics hampering large scale modelling of forest dynamics that would feed forest management plans with robust productivity predictions picard et al 2010 on the other side of the spectrum coarse scale models such as dynamic global vegetation models dgvm e g lpj dgvm sitch et al 2003 allow efficient large scale forest dynamics prediction with little input data relying on a wide set of mechanistic assumptions these models were initially developed to simulate ecosystem carbon fluxes but can be used to predict volume dynamics when coupled with individual based models e g seib dgvm sato et al 2007 nevertheless dgvms generally adopt a top down approach and are thus not fit to integrate field data such as inventory data that are merely used for validation as a consequence dgvms can sometimes have conflicting results and poorly predict observed regional patterns of carbon dynamics johnson et al 2016 in this study we propose an original model of volume dynamics with differential equations vdde to assess total volume stocks and recovery based on forest inventory data instead of using detailed information i e all trees to model all demographic process i e recruitment growth and mortality with great precision we deliberately chose to favour model simplicity and rely upon broadly available data i e the volume of all trees above 50 cm dbh the official minimum cutting dbh in most tropical countries blaser et al 2011 hereinafter referred to as total volume the vdde model was developed and calibrated with data from the paracou research station a long term large scale disturbance experiment in amazonia where 56 ha of tropical forest have been monitored for 30 years after being disturbed selective logging poison girdling fuelwood harvesting anthropogenic or natural disturbances such as logging or droughts affect forests as a whole and induce a shift in forest functioning hérault and piponiot 2018 even though the return frequency of these episodic succession inducing events is not well known this abrupt disturbance slow recovery has long been described in tropical forests as well as in temperate and boreal forests frolking et al 2009 liu et al 2011 chambers et al 2013 our assumption is that both the volume gain and the volume loss from mortality hereinafter referred to as volume mortality inherently depend on the overall successional stage of a forest rödig et al 2018 volkova et al 2018 hereinafter referred to as forest maturity while at our study site a limited number of disturbances selective logging poison girdling and fuelwood harvesting were experienced tropical forests may undergo many other forms of anthropogenic and natural disturbances such as droughts or fires that similarly to logging are associated with over mortality that can drastically decrease trees 50 cm dbh volume their effect on the forest volume dynamics can thus be modelled within the vdde framework as a decrease in the forest maturity 2 methods 2 1 study site the study is based on data from paracou research station 5 18 n 52 55 w a long term large scale disturbance experiment located in a lowland tropical forest in french guiana gourlet fleury et al 2004 the climate is affected by the north south movements of the inter tropical convergence zone and the site receives nearly two thirds of its annual 3041 mm of precipitation between mid march and mid june and less than 50 mm per month in september and october wagner et al 2011 the forest composition is typical of the guyana shield rainforests ter steege et al 2013 dominated by chrysobalanaceae fabaceae and lecythidaceae and with approximately 180 species of trees 10 cm dbh per ha 12 permanent forest plots 75 ha total were monitored for 31 year from 1984 to 2015 9 plots 56 25 ha total of the 12 plots underwent different logging treatments from 1986 to 1988 i 3 plots were selectively logged in 1986 causing a median volume loss of 34 1 m3 95 credibility interval 24 4 62 0 m3 ha 1 ii 6 were selectively logged in 1986 and were then applied timber stand improvement from 1987 to 1988 treatment induced over mortality in those plots lasted until 1990 causing a median volume loss of 90 1 m3 ha 1 95 credibility interval 52 4 138 3 m3 ha 1 2 2 measurements and volume computation in all plots all trees 10 cm dbh were identified tagged and mapped and had their dbh measured every year between 1984 and 1995 and every 2 years since then 1997 2015 the volume v i p k m3 of each tree i in plot p at census k 1 was calculated using a locally calibrated equation guitet et al 2016 currently used by the national forest service 1 i i p k v i p k 0 035829 8 7634 dbh i p k 2 where i p k is the set of live trees 50 cm

trees from species that were effectively logged in paracou at the time of the experiment the list of logged species in paracou is provided in table e2 2 3 conceptual framework forest maturity in the newly developed vdde model presented here the dynamic of total volume is the result of two ecosystem processes volume gains from tree growth and volume losses from tree mortality fig 1 these processes are both expressed as functions of forest maturity forest maturity is a hidden variable of the vdde model that gradually increases over time until a new disturbance either natural e g large blow down or human induced e g logging occurs and abruptly decreases forest maturity see fig 2 to capture the disturbance recovery dynamic we define the forest maturity as the time it would take for a given forest stand to grow from scratch and reach its current state in the absence of major disturbances the forest maturity is thus expressed in a time equivalent measure for example in years by definition the maturity and total volume are null when no tree has reached 50 cm dbh not observed in our data let us consider the theoretical case where the forest recovers from scratch and is not subject to any disturbance let t be the maturity of the stand in years v t 0 0 and t 0 v t 0 with v t the total volume of the stand at maturity t the total volume change is modelled as 4 dv t dt g t m t the volume gain from growth g t is the stand annual volume productivity by analogy with carbon sequestration in plants malhi 2012 we consider this net volume productivity to be the difference of gross volume productivity gvp t and the volume loss due to respiration vr t the gross volume productivity gvp increases with forest maturity until reaching a finite limit the maximum gross productivity α g 5 gvp t α g 1 e β g t where β g is the rate at which the asymptotic state is reached note that gvp t increases with forest maturity and decelerates when approaching maximum gross productivity the respiration vr i e the energy cost of maintenance is proportional to the total volume 6 vr t θ v t where θ is a constant note that vr t is assumed to increase linearly with total volume the net volume productivity is given by the difference of gvp t and vr t resulting in a hump shaped curve fig 3 similar to previous results from forest carbon cycle chen et al 2002 he et al 2012 volkova et al 2018 we expect the annual volume mortality to reach in time a finite limit α m at a rate β m we thus have 7 t 0 g t gvp t vr t α g 1 e β g t θ v t m t α m 1 e β m t dv t dt g t m t we get the non

of logging on commercial species only a proportion of the total volume is made of commercial species i e species that have a merchantable value we define v k ω k v t k the volume of commercial species at census k where ω k is the proportion of commercial species as a of total volume and t k the maturity selective logging targets commercial species depending on the logging techniques and the precision of timber harvesting logging can cause a varying amount of damage to the residual stand let δv be the total volume loss caused by logging part of this volume loss is the extracted volume vext i e the volume of commercial trees that have been purposely felled the rest is the incidental damage to non commercial trees the extracted volume is modelled as 12 vext ω 0 1 ψ δ v where ω 0 is the initial proportion of commercial species prior to logging ψ 1 is the precision of tree harvesting i e how well it targets commercial species if ψ 1 δv vext all the volume loss is intentional and there is no incidental damage if ψ 0 vext ω 0 δv the volume loss caused by logging harvested trees incidental damage is not directional and affects randomly commercial and non commercial trees in the same proportion as their occurrence in the forest if ψ 0 vext ω 0 δv logging affects particularly non commercial species which can be the specific case of silvicultural treatments when the largest non commercial trees are purposely killed to release competition logging thus changes the proportion of commercial species let ω 0 be the initial proportion of commercial species and ω 1 the post logging proportion of commercial species we have 13 ω 1 v 0 vext v 0 δ v ω 0 1 ω 0 ψ δ v v 0 1 δ v v 0 with v 0 the initial commercial volume v 0 the initial total volume δv the total volume loss caused by logging vext the extracted commercial volume and ψ 1 the logging precision modelling recruitment in the absence of further information we make the conservative assumption that the growth and mortality of trees 50 cm dbh do not differ between commercial and none commercial species however if the proportion of commercial volume ω differs between trees 50 cm dbh and trees 50 cm dbh as can happen when big commercial trees are selectively logged decreasing the proportion of commercial volume in trees 50 cm dbh the proportion of commercial volume can recover through the recruitment of trees from dbh 50 cm to dbh 50 cm let pr j be the proportion of volume gain from the recruitment of trees 50 cm dbh to 50 cm dbh the remaining volume gain comes from the growth of trees already dbh 50 cm dbh j years after logging the proportion of commercial volume in recruited trees is not significantly different from the pre logging proportion of commercial volume ω 0 see appendix a fig a2 we thus have 14 v t j 1 ω j 1 v t j ω j g t j ω 0 pr j recruitment ω j 1 pr j growth m t j ω j with pr j the proportion of recruitment over the total volume gain g t j j years after logging and t j the maturity of the plot j years after logging we model the proportion of recruitment of trees 50 cm dbh as a function of the total volume v t j 15 logit pr j γ 0 γ 1 ln v t j in this model the proportion of recruitment is 1 when the total volume is null and decreases thereafter observations and predictions in paracou are presented in appendix a fig a3 2 4 inference bayesian hierarchical models were inferred through mcmc methods using an adaptive form of the hamiltonian monte carlo sampling carpenter et al 2015 codes were developed using the r language r development core team 2008 we hereafter explicit the models that were inferred parameters priors distribution are reported in table e1 covariance structure in this study we have data from 12 plots all from a single area of about 500 ha we assume that all plots have similar disturbance history prior to logging and that they consequently have the same initial forest maturity t 0 for control plots p we thus have t p a t 0 with t p 1 the maturity at first census for disturbed plots the forest maturity at the first census after the disturbance 1987 for logged plots without timber stand improvement and 1990 for plots with timber stand improvement is t p 1 t 0 tloss

disturbance δv in m3 ha 1 analogous to a disturbance intensity is the difference in each disturbed plot between the pre disturbance volume in 1986 in paracou and the volume at the first post

long as 4 years the first post disturbance census was then set to 1990 the extracted volume vext is the volume of harvested trees in m3 ha 1 all plots p in paracou were subdivided in 4 subplots j and for each subplot the logging efficiency ω ext p j vext p j δ v p j and the proportion of commercial volume ω 0 p j were assessed we then modelled the logging efficiency as 20 ω ext p j b eta α p j β p

error parameter the data and results are presented in appendix a cumulative volume changes to avoid focusing on yearly fluctuations and improve our predictive strength instead of annual volume changes we used to infer the vdde model cumulative volume changes i e the annual volume changes integrated over time as suggested for example in walters 1999 thompson et al 2001 cumulative volume growth cvg

approximately half of the censused period to calibrate the model and make predictions over the validation period 16 years post logging predictions are then compared with the original data fig 5 2 5 simulations to illustrate some possible uses of the vdde model we simulated commercial volume recovery at our site under i current conditions and ii scenarios reflecting possible effects of future climate changes on disturbance regimes current conditions commercial volume recovery at the end of a cutting cycle in paracou conditions depending on the logging intensity extracted volume in m3 ha 1 on the cutting cycle length and on the initial proportion of commercial timber was assessed with the following steps a a set of parameters is randomly picked from the parameter posterior distribution b for every values of logging intensity vext between 0 and 30 m3 ha 1 we calculate the volume loss δ v vext ω 0 ψ 1 and the corresponding post logging maturity t 1 estimated as v t 1 v t 0 δv with v t 0 the volume at the initial maturity t 0 and v t 1 the volume at the post logging maturity given the set of parameters from a c the post logging proportion of commercial timber ω 1 is calculated with eq 13 with the initial proportion of commercial timber ω 0 being either 10 20 50 or 100 in the latter case ω 1 ω 0 1 and the proportion ωf of commercial volume at the end of the cutting cycle is estimated with eq 14 d the commercial volume recovery is then estimated as 28 vrec v t 1 trot ω f v t 1 ω 1 with trot the cutting cycle length between 5 and 100 yr e steps a d are repeated with 1000 sets of parameters and summary statistics are then calculated in the context of global changes to illustrate the potential effect of anthropogenic impacts on future volume stocks we tested how sensitive our results were to modifications in mortality parameter α m and initial maturity parameter t0 the total volume was simulated under the hypothesis of a decrease in initial maturity caused for example by increased frequency of disturbances and an increase of volume mortality following the steps a a set of parameters is randomly picked from the posterior distribution b new parameters are calculated α m 1 π m α m π m between 0 and 1 corresponding to an increase in mortality between 0 and 100 and t 0 1 π t t 0 π t between 0 and 1 corresponding to a decrease in initial maturity between 0 and 100 c total volume predictions are made with those new sets of parameters d steps a c are repeated with 1000 sets of parameters and summary statistics are calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 accuracy of the model predictions in this study we developed an original model that combines stocks here total volumes and fluxes here volume changes estimation in one single integrative framework stocks are the integrated resultant of fluxes and the estimation of one flux affects the estimation of the others parameters posterior calibrated with paracou data are reported in table 1 the goodness of prediction of the volume recovery is illustrated in figs 4 and b 4 with this rather simple model we were able to predict the variability of trajectories in total volume recovery for the paracou dataset fig 4 when calibrating the vdde model with only the first 15 years of post logging data i e approx half of the censused period predictions on the last 10 15 years of data fig 5 were still satisfyingly accurate the predicted pre logging maturity value is 212 186 238 yrs equivalent table 1 this does not mean that the forest has 212 years but rather that it would take an estimated 212 years for the forest to reach its pre logging state in the absence of disturbance logging provokes an estimated loss of maturity 90 62 117 yrs equivalent and an additional 72 64 80 yrs equivalent after silvicultural treatments fig 4 3 2 calibration data may come from diverse sources one of the main advantages of the vdde modelling framework is the basic requirement in terms of calibration data only measurements of trees above 50 cm are needed which are rather easy to measure typically 35 trees 50 cm dbh per ha in the tropics alder and synnott 1992 and 22 to 32 trees per ha in paracou and can thus be measured on wide areas covered by national forest inventories therefore the vdde model could be calibrated on a wide range of readily available data the only restriction lies in the fact that the vdde model requires at least 2 censuses to estimate total volume stocks and changes fortunately many territories are currently implementing long term monitoring of their forests under the redd scheme maniatis and mollicone 2010 and these datasets could be fruitfully used to calibrate the vdde model similarly in the brazilian amazon logging concessions in national forests are required to have permanent sample plots 1 ha for every 250 ha of logged forests balieiro et al 2010 that could also be used to estimate the potential for volume recovery at concession level or wider scale when aggregated static data can also be used to calibrate the vdde model by adding the measurements of total volume stocks to the overall likelihood of the model this means that data such as static national inventories can also greatly help improve estimates of total volume and volume recovery for example the national forest inventory that is being carried out in brazil aims at measuring all trees above 40 cm dbh in 4 0 2 ha plots in each 20 km 20 km cell in the whole brazilian amazon brando et al 2014 in national forest concessions the brazilian forest service carries out large inventories of all trees above 50 cm dbh to assess the available timber resource previous to logging balieiro et al 2010 we developed the vdde modelling framework to estimate the total volume and commercial volume recovery after selective logging but this framework could be extended to carbon stocks because it is generic enough in terms of ecosystem dynamics this model could also be used to explore tropical forests resilience to other disturbance types such as fire and or drought holdsworth and uhl 1997 brando et al 2014 or even the forest recovery after clear cutting poorter et al 2016 results could then be compared to explore the resilience of tropical forests to human and natural disturbances the methodology may need some adaptations as some specific problems may require a more complex model 3 3 model limitations while the vdde model relies upon sensible assumptions their consequences on the model behaviour may be questioned for instance we assumed that the volume change of commercial species is similar to the total volume change during the recovery period however because the designation of timber species is generally based on their mechanical wood properties the commercial species pool may be biased towards hard wood species chave et al 2009 with generally slow growth rates fargeon et al 2016 however not all commercial species do grow slowly as shown by some fast growing light wood species like balsa ochroma pyramidale condit et al 1993 with interesting mechanical properties bossu et al 2016 the conservative hypothesis of equal relative volume changes is to our point of view sensible it is however worth mentioning that harvesting only very slow growing species would have the effect of lowering the volume recovery and thus the sustainable logging intensity logging has been proven to lower the height and thus the volume of the stand rutishauser et al 2016 resulting in a possible overestimation of timber volume recovery with current allometric equations calibrated in old growth forests guitet et al 2016 when data becomes available some new volumetric equations should be calibrated in 2nd harvest forests to update volume estimates assigning the same initial maturity value to all plots may also be questioned indeed tropical forests are shaped by very local treefall gap dynamics swaine et al 1987 that could explain small inter plot variations in forest maturity from a practical standpoint however it is difficult to disentangle the inter plot variations in initial forest maturity from the inter plot variations in potential volume vmax with limited time series in the absence of further information we thus made the hypothesis that local disturbances from treefall gaps were evened out across our relatively large size plots 6 25 ha and that all plots had the same disturbance history the model as presented here has been shown to be a useful predictor of post logging volume recovery at a local scale however one key challenge for forest management today especially in the tropics where data is scarce is to have an understanding of ecological processes at a wider scale from the landscape to the regional scale makela et al 2000 as stated before one advantage of the vdde modelling framework is to allow a variety of widely available calibration data which makes robust regional estimates of volume recovery possible to upscale predictions a possible way is to add spatially explicit covariates to the model parameters for instance global maps of climatic fick and hijmans 2017 or soil variables hengl et al 2014 as proxies of model parameters 3 4 applying the vdde model to assess logging sustainability the commercial volume recovered at the end of the cutting cycle is presented in fig 6 depending on the cutting cycle length logging intensity and proportion of commercial volume the most influential variable on the volume recovery is the proportion of commercial species increasing proportion of commercial species in panels from left to right on fig 6 both the logging intensity y axis and the length of the cutting cycle x axis increases the volume recovery when the initial proportion of commercial volume is 10 left panel the forest hardly recovers more than 5 m3 ha 1 even after a cutting cycle of 100 years on the contrary if all species are commercial 100 of commercial volume commercial volume recovery following a logging intensity of 20 m3 ha 1 can be as high as 23 19 39 m3 ha 1 at the end of a 60 years cutting cycle to be considered sustainable selective logging should at least allow the recovery of initial timber volumes at the end of each cutting cycle otherwise the depletion of timber stocks could undermine the conservation value of managed forests in the long term as the loss of economical value would make them more prone to conversion to other land uses with lower ecological benefits edwards et al 2014 in french guiana 75 of timber production depends solely on 3 species dicorynia guianenesis qualea rosea and sextonia rubra french guiana nfs statistics unpublished data in paracou the volume of those 3 species represents 20 of the total volume and is consistent with what can be seen over the guyafor network a network of permanent plots distributed over the french guiana permanent forest estate piponiot et al 2016a grau et al 2017 the official cutting cycle length is 65 yr in french guiana which is particularly high for the tropics blaser et al 2011 and the logging intensity for the past 15 years has been 8 29 m3 ha 1 piponiot et al 2016a under such conditions the results of our model show that only 0 4 1 m3 ha 1 of commercial volume are recovered at the end of the cutting cycle fig 6 selective logging cannot thus be considered sustainable under current conditions in french guiana compared to other tropical countries french guiana s logging policies are especially strict e g cutting cycles longer than the usual 30 years blaser et al 2011 if commercial timber stocks are far from being recovered in french guiana there is little chance that logging can be considered sustainable in other tropical countries it is however worth mentioning that neighbouring countries like suriname and brazil harvest a larger variety of commercial tree species reis et al 2010 which might allow higher commercial volume recovery see fig 6 nevertheless most studies show that initial volume stocks are indeed not recovered in selectively logged forests across the tropics putz et al 2012 3 5 applying the vdde model to assess the effect of diversifying timber sources for a proportion of commercial species of 100 i e the total volume is commercial the volume recovered at the end of the rotation cycle increases with the logging intensity fig 6 nevertheless when the proportion of commercial volume decreases panel b increasing the logging intensity can decrease the commercial volume recovery this is because when logging focuses on only a few commercial species their proportion at the next logging cycle is inevitably lower see 2 3 as compared to the other species this means that even when the total volume is recovered at the end of the cutting cycle the relative proportion of commercial species will be lower and thus at the next logging cycle the volume recovery will decrease after a few logging cycles the proportion of commercial species might be so low that their exploitation may become not economically sound the smaller the initial pool of commercial species the stronger the depletion this clearly highlights the benefits of diversifying the pool of harvested species not only at one cutting cycle but also for changing this pool in time so that different species are harvested across different cutting cycles indeed the commercial volume recovery is low in the case of a restrictive pool of commercial species e g less than 6 m3 ha 1 after 65 yr in paracou if only 20 of the total volume is commercial at the 2nd harvest the available commercial volume will be too low such that harvesting the same forest stands several times will inevitably mean changing the pool of harvested species at the 2nd harvest 3 6 applying the vdde model to assess timber availability in human modified forests under climate change tropical forests are not spared from ongoing global changes malhi et al 2014 most tropical forests undergo increasing disturbance regimes such as fires logging or drought lewis et al 2015 today the so called intact forest landscape in the tropics has been reduced to 20 of the tropical forest area potapov et al 2017 and this proportion is likely to continue decreasing future climate is predicted to be hotter and seasonally drier in most tropical landscapes stocker 2014 provoking a decrease in biomass through the increase of tree mortality allen et al 2010 in amazonian forests this continuous increase in tree mortality has already been described brienen et al 2015 within our modeling framework an increased disturbance regime will inevitably decrease the forest maturity we simulated a 0 100 decrease of forest maturity and a drier climate will inevitably increase the volume mortality fig 7 for instance biomass mortality has increased by approximately 30 in amazonian permanent sample plots between 1985 and 2010 brienen et al 2015 for a similar increase in volume mortality total volume stocks in paracou are predicted to decrease from 80 68 167 to 65 86 153 m3 ha 1 i e a 19 decrease numbers between brackets are the 95 credibility interval and if those forests also suffer from increasing disturbances and their forest maturity subsequently decreases for example by 40 then the total volume would be 47 40 100 m3 ha 1 i e a 41 decrease the combined effect of an increase of mortality and of the disturbance regime could thus seriously lower available timber resource in tropical forests this has to be taken into account for future scenarios of timber provision in increasingly human modified forests 4 conclusion in this study we present an original modelling approach of timber volume recovery in tropical forests as a case study we assess the volume recovery potential of a selectively logged forest in french guiana we show that under current conditions selective logging is not sustainable insofar as the commercial volume which is the main productive value of a logged forest is not recovered at the end of a typical logging cycle we also predict timber availability in the case of an increase mortality and a decrease of forest maturity that will likely be triggered by future climate change and human disturbances such as fires clearcuts and logging the main advantages of the modelling framework presented here are threefold i it can be calibrated with widely available data i e the volume of trees 50 cm dbh ii it can explicitly integrate the effect of disturbances and iii it is generic enough to be applied for instance to carbon stocks to provide meaningful insights to forest managers and policy makers this model should now be applied to a larger scale integrating data from permanent forest plots as well as national forest inventories

25259,one third of contemporary tropical forests is designated by national forest services for timber production tropical forests are also increasingly affected by anthropogenic disturbances however there is still much uncertainty around the capacity of tropical forests to recover their timber volume after logging as well as other disturbances such as fires large blow downs and extreme droughts and thus on the long term sustainability of logging we developed an original bayesian hierarchical model of volume dynamics with differential equations vdde to infer the dynamic of timber volumes as the result of two ecosystem processes volume gains from tree growth and volume losses from tree mortality both processes are expressed as explicit functions of the forest maturity i e the overall successional stage of the forest that primarily depends on the frequency and severity of the disturbances that the forest has undergone as a case study the vdde model was calibrated with data from paracou a long term disturbance experiment in a neotropical forest where over 56 ha of permanent forest plots were logged with different intensities and censused for 31 years with this model we could predict timber recovery at paracou at the end of a cutting cycle depending on the logging intensity the rotation cycle length and the proportion of commercial volume the vdde modelling framework developed presents three main advantages i it can be calibrated with large tree inventories which are widely available from national forest inventories or logging concession management plans and are easy to measure both on the field and with remote sensing ii it depends on only a few input parameters which can be an advantage in tropical regions where data availability is scarce iii the modelling framework is flexible enough to explicitly include the effect of other types of disturbances both natural and anthropogenic e g blow downs fires and climate change on the forest maturity and thus to predict future timber provision in the tropics in a context of global changes keywords disturbance recovery tropical forest management sustainability ecosystem modelling 1 introduction tropical forests are increasingly prone to anthropogenic disturbances in 2017 only 20 of the remaining tropical forests were considered as undisturbed and structurally intact potapov et al 2017 and this proportion is likely to decrease under future human pressure lewis et al 2015 disturbances here defined as occasional events provoking sharp biomass losses rykiel 1985 alter forest structure notably average tree height tyukavina et al 2016 rutishauser et al 2016 thus decreasing in turn carbon and timber stocks espírito santo et al 2014 human activities are increasing the frequency and severity of disturbances in tropical forests both directly e g through logging and fires potapov et al 2017 and indirectly e g through climate change and forest fragmentation laurance and williamson 2001 in this context assessing the effect of disturbances on the recovery of tropical forests is of paramount importance to better estimate future timber provision the latter is predominantly done through selective logging that consists in harvesting a few high value tree species and leaving the rest of the forest to natural recovery such forest management is widespread it has been estimated that between 2005 and 2010 more than 50 of carbon emissions from tropical forest degradation were caused by selective logging pearson et al 2017 and 425 mha c 30 of the world wet tropical forests are currently intended for timber production by national forest services blaser et al 2011 pan et al 2013 though most of the forest cover is maintained after selective logging typically 50 90 asner et al 2002 cannon et al 1994 laporte et al 2007 opening the forest and felling trees has deep environmental consequences such as an obvious reduction of timber stocks keller et al 2004 but also large carbon

b rutishauser et al 2015 blanc et al 2009 before being selectively logged again with logging rotation generally ranging between 20 and 30 years blaser et al 2011 such cutting cycle duration may be sufficient to recover c stocks but not the volume of commercial species rutishauser et al 2015 roopsind et al 2017 leading to unsustainable wood production on the long run there has been a strong debate over the past two decades on the role of selective logging in production forests as a tool for tropical forest conservation rice et al 1997 bawa and seidler 1998 putz et al 2001 edwards et al 2014 if logged forests are to be considered as a piece of an integrative conservation scheme they should at least retain most of their environmental and economical values in time this is the main challenge for modern tropical forest management sustainable forest management is indeed defined by the international tropical timber organisation as the process of managing forest to achieve one or more clearly specified objectives of management without undue reduction of its inherent values and future productivity and without undue undesirable effects on the physical and social environment itto 1992 due to the social and economical benefits it brings sustainable timber harvest is even considered to be an efficient tool that gives additional value to forests that would else be cleared for agriculture edwards et al 2014 one of the cornerstone of sustainability in forest management is the maintenance of high productivity itto 1992 to allow the recovery of timber stocks at the end of a cutting cycle this is a critical point as in most selectively logged forests this criterion is not achieved and many studies report a drop in total volume at the end of the first cutting cycle putz et al 2012 previous studies simulating post logging timber recovery have made large uses of individual based models huth and ditzer 2001 kammesheidt et al 2001 valle et al 2007 sebbenn et al 2008 or transition matrix models macpherson et al 2010 gourlet fleury et al 2005a b such models perform well at locally predicting forest dynamics liang and picard 2013 but their high level of complexity and data requirements make the understanding of emergent patterns uneasy grimm 2005 furthermore recruitment of small trees is a key process for long term prediction in transition matrix models as well as in individual based models liang and picard 2013 berger et al 2008 fischer et al 2016 and requires data from permanent sample plots with measurements of trees from relatively low size classes typically above 10 cm of diameter at breast height dbh or less gourlet fleury et al 2005a b phillips et al 2004 because small trees are particularly numerous in tropical forests measuring them is costly picard et al 2010 kiyono et al 2011 for example it takes approximately 10 15 times longer to measure all trees above 10 cm dbh than only trees above 50 cm dbh alder and synnott 1992 in this context high quality data coming from long running permanent sample plots remain scarce in the tropics hampering large scale modelling of forest dynamics that would feed forest management plans with robust productivity predictions picard et al 2010 on the other side of the spectrum coarse scale models such as dynamic global vegetation models dgvm e g lpj dgvm sitch et al 2003 allow efficient large scale forest dynamics prediction with little input data relying on a wide set of mechanistic assumptions these models were initially developed to simulate ecosystem carbon fluxes but can be used to predict volume dynamics when coupled with individual based models e g seib dgvm sato et al 2007 nevertheless dgvms generally adopt a top down approach and are thus not fit to integrate field data such as inventory data that are merely used for validation as a consequence dgvms can sometimes have conflicting results and poorly predict observed regional patterns of carbon dynamics johnson et al 2016 in this study we propose an original model of volume dynamics with differential equations vdde to assess total volume stocks and recovery based on forest inventory data instead of using detailed information i e all trees to model all demographic process i e recruitment growth and mortality with great precision we deliberately chose to favour model simplicity and rely upon broadly available data i e the volume of all trees above 50 cm dbh the official minimum cutting dbh in most tropical countries blaser et al 2011 hereinafter referred to as total volume the vdde model was developed and calibrated with data from the paracou research station a long term large scale disturbance experiment in amazonia where 56 ha of tropical forest have been monitored for 30 years after being disturbed selective logging poison girdling fuelwood harvesting anthropogenic or natural disturbances such as logging or droughts affect forests as a whole and induce a shift in forest functioning hérault and piponiot 2018 even though the return frequency of these episodic succession inducing events is not well known this abrupt disturbance slow recovery has long been described in tropical forests as well as in temperate and boreal forests frolking et al 2009 liu et al 2011 chambers et al 2013 our assumption is that both the volume gain and the volume loss from mortality hereinafter referred to as volume mortality inherently depend on the overall successional stage of a forest rödig et al 2018 volkova et al 2018 hereinafter referred to as forest maturity while at our study site a limited number of disturbances selective logging poison girdling and fuelwood harvesting were experienced tropical forests may undergo many other forms of anthropogenic and natural disturbances such as droughts or fires that similarly to logging are associated with over mortality that can drastically decrease trees 50 cm dbh volume their effect on the forest volume dynamics can thus be modelled within the vdde framework as a decrease in the forest maturity 2 methods 2 1 study site the study is based on data from paracou research station 5 18 n 52 55 w a long term large scale disturbance experiment located in a lowland tropical forest in french guiana gourlet fleury et al 2004 the climate is affected by the north south movements of the inter tropical convergence zone and the site receives nearly two thirds of its annual 3041 mm of precipitation between mid march and mid june and less than 50 mm per month in september and october wagner et al 2011 the forest composition is typical of the guyana shield rainforests ter steege et al 2013 dominated by chrysobalanaceae fabaceae and lecythidaceae and with approximately 180 species of trees 10 cm dbh per ha 12 permanent forest plots 75 ha total were monitored for 31 year from 1984 to 2015 9 plots 56 25 ha total of the 12 plots underwent different logging treatments from 1986 to 1988 i 3 plots were selectively logged in 1986 causing a median volume loss of 34 1 m3 95 credibility interval 24 4 62 0 m3 ha 1 ii 6 were selectively logged in 1986 and were then applied timber stand improvement from 1987 to 1988 treatment induced over mortality in those plots lasted until 1990 causing a median volume loss of 90 1 m3 ha 1 95 credibility interval 52 4 138 3 m3 ha 1 2 2 measurements and volume computation in all plots all trees 10 cm dbh were identified tagged and mapped and had their dbh measured every year between 1984 and 1995 and every 2 years since then 1997 2015 the volume v i p k m3 of each tree i in plot p at census k 1 was calculated using a locally calibrated equation guitet et al 2016 currently used by the national forest service 1 i i p k v i p k 0 035829 8 7634 dbh i p k 2 where i p k is the set of live trees 50 cm

p k was 50 cm dbh at census k 1 then v i p k 1 0 and δt k is the time interval between censuses k and k 1 the commercial volume i e the volume of merchantable trees was computed as the sum of all trees from species that were effectively logged in paracou at the time of the experiment the list of logged species in paracou is provided in table e2 2 3 conceptual framework forest maturity in the newly developed vdde model presented here the dynamic of total volume is the result of two ecosystem processes volume gains from tree growth and volume losses from tree mortality fig 1 these processes are both expressed as functions of forest maturity forest maturity is a hidden variable of the vdde model that gradually increases over time until a new disturbance either natural e g large blow down or human induced e g logging occurs and abruptly decreases forest maturity see fig 2 to capture the disturbance recovery dynamic we define the forest maturity as the time it would take for a given forest stand to grow from scratch and reach its current state in the absence of major disturbances the forest maturity is thus expressed in a time equivalent measure for example in years by definition the maturity and total volume are null when no tree has reached 50 cm dbh not observed in our data let us consider the theoretical case where the forest recovers from scratch and is not subject to any disturbance let t be the maturity of the stand in years v t 0 0 and t 0 v t 0 with v t the total volume of the stand at maturity t the total volume change is modelled as 4 dv t dt g t m t the volume gain from growth g t is the stand annual volume productivity by analogy with carbon sequestration in plants malhi 2012 we consider this net volume productivity to be the difference of gross volume productivity gvp t and the volume loss due to respiration vr t the gross volume productivity gvp increases with forest maturity until reaching a finite limit the maximum gross productivity α g 5 gvp t α g 1 e β g t where β g is the rate at which the asymptotic state is reached note that gvp t increases with forest maturity and decelerates when approaching maximum gross productivity the respiration vr i e the energy cost of maintenance is proportional to the total volume 6 vr t θ v t where θ is a constant note that vr t is assumed to increase linearly with total volume the net volume productivity is given by the difference of gvp t and vr t resulting in a hump shaped curve fig 3 similar to previous results from forest carbon cycle chen et al 2002 he et al 2012 volkova et al 2018 we expect the annual volume mortality to reach in time a finite limit α m at a rate β m we thus have 7 t 0 g t gvp t vr t α g 1 e β g t θ v t m t α m 1 e β m t dv t dt g t m t we get the non

of logging on commercial species only a proportion of the total volume is made of commercial species i e species that have a merchantable value we define v k ω k v t k the volume of commercial species at census k where ω k is the proportion of commercial species as a of total volume and t k the maturity selective logging targets commercial species depending on the logging techniques and the precision of timber harvesting logging can cause a varying amount of damage to the residual stand let δv be the total volume loss caused by logging part of this volume loss is the extracted volume vext i e the volume of commercial trees that have been purposely felled the rest is the incidental damage to non commercial trees the extracted volume is modelled as 12 vext ω 0 1 ψ δ v where ω 0 is the initial proportion of commercial species prior to logging ψ 1 is the precision of tree harvesting i e how well it targets commercial species if ψ 1 δv vext all the volume loss is intentional and there is no incidental damage if ψ 0 vext ω 0 δv the volume loss caused by logging harvested trees incidental damage is not directional and affects randomly commercial and non commercial trees in the same proportion as their occurrence in the forest if ψ 0 vext ω 0 δv logging affects particularly non commercial species which can be the specific case of silvicultural treatments when the largest non commercial trees are purposely killed to release competition logging thus changes the proportion of commercial species let ω 0 be the initial proportion of commercial species and ω 1 the post logging proportion of commercial species we have 13 ω 1 v 0 vext v 0 δ v ω 0 1 ω 0 ψ δ v v 0 1 δ v v 0 with v 0 the initial commercial volume v 0 the initial total volume δv the total volume loss caused by logging vext the extracted commercial volume and ψ 1 the logging precision modelling recruitment in the absence of further information we make the conservative assumption that the growth and mortality of trees 50 cm dbh do not differ between commercial and none commercial species however if the proportion of commercial volume ω differs between trees 50 cm dbh and trees 50 cm dbh as can happen when big commercial trees are selectively logged decreasing the proportion of commercial volume in trees 50 cm dbh the proportion of commercial volume can recover through the recruitment of trees from dbh 50 cm to dbh 50 cm let pr j be the proportion of volume gain from the recruitment of trees 50 cm dbh to 50 cm dbh the remaining volume gain comes from the growth of trees already dbh 50 cm dbh j years after logging the proportion of commercial volume in recruited trees is not significantly different from the pre logging proportion of commercial volume ω 0 see appendix a fig a2 we thus have 14 v t j

j years after logging we model the proportion of recruitment of trees 50 cm dbh as a function of the total volume v t j 15 logit pr j γ 0 γ 1 ln v t j in this model the proportion of recruitment is 1 when the total volume is null and decreases thereafter observations and predictions in paracou are presented in appendix a fig a3 2 4 inference bayesian hierarchical models were inferred through mcmc methods using an adaptive form of the hamiltonian monte carlo sampling carpenter et al 2015 codes were developed using the r language r development core team 2008 we hereafter explicit the models that were inferred parameters priors distribution are reported in table e1 covariance structure in this study we have data from 12 plots all from a single area of about 500 ha we assume that all plots have similar disturbance history prior to logging and that they consequently have the same initial forest maturity t 0 for control plots p we thus have t p a t 0 with t p 1 the maturity at first census for disturbed plots the forest maturity at the first census after the disturbance 1987 for logged plots without timber stand improvement and 1990 for plots with timber stand improvement is t p 1 t 0 tloss

disturbance δv in m3 ha 1 analogous to a disturbance intensity is the difference in each disturbed plot between the pre disturbance volume in 1986 in paracou and the volume at the first post

long as 4 years the first post disturbance census was then set to 1990 the extracted volume vext is the volume of harvested trees in m3 ha 1 all plots p in paracou were subdivided in 4 subplots j and

we used to infer the vdde model cumulative volume changes i e the annual volume changes integrated over time as suggested for example in walters 1999 thompson et al 2001 cumulative volume growth cvg

simulations to illustrate some possible uses of the vdde model we simulated commercial volume recovery at our site under i current conditions and ii scenarios reflecting possible effects of future climate changes on disturbance regimes current conditions commercial volume recovery at the end of a cutting cycle in paracou conditions depending on the logging intensity extracted volume in m3 ha 1 on the cutting cycle length and on the initial proportion of commercial timber was assessed with the following steps a a set of parameters is randomly picked from the parameter posterior distribution b for every values of logging intensity vext between 0 and 30 m3 ha 1 we calculate the volume loss δ v vext ω 0 ψ 1 and the corresponding post logging maturity t 1 estimated as v t 1 v t 0 δv with v t 0 the volume at the initial maturity t 0 and v t 1 the volume at the post logging maturity given the set of parameters from a c the post logging proportion of commercial timber ω 1 is calculated with eq 13 with the initial proportion of commercial timber ω 0 being either 10 20 50 or 100 in the latter case ω 1 ω 0 1 and the proportion ωf of commercial volume at the end of the cutting cycle is estimated with eq 14 d the commercial volume recovery is then estimated as 28 vrec v t 1 trot ω f v t 1 ω 1 with trot the cutting cycle length between 5 and 100 yr e steps a d are repeated with 1000 sets of parameters and summary statistics are then calculated in the context of global changes to illustrate the potential effect of anthropogenic impacts on future volume stocks we tested how sensitive our results were to modifications in mortality parameter α m and initial maturity parameter t0 the total volume was simulated under the hypothesis of a decrease in initial maturity caused for example by increased frequency of disturbances and an increase of volume mortality following the steps a a set of parameters is randomly picked from the posterior distribution b new parameters are calculated α m 1 π m α m π m between 0 and 1 corresponding to an increase in mortality between 0 and 100 and t 0 1 π t t 0 π t between 0 and 1 corresponding to a decrease in initial maturity between 0

accuracy of the model predictions in this study we developed an original model that combines stocks here total volumes and fluxes here volume changes estimation in one single integrative framework stocks are the integrated resultant of fluxes and the estimation of one flux affects the estimation of the others parameters posterior calibrated with paracou data are reported in table 1 the goodness of prediction of the volume recovery is illustrated in figs 4 and b 4 with this rather simple model we were able to predict the variability of trajectories in total volume recovery for the paracou dataset fig 4 when calibrating the vdde model with only the first 15 years of post logging data i e approx half of the censused period predictions on the last 10 15 years of data fig 5 were still satisfyingly accurate the predicted pre logging maturity value is 212 186 238 yrs equivalent table 1 this does not mean that the forest has 212 years but rather that it would take an estimated 212 years for the forest to reach its pre logging state in the absence of disturbance logging provokes an estimated loss of maturity 90 62 117 yrs equivalent and an additional 72 64 80 yrs equivalent after silvicultural treatments fig 4 3 2 calibration data may come from diverse sources one of the main advantages of the vdde modelling framework is the basic requirement in terms of calibration data only measurements of trees above 50 cm are needed which are rather easy to measure typically 35 trees 50 cm dbh per ha in the tropics alder and synnott 1992 and 22 to 32 trees per ha in paracou and can thus be measured on wide areas covered by national forest inventories therefore the vdde model could be calibrated on a wide range of readily available data the only restriction lies in the fact that the vdde model requires at least 2 censuses to estimate total volume stocks and changes fortunately many territories are currently implementing long term monitoring of their forests under the redd scheme maniatis and mollicone 2010 and these datasets could be fruitfully used to calibrate the vdde model similarly in the brazilian amazon logging concessions in national forests are required to have permanent sample plots 1 ha for every 250 ha of logged forests balieiro et al 2010 that could also be used to estimate the potential for volume recovery at concession level or wider scale when aggregated static data can also be used to calibrate the vdde model by adding the measurements of total volume stocks to the overall likelihood of the model this means that data such as static national inventories can also greatly help improve estimates of total volume and volume recovery for example the national forest inventory that is being carried out in brazil aims at measuring all trees above 40 cm dbh in 4 0 2 ha plots in each 20 km 20 km cell in the whole brazilian amazon brando et al 2014 in national forest concessions the brazilian forest service carries out large inventories of all trees above 50 cm dbh to assess the available timber resource previous to logging balieiro et al 2010 we developed the vdde modelling framework to estimate the total volume and commercial volume recovery after selective logging but this framework could be extended to carbon stocks because it is generic enough in terms of ecosystem dynamics this model could also be used to explore tropical forests resilience to other disturbance types such as fire and or drought holdsworth and uhl 1997 brando et al 2014 or even the forest recovery after clear cutting poorter et al 2016 results could then be compared to explore the resilience of tropical forests to human and natural disturbances the methodology may need some adaptations as some specific problems may require a more complex model 3 3 model limitations while the vdde model relies upon sensible assumptions their consequences on the model behaviour may be questioned for instance we assumed that the volume change of commercial species is similar to the total volume change during the recovery period however because the designation of timber species is generally based on their mechanical wood properties the commercial species pool may be biased towards hard wood species chave et al 2009 with generally slow growth rates fargeon et al 2016 however not all commercial species do grow slowly as shown by some fast growing light wood species like balsa ochroma pyramidale condit et al 1993 with interesting mechanical properties bossu et al 2016 the conservative hypothesis of equal relative volume changes is to our point of view sensible it is however worth mentioning that harvesting only very slow growing species would have the effect of lowering the volume recovery and thus the sustainable logging intensity logging has been proven to lower the height and thus the volume of the stand rutishauser et al 2016 resulting in a possible overestimation of timber volume recovery with current allometric equations calibrated in old growth forests guitet et al 2016 when data becomes available some new volumetric equations should be calibrated in 2nd harvest forests to update volume estimates assigning the same initial maturity value to all plots may also be questioned indeed tropical forests are shaped by very local treefall gap dynamics swaine et al 1987 that could explain small inter plot variations in forest maturity from a practical standpoint however it is difficult to disentangle the inter plot variations in initial forest maturity from the inter plot variations in potential volume vmax with limited time series in the absence of further information we thus made the hypothesis that local disturbances from treefall gaps were evened out across our relatively large size plots 6 25 ha and that all plots had the same disturbance history the model as presented here has been shown to be a useful predictor of post logging volume recovery at a local scale however one key challenge for forest management today especially in the tropics where data is scarce is to have an understanding of ecological processes at a wider scale from the landscape to the regional scale makela et al 2000 as stated before one advantage of the vdde modelling framework is to allow a variety of widely available calibration data which makes robust regional estimates of volume recovery possible to upscale predictions a possible way is to add spatially explicit covariates to the model parameters for instance global maps of climatic fick and hijmans 2017 or soil variables hengl et al 2014 as proxies of model parameters 3 4 applying the vdde model to assess logging sustainability the commercial volume recovered at the end of the cutting cycle is presented in fig 6 depending on the cutting cycle length logging intensity and proportion of commercial volume the most influential variable on the volume recovery is the proportion of commercial species increasing proportion of commercial species in panels from left to right on fig 6 both the logging intensity y axis and the length of the cutting cycle x axis increases the volume recovery when the initial proportion of commercial volume is 10 left panel the forest hardly recovers more than 5 m3 ha 1 even after a cutting cycle of 100 years on the contrary if all species are commercial 100 of commercial volume commercial volume recovery following a logging intensity of 20 m3 ha 1 can be as high as 23 19 39 m3 ha 1 at the end of a 60 years cutting cycle to be considered sustainable selective logging should at least allow the recovery of initial timber volumes at the end of each cutting cycle otherwise the depletion of timber stocks could undermine the conservation value of managed forests in the long term as the loss of economical value would make them more prone to conversion to other land uses with lower ecological benefits edwards et al 2014 in french guiana 75 of timber production depends solely on 3 species dicorynia guianenesis qualea rosea and sextonia rubra french guiana nfs statistics unpublished data in paracou the volume of those 3 species represents 20 of the total volume and is consistent with what can be seen over the guyafor network a network of permanent plots distributed over the french guiana permanent forest estate piponiot et al 2016a grau et al 2017 the official cutting cycle length is 65 yr in french guiana which is particularly high for the tropics blaser et al 2011 and the logging intensity for the past 15 years has been 8 29 m3 ha 1 piponiot et al 2016a under such conditions the results of our model show that only 0 4 1 m3 ha 1 of commercial volume are recovered at the end of the cutting cycle fig 6 selective logging cannot thus be considered sustainable under current conditions in french guiana compared to other tropical countries french guiana s logging policies are especially strict e g cutting cycles longer than the usual 30 years blaser et al 2011 if commercial timber stocks are far from being recovered in french guiana there is little chance that logging can be considered sustainable in other tropical countries it is however worth mentioning that neighbouring countries like suriname and brazil harvest a larger variety of commercial tree species reis et al 2010 which might allow higher commercial volume recovery see fig 6 nevertheless most studies show that initial volume stocks are indeed not recovered in selectively logged forests across the tropics putz et al 2012 3 5 applying the vdde model to assess the effect of diversifying timber sources for a proportion of commercial species of 100 i e the total volume is commercial the volume recovered at the end of the rotation cycle increases with the logging intensity fig 6 nevertheless when the proportion of commercial volume decreases panel b increasing the logging intensity can decrease the commercial volume recovery this is because when logging focuses on only a few commercial species their proportion at the next logging cycle is inevitably lower see 2 3 as compared to the other species this means that even when the total volume is recovered at the end of the cutting cycle the relative proportion of commercial species will be lower and thus at the next logging cycle the volume recovery will decrease after a few logging cycles the proportion of commercial species might be so low that their exploitation may become not economically sound the smaller the initial pool of commercial species the stronger the depletion this clearly highlights the benefits of diversifying the pool of harvested species not only at one cutting cycle but also for changing this pool in time so that different species are harvested across different cutting cycles indeed the commercial volume recovery is low in the case of a restrictive pool of commercial species e g less than 6 m3 ha 1 after 65 yr in paracou if only 20 of the total volume is commercial at the 2nd harvest the available commercial volume will be too low such that harvesting the same forest stands several times will inevitably mean changing the pool of harvested species at the 2nd harvest 3 6 applying the vdde model to assess timber availability in human modified forests under climate change tropical forests are not spared from ongoing global changes malhi et al 2014 most tropical forests undergo increasing disturbance regimes such as fires logging or drought lewis et al 2015 today the so called intact forest landscape in the tropics has been reduced to 20 of the tropical forest area potapov et al 2017 and this proportion is likely to continue decreasing future climate is predicted to be hotter and seasonally drier in most tropical landscapes stocker 2014 provoking a decrease in biomass through the increase of tree mortality allen et al 2010 in amazonian forests this continuous increase in tree mortality has already been described brienen et al 2015 within our modeling framework an increased disturbance regime will inevitably decrease the forest maturity we simulated a 0 100 decrease of forest maturity and a drier climate will inevitably increase the volume mortality fig 7 for instance biomass mortality has increased by approximately 30 in amazonian permanent sample plots between 1985 and 2010 brienen et al 2015 for a similar increase in volume mortality total volume stocks in paracou are predicted to decrease from 80 68 167 to 65 86 153 m3 ha 1 i e a 19 decrease numbers between brackets are the 95 credibility interval and if those forests also suffer from increasing disturbances and their forest maturity subsequently decreases for example by 40 then the total volume would be 47 40 100 m3 ha 1 i e a 41 decrease the combined effect of an increase of mortality and of the disturbance regime could thus seriously lower available timber resource in tropical forests this has to be taken into account for future scenarios of timber provision in increasingly human modified forests 4 conclusion in this study we present an original modelling approach of timber volume recovery in tropical forests as a case study we assess the volume recovery potential of a selectively logged forest in french guiana we show that under current conditions selective logging is not sustainable insofar as the commercial volume which is the main productive value of a logged forest is not recovered at the end of a typical logging cycle we also predict timber availability in the case of an increase mortality and a decrease of forest maturity that will likely be triggered by future climate change and human disturbances such as fires clearcuts and logging the main advantages of the modelling framework presented here are threefold i it can be calibrated with widely available data i e the volume of trees 50 cm dbh ii it can explicitly integrate the effect of disturbances and iii it is generic enough to be applied for instance to carbon stocks to provide meaningful insights to forest managers and policy makers this model should now be applied to a larger scale integrating data from permanent forest plots as well as national forest inventories
