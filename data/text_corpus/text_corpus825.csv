resilient infrastructures keywords flood hazard mapping physically based modelling empirical modelling physical modelling uncertainty climate decision making 1 introduction flood represents the excess flow that inundates the conveying or holding medium when its capacity has been exceeded getahun and gebre 2015 flooding can be classified into pluvial flooding which results from rainfall causing excessive runoff leading to a rapid increase in water level and fluvial flooding resulting from an increase in the level of water of a stream river causing an overflow into the surrounding environment and coastal regions lin et al 2019 the increase in water level may be a result of excessive rainfall or snowmelt floods caused by snowmelt can result in multiple flood events leading to losses in lives and properties snowmelt resulting in flood has a major role in cold regions hydrology processes study which is key to flood disaster risk reduction zeinivand and de smedt 2010 fhm forms an important part of flood risk analysis and enables efficient estimation of the spatial extent of flood characteristics like velocity depth and frequency díez herrero et al 2009 flood hazard maps are relevant for flood management practices as these maps represent the spatial extent and distribution of flood hazards effectively di baldassarre et al 2010 over the years and in recent times there has been a lot of effort to understand predict analyze and quantify floods and their impact globally historical data and fhm play a relevant role in the identification of flood hazard potential areas hazard intensity flood depth and spatial damage extent there are three major ways to create a flood hazard map and these approaches are through the physically based empirical and physical modelling methods bellos 2012 teng et al 2017 although the physical modelling approach has largely been replaced by physically based models some researchers still simulate past and future flood event scenarios with real life experiments bellos 2012 saidani and shibani 2014 the physical modelling method requires experimentation to validate the prediction performance of the model alternatively numerical models remain significant as long as these models simulate or represent the physical real processes of a flow flood occurrence carmo 2020 the physically based models are useful in flood prediction and early warning systems but require large input data through hydrological parameters river network geometry topographic and sometimes remote sensing data processing in gis ji et al 2012 there is evidence of errors and associated uncertainties with physically based models chen et al 2016 ji et al 2012 and have limitations in replicating the actual physical process of complex flows carmo 2020 the numerical models rely on numerical solutions to solve flow equations in 1 2 and 3 d dimensions and are sometimes referred to as the hydrodynamic models several physically based and empirical models may require data from remote sensing and are capable of predicting floods the physical models are also capable of analyzing past and predicting future flood hazard extent through physical experimentation the empirical models are operable with various statistical and data driven approaches the statistical and data driven methods rely on hydrological topographic digital elevation model dem and geomorphology data which are sometimes obtained using remote sensing and processed in gis wang et al 2019a the empirical methods are categorized into i the multi criteria decision making method mcdm chen et al 2014 ii the statistical methods which include the bivariate costache 2019a el magd 2019 youssef et al 2016 models and the multivariate bui et al 2019a shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 models and iii the machine learning approach al abadi 2018 costache 2019a janizadeh et al 2019 and the artificial intelligence rahman et al 2019 the data sources for the physically based physical and empirical models may be palaeohydrological records hydrology data bathymetry data historical streamflow records geological data and several other sources of information díez herrero et al 2009 the use of a specific type of data is not exclusive to one type of model additionally in the work of morjani 2011 the author referred to statistical methods as one of the approaches in flood hazard analysis which follows the process of combining flood frequency analysis and contributing factors causal factors or flood related conditioning factors to establish flood inundation areas previous review studies on methods and modelling approaches in fhm by teng et al 2017 focused mainly on the hydrodynamic models which are numerical models and less emphasis on empirical models bellos 2012 did a short review of the physical and numerical methods the present study presents an overview of the numerical empirical modelling and physical approaches in fhm highlighting their strengths limitations recent advances and way forward for future researchers this review paper will empower researchers and decision makers with an extensive understanding of the recent approach in fhm thereby enabling flood management agencies decision makers design engineers early warning system agencies and responders in addressing and making accurate decisions in flood related problems and employing the best management practices in flood management the study focuses on applying relevant topics with advanced methods in the subject of interest to enable access to the best and right information for the study the methods discussed in this study are developed i to understand the general approach in fhm ii to identify the strengths and limitations of each method and iii to present recent development in methods 1 1 the relevance of flood maps flood hazard maps are critical in detecting areas at risk of flooding disasters flood hazard maps indicate regions that are susceptible to flooding hazards the interpretation of a typical flood hazard map should be able to provide information on the spatial extent depth and flood frequency flood hazard maps specification and ranking of flood prone regions rely on the end users requirement merz et al 2007 end users of flood hazard maps include but are not limited to flood mitigation and management decision makers and stakeholders weather forecasters emergency responders and design engineers flood hazard maps serve as an important tool in limiting the extent of damage caused by flood hazards through its provision of prior information on floods and its various characteristics this has proven to reduce mortality due to flood hazards help in evacuation plans and assist in raising awareness to allow for proper preparation hamzah 2005 accuracy in the information provided by flood hazard maps is crucial in flood mitigation and management related practices validating and checking the predictive capability of flood hazard maps is necessary for flood hazard analysis through model validation and uncertainty analysis sources of these uncertainties have been reported and can be found in studies by anuar 2018 bales and wagner 2009 koivumäki et al 2010 furthermore ways of conducting uncertainty assessment are comprehensively discussed in the studies by apel et al 2004 domeneghetti et al 2013 kazakis et al 2015 lim 2018 merz et al 2008 souissi et al 2019 uncertainties associated with flood hazard maps need to be given relevant consideration during the planning and decision making process in flood management policies anuar 2018 hamzah 2005 global fhm is relevant in evaluating global flood risk di baldassarre et al 2009 pappenberger et al 2012 these maps contain information that serves as a key tool in flood forecasting early warning system and climate change analysis evaluation of flood hazard vulnerability risk and uncertainties and the resulting maps are crucial as highlighted by the european flood risk directive 2007 60 ec of 2007 a summary of selected countries flood maps and the information about the maps are presented in table 1 1 2 research motivation and framework of the review study although there is a growing trend in the application of fhm in various aspects of flood management studies from the comprehensive review of several works of literature and other similar research works a review study that is recent and covers all aspects of fhm methods is not available this study therefore aims to review relevant articles and review paper publications spanning from the last two decades this review

categories of fhm methods which are the physically based empirical and physical models the physically based methods were sub categorized into the 1 2 3 d hydrodynamic modelling methods the empirical models were sub categorized into the mcdm the statistical and machine learning artificial intelligence methods in addition conceptual physically based and data driven hydrological modelling methods were discussed an illustrative diagram of the methodological process of the three methods considered in the study is presented in fig 1 the search for relevant papers was conducted in science direct scopus and google scholar databases for publications from the last two decades which included research and review articles as well as conference proceedings the use of the exact keywords hazard numerical modelling flood hydrodynamic flood hazard in the scopus database and science direct yielded 3435 and 1873 results respectively as indicated in fig 2 for the physically based modelling method

the methodological criteria applied in this review study after searching using the related keywords in several batches and combinations relevant papers were selected from both science direct scopus google scholar databases 3 results a total of 109 papers were reviewed for the physically based 25 papers for the physical and 115 papers for the empirical modelling methods in fhm as shown in fig 3 this indicates an application rate of 43 8 for physically based 10 for physical and 46 2 for the empirical modelling methods in fhm this shows that the empirical and physically based modelling methods both surpassed the physical modelling method based on application rate there was also an increase of 12 in publication rate between 2000 and 2020 for physically based modelling which might indicate the relevance of this method in fhm despite this the empirical modelling method which can be categorized as a more recent approach in flood hazard inundation modelling method has experienced improvement over the years with a 35 increase in publication percentage between 2000 and 2019 this might be related to the growing interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence and improved decision making as a key tool in fhm in the year 2019 alone 37 publications were recorded for the three sub categories mcdm machine learning and statistical methods with upward trends across all the three empirical modelling methods as shown in fig 4 additionally across all the modelling methods in fhm there was an increase in the publication in recent years the physical modelling method had the least publication when compared to the other modelling methods in fhm this can be correlated to the findings from this review that it is the least favourable of all the methods because of its investigative requirements the mcdm method is the most applied method amongst the empirical methods as shown in fig 5 the distribution of publications by methods shown in fig 6 across countries indicated that china had the total highest publication rate 27 iran 24 usa 24 and malaysia and uk 18 based on modelling method categories the usa had the most publications for physically based 15 physical modelling 5 and iran for empirical modelling 20 in summary this current study presents a summary of past review studies related to the three categories of fhm modelling methods discussed herein the overview of past review studies is presented in table 2 the purpose of this summarized review is to enable readers to have a general overview of the past and current situation in fhm methodologies detailed review case studies strengths limitations uncertainties and future directions are discussed in subsequent sections 3 1 general overview 3 1 1 physically based modelling methods in fhm the physically based models enable simulation of physical processes of flow through various real data input which can be either climatic or remote sensing data ramírez 2000 to simulate hydrological processes leading to flooding events and have been applied in various studies bellos 2012 the physically based models comprise of numerical models that incorporate measurable variables and variables characterized by time and space devi et al 2015 that require intense processing input and longer computing time hong et al 2018 numerical models allow visualization of the dynamic characteristics of the physical processes of a flood generation anees et al 2016 with the help of a mathematical model there are three forms of numerical models in the fhm which are the 1 2 and 3 dimensional hydrodynamic models anees et al 2016 these numerical models are based on the fluid motion that is driven by the standard principles of mass energy and momentum numerical models are expected to solve the complex equations that are characterized by the physical processes of flow systems there are two major categories in finding solutions to these complex flow equations which are the differential analysis and the finite control volume analysis toombes and chanson 2011 the input parameter of these models may be adjusted to evaluate the impact of changes in boundary conditions initial conditions of hydraulic structures and topographic data of hydraulic structures teng et al 2017 the creation of flood hazard maps for various flood scenarios requires topographic data provided by the digital terrain model or dem hydrology data capable of providing information about rainfall and river discharge land use information and bathymetry data anuar 2018 arseni et al 2020 lim 2018 in addition the process of fhm through numerical modelling methods includes gis and hydraulic modelling analysis lim 2018 3 1 1 1 role of conceptual physically based and data driven hydrological models in rainfall runoff modelling in fhm conceptual models are parametric models that explain the major parts of hydrological processes that lead to a flood event the processes consist of several interdependent storages that represent the physical aspects in a basin that are recharged by infiltration and rainfall and get drained by evaporation evapotranspiration runoff drainage and so on devi et al 2015 conceptual model parameters require large field data such as hydrological and meteorological data for calibration on the other hand physically based hydrological models describe various hydrological processes through the conservation of mass equations although the physically based hydrological models require large hydrologic input data such as topography soil water content river network dimensions and others it does not require field data for calibration like the conceptual models according to peel and mcmahon 2020 the systeme hydrologique european european hydrological system she a physical based full distributed model came into existence in the 1980s and ever since then about thirty five other physical based and coupled hydrodynamic models have been applied in rainfall runoff modelling in fhm additionally the data driven hydrological models also referred to as the black box or empirical models do not consider the hydrological processes in a basin in any way but can be trained and validated to predict rainfall runoff data for flood forecasting and hydrodynamic modelling in fhm banihabib 2016 devi et al 2015 these models have the ability to learn the evaluated climate indices hydrological and meteorological parameters to predict rainfall runoff data mosavi et al 2018 examples of some conceptual models include the hydrologiska byrans vattenavdelning hbv model topmodel and clark model clark 1945 full details of these studies can be found in mendez and calvo valverde 2016 beven et al 2021 cho et al 2018 liu et al 2017 respectively similarly examples of physically based hydrological models include the variable infiltration capacity vic devi et al 2015 sitterson et al 2017 she devi et al 2015 mike she vargas 2016 hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modelling system hec hms romali et al 2018 soil and water assessment tool swat sufiyan and magaji 2018 penn state integrated hydrologic modelling system pihm qu 2004 sitterson et al 2017 visualizing ecosystem land management assessments velma mckane et al 2014 and kinematic runoff and erosion model kineros woolhiser et al 1990 examples of data driven hydrological models include climatology average method flood frequency analysis aziz et al 2014 multiple linear regression autoregressive integrated moving average valipour et al 2013 bayesian models haddad and rahman 2012 empirical orthogonal function mackey and krishnamurti 2001 quantile regression techniques haddad and rahman 2012 artificial neural networks machine learning deep learning mosavi et al 2018 etc flood forecasting is instrumental in the flood early warning system fews which can be executed by hydrological rainfall runoff models in fhm banihabib 2016 however there is a need for accurate runoff data to predict flood and map inundated regions mirzaei et al 2016 several studies have simulated floods of various regions by applying conceptual rainfall runoff abdi and meddi 2021 masseroni et al 2017 monte et al 2016 physically based rainfall runoff mai and de smedt 2017 mirzaei et al 2016 neto et al 2016 romali et al 2018 and data driven models brocca et al 2013 harun et al 2001 to enable accurate input for the flood inundation mapping through hydrodynamic modelling however the need for large field data for calibration has decreased the application of some of these models in addition researchers have proposed and successfully applied several coupled hydrologic hydraulic models in modelling flood inundated areas and these modelling tools have proven to be efficient wang and yang 2020 mai and de smedt 2017 furthermore comprehensive information on coupled hydrologic hydraulic models and its application is presented by choi 2013 3 1 2 physical modelling methods in fhm according to bellos 2012 the high cost implication experimental requirement and the development of robust numerical models capable of simulating the physical processes of flow have led to the progression in replacement of the physical models by the physically based models before the 1970 s the major modelling methods were analytical and physical modelling as these models were applied in several fields of engineering but in recent years there has been a great development regarding information processing and the application of mathematical computations in simulating the physical processes of a flood this is because of the availability of computing power hardware and software for numerical modelling which occurred at varying periods across different regions and countries the application of numerical models in representing the physical processes has limited the need for physical models carmo 2016 carmo 2020 the requirement of physical models which need the development and implementation of highly accurate experimentation of realistic flood events complex operations and longer time dedication has made it the least favourable approach in fhm although the physical model is seldomly applied in fhm there are successful reports of its application and implementation the cases of application of the physical models are assumed not tested if the actual modelled experiment has not been carried out several studies have alternatively applied the physical model in cases where numerical computations simulations output were not sufficient to analyze the flood hazard or flow system such studies include physical water resources infrastructures construction siviglia et al 2009 tsunami flood wave propagation modelling hiraishi and yasuda 2006 miyashita and mori 2018 flood analysis mohamad et al 2014 dam break analysis güney et al 2014 and river basins flood management ishigaki et al 2004 mignot et al 2008 thang et al 2004 toda et al 2004 3 1 3 empirical modelling methods in fhm the empirical models are data driven models popularly referred to as a black box model that relies on observation data and characteristics and mechanism of the hydrological cycle the empirical models use mathematical equations that are simultaneous with the time series input and output data with high predictive power and applicable only within the estimated boundary devi et al 2015 empirical models can be divided based on its approach to quantitative and qualitative methods the quantitative based empirical models depend upon data analysis targeted at evaluating the relationship between flood occurrence and flood causing contributing factors which will be referred to herein and after as flood influencing factors fifs while the qualitative approach relies upon experts opinion of the same flood prediction through empirical modelling strives to create a connection between the physical processes which encompasses flood generation through regression equations and parameters that are capable of evaluating flood frequency analysis or flood spatial extent cunha et al 2011 feloni et al 2019 skakun et al 2014 the qualitative approach is usually subjected to experts opinion which is the reason why the popular mcdm even though the weights are empirically derived remains as a semi quantitative method the empirical models are operable with various statistical and data driven approaches through the use of hydrological digital elevation model dem terrain and geomorphology data sometimes obtained using remote sensing and processed in gis wang et al 2019a these data driven approaches are categorized into the quantitative mcdm chen et al 2014 although the expert s opinion on quantified weight puts it in the category of semi quantitative approach others include the bivariate statistical costache 2019a costache and bui 2019 el magd 2019 youssef et al 2016 multivariate statistical bui et al 2019a shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 and machine learning al abadi 2018 costache 2019a janizadeh et al 2019 rahman et al 2019 methods a flood influencing factors fifs flood occurrence is dependent on some meteorological factors and the catchment characteristics khosravi et al 2019 which are also capable of affecting the level of susceptibility of the area to flooding hazard flood modelling studies require analyzing the interrelationship between applied fifs pradhan 2009 multicollinearity is related to the evidence of dependence among the predictory variables of a regression model the existence of multicollinearity can reduce the predicting capacity of the model though it does not affect the reliability of the model al juaidi et al 2018 gujarati 2003 a factor is of high relevance if it correlates highly with the model which is the subject of prediction and not correlated with other factors used in the prediction furthermore a factor is regarded as irrelevant if its level of correlation with other factors is high costache 2019a ozcift and gulten 2011 the effective use of the empirical modelling method to identify flood hazard regions is highly dependent on the fact that the selected factors are related to the processes which lead to flood generation papaioannou et al 2015 one of the techniques applied in evaluating the level of correlation amongst the fifs is the variance inflation factor test bui et al 2019b santos et al 2019 other various approaches to evaluating multicollinearity include correlation based feature selection model costache 2019b pairwise scatter plots al juaidi et al 2018 and pearson correlation coefficients method papaioannou et al 2015 b identification and selection of fifs identification of the key factors that influence flooding is crucial in fhm analysis the effective use of the empirical modelling method to identify flood prone areas is highly dependent on the fact that the selected factors are related to the processes which lead to flood generation papaioannou et al 2015 these factors represent the criteria for the mcdm model and factors applied in analyzing flood prone areas in statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence modelling methods the fifs are mostly geomorphologically or hydrologically related and are sometimes inter related which prompts the need to check for multi collinearity between the selected factors fifs identification and selection are of high importance because the successful evaluation and implementation of the overall goal of the model are dependent on it generally researchers who apply empirical modelling methods have relied on literature in the selection of the fifs as done in studies by arabameri et al 2019 bui et al 2019c chapi et al 2017 costache 2019b khosravi et al 2016 papaioannou et al 2015 rahmati et al 2016b 3 1 3 1 multi criteria decision making mcdm modelling methods mcdm is an approach for making decisions based on complex decision problems of incomparable criteria and alternatives malczewski 2007 pavan and todeschini 2009 mcdm effectively illustrates stakeholder s flood decision choices and helps in synthesizing a smooth operation among the people and the policymakers when a flood affects an area quick and relevant decisions needs to be taken in a short specified period and these decisions are subjected to uncertainties and are at risk of failure levy 2005 mcdm is a method targeted at enabling decision makers to integrate information to ease the process of decision making and the outcome is usually a set of weights connected to different objectives madruga and evers 2016 papaioannou et al 2015 saaty 2000 the mcdm enables the estimation of criteria fifs weights through the pairwise comparison methods commonly referred to as the analytic hierarchy process ahp khaleghi and mahmoodi 2017 rahmati et al 2016b saaty 1990 the ranking mind je et al 2019 and the rating patrikaki et al 2018 samanta et al 2018 methods the mcdm model is structured in a way that the initial stage entails an expert decision maker allocating weight related to a criterion s relevance the mcdm model hierarchical structuring is important because it has an impact on the model result the model structure has the objective of the problem at the foremost hierarchical level and next level occupied by the criteria factors that define the problem saaty 2008 analytic hierarchy process ahp ranking rating are among the techniques applied in weight evaluation in mcdm modelling malczewski 1999 aggregating the weights enables the determination of the final scores for factors considered in the analysis by summing each factor s attributes by its weights through methods such as the weighted linear combination and order weighted average methods madruga and evers 2016 when applying mcdm methods in fhm it is crucial to analyze and select the most relevant and non correlating fifs these factors represent the criteria under consideration for the flood hazard analysis through the weight assigning process several studies have applied mcdm alongside gis in flood hazard susceptibility studies a review of this aspect can be found in madruga and evers 2016 the suitability of the gis with mcdm was also studied by chandio et al 2013 the mcdm methods have various types that have been applied in fhm studies which are briefly explained below a analytic hierarchy process ahp this is a method that solves decision making problems by ranking alternatives according to several criteria fifs both in discrete and continuous paired comparisons cozannet et al 2013 saaty 1987 it is referred to as the most popular mcdm method applied in fhm mahmoud and gan 2018 and it is based on pairwise comparisons of fifs and feature classes to enable the respective weight evaluation a detailed methodological explanation of the process of the ahp can be seen in malczewski 1999 malczewski and rinner 2015 which both gave a comprehensive methodological description of various mcdm methods and examples which include the weighted linear combination analytic hierarchy process ideal point and outranking methods b fuzzy ahp it enables the expert s judgment to be defined through means of fuzzy numbers based on the concept that decision making by humans is associated with uncertainties that are difficult to explain by single numbers mikhailov 2003 noranis et al 2019 parhizgar et al 2017 the method was introduced to curtail the uncertainty associated with ahp based on its subjective approach the most common type of fuzzy ahp includes the trapezoidal fuzzy ahp and the triangular fuzzy ahp chan et al 2019 both fuzzy ahp methods have been applied in detecting flood hazard zones in flood risk assessment studies by li et al 2018 yang et al 2013 furthermore parhizgar et al 2017 compared ahp and fuzzy ahp and reported more compatibility of the fuzzy ahp with the past flood data of the study area c analytic network process anp this is a generalized form of the ahp that was created to enhance and put into consideration multiple dependencies and interdependencies in the clustered group referred to as networks saaty 1996 sarkis 2003 the method is reliable in deciding interdependencies amongst real life factors similar to parameters that influence flood generation dano et al 2019 wang et al 2019b reported a 98 accuracy when the authors applied a hybrid model consisting of anp dematel and interval rough numbers for the detection of flood prone regions of shangyou china d technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis this method follows the concept that the favourable alternative is the one that is differentiated by the most immediate positive and farthest negative ideal solution lee et al 2014 the procedure for the topsis involves eight important steps and details can be found in amiri et al 2019 who applied the method alongside ahp using morphometric analysis of the catchment to prioritize flood inundated areas in the studied area the topsis method is an effective tool for decision makers to enable the proper integration of flood mitigation planning through flood hazard analysis for urban areas moghadas et al 2019 e fuzzy topsis this was developed based on the fuzzy sets theory to provide a solution to supplier selection problems in the supply chain system chen tung et al 2006 kim et al 2019 kim et al 2019 proposed a hybrid fuzzy topsis to deal with uncertainties associated with developing a flood hazard map for a levee failure the author reported that the method performed better with regards to the accuracy and ranking of flood inundation potential zones than the current flood hazard map produced by korea s ministry of land infrastructure and transport it has also been proven to be a robust methodology for decision making in flood and water resources management lee et al 2014 f decision making trial and evaluation laboratory dematel it was developed to comprehensively analyze complex interconnected decision problems wang et al 2019a it is a preferable method in delineating fhm because of its networking and interdependencies of criteria kanani sadat et al 2019 wang et al 2019a furthermore it has proven to be reliable in addressing uncertainties when fuzzified kanani sadat et al 2019 g vlsekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje multi criteria optimization and compromise solution vikor this method was developed to enhance mcdm in complex systems of contradictory criteria with the assumption and determination that a compromising solution is allowed madruga and evers 2016 the method has shown promising predictive accuracy of 96 when khosravi et al 2019 compared various mcdm methods which included vikor and some other ml methods in identifying flood susceptible zones 3 1 3 2 statistical modelling methods statistical methods are common methods in fhm shafapour et al 2019 these methods integrate past flood event records and distribution of fifs to predict the probability of flood occurrence in flood prone areas fpas in the study area the method enables estimation of flood hazard index fhi which is obtained from aggregating the weighted scores of geospatially analyzed thematic layers and the historical flood distributions morjani taroudant 2014 the flood inventory dataset is usually sectioned into the training and validation parts the two major categories of the statistical methods that are applied in fhm are the bivariate and multivariate statistical methods a bivariate statistical model the bivariate statistical models examine the influence of each class of a flood influencing feature on flood generation and a type include the statistical index si which develops a relationship between fifs and flood disaster costache 2019a shafapour et al 2019 where weights are assigned to the fifs other statistical models applicable in fhm include the evidential belief function ebf which is a knowledge based spatial integration model founded on the theory of the dempster shafer althuwaynee et al 2012 arabameri et al 2019 bui et al 2019b rahmati et al 2016a the partial least square pls which takes into consideration uncertainty and variety input data in integration into different gis layers costache 2019b the frequency ratio fr which is expressed as a ratio of the probability of occurrence of an event to the non occurrence of the same event azizat and wan omar 2018 cao et al 2016 popa et al 2019 sahana and patel 2019 samanta et al 2018 certainty factor cf which takes into consideration uncertainty and variety input data in integration into different gis layers costache 2019a and the weight of evidence woe proposed by agterberg 1992 which is applied in flood mapping by evaluating the weight of each fif based on the occurrence or non occurrence of flood hazard in the study area hong et al 2018 rahmati et al 2016a shafapour et al 2017 shafapour et al 2014 methods b multivariate statistical model the multivariate methods evaluate the influence of each flood causative factor on the generation of the flood through the integration of the flood records and the flood factors an example of this type of model is the logistic regression lr model mcfadden 1974 which evaluates the probability of occurrence of flooding in a region 3 1 3 3 artificial intelligence machine learning models machine learning model ml is a subdivision of artificial intelligence that has been developed from pattern identification to application in the evaluation of the framework of the data that will fit into effective and accurate models shobha and rangaswamy 2018 ml is developed to determine functional dependencies within the observed data to enable valuable deductions from the process ml models enable the construction of predictive models from historical data which can show features of new components zoppis et al 2019 in the case of machine learning models flood inventory records are applied in training and testing of the model which classifies the dataset by determining the connecting weights to the model the flood maps are generated by analyzing the validated models for the region of study through the evaluation of the probability of each flood location to flood hazard bui et al 2020 several ml methods have been applied in flood hazard susceptibility mapping studies which have shown promising predictive capabilities such ml models include decision tree dt models like the alternating decision trees adt which is a simple and effective algorithm for classification in ml built in a stump like structure unlike other tree algorithms the adt performed best when it was compared with four other decision tree models in flood susceptibility mapping with a predictive accuracy of 94 3 khosravi et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 have successfully applied the random forest rf model which comprises of many distinctive decision trees that shows attributes of an ensemble in flood susceptibility mapping each of these trees in the random forest produces a classification prediction and the classification with the highest vote is chosen as the model s prediction mao and wang 2012 other dt models include the classification and regression trees cart shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 the logistic model trees lmt khosravi et al 2018 the reduced error pruning trees reptree khosravi et al 2018 etc the support vector machine svm is another type of ml that is a linear model usually applied in classification and regression problems by developing a hyper plane capable of solving linear and non linear problems into easy and executable classes shafapour et al 2015 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 applied the maximum entropy model in fhm which is a combination of data from different sources to generate a probability distribution that represents the training data the probability distribution is then evaluated with the highest entropy with the training dataset janizadeh et al 2019 popa et al 2019 reported over 90 prediction accuracy of the multilayer perceptron mp in flood susceptibility mapping the mp model illustrates logistic regression which replaces the input for a non linear function hidden layer and it is often used in function approximation and order identification a similar regression based model is the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars which is a nonparametric model that enables flexibility in the evaluation of multi dimensional experimental data and can model complex nonlinear problems to generate straightforward linear models dodangeh et al 2020 the integration of multiple ml ai models have also been applied in fhm and such models are ensemble models like the naive bayes trees nbt which is an integration of naïve bayes and decision trees adopt pre pruning while building the tree structure and its technique is non complex and high predicting capability khosravi et al 2018 furthermore is the bayesian glm general linear model which is an improvement of the glm that adapts the technique of bayesian for effective prediction hosseini et al 2019 also termeh et al 2018 was able to identify flood susceptible areas with an ensemble of genetic algorithm ga model which has random nature that presents a better chance of finding a good solution to complex and chaotic problems in less time wilson and mantooth 2013 and four other models artificial intelligence based models have also performed well in identifying flood hazard prone areas as reported by bui et al 2020 the authors highlighted that the grasshopper optimization algorithm goa the grey wolf algorithm gwo and social spider optimization algorithm ssoa outperformed the support vector machine and particle swarm optimization and random forest in analyzing flood susceptible regions others include the firefly algorithm fa which is a recent metaheuristic algorithm developed by yang 2009 from the inspiration of fireflies behaviour nguyen et al 2018 the extreme learning machine elm is also an artificial intelligence proposed by huang et al 2006 for single hidden layer feedforward neural networks to create an efficient algorithm with a faster learning speed bui et al 2019c huang et al 2006 the deep learning neural network dlnn is also an artificial neural network that has more than a single hidden layer and is normally trained using the back propagation method it has difficulty in training the network when the number of hidden layers is increased due to the varying learning speeds of the hidden layers bui et al 2020 others include the particle swarm optimization pso bui et al 2019c wilson and mantooth 2013 the ant colonization algorithm aco termeh et al 2018 the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis mathur et al 2016 etc 3 2 case studies in this section several studies that carried out fhm are discussed most of the studies highlighted have delineated flood hazards through physically based physical and empirical methods the strengths and limitations of these methods are also discussed in this section a brief comparison of the advantages and limitations of the modelling methods in fhm is presented in table 3 3 2 1 physically based models in fhm 1d hydrodynamic models are relevant as these models have been widely applied in water resources management and flood modelling studies to support flood mitigation planning and key decision making in flood risk management such is presented by tian et al 2019 when they applied a 1d hydrologic hydraulic model in examining the flood inundation resulting from normal frequent flood occurrence of below 20 years return period by applying river flow theory gis and digital elevation model dem the resulting flood hazard and damage map were able to accurately identify the affected areas thereby meeting the requirement of the flood hazard analysis of the region of study this was done by calibrating the model result using flood observation data of 2012 alongside aerial image data of the study area for verification aryal et al 2020 determined inundated areas of an area of about 38 sq km for five different return periods using hec ras modelling tool to develop the 1d hydrodynamic model the authors concluded that the model result could buttress crucial decision making in flood management and help in flood management planning the 2d model has also proven to be dependent capable of executing complex computations simulating flood processes and accurate this is proven in the study by nguyen et al 2015 which developed a high resolution model 10 m resolution flood map indicating flood depth and velocities this was conducted by applying an integrated hydrologic hydraulic model which was made up of the hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm and a 2d hydraulic brezo modelling tool the validated flood predictions result of water level and streamflow showed a high confidence level in the models prediction of spatial flood and velocities fernández pato 2018 combined a 2d and 1d hydrodynamic model in modelling surface flow and pipe network flow to a riverbank tributary case study the 2d surface area was discretized by applying the optimal number of cells the integration of both models was validated through laboratory experimental data and real flood data of high intensity storm events the coupled 1d and 2d model and the experimental test was able to forecast the sudden variation in the flow depth of both the sewer and the riverbank flow li et al 2006 applied a 3d model in studying the effect of relocating a flood prevention system by analyzing possible impacts resulting from both tidal and fluvial flooding from the south and the river usk respectively the findings of the investigation showed that there will be a negligible impact on the relocation of the flood mitigation system and the nearby environment yang et al 2018 investigated the tsunami force control by using a numerical dam break wave in simulating this force with a 3d numerical model and the result was validated using a similar physical model experimentation result from another study amason 2005 3 2 1 1 conceptual physically based and data driven hydrological models these models possess the ability to enhance flood prediction accuracy through simplified basins hydrological process simulation chen et al 2016 dutta and herath 2004 applied a conceptual modelling approach in deciding on how to control flood hazards and the associated risk the model outcome was able to highlight the relevance of the basin scale flood management method for flood risk reduction other studies incorporate simulation of flood parameters in conceptual and physically based models to delineate flood hazard zones evaluate flood depth and damage extent using hydrodynamic models a similar study was carried out by shrestha and lohpaisankrit 2017 which combined a physically based model hydraulic and a conceptual model to simulate flood scenarios using various climatic change prediction models to predict future flood occurrences sufiyan and magaji 2018 simulated flow using catchment hydrological response parameters with a swat and three dimensional model mirzaei et al 2016 applied kineros and hec ras hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling tools to simulate varying water level scenarios and map inundated areas in the langat river basin malaysia hosseiny et al 2020 identified flood inundated areas and evaluated flood depth by applying an ensemble of ml and hydraulic models the hydraulic model was calibrated with observed surface water level data and was used to train random forest and multilayer perceptron models to forecast water level in wet nodes the authors concluded the findings can be applied to save computational time and cost the impact of snowmelt as discussed in the introductory part is significant in flood hazard potential and should be taken into consideration at all times especially for alpine regions like switzerland and the pacific northwest of the usa voigt et al 2003 in the study conducted by nie et al 2020 glacial lake burst flood was investigated by recreating past floods due to glacial outbursts by applying a glacial lake outburst flood glof model comprising of a dam break model dl breach and a hydrodynamic model the result from the study indicated a near future recurrence and the authors recommended the application of additional sediment and soil data for a substantial parameterization of the model for accurate flood hazard prediction 3 2 2 physical models in fhm a comparison between numerical 3d and physical experimentation of simulation of a dam break flow indicated that the physical experiment was more accurate and the experimental data from the study can be applied for model validation for other study areas ozmen cagatay et al 2014 postacchini et al 2019 proved the impact of the incidence angle flow depth flow velocity on the pressure acting on the walls of buildings when a model mansory structure scaled at 1 10 was applied in simulating flow mechanisms güney et al 2014 constructed a distorted physical model to investigate dam break resulting from flooding after an intensive storm event the model was built in such a way that its sizing allowed the components of the dam consisting of the body reservoir and downstream region with horizontal scaling of 1 150 to fit in a space of 300 square meters the model also enabled the construction of features capable of simulating roughness like culverts bridges houses and roads the flow that will cause the model dam to fail was examined for instantaneous partial collapse through simulation of a trapezoidal gap on the model dam body parameters measured include the depth of flow by ultrasonic velocity profiler uvp transducers flood propagation by a high resolution camera water level by water level sensors and flow velocities the result from the experiments indicated that the region of study modelled can be flooded in minutes at flow depth reaching 3 m and in four minutes for the built up areas kvočka et al 2016 successfully tested the capability of a physical model with experimentation and a numerically formulated model in accessing analyzing and predicting extreme flood hazard events the numerically based method applied was derived from the methodology of ramsbottom and surendran 2006 which tests the impact of flood hazards on human subjects the physical model applied was developed by xia et al 2014 in the uk and it was based on the processes of falling and forces on a human subject in a water body the findings from the investigation revealed that the physically based model is preferable as a method of analyzing extreme flood hazards in the study this was because the physical model method is more influenced by increased velocities and momentum regarding higher froude numbers rather than depending on velocity alone like in the physically based methods physical models were recommended for areas susceptible to flash floods or extreme coastal flooding on a large scale because the physical model tested in the study efficiently considered variations in rapid flow and enable a fast and visual flood hazard and risk assessment tomiczek et al 2020 tested the capability of mangrove forests in safeguarding the coastal environment during extreme flooding events the study built a physical model consisting of a mangrove boundary and modelled residential buildings the model was tested with varying transient wave conditions measurements of surface water level flow velocity flow pressure forces acting on cross shores and pressure close and acting against the building showed the mangrove affects the inshore flow hydrodynamics and forces the experimental results also showed that the existence of the mangrove was related to increased water levels and minimized peak velocities of flow between the inshore buildings and the mangrove begam et al 2018 also investigated glof with a numerical 2d model and validated the results by building a physical model the results from the study indicated a satisfactory correlation between the observation and the experimental results 3 2 3 empirical models in fhm 3 2 3 1 mcdm methods kourgialas and karatzas 2011 produced maps for each fif based on the factor s interactive influence on each other on all other factors and also on hazard followed by assigning weights rating method to each factor and finally integrating all factor weights to obtain an overall flood hazard map using six fifs the six fifs selection was conducted based on the general importance and findings from past studies the results from the study were found reliable when validated with the record of the flood events in the study area gigović et al 2017 applied fuzzy logic based on interval rough ir numbers in a gis environment to develop an fhi to produce a flood hazard map using six fifs the ir ahp showed the best consistency when compared to historical flood events alongside the fuzzy ahp and ordinary ahp xiao et al 2017 developed a flood hazard map using the fuzzy ahp technique rather than the conventional wlc in assigning weights to the developed factors some of which included flow accumulation soil conservation service curve number drainage pumping stations slope elevation standard deviation depression point density and dike density and integrating all weights for a comprehensive flood hazard map the applied technique of the ordered weighted averaging owa method which is based on optimization that was combined with fuzzy ahp made the result of the analysis flexible in terms of the decision makers risk consideration arabameri et al 2019 used topsis and vikor in the analysis of a flood prone area and compared it with two statistical methods fr ebf when analyzing flood susceptibility areas the findings from the study indicated the optimal fifs and established efficiency in combining statistical and mcdm methods by applying remote sensing data with the gis technique phrakonkham et al 2019 evaluated the flood hazard index fhi from the relationship between flow velocity and flow duration to produce a flood hazard map the fhi values were used to recognize flood prone zones on the land use change hazard map the climate change impact on flood hazard was determined by estimating the difference in duration of flood between 50 and 100 year recurrence intervals subsequently ahp was used to assign weights based on criteria relevance and finally an integrated flood hazard map was created arianpour and jamali 2015 reported high accuracy when the authors applied boolean and fuzzy rules in factor selection in the spatial mcdm model because raw data which are sometimes characterized by error was not applied 3 2 3 2 statistical models in fhm khosravi et al 2016 mapped flood susceptible regions by applying three statistical models which included si woe and shannon s entropy using 10 fifs and flood inventory records the results from the study showed that the best model was the si as similarly indicated in the study of shafapour et al 2019 kalantari et al 2014 applied the pls model to evaluate nine physical catchment descriptors that are significant in the prediction of fhm the result showed land use elevation and soil type were the most influential to flood hazards in the study area the authors concluded that the methodology applied was a simple and consistent approach in delineating flood prone areas along roads nandi et al 2016 applied lr in fhm with the help of principal component analysis in fif selection analysis and the flood frequency distribution the result of the study showed an accurate prediction the methodology can be adopted for similar catchments and the analysis can be developed with additional and updated information rahmati et al 2016a applied woe and fr in flood susceptibility mapping by using 110 flood records and nine fifs the result of the study showed both methods presented similar good predicting accuracy performance 3 2 3 3 ml ai models in fhm hosseini et al 2019 categorized selected fifs through simulated annealing as input and the flash flood inventory map as output in the ml model and validated the models for spatial flash flood prediction map development the selection of the fifs was done based on findings from past studies and data availability in the study area the maps were classified and flash flood hazard maps were produced the study applied new machine learning models glmboost rf and bayesian glm the results revealed the models performed excellently and accurately in flash fhm popa et al 2019 made use of fr mp and an ensemble of both to develop an index for flash flood and flood hazard for mapping using flood inventory records and fifs the combination of fr and mp outshined others in terms of performance in fhm and findings revealed the fifs directly influence flood development khosravi et al 2018 examined four machine learning models decision tree type in the production of fsms which incorporated 11 fifs the study revealed that the adt model performed better than the other models zhao et al 2018 applied random forest rf in delineating flood susceptible regions by applying flood inventory records and fifs results from the study indicated the highest fifs to flood occurrences and showed that the rf model applied outperformed the svm and ann models 3 3 modelling method strengths and limitations 3 3 1 physically based models the time required for numerical modelling in fhm is becoming more tolerable and these models are the most applied in flood analysis studies ahmad and simonovic 2015 teng et al 2017 the simulation of the physical processes that describe a flood flow system is made possible through numerical computations in this model in addition to this the access to better dems resolution and more accurate data has greatly benefitted the application of hydrodynamic models unlike the physical models which require fabrication and experimentation to build the flow scenario and obtain results which can be costly some numerical models are freely available for use 3 3 1 1 1d hydrodynamic models 1d models have widespread recognition and a 1d hydrodynamic modelling tool like hec ras 1d is free software for global users these models are effective when computing a wide range of river drainage systems and several water resources structures these models are capable of effectively carrying out flood analysis anees et al 2016 flood risk analysis tian et al 2019 and dam break analysis the 1d model requires less computational time easier to run and build than the 2d numerical model gharbi et al 2016 lin et al 2006 the id models are also capable of forecasting the average velocity of a channel cross section and the water surface elevation however the id hydrodynamic model with all the above mentioned strengths is only suitable for modelling properly outlined and steady flow channels the id hydrodynamic is unable to incorporate the entire details of the complexity of urban flooding especially internal floods this is because in 1d models the impact of increased resistance posed by structures or buildings is not accounted for explicitly unlike in 2d models vojinovic and tutulic 2009 therefore researchers have found alternatives in coupling 1d and 2d models to accurately map flood inundated areas in urban areas when there is a need to consider flow interactions between ground surfaces and underground pipe systems fan et al 2017 also the assumptions such as horizontal cross section water level negligible river curvature and hydraulic jump small mean bottom slope and application of the law of resistance for friction caused by stream boundaries and unsteady flows similar to the one applied for steady flows reduces the accuracy in the 1d model results 3 3 1 2 2d hydrodynamic models the 2d hydrodynamic model is capable of accurately estimating the flow depth and velocities across a grid that outlines the topographic domain under investigation toombes and chanson 2011 the 2d has been described to possess relevant improvement in the evaluation of hydraulic parameters and the identification of flood prone areas these models are widely applied in fhm however the evaluation takes longer computational time and the probability of large variations in cell sizes due to the complexity of urban underground surface will result in reduced efficiency caused by the limited time step which is dependent on the smallest cells in the mesh fan et al 2017 there are limitations in the computational approach applied in evaluating the forces acting on individual flow components like the viscous shear stresses and channel bed friction in addition to the basic assumptions made by the saint venant equations toombes and chanson 2011 3 3 1 3 3d hydrodynamic models the recent years have seen the improvement in computing capabilities which has allowed the application of 3d hydrodynamic models in surface water analysis a 3d flood model can enable a practical design to be carried out using a computer system li et al 2006 show clearer details of the flow fields al zubaidi and wells 2018 turbulent conditions at varying scenarios enable clearer understanding into various physical processes via free surface flow abdurrasheed et al 2019 and improved visualization of flooded areas for better flood risk reduction management douass and kbir 2019 it also allows users more regulation of the 3d visualization which enables extended exploration and investigation of flood affected areas lim 2018 these models tend to be more accurate and more complicated therefore discouraging the model s application in large scale study areas prinos 2008 anees et al 2016 mentioned the need for applying these models will be difficult to justify if the analysis required for the study includes computation of parameters like inundation extent flood depth velocity direction a magnitude which can be done with the 1d and 2d hydrodynamic models some examples of numerical model types and related application areas are presented in table 4 3 3 1 4 conceptual physically based and data driven hydrological models one of the major advantages of physically based hydrological models is the ability to simulate the mechanism that makes up the hydrologic cycle of a basin the models are most suitable for use when data is sufficiently available and enable enhanced comprehension of the basins characteristics related to flood processes its application incorporates larger scales because it allows for a longer computational period it also enables the evaluation of the physical parameters of the basin it is however unable to measure parameters that are process based such as water storage capacity physically based hydrological models are limited at catchment scale and are therefore not replicable to non similar basins the conceptual hydrological models require field data for calibration which are sometimes not available or sufficient chen et al 2016 sitterson et al 2017 according to kan et al 2017 conceptual models have gained a reputation for being reliable and powerful tools for hydrological simulation and flood forecasting they have more benefits in comparison to physically based fully distributed hydrological models in terms of computational efficiency complexity simplified and suitability in addition they present more physical clarity than the black box models all the above mentioned attributes have made them a relevant tool in flood forecasting further details on the comparison between physically based and conceptual rainfall runoff models can be read in the study by jaiswal et al 2020 one of the key strengths of the data driven hydrological models is that they can numerically derive flood non linearly with the use of historical data without the understanding of the physical processes that result in flood generation these models are also faster require less input to build less computation time and cheaper to operate however there have been reports about inadequacies regarding short term prediction and the requirement of extensive data in terms of long term prediction and for a reliable forecast mosavi et al 2018 3 3 1 5 physical models the findings from physical models are factual results allowing a proper understanding of the phenomena and the complexity of the processes that lead to flood generation the results from these models can provide in detail the impact of a flood on humans infrastructure and the environment with a proper time scale the method allows proper investigation into high impact flood events such as hurricane katrina which caused destruction and failure of several infrastructures emelen et al 2012 and dam break failures due to flooding larocque et al 2013 leal et al 2002 soares frazão and zech 2007 the physical models enable the validation of theoretical model output the analysis of various details of the physical projects and tests the various effect of flood hazard impact on the environment in extreme conditions its application gives a better understanding of how structures will behave under varying flow conditions with instant visual results carmo 2020 taveira pinto et al 2020 despite all these capabilities the models are characterized by several complex issues that are difficult to solve such an issue may be scale effects in cases where there is a need to scale a free hydrodynamic surface by applying a flow that will fulfill all the conditions of the targeted stimulation additionally there are cases of laboratory effects such as reflection restriction on flows experiment duration and incomplete modelling taveira pinto et al 2020 even though the results from the physically modeled flood cases represent factual experimental processes the cost of building these models is high there are reported cases of uncertainties in results due to limited measurement devices emelen et al 2012 and the inability to properly simulate the actual roughness required from stand in materials güney et al 2014 3 3 2 empirical models the empirical model unlike the physical models does not try to simulate physical processes but applies data observations or estimations as inputs physically based methods have been used in flood mapping to describe predict and simulate various parts of the processes and development of floods fhm requires a wide range of hydrologic observation data and in recent years due to the non availability of this data researchers are now finding alternatives in qualitative and quantitative approaches in empirical methods in fhm with the accessibility of remote sensing data 3 3 2 1 the mcdm models mcdm can provide information to help rank uncertainties associated with model components such as deriving flood depth magnitude and extent which are usually solved based on the study participant participants intuition only flood risk management requires the contribution of decision support methods that consider various policy decision makers opinions objectives subjective views possible alternatives and optimum evaluation criteria mcdm can be applied in synthesizing complex environmental issues like flood disasters and socio economic goals to make the best decision mcdm has been successfully applied in flood analysis and fhm with the help of gis and remote sensing data franci et al 2016 nigusse and adhanom 2019 rahmati et al 2016b to produce more flexible less biased and accurate decisions in evaluation of relevant fifs the mcdm are methods that have proven to be relevant in delineating flood hazard areas for both gauged and ungauged regions and on a large scale even though the mcdm is simple to apply and implement the method is subjected to uncertainties based on different experts opinions and perspectives 3 3 2 2 the statistical models the statistical methods enable the integration of gis based numerical simulation with statistical methods for fhm by applying weighted indices these methods can be easily understood with less computing time and is accurate for flood modelling as it considers observation and remote sensing data to produce flood susceptibility hazard maps on small scales these methods do not require specific data computing software and system capacity to run the model the fr method requires minimum data input easy to process at a low cost on the other hand methods like ebf requires a high run time a wide range of estimation process and data transformation before producing the final flood hazard maps shafapour et al 2019 3 3 2 3 the ml ai models the artificial intelligence machine learning methods are frequently applied in flood modelling because of the computational efficiency in detecting spatial flood extent and susceptible areas using remote sensing data and past flood data these models are good models that can be combined with other methods in flood modelling and are also effective in data scarce regions the major problem with these kinds of models is the input data bad data and length of the dataset can influence the accuracy of the prediction model furthermore resulting flood prediction can be affected by applying out of range training values in validating prediction models dodangeh et al 2020 janizadeh et al 2019 termeh et al 2018 3 4 recent trends in fhm methodologies in this section the recent development in methods will be discussed 3 4 1 physically based models prinos 2008 categorized the numerical methods in fhm into the first second and third generation models by the models level of complexity this categorization describes the mode of development in these models the authors referred to the 1d as the first the 1d and 1d 2d coupled models as the second and the 3d as the third generation models table 5 shows a summary of these models and some typical characteristics 3 4 1 1 1d hydrodynamic models recent and current studies in 1d hydrodynamic modelling include the afflux system which enables a better technique for forecasting surges in the upstream water level of hydraulic structures another high point in the development of the 1d is the linking potential it has with the 2d hydrodynamic models néelz and pender 2009 teng et al 2017 over the years researchers have found alternatives when modelling floodplains where the assumptions associated with 1d requires clarification researchers opt for the fully 2d or integrate the 1d and 2d hydrodynamic models the 1d 2d coupled models have made significant improvement over the years as have been applied in complex flow and drainage system and can model flood problems associated with flood hazard and risk dhondia and stelling 2004 lin et al 2006 3 4 1 2 2d hydrodynamic models for a long time the application of 2d hydrodynamic models to large areas was a difficult task because of the long computation duration required recently the development of parallelization methods has enabled new areas for investigation report on computation time conservation by developing 2d swe on message passing interface communication that will normally function with high performance computers ferrari et al 2019 3 4 1 3 3d hydrodynamic models the improvement in the 1 2 and 1 2 ds can be found in the 3d hydrodynamic models which have been reported to possess high computational accuracy enables users with a better understanding of hydrological processes understanding adjustable gridding system realistic prediction of flood scenarios accessible for modelling larger scaled flood problems and less complexity anees et al 2017 recently flood disaster management activities have found the need for 3d technologies and cartographic visualization to help in understanding and increasing the awareness of flood problems at regional local and global scales herman et al 2017 furthermore digital hydrodynamic modelling tools have improved flood management decision making through the evaluation and visualization of flow parameters in 3d with the help of data from virtual environments such data include satellite images topographic maps dem and lidar points clouds wu et al 2019 applying 3d models to flood inundation modelling for fhm in scales exceeding a kilometer was initially regarded as not feasible because of the required computing power and issues of accuracy in presenting turbulent conditions at varying scenarios free surface flows velocity flow fields al zubaidi and wells 2018 teng et al 2017 however alternatives have been made possible through a particle based method referred to as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph which enables high quality visualization with the help of graphics processing units that accelerate the simulation process in comparison to the computer processing unit s execution hadimlioglu et al 2020 goswami et al 2010 improvement in 3d flood simulations has also been made possible through advanced graphics processing units particle based simulations and data availability however there were limitations posed by the sph as presented by goswami et al 2010 teng et al 2017 based on an overestimation of cpu memory consumption but improved sph methods have been introduced and seen in studies by alihan hadimlioglu et al 2020 goswami et al 2010 winchenbach et al 2016 3 4 1 4 conceptual data driven and physically based hydrological models the physical based distributed hydrological model was initially based on the assumption that the model will define parameters directly from the hydrological processes of the catchment and does not require the calibration of model parameters this resulted in high uncertainty leading to errors in flood forecasting recently parameter optimization has become a necessity for these models chen et al 2016 evaluated the flood prediction performance of two catchment areas in china using a particle swarm optimization algorithm additionally duethmann et al 2020 mentioned that various studies have shown indication that hydrological models perform less when applied to periods with climate conditions that vary from the ones applied during calibration this setback was tested to know the reason for the discrepancy between the observed and simulated streamflow values by making few modifications in the new model the findings from the study showed that precipitation data obtained from stationary rainfall stations is important uncertainties in climate change predictions can also be assessed using the physically based hydrological model in analyzing flood hazard potential under various climate change scenarios shrestha and lohpaisankrit 2017 in most cases of hydrodynamic modelling studies physically based distributed models tingsanchali and karim 2010 and mathematical and analogue models peel and mcmahon 2020 are used for rainfall runoff modelling recent years have seen both conceptual and physically based hydrological models been combined with various data driven models machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict runoff for rainfall runoff modelling kwon et al 2020 to provide more accuracy such ensemble was applied in the study by young et al 2017 which applied a hybrid hec hms ann and support vector regression for accurate rainfall runoff prediction in modelling extreme typhoons also kwon et al 2020 applied a hybrid of tank which is a conceptual hydrological model and least squared svm to analyze the rainfall runoff process further recent advances have been made possible through flood predicting models that integrate hydraulic models with land phase models to enable simulation of flood generation in an entire drainage basin these modelling tools are operated by factors such as rainfall evaporation temperature which are sourced from remote sensing ground stations or a combination of both for updated data the integration of these hydrological and hydraulic river routing have been successfully applied in fhm of complex flow systems with the aid of adequate digital terrain models arduino et al 2005 fatapour et al 2020 knijff et al 2010 3 4 2 physical models there have been notable technological advancements in the last few decades as the perspective of physical models have changed because of the development of equipment and techniques applied in experimentation the improvement in this aspect will result in improved field data thereby allowing for reliable calibrations carmo 2020 taveira pinto et al 2020 this has offered some solutions to the limitations of numerical modelling generally with improved experimental techniques the physical models enable the opportunity to investigate new flow phenomena and the estimation of variables in complex flows which are impossible via numerical computations taveira pinto et al 2020 physical model methods represent real flood phenomena recent advances for these methods are in the integration of physical and numerical models which is referred to as composite modelling gerritsen et al 2011 in other words a balanced application of numerical and physical models it is the computational representation of the real flood phenomena which form the advanced methods various concepts and assumptions are linked to these advanced methods because these models enable optimized results from both the numerical and physical models for specific flood analysis applying this method at a suitable geographical scale will result in an excellent simulation of the entire process the future of these models lies in the application of numerical simulations in enhancing physical models i e composite models especially for complex flow flood cases which are difficult to replicate in models taveira pinto et al 2020 such cases can include turbid currents turbulent flows and scour at complex bridge piers yang et al 2019 a further question is whether numerical models applied for specific scales validate some model scale effects such as the effect of kinematic viscosity 3 4 3 empirical models the notable observation is the diversity in the choice of methodologies that depends mainly on data availability and other factors like capabilities advantages and limitations of these methods there are a lot of challenges in producing flood hazard maps mainly due to the inaccessibility of sufficient data for flood investigations such as hydrologic data flood event records and topographical survey maps of drainage networks and flood plains kourgialas and karatzas 2017 furthermore is the complexity of applying physically based models which sometimes requires large datasets for execution hong et al 2018 longer computing time and little flow dynamics illustration of conceptual models teng et al 2017 some researchers are now finding alternatives in different approaches in the empirical modelling of flood hazard areas with the help of remote sensing data the empirical based modelling methods in fhm are useful in data scarce regions because remote sensing data can serve as a supporting system in place of insufficient or unavailable historical data the physically based modelling methods are sometimes executed with large data producing reliable results franci et al 2016 while the empirical methods such as the mcdm need fewer data and also generate suitable results souissi et al 2019 flood hazard maps that are presently accessible globally are often portrayed in poor resolution giustarini et al 2015 accurate and effective identification of flood prone regions needs high resolution dem data which is costly and scarce thereby much reliance on the free and available data like the us geological survey usgs strm dem topographical maps and national remote sensing center nrsc cartosat 1 dem kuldeep and garg 2011 the early phase of satellite remote sensing data experienced the availability of landsat multi spectral scanner mss with 80 m resolution dominantly applied for flood mitigation studies this extended to the landsat thematic mapper imageries of 30 m which provides flood monitoring data and for identifying flood spatial extent boundary improvement of the landsat thematic mapper imageries of 30 m brought the landsat tm band 7 wang et al 2019b wang et al 2011 and landsat oli ahmed and kranthi 2018 hong et al 2018 which is capable of easily delineating inundated regions recently the spot imageries which perform better with dem in flood analysis emerged also the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr became available which is relatively relevant in regional flood analysis and for evaluating normalized difference vegetation index ndvi sanyal and lu 2005 furthermore large scale flood mapping analysis can rely on imageries obtained from the recent synthetic aperture radar sar images such as the terrasar x giustarini et al 2015 shafapour et al 2015 sentinel 1 bui et al 2019a ngo et al 2018 rahman et al 2019 phased array

associated with fhm methods in this section the uncertainty related to each method discussed in this study will be briefly explained uncertainty can be categorized as the natural and epistemic uncertainty as the former can be ascribed to the uncertainty resulting from non predictable outcomes and the latter can be ascribed to the uncertainty resulting from missing information lack of expertise of process and technique anuar 2018 merz and thieken 2005 3 5 1 physically based modelling methods generally uncertainty in fhm can be accounted for by uncertainty in hydrologic data topographic data hydraulic model mapping technique and the geospatial approach applied in its generation bales and wagner 2009 merwade et al 2008 a detailed explanation of uncertainty in flood risk flood risk management frequency analysis can be found in berbić et al 2015 hall 2014 merz and thieken 2005 and flood estimation in blazkova and beven 2009 the proper identification of uncertainties requires effective investigation of the originating source teng et al 2017 for the hydrodynamic modelling prinos 2008 classified these uncertainties into the model data and parameter uncertainty as shown in table 6 uncertainties can be addressed through model calibration of the model the uncertainties associated with friction parameters seem to be the important factor to uncertainty and therefore given optimal consideration despite other sources such as model framework and topographical factors one analytic technique to measure uncertainty is the general likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 which has proven to be relevant and is easy to implement anuar 2018 3 5 2 physical modelling methods even though the results from the physical modelling flood cases represent factual experimental processes the cost of building these models is high and highly dependent on funding by government bodies there are reported cases of uncertainties due to limited measurement devices emelen et al 2012 measurement error and the inability to properly simulate the actual roughness of different environmental and infrastructural features güney et al 2014 through use of stand in materials the materials representing these stand in materials are required to have the same roughness of actual features while considering the froude number but in most cases simulation of roughness introduces a lot of uncertainties in the physical model for composite models that combine numerical and physical models gerritsen et al 2011 confirmed from a case study of coastal modelling that these models can reduce bed uncertainty in physical modelling in which one or two properly selected bedforms are under consideration 3 5 3 empirical modelling methods 3 5 3 1 mcdm models in mcdm various approaches have been developed to rank complex issues with multi criteria attributes this modelling method allows the definition evaluation and ranking of alternatives that are selected based on the criteria weight determination however the decision making process is often associated with uncertainties mcdm approach requires both internal and external information whereby the internal information describes the decision makers approach for consistency and rational decision making related to the judgment and alternative structure the external information is related to the circumstances surrounding the decision its consequences and the constraints uncertainties relating to the internal information of the decision making process may result due to wrong judgment arising from the misconception of an alternative su and tung 2014 the external uncertainties are related to processes related to analyzing and specification of criteria under consideration besides uncertainties related to flood events characterized by natural aleatoric uncertainty madruga and evers 2016 merz et al 2008 the ahp indirectly accesses uncertainties through evaluation of the inconsistency index for every pairwise comparison made according to madruga and evers 2016 in flood analysis using mcdm a larger percentage of researchers do not report the performance of sensitivity analysis although sensitivity analysis was applied in the mcdm methods by fernández and lutz 2010 kazakis et al 2015 souissi et al 2019 toosi et al 2019 and examples include single parameter sensitivity analysis spsa taylor series error propagation and monte carlo approach which incorporates extended fast fourier amplitude sensitivity test method fernández and lutz 2010 some other authors validated the results obtained with a flood event record of the study area nigusse and adhanom 2019 phrakonkham et al 2019 to check for similarities the spsa replaces the empirical weights obtained through ahp or any other weighting methods with effective weights souissi et al 2019 the single parameter sensitivity analysis is easy therefore makes it a practical approach for researchers even though it does not consider the informative aspect of the uncertainty thereby giving room for bias overview of the final mapping decision uncertainties relating to subjectivity of the decision makers opinion can be modelled by methods like the fuzzy set which deals with groups whose boundaries are unclear yang et al 2013 and a combination fuzzy set with other mcdm methods because of its similarity to human reasoning and computational requirements even with these capabilities some studies have indicated that the fuzzy set theory does not provide a better outcome than the ahp judgments are fuzzy thereby finding no need for the complexity of fuzzy numbers madruga 2018 the objective methods do not rely completely on the decision makers opinion but rather highlight the mathematical evaluation of the criteria weights thereby reducing the rate of uncertainty and increasing the effectiveness of the evaluation process an objective method like the entropy based mcdm was proposed by mahmoody and jelokhani niaraki 2019 and the result from the study indicated that the method provides more accuracy than the subjective method a summary of mcdm methods highlighting the methods characteristics from a few selected fhm studies is presented in table 7 3 5 3 2 statistical and ml ai models on the other hand for statistical models and machine learning methods it is crucial to evaluate the performance of a prediction model dodangeh et al 2020 and it is common to make use of statistical indicators for the evaluation and comparison of classification models bui et al 2020 examples of some of these testing measures include the relative operating characteristics curve roc often applied in the predictive performance test popa et al 2019 rahmati et al 2019 others include root mean square error rmse applied by elkhrachy 2015 kia et al 2012 kourgialas and karatzas 2017 kumar 2016 coefficient of determination r2 kia et al 2012 kling gupta efficiency kge for flood model prediction model evaluation rezaei sadr 2020 true skill statistics tss popularly referred to as hanssen kuipers discriminant dodangeh et al 2020 heidke skill score hosseini et al 2019 correlation coefficient dodangeh et al 2020 overall accuracy bui et al 2020 and wilcoxon signed rank tests hong et al 2018 khosravi et al 2018 wei et al 2019 and confusion matrix hosseini et al 2019 4 summary fhm has formed the basis for an improved approach in flood mitigation measures and management researchers and policy makers must also be aware and mindful of the next limiting components in flood analysis for fhm variations in the prediction results obtained from the various modelling methods indicate the uncertainty related to the fhm modelling method future developments in fhm may involve outweighing the benefits of the physical model against the additional costs especially for areas where the expectation of flood hazard risk vulnerability and damage are high in regards to composite modelling uncertainty associated with physical models that simulate the physical processes of the terrain should be given more attention the future for these models lies in the solution to how numerical simulations can be applied in enhancing physical models i e composite models especially for complex flow flood cases that are difficult to replicate in models the upgrade in equipment applied in physical models will improve the result to reduce uncertainty and encourage its application dem and digital terrain model dtm play a significant role in physically based hydrodynamic modelling and the influence of high resolution dem on flood hazard maps generated should be given more investigative consideration the improvement of the computational ability of computer systems has given a positive opportunity in simulating flows with high resolution data complex terrain and boundaries at larger scales investigation of uncertainty should be extended to flood depth and extents because of the possibility of the vertical changes in the profile affecting the horizontal stretch of the water there is a need for future research to consider highlighting uncertainty associated with flood hazard analysis in the maps because most times it is graphically represented and not included in the actual flood hazard map this will help in flood risk analysis as it relies much on fhm researchers should consider simplifying the representation of uncertainties presented in flood hazard analysis for better comprehension of flood management decisions for policymakers as empirical methods in fhm relies greatly on remote sensing data there is a need to highlight that fhms developed using dem land use soil map and etc need to be updated regularly the need to source reliable and high resolution data for flood hazard susceptibility mapping is highly recommended as highlighted with physically based modelling methods in fhm the influence of the different resolution of remote sensing data should be investigated on the outcome of the flood hazard map and its contribution to the uncertainty associated with the final flood map there is a need for researchers to explore more objective methods in mcdm that evaluate the whole decision making process rather than relying on fuzzifying the methods and sensitivity analysis despite the report of high prediction capabilities associated with using machine learning models in delineating flood hazard susceptibility areas the results can be affected by uncertainties associated with the input data it will be of benefit for future researchers to work on recommended models with varying study regions to validate the predictive performance of machine learning models the consideration of antecedent soil conditions and rainfall days preceding major flood derived from the historical record as part of fifs should be incorporated in flood hazard susceptibility studies researchers can also benefit from applying different classification methods in which principles are founded on statistical or probabilistic methods in preference to the practical ones with less objective expert based approaches which can improve the model predictive performance researchers should also consider the model averaging method which integrates the result of different individual models through the exploration of more ensemble models in a single robust model for the best result future studies should also be mindful of the date of flood events records collected through remote sensing concerning selected fifs such as urbanization and climate change that are susceptible to temporal variability 5 conclusion this paper presents a comprehensive review of methodologies in fhm a current review of the various fhm objectives is presented based on the increased need for flood hazard maps to mitigate the increased flood disaster events previous studies have reviewed methods in fhm with a higher focus on numerical modelling methods in this paper a current review of the physically based physical and empirical methods is given the result from the systematic literature findings indicate a 46 20 application rate of empirical modelling methods surpassing the 43 8 and 10 application rate for physically based modelling and physical modelling methods respectively this might indicate the significance of the modelling methods as key tools in flood management practices the physical modelling method remains the least favourable as indicated by past studies while the empirical modelling methods showed an increment of 35 in application rate between 2000 and 2019 over the years there has been a great improvement in fhm methods which include developing models capable of computing complex flow for complex terrains and channels at reasonable run time with improved software packages and the application of supercomputers for modelling flood hazards despite the ability of physical models to present accurate and realistic flood scenarios these models are costly to build while empirical models can delineate flood hazard susceptibility regions and evaluate flood vulnerability and risk these models cannot predict flow depth velocity and the probability of future reoccurrence with all the capabilities and few limitations of these approaches researchers and decision makers can find precision potential opportunity to combine and understand uncertainties and risks associated with these methods most importantly researchers can pick on the numerous gaps and work on them to make a tremendous improvement in the field of flood analysis for fhm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

4125,flood hazard mapping fhm has undergone significant development in terms of approach and capacity of the result to meet the target of policymakers for accurate prediction and identification of flood prone or affected regions fhm is a vital tool in flood hazard and risk management analysis previous review studies have focused on flood inundation modelling methods this present study presents a thorough and current review of the physically based empirical and physical modelling methods in fhm the study gives insight into strengths limitations case studies and uncertainties associated with the methods it further discusses the approaches in handling uncertainties related to each method and its recent development the review study is targeted at enlightening researchers and decision makers with an extensive understanding of the methods and of the recent improvements in fhm thereby empowering flood management agencies decision makers design engineers early warning system agencies and responders in addressing and making accurate decisions in flood related problems employing best management practices in flood management and adaption of climate decision making towards building resilient infrastructures keywords flood hazard mapping physically based modelling empirical modelling physical modelling uncertainty climate decision making 1 introduction flood represents the excess flow that inundates the conveying or holding medium when its capacity has been exceeded getahun and gebre 2015 flooding can be classified into pluvial flooding which results from rainfall causing excessive runoff leading to a rapid increase in water level and fluvial flooding resulting from an increase in the level of water of a stream river causing an overflow into the surrounding environment and coastal regions lin et al 2019 the increase in water level may be a result of excessive rainfall or snowmelt floods caused by snowmelt can result in multiple flood events leading to losses in lives and properties snowmelt resulting in flood has a major role in cold regions hydrology processes study which is key to flood disaster risk reduction zeinivand and de smedt 2010 fhm forms an important part of flood risk analysis and enables efficient estimation of the spatial extent of flood characteristics like velocity depth and frequency díez herrero et al 2009 flood hazard maps are relevant for flood management practices as these maps represent the spatial extent and distribution of flood hazards effectively di baldassarre et al 2010 over the years and in recent times there has been a lot of effort to understand predict analyze and quantify floods and their impact globally historical data and fhm play a relevant role in the identification of flood hazard potential areas hazard intensity flood depth and spatial damage extent there are three major ways to create a flood hazard map and these approaches are through the physically based empirical and physical modelling methods bellos 2012 teng et al 2017 although the physical modelling approach has largely been replaced by physically based models some researchers still simulate past and future flood event scenarios with real life experiments bellos 2012 saidani and shibani 2014 the physical modelling method requires experimentation to validate the prediction performance of the model alternatively numerical models remain significant as long as these models simulate or represent the physical real processes of a flow flood occurrence carmo 2020 the physically based models are useful in flood prediction and early warning systems but require large input data through hydrological parameters river network geometry topographic and sometimes remote sensing data processing in gis ji et al 2012 there is evidence of errors and associated uncertainties with physically based models chen et al 2016 ji et al 2012 and have limitations in replicating the actual physical process of complex flows carmo 2020 the numerical models rely on numerical solutions to solve flow equations in 1 2 and 3 d dimensions and are sometimes referred to as the hydrodynamic models several physically based and empirical models may require data from remote sensing and are capable of predicting floods the physical models are also capable of analyzing past and predicting future flood hazard extent through physical experimentation the empirical models are operable with various statistical and data driven approaches the statistical and data driven methods rely on hydrological topographic digital elevation model dem and geomorphology data which are sometimes obtained using remote sensing and processed in gis wang et al 2019a the empirical methods are categorized into i the multi criteria decision making method mcdm chen et al 2014 ii the statistical methods which include the bivariate costache 2019a el magd 2019 youssef et al 2016 models and the multivariate bui et al 2019a shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 models and iii the machine learning approach al abadi 2018 costache 2019a janizadeh et al 2019 and the artificial intelligence rahman et al 2019 the data sources for the physically based physical and empirical models may be palaeohydrological records hydrology data bathymetry data historical streamflow records geological data and several other sources of information díez herrero et al 2009 the use of a specific type of data is not exclusive to one type of model additionally in the work of morjani 2011 the author referred to statistical methods as one of the approaches in flood hazard analysis which follows the process of combining flood frequency analysis and contributing factors causal factors or flood related conditioning factors to establish flood inundation areas previous review studies on methods and modelling approaches in fhm by teng et al 2017 focused mainly on the hydrodynamic models which are numerical models and less emphasis on empirical models bellos 2012 did a short review of the physical and numerical methods the present study presents an overview of the numerical empirical modelling and physical approaches in fhm highlighting their strengths limitations recent advances and way forward for future researchers this review paper will empower researchers and decision makers with an extensive understanding of the recent approach in fhm thereby enabling flood management agencies decision makers design engineers early warning system agencies and responders in addressing and making accurate decisions in flood related problems and employing the best management practices in flood management the study focuses on applying relevant topics with advanced methods in the subject of interest to enable access to the best and right information for the study the methods discussed in this study are developed i to understand the general approach in fhm ii to identify the strengths and limitations of each method and iii to present recent development in methods 1 1 the relevance of flood maps flood hazard maps are critical in detecting areas at risk of flooding disasters flood hazard maps indicate regions that are susceptible to flooding hazards the interpretation of a typical flood hazard map should be able to provide information on the spatial extent depth and flood frequency flood hazard maps specification and ranking of flood prone regions rely on the end users requirement merz et al 2007 end users of flood hazard maps include but are not limited to flood mitigation and management decision makers and stakeholders weather forecasters emergency responders and design engineers flood hazard maps serve as an important tool in limiting the extent of damage caused by flood hazards through its provision of prior information on floods and its various characteristics this has proven to reduce mortality due to flood hazards help in evacuation plans and assist in raising awareness to allow for proper preparation hamzah 2005 accuracy in the information provided by flood hazard maps is crucial in flood mitigation and management related practices validating and checking the predictive capability of flood hazard maps is necessary for flood hazard analysis through model validation and uncertainty analysis sources of these uncertainties have been reported and can be found in studies by anuar 2018 bales and wagner 2009 koivumäki et al 2010 furthermore ways of conducting uncertainty assessment are comprehensively discussed in the studies by apel et al 2004 domeneghetti et al 2013 kazakis et al 2015 lim 2018 merz et al 2008 souissi et al 2019 uncertainties associated with flood hazard maps need to be given relevant consideration during the planning and decision making process in flood management policies anuar 2018 hamzah 2005 global fhm is relevant in evaluating global flood risk di baldassarre et al 2009 pappenberger et al 2012 these maps contain information that serves as a key tool in flood forecasting early warning system and climate change analysis evaluation of flood hazard vulnerability risk and uncertainties and the resulting maps are crucial as highlighted by the european flood risk directive 2007 60 ec of 2007 a summary of selected countries flood maps and the information about the maps are presented in table 1 1 2 research motivation and framework of the review study although there is a growing trend in the application of fhm in various aspects of flood management studies from the comprehensive review of several works of literature and other similar research works a review study that is recent and covers all aspects of fhm methods is not available this study therefore aims to review relevant articles and review paper publications spanning from the last two decades this review

subjects required to create the structure of the review to reveal the new development in the fhm methods and identify gaps for future studies 2 overview of methods the study focused on three categories of fhm methods which are the physically based empirical and physical models the physically based methods were sub categorized into the 1 2 3 d hydrodynamic modelling methods the empirical models were sub categorized into the mcdm the statistical and machine learning artificial intelligence methods in addition conceptual physically based and data driven hydrological modelling methods were discussed an illustrative diagram of the methodological process of the three methods considered in the study is presented in fig 1 the search for relevant papers was conducted in science direct scopus and google scholar databases for publications from the last two decades which included research and review articles as well as conference proceedings the use of the exact keywords hazard numerical modelling flood hydrodynamic flood hazard in the scopus database and science direct yielded 3435 and 1873 results respectively as indicated in fig 2 for the physically based modelling method at the time of writing this article the keywords shown in fig 2 was applied for the physical and empirical modelling methods other combinations of keywords used are stated below for subsequent

the methodological criteria applied in this review study after searching using the related keywords in several batches and combinations relevant papers were selected from both science direct scopus google scholar databases 3 results a total of 109 papers were reviewed for the physically based 25 papers for the physical and 115 papers for the empirical modelling methods in fhm as shown in fig 3 this indicates an application rate of 43 8 for physically based 10 for physical and 46 2 for the empirical modelling methods in fhm this shows that the empirical and physically based modelling methods both surpassed the physical modelling method based on application rate there was also an increase of 12 in publication rate between 2000 and 2020 for physically based modelling which might indicate the relevance of this method in fhm despite this the empirical modelling method which can be categorized as a more recent approach in flood hazard inundation modelling method has experienced improvement over the years with a 35 increase in publication percentage between 2000 and 2019 this might be related to the growing interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence and improved decision making as a key tool in fhm in the year 2019 alone 37 publications were recorded for the three sub categories mcdm machine learning and statistical methods with upward trends across all the three empirical modelling methods as shown in fig 4 additionally across all the modelling methods in fhm there was an increase in the publication in recent years the physical modelling method had the least publication when compared to the other modelling methods in fhm this can be correlated to the findings from this review that it is the least favourable of all the methods because of its investigative requirements the mcdm method is the most applied method amongst the empirical methods as shown in fig 5 the distribution of publications by methods shown in fig 6 across countries indicated that china had the total highest publication rate 27 iran 24 usa 24 and malaysia and uk 18 based on modelling method categories the usa had the most publications for physically based 15 physical modelling 5 and iran for empirical modelling 20 in summary this current study presents a summary of past review studies related to the three categories of fhm modelling methods discussed herein the overview of past review studies is presented in table 2 the purpose of this summarized review is to enable readers to have a general overview of the past and current situation in fhm methodologies detailed review case studies strengths limitations uncertainties and future directions are discussed in subsequent sections 3 1 general overview 3 1 1 physically based modelling methods in fhm the physically based models enable simulation of physical processes of flow through various real data input which can be either climatic or remote sensing data ramírez 2000 to simulate hydrological processes leading to flooding events and have been applied in various studies bellos 2012 the physically based models comprise of numerical models that incorporate measurable variables and variables characterized by time and space devi et al 2015 that require intense processing input and longer computing time hong et al 2018 numerical models allow visualization of the dynamic characteristics of the physical processes of a flood generation anees et al 2016 with the help of a mathematical model there are three forms of numerical models in the fhm which are the 1 2 and 3 dimensional hydrodynamic models anees et al 2016 these numerical models are based on the fluid motion that is driven by the standard principles of mass energy and momentum numerical models are expected to solve the complex equations that are characterized by the physical processes of flow systems there are two major categories in finding solutions to these complex flow equations which are the differential analysis and the finite control volume analysis toombes and chanson 2011 the input parameter of these models may be adjusted to evaluate the impact of changes in boundary conditions initial conditions of hydraulic structures and topographic data of hydraulic structures teng et al 2017 the creation of flood hazard maps for various flood scenarios requires topographic data provided by the digital terrain model or dem hydrology data capable of providing information about rainfall and river discharge land use information and bathymetry data anuar 2018 arseni et al 2020 lim 2018 in addition the process of fhm through numerical modelling methods includes gis and hydraulic modelling analysis lim 2018 3 1 1 1 role of conceptual physically based and data driven hydrological models in rainfall runoff modelling in fhm conceptual models are parametric models that explain the major parts of hydrological processes that lead to a flood event the processes consist of several interdependent storages that represent the physical aspects in a basin that are recharged by infiltration and rainfall and get drained by evaporation evapotranspiration runoff drainage and so on devi et al 2015 conceptual model parameters require large field data such as hydrological and meteorological data for calibration on the other hand physically based hydrological models describe various hydrological processes through the conservation of mass equations although the physically based hydrological models require large hydrologic input data such as topography soil water content river network dimensions and others it does not require field data for calibration like the conceptual models according to peel and mcmahon 2020 the systeme hydrologique european european hydrological system she a physical based full distributed model came into existence in the 1980s and ever since then about thirty five other physical based and coupled hydrodynamic models have been applied in rainfall runoff modelling in fhm additionally the data driven hydrological models also referred to as the black box or empirical models do not consider the hydrological processes in a basin in any way but can be trained and validated to predict rainfall runoff data for flood forecasting and hydrodynamic modelling in fhm banihabib 2016 devi et al 2015 these models have the ability to learn the evaluated climate indices hydrological and meteorological parameters to predict rainfall runoff data mosavi et al 2018 examples of some conceptual models include the hydrologiska byrans vattenavdelning hbv model topmodel and clark model clark 1945 full details of these studies can be found in mendez and calvo valverde 2016 beven et al 2021 cho et al 2018 liu et al 2017 respectively similarly examples of physically based hydrological models include the variable infiltration capacity vic devi et al 2015 sitterson et al 2017 she devi et al 2015 mike she vargas 2016 hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modelling system hec hms romali et al 2018 soil and water assessment tool swat sufiyan and magaji 2018 penn state integrated hydrologic modelling system pihm qu 2004 sitterson et al 2017 visualizing ecosystem land management assessments velma mckane et al 2014 and kinematic runoff and erosion model kineros woolhiser et al 1990 examples of data driven hydrological models include climatology average method flood frequency analysis aziz et al 2014 multiple linear regression autoregressive integrated moving average valipour et al 2013 bayesian models haddad and rahman 2012 empirical orthogonal function mackey and krishnamurti 2001 quantile regression techniques haddad and rahman 2012 artificial neural networks machine learning deep learning mosavi et al 2018 etc flood forecasting is instrumental in the flood early warning system fews which can be executed by hydrological rainfall runoff models in fhm banihabib 2016 however there is a need for accurate runoff data to predict flood and map inundated regions mirzaei et al 2016 several studies have simulated floods of various regions by applying conceptual rainfall runoff abdi and meddi 2021 masseroni et al 2017 monte et al 2016 physically based rainfall runoff mai and de smedt 2017 mirzaei et al 2016 neto et al 2016 romali et al 2018 and data driven models brocca et al 2013 harun et al 2001 to enable accurate input for the flood inundation mapping through hydrodynamic modelling however the need for large field data for calibration has decreased the application of some of these models in addition researchers have proposed and successfully applied several coupled hydrologic hydraulic models in modelling flood inundated areas and these modelling tools have proven to be efficient wang and yang 2020 mai and de smedt 2017 furthermore comprehensive information on coupled hydrologic hydraulic models and its application is presented by choi 2013 3 1 2 physical modelling methods in fhm according to bellos 2012 the high cost implication experimental requirement and the development of robust numerical models capable of simulating the physical processes of flow have led to the progression in replacement of the physical models by the physically based models before the 1970 s the major modelling methods were analytical and physical modelling as these models were applied in several fields of engineering but in recent years there has been a great development regarding information processing and the application of mathematical computations in simulating the physical processes of a flood this is because of the availability of computing power hardware and software for numerical modelling which occurred at varying periods across different regions and countries the application of numerical models in representing the physical processes has limited the need for physical models carmo 2016 carmo 2020 the requirement of physical models which need the development and implementation of highly accurate experimentation of realistic flood events complex operations and longer time dedication has made it the least favourable approach in fhm although the physical model is seldomly applied in fhm there are successful reports of its application and implementation the cases of application of the physical models are assumed not tested if the actual modelled experiment has not been carried out several studies have alternatively applied the physical model in cases where numerical computations simulations output were not sufficient to analyze the flood hazard or flow system such studies include physical water resources infrastructures construction siviglia et al 2009 tsunami flood wave propagation modelling hiraishi and yasuda 2006 miyashita and mori 2018 flood analysis mohamad et al 2014 dam break analysis güney et al 2014 and river basins flood management ishigaki et al 2004 mignot et al 2008 thang et al 2004 toda et al 2004 3 1 3 empirical modelling methods in fhm the empirical models are data driven models popularly referred to as a black box model that relies on observation data and characteristics and mechanism of the hydrological cycle the empirical models use mathematical equations that are simultaneous with the time series input and output data with high predictive power and applicable only within the estimated boundary devi et al 2015 empirical models can be divided based on its approach to quantitative and qualitative methods the quantitative based empirical models depend upon data analysis targeted at evaluating the relationship between flood occurrence and flood causing contributing factors which will be referred to herein and after as flood influencing factors fifs while the qualitative approach relies upon experts opinion of the same flood prediction through empirical modelling strives to create a connection between the physical processes which encompasses flood generation through regression equations and parameters that are capable of evaluating flood frequency analysis or flood spatial extent cunha et al 2011 feloni et al 2019 skakun et al 2014 the qualitative approach is usually subjected to experts opinion which is the reason why the popular mcdm even though the weights are empirically derived remains as a semi quantitative method the empirical models are operable with various statistical and data driven approaches through the use of hydrological digital elevation model dem terrain and geomorphology data sometimes obtained using remote sensing and processed in gis wang et al 2019a these data driven approaches are categorized into the quantitative mcdm chen et al 2014 although the expert s opinion on quantified weight puts it in the category of semi quantitative approach others include the bivariate statistical costache 2019a costache and bui 2019 el magd 2019 youssef et al 2016 multivariate statistical bui et al 2019a shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 and machine learning al abadi 2018 costache 2019a janizadeh et al 2019 rahman et al 2019 methods a flood influencing factors fifs flood occurrence is dependent on some meteorological factors and the catchment characteristics khosravi et al 2019 which are also capable of affecting the level of susceptibility of the area to flooding hazard flood modelling studies require analyzing the interrelationship between applied fifs pradhan 2009 multicollinearity is related to the evidence of dependence among the predictory variables of a regression model the existence of multicollinearity can reduce the predicting capacity of the model though it does not affect the reliability of the model al juaidi et al 2018 gujarati 2003 a factor is of high relevance if it correlates highly with the model which is the subject of prediction and not correlated with other factors used in the prediction furthermore a factor is regarded as irrelevant if its level of correlation with other factors is high costache 2019a ozcift and gulten 2011 the effective use of the empirical modelling method to identify flood hazard regions is highly dependent on the fact that the selected factors are related to the processes which lead to flood generation papaioannou et al 2015 one of the techniques applied in evaluating the level of correlation amongst the fifs is the variance inflation factor test bui et al 2019b santos et al 2019 other various approaches to evaluating multicollinearity include correlation based feature selection model costache 2019b pairwise scatter plots al juaidi et al 2018 and pearson correlation coefficients method papaioannou et al 2015 b identification and selection of fifs identification of the key factors that influence flooding is crucial in fhm analysis the effective use of the empirical modelling method to identify flood prone areas is highly dependent on the fact that the selected factors are related to the processes which lead to flood generation papaioannou et al 2015 these factors represent the criteria for the mcdm model and factors applied in analyzing flood prone areas in statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence modelling methods the fifs are mostly geomorphologically or hydrologically related and are sometimes inter related which prompts the need to check for multi collinearity between the selected factors fifs identification and selection are of high importance because the successful evaluation and implementation of the overall goal of the model are dependent on it generally researchers who apply empirical modelling methods have relied on literature in the selection of the fifs as done in studies by arabameri et al 2019 bui et al 2019c chapi et al 2017 costache 2019b khosravi et al 2016 papaioannou et al 2015 rahmati et al 2016b 3 1 3 1 multi criteria decision making mcdm modelling methods mcdm is an approach for making decisions based on complex decision problems of incomparable criteria and alternatives malczewski 2007 pavan and todeschini 2009 mcdm effectively illustrates stakeholder s flood decision choices and helps in synthesizing a smooth operation among the people and the policymakers when a flood affects an area quick and relevant decisions needs to be taken in a short specified period and these decisions are subjected to uncertainties and are at risk of failure levy 2005 mcdm is a method targeted at enabling decision makers to integrate information to ease the process of decision making and the outcome is usually a set of weights connected to different objectives madruga and evers 2016 papaioannou et al 2015 saaty 2000 the mcdm enables the estimation of criteria fifs weights through the pairwise comparison methods commonly referred to as the analytic hierarchy process ahp khaleghi and mahmoodi 2017 rahmati et al 2016b saaty 1990 the ranking mind je et al 2019 and the rating patrikaki et al 2018 samanta et al 2018 methods the mcdm model is structured in a way that the initial stage entails an expert decision maker allocating weight related to a criterion s relevance the mcdm model hierarchical structuring is important because it has an impact on the model result the model structure has the objective of the problem at the foremost hierarchical level and next level occupied by the criteria factors that define the problem saaty 2008 analytic hierarchy process ahp ranking rating are among the techniques applied in weight evaluation in mcdm modelling malczewski 1999 aggregating the weights enables the determination of the final scores for factors considered in the analysis by summing each factor s attributes by its weights through methods such as the weighted linear combination and order weighted average methods madruga and evers 2016 when applying mcdm methods in fhm it is crucial to analyze and select the most relevant and non correlating fifs these factors represent the criteria under consideration for the flood hazard analysis through the weight assigning process several studies have applied mcdm alongside gis in flood hazard susceptibility studies a review of this aspect can be found in madruga and evers 2016 the suitability of the gis with mcdm was also studied by chandio et al 2013 the mcdm methods have various types that have been applied in fhm studies which are briefly explained below a analytic hierarchy process ahp this is a method that solves decision making problems by ranking alternatives according to several criteria fifs both in discrete and continuous paired comparisons cozannet et al 2013 saaty 1987 it is referred to as the most popular mcdm method applied in fhm mahmoud and gan 2018 and it is based on pairwise comparisons of fifs and feature classes to enable the respective weight evaluation a detailed methodological explanation of the process of the ahp can be seen in malczewski 1999 malczewski and rinner 2015 which both gave a comprehensive methodological description of various mcdm methods and examples which include the weighted linear combination analytic hierarchy process ideal point and outranking methods b fuzzy ahp it enables the expert s judgment to be defined through means of fuzzy numbers based on the concept that decision making by humans is associated with uncertainties that are difficult to explain by single numbers mikhailov 2003 noranis et al 2019 parhizgar et al 2017 the method was introduced to curtail the uncertainty associated with ahp based on its subjective approach the most common type of fuzzy ahp includes the trapezoidal fuzzy ahp and the triangular fuzzy ahp chan et al 2019 both fuzzy ahp methods have been applied in detecting flood hazard zones in flood risk assessment studies by li et al 2018 yang et al 2013 furthermore parhizgar et al 2017 compared ahp and fuzzy ahp and reported more compatibility of the fuzzy ahp with the past flood data of the study area c analytic network process anp this is a generalized form of the ahp that was created to enhance and put into consideration multiple dependencies and interdependencies in the clustered group referred to as networks saaty 1996 sarkis 2003 the method is reliable in deciding interdependencies amongst real life factors similar to parameters that influence flood generation dano et al 2019 wang et al 2019b reported a 98 accuracy when the authors applied a hybrid model consisting of anp dematel and interval rough numbers for the detection of flood prone regions of shangyou china d technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis this method follows the concept that the favourable alternative is the one that is differentiated by the most immediate positive and farthest negative ideal solution lee et al 2014 the procedure for the topsis involves eight important steps and details can be found in amiri et al 2019 who applied the method alongside ahp using morphometric analysis of the catchment to prioritize flood inundated areas in the studied area the topsis method is an effective tool for decision makers to enable the proper integration of flood mitigation planning through flood hazard analysis for urban areas moghadas et al 2019 e fuzzy topsis this was developed based on the fuzzy sets theory to provide a solution to supplier selection problems in the supply chain system chen tung et al 2006 kim et al 2019 kim et al 2019 proposed a hybrid fuzzy topsis to deal with uncertainties associated with developing a flood hazard map for a levee failure the author reported that the method performed better with regards to the accuracy and ranking of flood inundation potential zones than the current flood hazard map produced by korea s ministry of land infrastructure and transport it has also been proven to be a robust methodology for decision making in flood and water resources management lee et al 2014 f decision making trial and evaluation laboratory dematel it was developed to comprehensively analyze complex interconnected decision problems wang et al 2019a it is a preferable method in delineating fhm because of its networking and interdependencies of criteria kanani sadat et al 2019 wang et al 2019a furthermore it has proven to be reliable in addressing uncertainties when fuzzified kanani sadat et al 2019 g vlsekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje multi criteria optimization and compromise solution vikor this method was developed to enhance mcdm in complex systems of contradictory criteria with the assumption and determination that a compromising solution is allowed madruga and evers 2016 the method has shown promising predictive accuracy of 96 when khosravi et al 2019 compared various mcdm methods which included vikor and some other ml methods in identifying flood susceptible zones 3 1 3 2 statistical modelling methods statistical methods are common methods in fhm shafapour et al 2019 these methods integrate past flood event records and distribution of fifs to predict the probability of flood occurrence in flood prone areas fpas in the study area the method enables estimation of flood hazard index fhi which is obtained from aggregating the weighted scores of geospatially analyzed thematic layers and the historical flood distributions morjani taroudant 2014 the flood inventory dataset is usually sectioned into the training and validation parts the two major categories of the statistical methods that are applied in fhm are the bivariate and multivariate statistical methods a bivariate statistical model the bivariate statistical models examine the influence of each class of a flood influencing feature on flood generation and a type include the statistical index si which develops a relationship between fifs and flood disaster costache 2019a shafapour et al 2019 where weights are assigned to the fifs other statistical models applicable in fhm include the evidential belief function ebf which is a knowledge based spatial integration model founded on the theory of the dempster shafer althuwaynee et al 2012 arabameri et al 2019 bui et al 2019b rahmati et al 2016a the partial least square pls which takes into consideration uncertainty and variety input data in integration into different gis layers costache 2019b the frequency ratio fr which is expressed as a ratio of the probability of occurrence of an event to the non occurrence of the same event azizat and wan omar 2018 cao et al 2016 popa et al 2019 sahana and patel 2019 samanta et al 2018 certainty factor cf which takes into consideration uncertainty and variety input data in integration into different gis layers costache 2019a and the weight of evidence woe proposed by agterberg 1992 which is applied in flood mapping by evaluating the weight of each fif based on the occurrence or non occurrence of flood hazard in the study area hong et al 2018 rahmati et al 2016a shafapour et al 2017 shafapour et al 2014 methods b multivariate statistical model the multivariate methods evaluate the influence of each flood causative factor on the generation of the flood through the integration of the flood records and the flood factors an example of this type of model is the logistic regression lr model mcfadden 1974 which evaluates the probability of occurrence of flooding in a region 3 1 3 3 artificial intelligence machine learning models machine learning model ml is a subdivision of artificial intelligence that has been developed from pattern identification to application in the evaluation of the framework of the data that will fit into effective and accurate models shobha and rangaswamy 2018 ml is developed to determine functional dependencies within the observed data to enable valuable deductions from the process ml models enable the construction of predictive models from historical data which can show features of new components zoppis et al 2019 in the case of machine learning models flood inventory records are applied in training and testing of the model which classifies the dataset by determining the connecting weights to the model the flood maps are generated by analyzing the validated models for the region of study through the evaluation of the probability of each flood location to flood hazard bui et al 2020 several ml methods have been applied in flood hazard susceptibility mapping studies which have shown promising predictive capabilities such ml models include decision tree dt models like the alternating decision trees adt which is a simple and effective algorithm for classification in ml built in a stump like structure unlike other tree algorithms the adt performed best when it was compared with four other decision tree models in flood susceptibility mapping with a predictive accuracy of 94 3 khosravi et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 have successfully applied the random forest rf model which comprises of many distinctive decision trees that shows attributes of an ensemble in flood susceptibility mapping each of these trees in the random forest produces a classification prediction and the classification with the highest vote is chosen as the model s prediction mao and wang 2012 other dt models include the classification and regression trees cart shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 the logistic model trees lmt khosravi et al 2018 the reduced error pruning trees reptree khosravi et al 2018 etc the support vector machine svm is another type of ml that is a linear model usually applied in classification and regression problems by developing a hyper plane capable of solving linear and non linear problems into easy and executable classes shafapour et al 2015 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 applied the maximum entropy model in fhm which is a combination of data from different sources to generate a probability distribution that represents the training data the probability distribution is then evaluated with the highest entropy with the training dataset janizadeh et al 2019 popa et al 2019 reported over 90 prediction accuracy of the multilayer perceptron mp in flood susceptibility mapping the mp model illustrates logistic regression which replaces the input for a non linear function hidden layer and it is often used in function approximation and order identification a similar regression based model is the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars which is a nonparametric model that enables flexibility in the evaluation of multi dimensional experimental data and can model complex nonlinear problems to generate straightforward linear models dodangeh et al 2020 the integration of multiple ml ai models have also been applied in fhm and such models are ensemble models like the naive bayes trees nbt which is an integration of naïve bayes and decision trees adopt pre pruning while building the tree structure and its technique is non complex and high predicting capability khosravi et al 2018 furthermore is the bayesian glm general linear model which is an improvement of the glm that adapts the technique of bayesian for effective prediction hosseini et al 2019 also termeh et al 2018 was able to identify flood susceptible areas with an ensemble of genetic algorithm ga model which has random nature that presents a better chance of finding a good solution to complex and chaotic problems in less time wilson and mantooth 2013 and four other models artificial intelligence based models have also performed well in identifying flood hazard prone areas as reported by bui et al 2020 the authors highlighted that the grasshopper optimization algorithm goa the grey wolf algorithm gwo and social spider optimization algorithm ssoa outperformed the support vector machine and particle swarm optimization and random forest in analyzing flood susceptible regions others include the firefly algorithm fa which is a recent metaheuristic algorithm developed by yang 2009 from the inspiration of fireflies behaviour nguyen et al 2018 the extreme learning machine elm is also an artificial intelligence proposed by huang et al 2006 for single hidden layer feedforward neural networks to create an efficient algorithm with a faster learning speed bui et al 2019c huang et al 2006 the deep learning neural network dlnn is also an artificial neural network that has more than a single hidden layer and is normally trained using the back propagation method it has difficulty in training the network when the number of hidden layers is increased due to the varying learning speeds of the hidden layers bui et al 2020 others include the particle swarm optimization pso bui et al 2019c wilson and mantooth 2013 the ant colonization algorithm aco termeh et al 2018 the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis mathur et al 2016 etc 3 2 case studies in this section several studies that carried out fhm are discussed most of the studies highlighted have delineated flood hazards through physically based physical and empirical methods the strengths and limitations of these methods are also discussed in this section a brief comparison of the advantages and limitations of the modelling methods in fhm is presented in table 3 3 2 1 physically based models in fhm 1d hydrodynamic models are relevant as these models have been widely applied in water resources management and flood modelling studies to support flood mitigation planning and key decision making in flood risk management such is presented by tian et al 2019 when they applied a 1d hydrologic hydraulic model in examining the flood inundation resulting from normal frequent flood occurrence of below 20 years return period by applying river flow theory gis and digital elevation model dem the resulting flood hazard and damage map were able to accurately identify the affected areas thereby meeting the requirement of the flood hazard analysis of the region of study this was done by calibrating the model result using flood observation data of 2012 alongside aerial image data of the study area for verification aryal et al 2020 determined inundated areas of an area of about 38 sq km for five different return periods using hec ras modelling tool to develop the 1d hydrodynamic model the authors concluded that the model result could buttress crucial decision making in flood management and help in flood management planning the 2d model has also proven to be dependent capable of executing complex computations simulating flood processes and accurate this is proven in the study by nguyen et al 2015 which developed a high resolution model 10 m resolution flood map indicating flood depth and velocities this was conducted by applying an integrated hydrologic hydraulic model which was made up of the hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm and a 2d hydraulic brezo modelling tool the validated flood predictions result of water level and streamflow showed a high confidence level in the models prediction of spatial flood and velocities fernández pato 2018 combined a 2d and 1d hydrodynamic model in modelling surface flow and pipe network flow to a riverbank tributary case study the 2d surface area was discretized by applying the optimal number of cells the integration of both models was validated through laboratory experimental data and real flood data of high intensity storm events the coupled 1d and 2d model and the experimental test was able to forecast the sudden variation in the flow depth of both the sewer and the riverbank flow li et al 2006 applied a 3d model in studying the effect of relocating a flood prevention system by analyzing possible impacts resulting from both tidal and fluvial flooding from the south and the river usk respectively the findings of the investigation showed that there will be a negligible impact on the relocation of the flood mitigation system and the nearby environment yang et al 2018 investigated the tsunami force control by using a numerical dam break wave in simulating this force with a 3d numerical model and the result was validated using a similar physical model experimentation result from another study amason 2005 3 2 1 1 conceptual physically based and data driven hydrological models these models possess the ability to enhance flood prediction accuracy through simplified basins hydrological process simulation chen et al 2016 dutta and herath 2004 applied a conceptual modelling approach in deciding on how to control flood hazards and the associated risk the model outcome was able to highlight the relevance of the basin scale flood management method for flood risk reduction other studies incorporate simulation of flood parameters in conceptual and physically based models to delineate flood hazard zones evaluate flood depth and damage extent using hydrodynamic models a similar study was carried out by shrestha and lohpaisankrit 2017 which combined a physically based model hydraulic and a conceptual model to simulate flood scenarios using various climatic change prediction models to predict future flood occurrences sufiyan and magaji 2018 simulated flow using catchment hydrological response parameters with a swat and three dimensional model mirzaei et al 2016 applied kineros and hec ras hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling tools to simulate varying water level scenarios and map inundated areas in the langat river basin malaysia hosseiny et al 2020 identified flood inundated areas and evaluated flood depth by applying an ensemble of ml and hydraulic models the hydraulic model was calibrated with observed surface water level data and was used to train random forest and multilayer perceptron models to forecast water level in wet nodes the authors concluded the findings can be applied to save computational time and cost the impact of snowmelt as discussed in the introductory part is significant in flood hazard potential and should be taken into consideration at all times especially for alpine regions like switzerland and the pacific northwest of the usa voigt et al 2003 in the study conducted by nie et al 2020 glacial lake burst flood was investigated by recreating past floods due to glacial outbursts by applying a glacial lake outburst flood glof model comprising of a dam break model dl breach and a hydrodynamic model the result from the study indicated a near future recurrence and the authors recommended the application of additional sediment and soil data for a substantial parameterization of the model for accurate flood hazard prediction 3 2 2 physical models in fhm a comparison between numerical 3d and physical experimentation of simulation of a dam break flow indicated that the physical experiment was more accurate and the experimental data from the study can be applied for model validation for other study areas ozmen cagatay et al 2014 postacchini et al 2019 proved the impact of the incidence angle flow depth flow velocity on the pressure acting on the walls of buildings when a model mansory structure scaled at 1 10 was applied in simulating flow mechanisms güney et al 2014 constructed a distorted physical model to investigate dam break resulting from flooding after an intensive storm event the model was built in such a way that its sizing allowed the components of the dam consisting of the body reservoir and downstream region with horizontal scaling of 1 150 to fit in a space of 300 square meters the model also enabled the construction of features capable of simulating roughness like culverts bridges houses and roads the flow that will cause the model dam to fail was examined for instantaneous partial collapse through simulation of a trapezoidal gap on the model dam body parameters measured include the depth of flow by ultrasonic velocity profiler uvp transducers flood propagation by a high resolution camera water level by water level sensors and flow velocities the result from the experiments indicated that the region of study modelled can be flooded in minutes at flow depth reaching 3 m and in four minutes for the built up areas kvočka et al 2016 successfully tested the capability of a physical model with experimentation and a numerically formulated model in accessing analyzing and predicting extreme flood hazard events the numerically based method applied was derived from the methodology of ramsbottom and surendran 2006 which tests the impact of flood hazards on human subjects the physical model applied was developed by xia et al 2014 in the uk and it was based on the processes of falling and forces on a human subject in a water body the findings from the investigation revealed that the physically based model is preferable as a method of analyzing extreme flood hazards in the study this was because the physical model method is more influenced by increased velocities and momentum regarding higher froude numbers rather than depending on velocity alone like in the physically based methods physical models were recommended for areas susceptible to flash floods or extreme coastal flooding on a large scale because the physical model tested in the study efficiently considered variations in rapid flow and enable a fast and visual flood hazard and risk assessment tomiczek et al 2020 tested the capability of mangrove forests in safeguarding the coastal environment during extreme flooding events the study built a physical model consisting of a mangrove boundary and modelled residential buildings the model was tested with varying transient wave conditions measurements of surface water level flow velocity flow pressure forces acting on cross shores and pressure close and acting against the building showed the mangrove affects the inshore flow hydrodynamics and forces the experimental results also showed that the existence of the mangrove was related to increased water levels and minimized peak velocities of flow between the inshore buildings and the mangrove begam et al 2018 also investigated glof with a numerical 2d model and validated the results by building a physical model the results from the study indicated a satisfactory correlation between the observation and the experimental results 3 2 3 empirical models in fhm 3 2 3 1 mcdm methods kourgialas and karatzas 2011 produced maps for each fif based on the factor s interactive influence on each other on all other factors and also on hazard followed by assigning weights rating method to each factor and finally integrating all factor weights to obtain an overall flood hazard map using six fifs the six fifs selection was conducted based on the general importance and findings from past studies the results from the study were found reliable when validated with the record of the flood events in the study area gigović et al 2017 applied fuzzy logic based on interval rough ir numbers in a gis environment to develop an fhi to produce a flood hazard map using six fifs the ir ahp showed the best consistency when compared to historical flood events alongside the fuzzy ahp and ordinary ahp xiao et al 2017 developed a flood hazard map using the fuzzy ahp technique rather than the conventional wlc in assigning weights to the developed factors some of which included flow accumulation soil conservation service curve number drainage pumping stations slope elevation standard deviation depression point density and dike density and integrating all weights for a comprehensive flood hazard map the applied technique of the ordered weighted averaging owa method which is based on optimization that was combined with fuzzy ahp made the result of the analysis flexible in terms of the decision makers risk consideration arabameri et al 2019 used topsis and vikor in the analysis of a flood prone area and compared it with two statistical methods fr ebf when analyzing flood susceptibility areas the findings from the study indicated the optimal fifs and established efficiency in combining statistical and mcdm methods by applying remote sensing data with the gis technique phrakonkham et al 2019 evaluated the flood hazard index fhi from the relationship between flow velocity and flow duration to produce a flood hazard map the fhi values were used to recognize flood prone zones on the land use change hazard map the climate change impact on flood hazard was determined by estimating the difference in duration of flood between 50 and 100 year recurrence intervals subsequently ahp was used to assign weights based on criteria relevance and finally an integrated flood hazard map was created arianpour and jamali 2015 reported high accuracy when the authors applied boolean and fuzzy rules in factor selection in the spatial mcdm model because raw data which are sometimes characterized by error was not applied 3 2 3 2 statistical models in fhm khosravi et al 2016 mapped flood susceptible regions by applying three statistical models which included si woe and shannon s entropy using 10 fifs and flood inventory records the results from the study showed that the best model was the si as similarly indicated in the study of shafapour et al 2019 kalantari et al 2014 applied the pls model to evaluate nine physical catchment descriptors that are significant in the prediction of fhm the result showed land use elevation and soil type were the most influential to flood hazards in the study area the authors concluded that the methodology applied was a simple and consistent approach in delineating flood prone areas along roads nandi et al 2016 applied lr in fhm with the help of principal component analysis in fif selection analysis and the flood frequency distribution the result of the study showed an accurate prediction the methodology can be adopted for similar catchments and the analysis can be developed with additional and updated information rahmati et al 2016a applied woe and fr in flood susceptibility mapping by using 110 flood records and nine fifs the result of the study showed both methods presented similar good predicting accuracy performance 3 2 3 3 ml ai models in fhm hosseini et al 2019 categorized selected fifs through simulated annealing as input and the flash flood inventory map as output in the ml model and validated the models for spatial flash flood prediction map development the selection of the fifs was done based on findings from past studies and data availability in the study area the maps were classified and flash flood hazard maps were produced the study applied new machine learning models glmboost rf and bayesian glm the results revealed the models performed excellently and accurately in flash fhm popa et al 2019 made use of fr mp and an ensemble of both to develop an index for flash flood and flood hazard for mapping using flood inventory records and fifs the combination of fr and mp outshined others in terms of performance in fhm and findings revealed the fifs directly influence flood development khosravi et al 2018 examined four machine learning models decision tree type in the production of fsms which incorporated 11 fifs the study revealed that the adt model performed better than the other models zhao et al 2018 applied random forest rf in delineating flood susceptible regions by applying flood inventory records and fifs results from the study indicated the highest fifs to flood occurrences and showed that the rf model applied outperformed the svm and ann models 3 3 modelling method strengths and limitations 3 3 1 physically based models the time required for numerical modelling in fhm is becoming more tolerable and these models are the most applied in flood analysis studies ahmad and simonovic 2015 teng et al 2017 the simulation of the physical processes that describe a flood flow system is made possible through numerical computations in this model in addition to this the access to better dems resolution and more accurate data has greatly benefitted the application of hydrodynamic models unlike the physical models which require fabrication and experimentation to build the flow scenario and obtain results which can be costly some numerical models are freely available for use 3 3 1 1 1d hydrodynamic models 1d models have widespread recognition and a 1d hydrodynamic modelling tool like hec ras 1d is free software for global users these models are effective when computing a wide range of river drainage systems and several water resources structures these models are capable of effectively carrying out flood analysis anees et al 2016 flood risk analysis tian et al 2019 and dam break analysis the 1d model requires less computational time easier to run and build than the 2d numerical model gharbi et al 2016 lin et al 2006 the id models are also capable of forecasting the average velocity of a channel cross section and the water surface elevation however the id hydrodynamic model with all the above mentioned strengths is only suitable for modelling properly outlined and steady flow channels the id hydrodynamic is unable to incorporate the entire details of the complexity of urban flooding especially internal floods this is because in 1d models the impact of increased resistance posed by structures or buildings is not accounted for explicitly unlike in 2d models vojinovic and tutulic 2009 therefore researchers have found alternatives in coupling 1d and 2d models to accurately map flood inundated areas in urban areas when there is a need to consider flow interactions between ground surfaces and underground pipe systems fan et al 2017 also the assumptions such as horizontal cross section water level negligible river curvature and hydraulic jump small mean bottom slope and application of the law of resistance for friction caused by stream boundaries and unsteady flows similar to the one applied for steady flows reduces the accuracy in the 1d model results 3 3 1 2 2d hydrodynamic models the 2d hydrodynamic model is capable of accurately estimating the flow depth and velocities across a grid that outlines the topographic domain under investigation toombes and chanson 2011 the 2d has been described to possess relevant improvement in the evaluation of hydraulic parameters and the identification of flood prone areas these models are widely applied in fhm however the evaluation takes longer computational time and the probability of large variations in cell sizes due to the complexity of urban underground surface will result in reduced efficiency caused by the limited time step which is dependent on the smallest cells in the mesh fan et al 2017 there are limitations in the computational approach applied in evaluating the forces acting on individual flow components like the viscous shear stresses and channel bed friction in addition to the basic assumptions made by the saint venant equations toombes and chanson 2011 3 3 1 3 3d hydrodynamic models the recent years have seen the improvement in computing capabilities which has allowed the application of 3d hydrodynamic models in surface water analysis a 3d flood model can enable a practical design to be carried out using a computer system li et al 2006 show clearer details of the flow fields al zubaidi and wells 2018 turbulent conditions at varying scenarios enable clearer understanding into various physical processes via free surface flow abdurrasheed et al 2019 and improved visualization of flooded areas for better flood risk reduction management douass and kbir 2019 it also allows users more regulation of the 3d visualization which enables extended exploration and investigation of flood affected areas lim 2018 these models tend to be more accurate and more complicated therefore discouraging the model s application in large scale study areas prinos 2008 anees et al 2016 mentioned the need for applying these models will be difficult to justify if the analysis required for the study includes computation of parameters like inundation extent flood depth velocity direction a magnitude which can be done with the 1d and 2d hydrodynamic models some examples of numerical model types and related application areas are presented in table 4 3 3 1 4 conceptual physically based and data driven hydrological models one of the major advantages of physically based hydrological models is the ability to simulate the mechanism that makes up the hydrologic cycle of a basin the models are most suitable for use when data is sufficiently available and enable enhanced comprehension of the basins characteristics related to flood processes its application incorporates larger scales because it allows for a longer computational period it also enables the evaluation of the physical parameters of the basin it is however unable to measure parameters that are process based such as water storage capacity physically based hydrological models are limited at catchment scale and are therefore not replicable to non similar basins the conceptual hydrological models require field data for calibration which are sometimes not available or sufficient chen et al 2016 sitterson et al 2017 according to kan et al 2017 conceptual models have gained a reputation for being reliable and powerful tools for hydrological simulation and flood forecasting they have more benefits in comparison to physically based fully distributed hydrological models in terms of computational efficiency complexity simplified and suitability in addition they present more physical clarity than the black box models all the above mentioned attributes have made them a relevant tool in flood forecasting further details on the comparison between physically based and conceptual rainfall runoff models can be read in the study by jaiswal et al 2020 one of the key strengths of the data driven hydrological models is that they can numerically derive flood non linearly with the use of historical data without the understanding of the physical processes that result in flood generation these models are also faster require less input to build less computation time and cheaper to operate however there have been reports about inadequacies regarding short term prediction and the requirement of extensive data in terms of long term prediction and for a reliable forecast mosavi et al 2018 3 3 1 5 physical models the findings from physical models are factual results allowing a proper understanding of the phenomena and the complexity of the processes that lead to flood generation the results from these models can provide in detail the impact of a flood on humans infrastructure and the environment with a proper time scale the method allows proper investigation into high impact flood events such as hurricane katrina which caused destruction and failure of several infrastructures emelen et al 2012 and dam break failures due to flooding larocque et al 2013 leal et al 2002 soares frazão and zech 2007 the physical models enable the validation of theoretical model output the analysis of various details of the physical projects and tests the various effect of flood hazard impact on the environment in extreme conditions its application gives a better understanding of how structures will behave under varying flow conditions with instant visual results carmo 2020 taveira pinto et al 2020 despite all these capabilities the models are characterized by several complex issues that are difficult to solve such an issue may be scale effects in cases where there is a need to scale a free hydrodynamic surface by applying a flow that will fulfill all the conditions of the targeted stimulation additionally there are cases of laboratory effects such as reflection restriction on flows experiment duration and incomplete modelling taveira pinto et al 2020 even though the results from the physically modeled flood cases represent factual experimental processes the cost of building these models is high there are reported cases of uncertainties in results due to limited measurement devices emelen et al 2012 and the inability to properly simulate the actual roughness required from stand in materials güney et al 2014 3 3 2 empirical models the empirical model unlike the physical models does not try to simulate physical processes but applies data observations or estimations as inputs physically based methods have been used in flood mapping to describe predict and simulate various parts of the processes and development of floods fhm requires a wide range of hydrologic observation data and in recent years due to the non availability of this data researchers are now finding alternatives in qualitative and quantitative approaches in empirical methods in fhm with the accessibility of remote sensing data 3 3 2 1 the mcdm models mcdm can provide information to help rank uncertainties associated with model components such as deriving flood depth magnitude and extent which are usually solved based on the study participant participants intuition only flood risk management requires the contribution of decision support methods that consider various policy decision makers opinions objectives subjective views possible alternatives and optimum evaluation criteria mcdm can be applied in synthesizing complex environmental issues like flood disasters and socio economic goals to make the best decision mcdm has been successfully applied in flood analysis and fhm with the help of gis and remote sensing data franci et al 2016 nigusse and adhanom 2019 rahmati et al 2016b to produce more flexible less biased and accurate decisions in evaluation of relevant fifs the mcdm are methods that have proven to be relevant in delineating flood hazard areas for both gauged and ungauged regions and on a large scale even though the mcdm is simple to apply and implement the method is subjected to uncertainties based on different experts opinions and perspectives 3 3 2 2 the statistical models the statistical methods enable the integration of gis based numerical simulation with statistical methods for fhm by applying weighted indices these methods can be easily understood with less computing time and is accurate for flood modelling as it considers observation and remote sensing data to produce flood susceptibility hazard maps on small scales these methods do not require specific data computing software and system capacity to run the model the fr method requires minimum data input easy to process at a low cost on the other hand methods like ebf requires a high run time a wide range of estimation process and data transformation before producing the final flood hazard maps shafapour et al 2019 3 3 2 3 the ml ai models the artificial intelligence machine learning methods are frequently applied in flood modelling because of the computational efficiency in detecting spatial flood extent and susceptible areas using remote sensing data and past flood data these models are good models that can be combined with other methods in flood modelling and are also effective in data scarce regions the major problem with these kinds of models is the input data bad data and length of the dataset can influence the accuracy of the prediction model furthermore resulting flood prediction can be affected by applying out of range training values in validating prediction models dodangeh et al 2020 janizadeh et al 2019 termeh et al 2018 3 4 recent trends in fhm methodologies in this section the recent development in methods will be discussed 3 4 1 physically based models prinos 2008 categorized the numerical methods in fhm into the first second and third generation models by the models level of complexity this categorization describes the mode of development in these models the authors referred to the 1d as the first the 1d and 1d 2d coupled models as the second and the 3d as the third generation models table 5 shows a summary of these models and some typical characteristics 3 4 1 1 1d hydrodynamic models recent and current studies in 1d hydrodynamic modelling include the afflux system which enables a better technique for forecasting surges in the upstream water level of hydraulic structures another high point in the development of the 1d is the linking potential it has with the 2d hydrodynamic models néelz and pender 2009 teng et al 2017 over the years researchers have found alternatives when modelling floodplains where the assumptions associated with 1d requires clarification researchers opt for the fully 2d or integrate the 1d and 2d hydrodynamic models the 1d 2d coupled models have made significant improvement over the years as have been applied in complex flow and drainage system and can model flood problems associated with flood hazard and risk dhondia and stelling 2004 lin et al 2006 3 4 1 2 2d hydrodynamic models for a long time the application of 2d hydrodynamic models to large areas was a difficult task because of the long computation duration required recently the development of parallelization methods has enabled new areas for investigation report on computation time conservation by developing 2d swe on message passing interface communication that will normally function with high performance computers ferrari et al 2019 3 4 1 3 3d hydrodynamic models the improvement in the 1 2 and 1 2 ds can be found in the 3d hydrodynamic models which have been reported to possess high computational accuracy enables users with a better understanding of hydrological processes understanding adjustable gridding system realistic prediction of flood scenarios accessible for modelling larger scaled flood problems and less complexity anees et al 2017 recently flood disaster management activities have found the need for 3d technologies and cartographic visualization to help in understanding and increasing the awareness of flood problems at regional local and global scales herman et al 2017 furthermore digital hydrodynamic modelling tools have improved flood management decision making through the evaluation and visualization of flow parameters in 3d with the help of data from virtual environments such data include satellite images topographic maps dem and lidar points clouds wu et al 2019 applying 3d models to flood inundation modelling for fhm in scales exceeding a kilometer was initially regarded as not feasible because of the required computing power and issues of accuracy in presenting turbulent conditions at varying scenarios free surface flows velocity flow fields al zubaidi and wells 2018 teng et al 2017 however alternatives have been made possible through a particle based method referred to as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph which enables high quality visualization with the help of graphics processing units that accelerate the simulation process in comparison to the computer processing unit s execution hadimlioglu et al 2020 goswami et al 2010 improvement in 3d flood simulations has also been made possible through advanced graphics processing units particle based simulations and data availability however there were limitations posed by the sph as presented by goswami et al 2010 teng et al 2017 based on an overestimation of cpu memory consumption but improved sph methods have been introduced and seen in studies by alihan hadimlioglu et al 2020 goswami et al 2010 winchenbach et al 2016 3 4 1 4 conceptual data driven and physically based hydrological models the physical based distributed hydrological model was initially based on the assumption that the model will define parameters directly from the hydrological processes of the catchment and does not require the calibration of model parameters this resulted in high uncertainty leading to errors in flood forecasting recently parameter optimization has become a necessity for these models chen et al 2016 evaluated the flood prediction performance of two catchment areas in china using a particle swarm optimization algorithm additionally duethmann et al 2020 mentioned that various studies have shown indication that hydrological models perform less when applied to periods with climate conditions that vary from the ones applied during calibration this setback was tested to know the reason for the discrepancy between the observed and simulated streamflow values by making few modifications in the new model the findings from the study showed that precipitation data obtained from stationary rainfall stations is important uncertainties in climate change predictions can also be assessed using the physically based hydrological model in analyzing flood hazard potential under various climate change scenarios shrestha and lohpaisankrit 2017 in most cases of hydrodynamic modelling studies physically based distributed models tingsanchali and karim 2010 and mathematical and analogue models peel and mcmahon 2020 are used for rainfall runoff modelling recent years have seen both conceptual and physically based hydrological models been combined with various data driven models machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict runoff for rainfall runoff modelling kwon et al 2020 to provide more accuracy such ensemble was applied in the study by young et al 2017 which applied a hybrid hec hms ann and support vector regression for accurate rainfall runoff prediction in modelling extreme typhoons also kwon et al 2020 applied a hybrid of tank which is a conceptual hydrological model and least squared svm to analyze the rainfall runoff process further recent advances have been made possible through flood predicting models that integrate hydraulic models with land phase models to enable simulation of flood generation in an entire drainage basin these modelling tools are operated by factors such as rainfall evaporation temperature which are sourced from remote sensing ground stations or a combination of both for updated data the integration of these hydrological and hydraulic river routing have been successfully applied in fhm of complex flow systems with the aid of adequate digital terrain models arduino et al 2005 fatapour et al 2020 knijff et al 2010 3 4 2 physical models there have been notable technological advancements in the last few decades as the perspective of physical models have changed because of the development of equipment and techniques applied in experimentation the improvement in this aspect will result in improved field data thereby allowing for reliable calibrations carmo 2020 taveira pinto et al 2020 this has offered some solutions to the limitations of numerical modelling generally with improved experimental techniques the physical models enable the opportunity to investigate new flow phenomena and the estimation of variables in complex flows which are impossible via numerical computations taveira pinto et al 2020 physical model methods represent real flood phenomena recent advances for these methods are in the integration of physical and numerical models which is referred to as composite modelling gerritsen et al 2011 in other words a balanced application of numerical and physical models it is the computational representation of the real flood phenomena which form the advanced methods various concepts and assumptions are linked to these advanced methods because these models enable optimized results from both the numerical and physical models for specific flood analysis applying this method at a suitable geographical scale will result in an excellent simulation of the entire process the future of these models lies in the application of numerical simulations in enhancing physical models i e composite models especially for complex flow flood cases which are difficult to replicate in models taveira pinto et al 2020 such cases can include turbid currents turbulent flows and scour at complex bridge piers yang et al 2019 a further question is whether numerical models applied for specific scales validate some model scale effects such as the effect of kinematic viscosity 3 4 3 empirical models the notable observation is the diversity in the choice of methodologies that depends mainly on data availability and other factors like capabilities advantages and limitations of these methods there are a lot of challenges in producing flood hazard maps mainly due to the inaccessibility of sufficient data for flood investigations such as hydrologic data flood event records and topographical survey maps of drainage networks and flood plains kourgialas and karatzas 2017 furthermore is the complexity of applying physically based models which sometimes requires large datasets for execution hong et al 2018 longer computing time and little flow dynamics illustration of conceptual models teng et al 2017 some researchers are now finding alternatives in different approaches in the empirical modelling of flood hazard areas with the help of remote sensing data the empirical based modelling methods in fhm are useful in data scarce regions because remote sensing data can serve as a supporting system in place of insufficient or unavailable historical data the physically based modelling methods are sometimes executed with large data producing reliable results franci et al 2016 while the empirical methods such as the mcdm need fewer data and also generate suitable results souissi et al 2019 flood hazard maps that are presently accessible globally are often portrayed in poor resolution giustarini et al 2015 accurate and effective identification of flood prone regions needs high resolution dem data which is costly and scarce thereby much reliance on the free and available data like the us geological survey usgs strm dem topographical maps and national remote sensing center nrsc cartosat 1 dem kuldeep and garg 2011 the early phase of satellite remote sensing data experienced the availability of landsat multi spectral scanner mss with 80 m resolution dominantly applied for flood mitigation studies this extended to the landsat thematic mapper imageries of 30 m which provides flood monitoring data and for identifying flood spatial extent boundary improvement of the landsat thematic mapper imageries of 30 m brought the landsat tm band 7 wang et al 2019b wang et al 2011 and landsat oli ahmed and kranthi 2018 hong et al 2018 which is capable of easily delineating inundated regions recently the spot imageries which perform better with dem in flood analysis emerged also the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr became available which is relatively relevant in regional flood analysis and for evaluating normalized difference vegetation index ndvi sanyal and lu 2005 furthermore large scale flood mapping analysis can rely on imageries obtained from the recent synthetic aperture radar sar images such as the terrasar x giustarini et al 2015 shafapour et al 2015 sentinel 1 bui et al 2019a ngo et al 2018 rahman et al 2019 phased array l band synthetic aperture radar palsar rahman et al 2019 advanced land observing satellite 2 alos 2 arabameri et al 2019 kumar 2016 liu et al 2019 and cosmo skymed liu et al 2019 3 5 uncertainty associated with fhm methods in this section the uncertainty related to each method discussed in this study will be briefly explained uncertainty can be categorized as the natural and epistemic uncertainty as the former can be ascribed to the uncertainty resulting from non predictable outcomes and the latter can be ascribed to the uncertainty resulting from missing information lack of expertise of process and technique anuar 2018 merz and thieken 2005 3 5 1 physically based modelling methods generally uncertainty in fhm can be accounted for by uncertainty in hydrologic data topographic data hydraulic model mapping technique and the geospatial approach applied in its generation bales and wagner 2009 merwade et al 2008 a detailed explanation of uncertainty in flood risk flood risk management frequency analysis can be found in berbić et al 2015 hall 2014 merz and thieken 2005 and flood estimation in blazkova and beven 2009 the proper identification of uncertainties requires effective investigation of the originating source teng et al 2017 for the hydrodynamic modelling prinos 2008 classified these uncertainties into the model data and parameter uncertainty as shown in table 6 uncertainties can be addressed through model calibration of the model the uncertainties associated with friction parameters seem to be the important factor to uncertainty and therefore given optimal consideration despite other sources such as model framework and topographical factors one analytic technique to measure uncertainty is the general likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 which has proven to be relevant and is easy to implement anuar 2018 3 5 2 physical modelling methods even though the results from the physical modelling flood cases represent factual experimental processes the cost of building these models is high and highly dependent on funding by government bodies there are reported cases of uncertainties due to limited measurement devices emelen et al 2012 measurement error and the inability to properly simulate the actual roughness of different environmental and infrastructural features güney et al 2014 through use of stand in materials the materials representing these stand in materials are required to have the same roughness of actual features while considering the froude number but in most cases simulation of roughness introduces a lot of uncertainties in the physical model for composite models that combine numerical and physical models gerritsen et al 2011 confirmed from a case study of coastal modelling that these models can reduce bed uncertainty in physical modelling in which one or two properly selected bedforms are under consideration 3 5 3 empirical modelling methods 3 5 3 1 mcdm models in mcdm various approaches have been developed to rank complex issues with multi criteria attributes this modelling method allows the definition evaluation and ranking of alternatives that are selected based on the criteria weight determination however the decision making process is often associated with uncertainties mcdm approach requires both internal and external information whereby the internal information describes the decision makers approach for consistency and rational decision making related to the judgment and alternative structure the external information is related to the circumstances surrounding the decision its consequences and the constraints uncertainties relating to the internal information of the decision making process may result due to wrong judgment arising from the misconception of an alternative su and tung 2014 the external uncertainties are related to processes related to analyzing and specification of criteria under consideration besides uncertainties related to flood events characterized by natural aleatoric uncertainty madruga and evers 2016 merz et al 2008 the ahp indirectly accesses uncertainties through evaluation of the inconsistency index for every pairwise comparison made according to madruga and evers 2016 in flood analysis using mcdm a larger percentage of researchers do not report the performance of sensitivity analysis although sensitivity analysis was applied in the mcdm methods by fernández and lutz 2010 kazakis et al 2015 souissi et al 2019 toosi et al 2019 and examples include single parameter sensitivity analysis spsa taylor series error propagation and monte carlo approach which incorporates extended fast fourier amplitude sensitivity test method fernández and lutz 2010 some other authors validated the results obtained with a flood event record of the study area nigusse and adhanom 2019 phrakonkham et al 2019 to check for similarities the spsa replaces the empirical weights obtained through ahp or any other weighting methods with effective weights souissi et al 2019 the single parameter sensitivity analysis is easy therefore makes it a practical approach for researchers even though it does not consider the informative aspect of the uncertainty thereby giving room for bias overview of the final mapping decision uncertainties relating to subjectivity of the decision makers opinion can be modelled by methods like the fuzzy set which deals with groups whose boundaries are unclear yang et al 2013 and a combination fuzzy set with other mcdm methods because of its similarity to human reasoning and computational requirements even with these capabilities some studies have indicated that the fuzzy set theory does not provide a better outcome than the ahp judgments are fuzzy thereby finding no need for the complexity of fuzzy numbers madruga 2018 the objective methods do not rely completely on the decision makers opinion but rather highlight the mathematical evaluation of the criteria weights thereby reducing the rate of uncertainty and increasing the effectiveness of the evaluation process an objective method like the entropy based mcdm was proposed by mahmoody and jelokhani niaraki 2019 and the result from the study indicated that the method provides more accuracy than the subjective method a summary of mcdm methods highlighting the methods characteristics from a few selected fhm studies is presented in table 7 3 5 3 2 statistical and ml ai models on the other hand for statistical models and machine learning methods it is crucial to evaluate the performance of a prediction model dodangeh et al 2020 and it is common to make use of statistical indicators for the evaluation and comparison of classification models bui et al 2020 examples of some of these testing measures include the relative operating characteristics curve roc often applied in the predictive performance test popa et al 2019 rahmati et al 2019 others include root mean square error rmse applied by elkhrachy 2015 kia et al 2012 kourgialas and karatzas 2017 kumar 2016 coefficient of determination r2 kia et al 2012 kling gupta efficiency kge for flood model prediction model evaluation rezaei sadr 2020 true skill statistics tss popularly referred to as hanssen kuipers discriminant dodangeh et al 2020 heidke skill score hosseini et al 2019 correlation coefficient dodangeh et al 2020 overall accuracy bui et al 2020 and wilcoxon signed rank tests hong et al 2018 khosravi et al 2018 wei et al 2019 and confusion matrix hosseini et al 2019 4 summary fhm has formed the basis for an improved approach in flood mitigation measures and management researchers and policy makers must also be aware and mindful of the next limiting components in flood analysis for fhm variations in the prediction results obtained from the various modelling methods indicate the uncertainty related to the fhm modelling method future developments in fhm may involve outweighing the benefits of the physical model against the additional costs especially for areas where the expectation of flood hazard risk vulnerability and damage are high in regards to composite modelling uncertainty associated with physical models that simulate the physical processes of the terrain should be given more attention the future for these models lies in the solution to how numerical simulations can be applied in enhancing physical models i e composite models especially for complex flow flood cases that are difficult to replicate in models the upgrade in equipment applied in physical models will improve the result to reduce uncertainty and encourage its application dem and digital terrain model dtm play a significant role in physically based hydrodynamic modelling and the influence of high resolution dem on flood hazard maps generated should be given more investigative consideration the improvement of the computational ability of computer systems has given a positive opportunity in simulating flows with high resolution data complex terrain and boundaries at larger scales investigation of uncertainty should be extended to flood depth and extents because of the possibility of the vertical changes in the profile affecting the horizontal stretch of the water there is a need for future research to consider highlighting uncertainty associated with flood hazard analysis in the maps because most times it is graphically represented and not included in the actual flood hazard map this will help in flood risk analysis as it relies much on fhm researchers should consider simplifying the representation of uncertainties presented in flood hazard analysis for better comprehension of flood management decisions for policymakers as empirical methods in fhm relies greatly on remote sensing data there is a need to highlight that fhms developed using dem land use soil map and etc need to be updated regularly the need to source reliable and high resolution data for flood hazard susceptibility mapping is highly recommended as highlighted with physically based modelling methods in fhm the influence of the different resolution of remote sensing data should be investigated on the outcome of the flood hazard map and its contribution to the uncertainty associated with the final flood map there is a need for researchers to explore more objective methods in mcdm that evaluate the whole decision making process rather than relying on fuzzifying the methods and sensitivity analysis despite the report of high prediction capabilities associated with using machine learning models in delineating flood hazard susceptibility areas the results can be affected by uncertainties associated with the input data it will be of benefit for future researchers to work on recommended models with varying study regions to validate the predictive performance of machine learning models the consideration of antecedent soil conditions and rainfall days preceding major flood derived from the historical record as part of fifs should be incorporated in flood hazard susceptibility studies researchers can also benefit from applying different classification methods in which principles are founded on statistical or probabilistic methods in preference to the practical ones with less objective expert based approaches which can improve the model predictive performance researchers should also consider the model averaging method which integrates the result of different individual models through the exploration of more ensemble models in a single robust model for the best result future studies should also be mindful of the date of flood events records collected through remote sensing concerning selected fifs such as urbanization and climate change that are susceptible to temporal variability 5 conclusion this paper presents a comprehensive review of methodologies in fhm a current review of the various fhm objectives is presented based on the increased need for flood hazard maps to mitigate the increased flood disaster events previous studies have reviewed methods in fhm with a higher focus on numerical modelling methods in this paper a current review of the physically based physical and empirical methods is given the result from the systematic literature findings indicate a 46 20 application rate of empirical modelling methods surpassing the 43 8 and 10 application rate for physically based modelling and physical modelling methods respectively this might indicate the significance of the modelling methods as key tools in flood management practices the physical modelling method remains the least favourable as indicated by past studies while the empirical modelling methods showed an increment of 35 in application rate between 2000 and 2019 over the years there has been a great improvement in fhm methods which include developing models capable of computing complex flow for complex terrains and channels at reasonable run time with improved software packages and the application of supercomputers for modelling flood hazards despite the ability of physical models to present accurate and realistic flood scenarios these models are costly to build while empirical models can delineate flood hazard susceptibility regions and evaluate flood vulnerability and risk these models cannot predict flow depth velocity and the probability of future reoccurrence with all the capabilities and few limitations of these approaches researchers and decision makers can find precision potential opportunity to combine and understand uncertainties and risks associated with these methods most importantly researchers can pick on the numerous gaps and work on them to make a tremendous improvement in the field of flood analysis for fhm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

4126,the well known conceptual xin anjiang model xaj has limited capability for application in the basins with limited data due to two major runoff routing problems relying on the observed flow data to estimate the parameters of the muskingum method and lack of physics based representation of spatial heterogeneity in key routing parameters such as the river network recession constant cs to tackle these issues this study first developed a new hybrid rainfall runoff model named the xin anjiang digital channel xaj dch model by coupling the xaj model with the muskingum cunge todini mct and diffusion wave methods to improve the river network routing then a physics based cs estimation method was developed to conquer the data limitation by deriving the quantitative relationships of the cs parameter with basin characteristics such as sub catchment area average river slope average rainfall intensity and average river width based on the mass conservation the flood prediction capabilities of the xaj and xaj dch models were further tested and compared in the tunxi catchment with two nested sub catchments the results show that the xaj dch model can predict stream flows well at both catchment outlet and internal channel grid cells without recalibration moreover the derived cs values based on the proposed method enable both xaj and xaj dch models to gain good results with the averaged nash sutcliffe efficiency ranging between 0 91 and 0 95 keywords xin anjiang model river network recession constant channel routing diffusion wave muskingum cunge todini prediction in ungauged basin 1 introduction there are many small and medium sized rivers in china which suffer frequent floods and are the main contributor of natural hazard related casualties in china flood forecasting in these small and medium sized river basins are generally challenging due to the nature of floods in these basins characterized by heavy and rapid rainstorms fast flow concentration impacts of manmade small dams and reservoirs and lack of hydrometeorological data due to sparse rainfall stations among others fan et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 2021 in order to reduce the impact of floods operational flood forecasting systems have been developed around the world the growing necessity of these operational systems enhances the development of catchment hydrological models huo et al 2020 liu et al 2020 hydrological models are mainly divided into the distributed models and conceptual models distributed models have the advantages of accounting for the impacts of land surface and climate changes on the hydrologic system and providing flow simulation at interior locations of a watershed which makes hydrological predictions possible in ungauged or scarcely gauged watersheds and advances operational flood forecasting chao et al 2021 ciarapica and todini 2002 koren et al 2004 yao et al 2021 however a majority of distributed hydrological models are physically based as they are defined in light of mass and momentum conservation equations these models commonly require a large amount of high resolution input data making the parameterization and computation procedures very complicated and cumbersome in spite of great efforts the application results of the physically based models are usually unsatisfactory al areeq et al 2021 el hassan et al 2013 newman et al 2017 reed et al 2004 seyfried and wilcox 1995 yao et al 2012 because of the simplicity and effectiveness of conceptual models hydrologists are widely interested in the conceptually based distributed models to overcome the shortcomings of physically based models bell et al 2009 carpenter and georgakakos 2004 koren et al 2004 robinson and sivapalan 1995 yao et al 2012 in particular these conceptually based distributed models that combine the features of conceptual rainfall runoff models and physically distributed routing models have the potential to improve the simulation accuracy and spatiotemporal resolutions of practical river and stream forecasts the xin anjiang model xaj is a popular conceptual hydrological model which has been widely used in rainfall runoff simulation and prediction for humid and semi humid areas of china chao et al 2019 todini 2006 zhao 1992 zhao 1994 it has already been deployed in the china national flood forecasting system wmo 2011 however less attention has been paid on studying the flow routing of the xaj model there are two main problems in the flow routing module that are not well addressed and limit the xaj model prediction accuracy first channel routing parameters in the xaj model are set to be homogeneous in all sub reaches without considering the spatial heterogeneity of channel characteristics the outflow of each sub catchment is routed using the linear muskingum method to produce outflow of the whole catchment to compensate the impact of spatial heterogeneity the two parameters of the muskingum method are needed to be calibrated in the xaj model rui and zhang 2014 in addition since streamflow is routed using the muskingum method from each individual tributary to the outlet of a catchment in xaj model a linear summation of routed flows is made at the outlet on the supposition that flood waves from different tributaries propagate independently therefore the xaj model cannot predict the discharge at the interior points as a lumped model with the construction of manmade small dams and reservoirs in china the natural hydraulic characteristics of river channels have been changed the parameters and structure of the muskingum method are difficult to account for the human induced hydrological processes in the real world the second disadvantage is that the sensitive parameters must be calibrated based on historical streamflow data using either a trial and error approach or an automatic optimization algorithm even though some insensitive parameters of the xaj model can be preset or estimated based on past implementation experiences huang et al 2019 lü et al 2013 this makes the model difficult to achieve good results in the ungauged catchments according to the finding of yao et al 2014 solely transposing routing parameters of the xaj model from a downstream donor basin to an upstream recipient basin can cause higher uncertainty than solely transposing runoff generation parameters this is largely because the routing parameters are closely related to the geomorphologic characteristics of catchment which have higher spatial variability the river network recession constant cs of the xaj model represents the retention capacity of a sub catchment river network and quantifies the flood peak attenuation in the lag and route method zhao 1992 zhao 1994 it has been widely recognized that the simulated flood events by the xaj model are extremely sensitive to this parameter generally the value of cs ranges from 0 to 1 and has a higher value for a larger catchment in addition the value of cs generally tends to decrease from downstream to upstream areas since increasing slope has influence on flow velocity therefore it is difficult to calibrate or transpose the cs value directly for the data limited regions although many studies have applied to estimate the values of this parameter they still have some limitations for example zhao 1991 deduced the equation of cs with respect to the change of the reference river length reflecting the impacts of channel water storage and flow velocity according to the assumption of a linear reservoir but the method still relies on the observed hydrological data later some studies used the empirical or statistical methods to quantify the relationship between cs and geomorphologic characteristics hu et al 2017 xu et al 2008 but the established statistical relationship between cs and geomorphologic characteristics from one catchment is only applicable for the catchments with hydrological properties similar to this catchment it is difficult to widely apply these methods to any catchment especially these ungauged catchments therefore it is necessary to develop a physically based estimation method to accurately derive the cs value and account for its spatial variability to address the above mentioned issues in the xaj model it is necessary to use more physics based methods instead of the muskingum method to conduct channel routing as a typical hydrological routhing method the muskingum method was extended to a modified method known as the muskingum cunge method mc which considers time varying parameters cunge 1969 but the mc method does not warrant conservation of mass which can lead to a water imbalance of 8 to 10 ponce and changanti 1994 ponce and yevjevich 1978 tang et al 1999 therefore todini 2007 further developed the mc method to formulate the muskingum cunge todini approach mct to preserve the mass balance without changing water storage term other studies such as perumal and price 2013 and reggiani et al 2014 developed routing schemes similar to todini s approach a common feature of these routing schemes is to solve the nonlinear variable parameter muskingum scheme through an iterative approach to guarantee conservation of mass besides the hydrological routing methods hydraulic routing methods are another key routing method and are based on the mass conservation and simplified momentum conservation equation including the diffusion wave and kinematic wave methods the diffusion wave method is a significant improvement over the kinematic wave method as the water surface slope term is included in the equation to allow the attenuation of flood wave it also allows the specification of a boundary condition at the downstream extremity of the river reach to account for backwater effects therefore the diffusion wave method is generally superior to the kinematic wave method due to its broader applicability in this study the xaj model is coupled with both diffusion wave method and mct approaches referred to as the xaj dch model xin anjiang digital channel model to enhance the channel flow routing simulation capabilities of the original xaj model the diffusion wave and mct approaches are selected to improve the channel routing of the xaj model for several reasons first they are widely used as the routing component for distributed or semi distributed hydrological models because they are easy to implement and require few river cross section data second both methods have a relatively higher computation efficiency than the other more complicated hydraulic routing methods third the diffusion wave method can be reasonably used in the areas with hydraulically mild slopes jain and singh 2005 as the water surface slope term is included in the equation to account for backwater effects furthermore a physical method for estimating cs based on the river link storage equation was proposed to consider the impact of the underlying surface characteristics of the watershed and the hydraulic characteristics of rivers on the flow routing the flow routing of each sub catchment is modeled by a linear mass conservation for a discrete set of channel links connected in parallel and series a quasi analytical solution for the storage of the last link is obtained in terms of recursion relations the cs value can be estimated using the least square method according to a series of storage of the last link at the adjacent moment the proposed cs estimation method can provide a reasonable range for the cs parameter in ungauged area in addition the spatial variability of cs is further considered because the cs estimation method can calculate the cs value for each sub catchment which can improve the prediction accuracy of the model in summary the objective of this study is to improve the prediction accuracy of the xaj model by developing a new physics based routing framework and a key routing parameter estimation method this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the structure of the xaj and xaj dch models and the derivation of the cs estimation method section 3 introduces the study areas data sources and model calibration and evaluation section 4 presents the results and discussion and section 5 provides a conclusion and perspective on future studies 2 methodology 2 1 xin anjiang model the xin anjiang model developed in the 1970s is a semi distributed conceptual rainfall runoff model the catchment is divided into a set of sub catchments allowing for taking the spatial patterns of forcings and land surface conditions into account at the sub catchment level the main feature of the xin anjiang model is the concept that saturation excess runoff occurs without further loss when the aeration zone reaches its field capacity for each sub catchment runoff is calculated using four major modules evapotranspiration module runoff generation module runoff separation module and runoff routing module fig 1 in the runoff routing module the overland flow directly flows into the river network of each sub catchment due to short negligible concentration time while the interflow and groundwater flow concentrate slowly they first pass through the regulation and storage of the conceptualized linear reservoirs and then converge into the river network total runoff i e the sum of surface flow interflow and groundwater flow of each sub catchment is directly routed to the outlet of each sub catchment through the lag and route method the outflow from each sub catchment is then routed along the main river reaches using the muskingum successive routing scheme to produce the flow at the outlet of the whole catchment more details about the xaj model can be found in zhao 1992 2 2 a new routing framework in this study we developed a new runoff routing scheme based on the routing scheme of the xaj model highlighted in fig 1 in the new runoff routing scheme the lag and route method is utilized for calculating the amount of total runoff including surface flow interflow and groundwater flow of each sub catchment flowing into the main river channel instead of the subcatchment outlet at each time step the grid to grid mct method and diffusion wave method are employed to do the channel routing instead of the original muskingum method channel roughness n instead of muskingum parameters k and x comparing to the original muskingum method the parameters of both mct and diffusion wave methods can be easily determined by the channel geometric characteristics channel roughness and channel gradient which can be derived from the elevation namely the digital elevation model dem and stream order through the improvement for the flow routing the influence of spatial terrain variability on hydrological processes can be further accounted for and the model can predict the discharge at every grid cell of the main river channels further details on the methods are described as follows 2 2 1 sub catchment flow

2 2 2 channel routing in the xaj dch model channel routing is conducted on a grid to grid basis along the main streams fig 2 the main streams are defined as the channel reaches linking the outlets of all sub catchments and the outlet of the whole catchment fig 2 in other words the main stream is composed of the river channels connecting all sub catchments excluding all 1st order channel and the river channels inside the 1st order sub catchment fig 2 channels are assumed to be rectangular and lateral inflow is taken into account the channel surface width is inconstant and assumed to increase towards the catchment outlet the channel width formula of the topkapi model liu and todini 2002 was adopted to calculate the width of river grid cells in the ungauged basins the channel width b i in m

rainfall runoff process is calculated on the sub catchment level it is a key step to couple the runoff routing processes of sub catchments with the grid based channel routing in the model to facilitate the coupling we define the main stream network as the channel reaches linking the outlets of all sub catchments and the outlet of the whole catchment fig 3 only the defined main stream network is involved in the channel routing calculation in other words runoff yielded in all sub catchments located in the upstream source regions such as a b and c in fig 2 is directly routed to their respective sub catchment outlets in a source to sink form using the lag and route method the outflow from these sub catchments serves as inflow for the downstream channel network for these sub catchments located in the middle stream and downstream such as d e f and g in fig 2 they contain one or more channel reaches as a part of the channel network therefore these channel reaches are involved in the channel routing in these cases flow of this sub catchment computed by the lag and route method is then equally distributed along the defined channel network within this sub catchment as lateral inflow for the mct and diffusion wave methods second the coupling also needs to resolve the time scale conversion the rainfall runoff generation calculation in the xaj xaj dch model generally takes one hour as the time step while the diffusion wave method or the mct method is applied to calculate channel flow routing at a time scale of seconds in order to guarantee the numerical stability here we evenly disaggregate the 1 hour runoff simulated by the model into the time step of the river channel routing the outlet grid cell of the whole catchment was numbered as 0 the inflow grid cells are sought from the downstream to the upstream according to the eight directions d8 method o callaghan and mark 1984 the channel network grid cells are numbered as 1 2 and so on until reaching the source of each river branch if two channel grid cells independently flow into the same downstream channel reach the two channel grid cells are assigned the same number grid to grid channel routing is done using a flow direction grid illustrated in fig 3 number 0 represents the outlet of the whole catchment while the red grid cells represent the outlets of sub catchments the inflow discharge is routed from the grid cell with the maximum number to the outlet cell namely grid cell 0 at the junction the discharge routed from upstream tributaries is first summed together and the summed discharge is then routed to the next downstream junction through this way we can obtain the discharge of each channel grid cell at each time step 2 3 derivation of the cs estimation equation in order to address the parameter estimation issue of the predictions in ungauged basins we developed a physically based method to estimate the values of cs from the analytic solutions of the partial differential equations with proper definite solution conditions which describes the dynamic changes of flow routing processes of the river network this method can be easily applied to the ungauged basins the new cs estimation method is described in details as follows here we assume that the river network structure is a binary tree structure and all links in a river network have the same length each link is indexed by a number k which quantifies the total number of upstream links draining into it the index of a river link from the source is 1 fig 3 the network magnitude m denotes the total number of source streams it is well known that k 2 m 1 which is proportional to the total drainage area draining into this link fig 3 a brief description of deducing the dynamic discharge is based on menabde et al 2001 according to the mass conservation the storage variation of river link k can be written as 22 d w k t dt i k t o k t k 1 2 n where t is time w k t is the storage volume of link k m3 i k t is inflow of link k in t time m3 s and o k t is outflow of link k at time t m3 s for the binary tree river network i k t consists of two parts 23 i k t o k 1 t o k 2 t where k 1 and k 2 are two upstream links of k o k 1 t and o k 2 t m3 s are the outflow of k 1 and k 2 respectively assuming that the channel is a rectangular channel the outflow of k is 24 o k t b d v the channel storage volume is 25 w k t d b l where b is the mean river width m d is the mean link depth m v is the mean link velocity m s and l is the mean link length m the above definitions produce a relationship between discharge and storage 26 o k t v l w k t the mean link length l is approximately assumed as a constant over the entire network moreover v is assumed as a constant velocity parameter this assumption makes eq 26 equivalent to the well known linear reservoir equation proposed by nash nash 1957 the assumption of an instantaneously applied rainfall is equivalent to the assumption that all links initially received the same water storage w 0 which becomes an initial condition for the dynamics equation the eqs 23 and 26 are substituted for eq 22 to obtain 27 d w k t d t v l w k 1 t v l w k 2 t v l w k t to solve the above equation a dimensionless time t v t l is introduced converting w k t w k 1 t and w k 2 t into f k t f k 1 t and f k 2 t respectively eq 27 can be converted to 28 d f k t d t v l f k 1 t v l f k 2 t v l f k t eq 28 can be further reduced to 29 d f k t d t f k 1 t f k 2 t f k t the storage equation of k is 30 f k t e t w 0 0 t e τ f k 1 τ f k 2 τ d τ for the link numbered as 1 f k 1 τ and f k 2 τ are both 0 its storage equation of river link is 31 f 1 t w 0 e t if hour h is taken as the unit of time the expression of t can be written as 32 t 3 6 v l t the above equations can be further used to derive the cs parameter through the least square method according to rodríguez iturbe et al 1982 the eagleson bras formula can be used for estimating velocity in the ungauged basins the formula has a certain hydraulic basis and considers the impacts of natural geographical factors and rainfall making it more appropriate than many other empirical formulas 33 v 0 665 α 0 6 i r a tot 0 4 34 α s 0 1 2 n b 2 3 where i r is mean rainfall intensity cm h a tot is the total drainage area of a catchment km2 b is mean link width m s 0 is mean link slope and n is the manning roughness based on many trial and error attempts manning roughness can all be set to 0 025 since it has little impact on the final results according to the formula of the lag and route method we can regard cs as the regression coefficient of a univariate regression equation in which f t is the independent variable and f t δ t is the dependent variable if only a set of f t f t δ t are used to determine the river network recession constant cs the estimation error of parameters will be caused to minimize this effect cs is calculated using the least square method by n sets of

catchment is located in the southern mountainous region of huangshan city anhui province china and has a typical humid subtropical climate it has a drainage area of 2692 km2 the terrain is high in the south and low in the north with elevation ranging between 115 and 1614 m fig 4 it has a monsoon dominant climate with more than 60 of annual rainfall concentrated in the flood season may to august the long term annual average rainfall from 1982 to 2005 is 1600 mm yr 1 river discharge varies seasonally and inter annually floods in the tunxi catchment are characterized by high peak flow and short duration besides the hydrological station at the outlet of tunxi catchment there are two interior hydrological stations named chengcun and yuetan nine rain gauge stations including wucheng shimen zuolong dalian shangxikou rucun yixian yanqian and xiuning fig 4 dem data with a 90 m 90 m resolution were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud of the computer network information center chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn while the original source of the dem data is the nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm 1 arc second global dem dataset https earthexplorer usgs gov the dem data were mainly used for determining flow direction river network and watershed delineation 3 2 model calibration and evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the xaj dch model the performances of the original xaj model and the xaj dch model were first evaluated and compared at hourly time scale we selected 32 flood events from 1981 to 2005 for simulation and comparison when selecting flood events it is necessary to ensure the representativeness of large medium and small flood events and cover the flood events with as many various peak shapes and durations as possible the first 19 floods are used for calibration and the rest is used for verification the shuffled complex evolution sce ua global optimization algorithm duan et al 1992 was adopted for the calibration of the model parameters since the mct and diffusion wave methods are based on grid cells both methods can not only predict hydrologic processes at the outlet but also at any channel grid cell two internal locations chengcun and yuetan in the tunxi catchment were modeled as ungauged therefore their measured streamflow data are used to test the model s abilities to simulate rainfall runoff responses at the ungauged areas it should be noted that the observed streamflow data at the interior locations were not used for the calibration and validation at all we chose 11 flood events in chengcun and yuetan for model validation to verify the effectiveness of the cs estimation method we calculated the cs value of each sub catchment using the proposed cs estimation method all simulations using the estimated cs values are compared with the simulations with the calibrated cs values while holding the other parameters as the same calibrated ones since cs is determined as each channel reach the calculated cs value can reflect the regulation and storage capacity of the river network in each sub catchment in the xaj model the regulation and storage capacity of sub catchment is completely computed by the lag and route method so that the calculated cs value can be used directly in the xaj model in contrast both the lag and route method and channel routing method jointly contribute to the storage capacity in sub catchments in the xaj dch model so the cs values in the xaj dch model need be assigned lower values than the calculated cs values for example there are no channels within the source sub catchments zuolong dalian shimen yixian and rucun involving the channel routing only lag and route method therefore is applied in these sub catchments for flow routing as a result we directly adopted the calculated cs values in these sub catchments for the remaining six sub catchments i e chengcun shangxikou wucheng tunxi xiuning and yanqian lag and route method and channel routing method jointly contribute to flow routing therefore the cs values were slightly reduced relative to the calculated cs values in these sub catchments in accordance with the accuracy standard established by ministry of water resources china mwr 2008 four metrics were chosen as evaluation criteria including relative runoff volume error rre relative peak discharge error rpe peak time error

error if the absolute value of rre is less than 20 if the absolute value of rpe is less than 20 this simulation is regarded as a qualified simulation with regard to peak discharge error similarly if the absolute value of peak time error is within 3 h this simulation is regarded as a qualified simulation with regard to peak time error if the nse is greater than 0 7 this simulation is regarded as a qualified simulation with regard to goodness of fit yao et al 2012 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of the xaj and xaj dch performance the calibrated model parameters were listed in table 1 it is not surprise that both the xaj and xaj dch models have the same runoff generation parameter values because the two models shares the same runoff generation modules however the routing parameter cs value of the xaj dch model was 0 87 while the cs value of the xaj model was 0 90 it is clear that the calibrated cs value in the xaj model is larger than that in the xaj dch model this is because cs represents the regulation and storage capacity of the whole river network in the xaj model while cs represents the regulation and storage capacity of the remaining river network in each sub catchment excluding the main channels used for channel routing in the xaj dch model higher cs means stronger regulation and storage capacity therefore the calibrated cs value in xaj model is larger than that in xaj dch model fig 5 shows the distributions of the rre rpe pte and nse statistics for the simulations of all flood events both calibration and validation using the xaj model and xaj dch model the top and bottom lines of these box plots represent the maximum and minimum values respectively while the top middle and bottom of the box represent the 75th 50th and 25th percentiles respectively the accuracy statistics of model performance are summarized in table 3 which shows the percentages of qualified simulations with respect to rre rpe pte and nse for all flood events at the catchment outlet the qualified ratios relative to rre rpe and pte for all calibration and validation events using the muskingum method of xaj model were 93 8 84 3 and 87 5 respectively with a mean nse of 0 94 the qualified ratios relative to rre rpe and pte using the mct method of xaj dch model were 96 9 93 8 and 81 3 respectively with a mean nse of 0 94 the qualified ratios relative to rre rpe and pte using the diffusion wave method of xaj dch were 96 9 90 6 and 87 5 respectively with a mean nse of 0 93 these results suggest the performance of the xaj and xaj dch models are comparable and satisfactory although xaj dch has overall smaller runoff and peak errors table 3 shows that the absolute mean value of pte using muskingum method of the xaj model was 1 3 h while that using the mct and diffusion wave methods of xaj dch model were 1 9 h and 1 9 h respectively this result suggests that the xaj dch model has a slightly higher peak time error than the xaj model fig 5c although the simulation results of the mct and diffusion wave methods of the xaj dch model are similar the mct method is more efficient than the diffusion wave method the mct method just needs a time step of 200 s to ensure the numerical stability while the diffusion wave method requires a time step of 3 s at the interior station chengcun the average nse values using the mct and diffusion wave methods were 0 88 and 0 89 respectively that reached the second level standard values falling between 0 7 and 0 9 the average nse values for the interior location yuetan using the mct and diffusion wave methods were 0 92 and 0 91 respectively that reached the first level standard i e the nse value is greater than 0 9 it suggests the xaj dch model is able to produce promising simulations for the nested points without recalibration although errors are typically greater than the errors for the parent tunxi watershed 4 2 effectiveness of the physics based cs estimation on flood simulations in order to test the applicability of the cs estimation method and test whether improving the spatial distribution of cs can improve the simulation accuracy of xaj model and xaj dch model cs value of each sub catchment was calculated the channel width formula eq 5 was applied to calculate the width of river cross sections and then the mean river width of every sub catchment is calculated the mean river slopes are computed as the average slopes of the longest flow path traced from dem at different locations over the tunxi catchment the estimated cs value of each catchment for two models was listed in table 2 fig 6 illustrates the fitted relationships of the estimated cs values with sub catchment area mean river slope and mean river width it shows that the cs values tend to increase with drainage area number of river chains and river width in contrast the cs values tend to decrease with the increase of river slope these results conform to the physical principle of flow routing since the cs value has a positive correlation with the storage capacity of the basin larger cs value represents a stronger retention capacity a sub catchment with a larger drainage area or more links means the path of water droplets to the outlet of the basin is longer i e a stronger retention capacity wider river channel also contributes to storage capacity in addition the values of cs commonly tend to decrease from downstream to upstream areas due to the influence of increasing slope on flow velocity these results implied that the proposed cs estimation method is consistent with the physical rules of channel routing figs 5 and 7 show the distributions of rre rpe pte and nse statistics for all flood event simulations using the calibrated and estimated cs values in both models respectively selected events from hourly streamflow simulations for the catchment outlet and nested stations are shown in fig 8 the accuracy statistics of model performance using the calibrated and estimated cs values are summarized in tables 3 and 4 respectively it can be seen from the comparison of tables 3 and 4 and figs 5 and 7 that the simulations using the estimated cs values generally perform better than the simulations using the calibrated cs values for both models comparing with these simulations using the calibrated cs values in both models simulations using the estimated cs values show a slightly improvement on the simulations of peak discharge peak time and nse the ranges of absolute mean rpe were narrowed from 8 4 14 to 7 2 11 5 the ranges of absolute mean pte were narrowed from 1 2 h 2 3 h to 0 6 h 2 3 h the average nse for these simulations using calibrated cs values ranged from 0 88 to 0 94 while the average nse for these simulations using the estimated cs values ranged from 0 91 to 0 95 these results underscore that the simulation accuracy of both models can be improved by accounting for the spatial variation of cs values furthermore fig 8 also demonstrates estimated cs values in both models can reasonably simulate the observed flow hydrographs moreover the flow hydrographs by the model using the estimated cs values are more consistent with the observed hydrographs than those using calibrated cs values consequently all these results indicate the cs estimation method is effective 4 3 discussion according to the simulation results of the xaj and xaj dch models at the outlet one can see that the peak time error of the xaj dch model is slightly higher than that of xaj model there are two possible causes for it the first reason is likely that the lateral inflow of each subcatchment is evenly routed to each channel grid cell in the xaj dch model without considering the non uniform routing of the lateral inflow into the river channel second the calculation of wave velocity and cross section velocity may be not accurate enough which can lead to an increase in peak time error through the comparison of the simulation results at the internal stations and the outlet we can find that the nses at the internal stations yuetan and chengcun have reached over 0 8 but these values are not as high as those at the outlet that are greater than 0 9 this is because the model parameters were calibrated on the observed flow at outlet one can also note that the mean nse value of yuetan is larger than that of chengcun see fig 5 and table 3 implying that the goodness of fit of the flood hydrograph at yuetan is better than that at chengcun a possible cause is that the spatial variation of rainfall and the underlying surface conditions are not less well considered at chengcun for example the spatial variation of rainfall may not have been accurately captured because the density of rain gauges is low the geometry of the channel is assumed to be rectangular and the width of the river is calculated according to the formula of the width of the river which may not be consistent with the actual situation in addition yuetan is located in the downstream while chengcun is located in the upstream therefore the discharge and runoff volume at yuetan are larger than that at chengcun if the absolute errors at the two stations are the same the relative error at yuetan which has a higher runoff volume and discharge will be larger overall comparing with the original xaj model the xaj dch model has several advantages first the mct method and the diffusion wave method account for the spatial variability of river channel characteristics such as river width riverbed slope channel roughness and initial water depth these corresponding channel parameters can be adjusted without recalibrating the model if the geometric characteristics or hydraulic properties of a sub reach are changed second the xaj dch model computes discharge on a grid to grid basis without recalibration which makes it more flexible to couple with other hydrological modules such as reservoir third the diffusion wave method can be reasonably used in hydraulically mild slope as the water surface slope term is included in the equation to account for backwater effects in addition when applying the estimated cs values to the xaj model and xaj dch model we verify the effectiveness of this method our results have clearly demonstrated that considering the spatial variability of the model parameters such as cs to a certain extent can lead to improved model simulation accuracy fig 8 unlike the previous studies that applied empirical or statistical methods to estimate the cs hu et al 2017 xu et al 2008 this new cs estimation method developed in this study is based on the formula derived from the water balance of links which has a relatively strong physical basis and can be applied to any watershed however one must also notice that the estimated cs value need be fine tuned when it is used in different sub watersheds 5 conclusion and perspective this study proposed a new model named xaj dch model by coupling the xaj model with the mct method and diffusion wave method the performance of the xaj dch model has been verified successfully at tunxi catchment in comparison to the traditional xaj model compared with the xaj model the xaj dch model can not only easily estimate the channel parameters according to the topographic geomorphic and hydraulic characteristics of a channel but also predict the discharges of the internal stations without recalibration in addition this study also proposed an estimation method for the key routing parameter cs based on the river link storage equations by adopting this method the cs values can be obtained in the ungauged basins and make it easier to apply the xaj and xaj dch models in ungauged basins in summary the new routing framework and cs estimation approach have the potential to produce substantially improved flood predictions in small and medium sized river basins further work should be conducted to refine the modeling approach and facilitate its operational implementation first although the mct and diffusion wave methods have an advantage of ensuring accuracy and mass conservation their numerical robustness is still an issue sharp gradients in the inflow may lead to unphysical oscillations in the solution and negative flows especially in the rising limb of a hydrograph in our study we can only prevent the oscillation and overshoot by shortening the time step of channel calculation the stability of river routing methods need be further studied and improved second the mct and diffusion wave methods cannot only simulate the discharge but also calculate the water level of each reach however due to the generalization of the geometric and hydraulic characteristics of the river the simulated water level is not very accurate further work need be done to resolve this issue declaration of competing

4126,the well known conceptual xin anjiang model xaj has limited capability for application in the basins with limited data due to two major runoff routing problems relying on the observed flow data to estimate the parameters of the muskingum method and lack of physics based representation of spatial heterogeneity in key routing parameters such as the river network recession constant cs to tackle these issues this study first developed a new hybrid rainfall runoff model named the xin anjiang digital channel xaj dch model by coupling the xaj model with the muskingum cunge todini mct and diffusion wave methods to improve the river network routing then a physics based cs estimation method was developed to conquer the data limitation by deriving the quantitative relationships of the cs parameter with basin characteristics such as sub catchment area average river slope average rainfall intensity and average river width based on the mass conservation the flood prediction capabilities of the xaj and xaj dch models were further tested and compared in the tunxi catchment with two nested sub catchments the results show that the xaj dch model can predict stream flows well at both catchment outlet and internal channel grid cells without recalibration moreover the derived cs values based on the proposed method enable both xaj and xaj dch models to gain good results with the averaged nash sutcliffe efficiency ranging between 0 91 and 0 95 keywords xin anjiang model river network recession constant channel routing diffusion wave muskingum cunge todini prediction in ungauged basin 1 introduction there are many small and medium sized rivers in china which suffer frequent floods and are the main contributor of natural hazard related casualties in china flood forecasting in these small and medium sized river basins are generally challenging due to the nature of floods in these basins characterized by heavy and rapid rainstorms fast flow concentration impacts of manmade small dams and reservoirs and lack of hydrometeorological data due to sparse rainfall stations among others fan et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 2021 in order to reduce the impact of floods operational flood forecasting systems have been developed around the world the growing necessity of these operational systems enhances the development of catchment hydrological models huo et al 2020 liu et al 2020 hydrological models are mainly divided into the distributed models and conceptual models distributed models have the advantages of accounting for the impacts of land surface and climate changes on the hydrologic system and providing flow simulation at interior locations of a watershed which makes hydrological predictions possible in ungauged or scarcely gauged watersheds and advances operational flood forecasting chao et al 2021 ciarapica and todini 2002 koren et al 2004 yao et al 2021 however a majority of distributed hydrological models are physically based as they are defined in light of mass and momentum conservation equations these models commonly require a large amount of high resolution input data making the parameterization and computation procedures very complicated and cumbersome in spite of great efforts the application results of the physically based models are usually unsatisfactory al areeq et al 2021 el hassan et al 2013 newman et al 2017 reed et al 2004 seyfried and wilcox 1995 yao et al 2012 because of the simplicity and effectiveness of conceptual models hydrologists are widely interested in the conceptually based distributed models to overcome the shortcomings of physically based models bell et al 2009 carpenter and georgakakos 2004 koren et al 2004 robinson and sivapalan 1995 yao et al 2012 in particular these conceptually based distributed models that combine the features of conceptual rainfall runoff models and physically distributed routing models have the potential to improve the simulation accuracy and spatiotemporal resolutions of practical river and stream forecasts the xin anjiang model xaj is a popular conceptual hydrological model which has been widely used in rainfall runoff simulation and prediction for humid and semi humid areas of china chao et al 2019 todini 2006 zhao 1992 zhao 1994 it has already been deployed in the china national flood forecasting system wmo 2011 however less attention has been paid on studying the flow routing of the xaj model there are two main problems in the flow routing module that are not well addressed and limit the xaj model prediction accuracy first channel routing parameters in the xaj model are set to be homogeneous in all sub reaches without considering the spatial heterogeneity of channel characteristics the outflow of each sub catchment is routed using the linear muskingum method to produce outflow of the whole catchment to compensate the impact of spatial heterogeneity the two parameters of the muskingum method are needed to be calibrated in the xaj model rui and zhang 2014 in addition since streamflow is routed using the muskingum method from each individual tributary to the outlet of a catchment in xaj model a linear summation of routed flows is made at the outlet on the supposition that flood waves from different tributaries propagate independently therefore the xaj model cannot predict the discharge at the interior points as a lumped model with the construction of manmade small dams and reservoirs in china the natural hydraulic characteristics of river channels have been changed the parameters and structure of the muskingum method are difficult to account for the human induced hydrological processes in the real world the second disadvantage is that the sensitive parameters must be calibrated based on historical streamflow data using either a trial and error approach or an automatic optimization algorithm even though some insensitive parameters of the xaj model can be preset or estimated based on past implementation experiences huang et al 2019 lü et al 2013 this makes the model difficult to achieve good results in the ungauged catchments according to the finding of yao et al 2014 solely transposing routing parameters of the xaj model from a downstream donor basin to an upstream recipient basin can cause higher uncertainty than solely transposing runoff generation parameters this is largely because the routing parameters are closely related to the geomorphologic characteristics of catchment which have higher spatial variability the river network recession constant cs of the xaj model represents the retention capacity of a sub catchment river network and quantifies the flood peak attenuation in the lag and route method zhao 1992 zhao 1994 it has been widely recognized that the simulated flood events by the xaj model are extremely sensitive to this parameter generally the value of cs ranges from 0 to 1 and has a higher value for a larger catchment in addition the value of cs generally tends to decrease from downstream to upstream areas since increasing slope has influence on flow velocity therefore it is difficult to calibrate or transpose the cs value directly for the data limited regions although many studies have applied to estimate the values of this parameter they still have some limitations for example zhao 1991 deduced the equation of cs with respect to the change of the reference river length reflecting the impacts of channel water storage and flow velocity according to the assumption of a linear reservoir but the method still relies on the observed hydrological data later some studies used the empirical or statistical methods to quantify the relationship between cs and geomorphologic characteristics hu et al 2017 xu et al 2008 but the established statistical relationship between cs and geomorphologic characteristics from one catchment is only applicable for the catchments with hydrological properties similar to this catchment it is difficult to widely apply these methods to any catchment especially these ungauged catchments therefore it is necessary to develop a physically based estimation method to accurately derive the cs value and account for its spatial variability to address the above mentioned issues in the xaj model it is necessary to use more physics based methods instead of the muskingum method to conduct channel routing as a typical hydrological routhing method the muskingum method was extended to a modified method known as the muskingum cunge method mc which considers time varying parameters cunge 1969 but the mc method does not warrant conservation of mass which can lead to a water imbalance of 8 to 10 ponce and changanti 1994 ponce and yevjevich 1978 tang et al 1999 therefore todini 2007 further developed the mc method to formulate the muskingum cunge todini approach mct to preserve the mass balance without changing water storage term other studies such as perumal and price 2013 and reggiani et al 2014 developed routing schemes similar to todini s approach a common feature of these routing schemes is to solve the nonlinear variable parameter muskingum scheme through an iterative approach to guarantee conservation of mass besides the hydrological routing methods hydraulic routing methods are another key routing method and are based on the mass conservation and simplified momentum conservation equation including the diffusion wave and kinematic wave methods the diffusion wave method is a significant improvement over the kinematic wave method as the water surface slope term is included in the equation to allow the attenuation of flood wave it also allows the specification of a boundary condition at the downstream extremity of the river reach to account for backwater effects therefore the diffusion wave method is generally superior to the kinematic wave method due to its broader applicability in this study the xaj model is coupled with both diffusion wave method and mct approaches referred to as the xaj dch model xin anjiang digital channel model to enhance the channel flow routing simulation capabilities of the original xaj model the diffusion wave and mct approaches are selected to improve the channel routing of the xaj model for several reasons first they are widely used as the routing component for distributed or semi distributed hydrological models because they are easy to implement and require few river cross section data second both methods have a relatively higher computation efficiency than the other more complicated hydraulic routing methods third the diffusion wave method can be reasonably used in the areas with hydraulically mild slopes jain and singh 2005 as the water surface slope term is included in the equation to account for backwater effects furthermore a physical method for estimating cs based on the river link storage equation was proposed to consider the impact of the underlying surface characteristics of the watershed and the hydraulic characteristics of rivers on the flow routing the flow routing of each sub catchment is modeled by a linear mass conservation for a discrete set of channel links connected in parallel and series a quasi analytical solution for the storage of the last link is obtained in terms of recursion relations the cs value can be estimated using the least square method according to a series of storage of the last link at the adjacent moment the proposed cs estimation method can provide a reasonable range for the cs parameter in ungauged area in addition the spatial variability of cs is further considered because the cs estimation method can calculate the cs value for each sub catchment which can improve the prediction accuracy of the model in summary the objective of this study is to improve the prediction accuracy of the xaj model by developing a new physics based routing framework and a key routing parameter estimation method this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the structure of the xaj and xaj dch models and the derivation of the cs estimation method section 3 introduces the study areas data sources and model calibration and evaluation section 4 presents the results and discussion and section 5 provides a conclusion and perspective on future studies 2 methodology 2 1 xin anjiang model the xin anjiang model developed in the 1970s is a semi distributed conceptual rainfall runoff model the catchment is divided into a set of sub catchments allowing for taking the spatial patterns of forcings and land surface conditions into account at the sub catchment level the main feature of the xin anjiang model is the concept that saturation excess runoff occurs without further loss when the aeration zone reaches its field capacity for each sub catchment runoff is calculated using four major modules evapotranspiration module runoff generation module runoff separation module and runoff routing module fig 1 in the runoff routing module the overland flow directly flows into the river network of each sub catchment due to short negligible concentration time while the interflow and groundwater flow concentrate slowly they first pass through the regulation and storage of the conceptualized linear reservoirs and then converge into the river network total runoff i e the sum of surface flow interflow and groundwater flow of each sub catchment is directly routed to the outlet of each sub catchment through the lag and route method the outflow from each sub catchment is then routed along the main river reaches using the muskingum successive routing scheme to produce the flow at the outlet of the whole catchment more details about the xaj model can be found in zhao 1992 2 2 a new routing framework in this study we developed a new runoff routing scheme based on the routing scheme of the xaj model highlighted in fig 1 in the new runoff routing scheme the lag and route method is utilized for calculating the amount of total runoff including surface flow interflow and groundwater flow of each sub catchment flowing into the main river channel instead of the subcatchment outlet at each time step the grid to grid mct method and diffusion wave method are employed to do the channel routing instead of the original muskingum method channel roughness n instead of muskingum parameters k and x comparing to the original muskingum method the parameters of both mct and diffusion wave methods can be easily determined by the channel geometric characteristics channel roughness and channel gradient which can be derived from the elevation namely the digital elevation model dem and stream order through the improvement for the flow routing the influence of spatial terrain variability on hydrological processes can be further accounted for and the model can predict the discharge at every grid cell of the main river channels further details on the methods are described as follows 2 2 1 sub catchment flow

2 2 2 channel routing in the xaj dch model channel routing is conducted on a grid to grid basis along the main streams fig 2 the main streams are defined as the channel reaches linking the outlets of all sub catchments and the outlet of the whole catchment fig 2 in other words the main stream is composed of the river channels connecting all sub catchments excluding all 1st order channel and the river channels inside the 1st order sub catchment fig 2 channels are assumed to be rectangular and lateral inflow is taken into account the channel surface width is inconstant and assumed to increase towards the catchment outlet the channel width formula of the topkapi model liu and todini 2002 was adopted to calculate the width of river grid cells in the ungauged basins the channel width b i in m at channel grid cell i is taken to increase as a function of the drainage area of grid cell i on the basis of geomorphological considerations liu and todini 2002 5 b i b max b max b min a tot a min a

grid cells δ x is defined as the distance between the central points of the river channel grid cells which is equal to d orthogonal flow direction or 2 d diagonal flow direction in the new routing

total number of adjacent upstream channel cells 2 2 3 coupling of the sub catchment routing and the channel routing in the xaj dch model channel routing is conducted on a grid to grid basis while rainfall runoff process is calculated on the sub catchment level it is a key step to couple the runoff routing processes of sub catchments with the grid based channel routing in the model to facilitate the coupling we define the main stream network as the channel reaches linking the outlets of all sub catchments and the outlet of the whole catchment fig 3 only the defined main stream network is involved in the channel routing calculation in other words runoff yielded in all sub catchments located in the upstream source regions such as a b and c in fig 2 is directly routed to their respective sub catchment outlets in a source to sink form using the lag and route method the outflow from these sub catchments serves as inflow for the downstream channel network for these sub catchments located in the middle stream and downstream such as d e f and g in fig 2 they contain one or more channel reaches as a part of the channel network therefore these channel reaches are involved in the channel routing in these cases flow of this sub catchment computed by the lag and route method is then equally distributed along the defined channel network within this sub catchment as lateral inflow for the mct and diffusion wave methods second the coupling also needs to resolve the time scale conversion the rainfall runoff generation calculation in the xaj xaj dch model generally takes one hour as the time step while the diffusion wave method or the mct method is applied to calculate channel flow routing at a time scale of seconds in order to guarantee the numerical stability here we evenly disaggregate the 1 hour runoff simulated by the model into the time step of the river channel routing the outlet grid cell of the whole catchment was numbered as 0 the inflow grid cells are sought from the downstream to the upstream according to the eight directions d8 method o callaghan and mark 1984 the channel network grid cells are numbered as 1 2 and so on until reaching the source of each river branch if two channel grid cells independently flow into the same downstream channel reach the two channel grid cells are assigned the same number grid to grid channel routing is done using a flow direction grid illustrated in fig 3 number 0 represents the outlet of the whole catchment while the red grid cells represent the outlets of sub catchments the inflow discharge is routed from the grid cell with the maximum number to the outlet cell namely grid cell 0 at the junction the discharge routed from upstream tributaries is first summed together and the summed discharge is then routed to the next downstream junction through this way we can obtain the discharge of each channel grid cell at each time step 2 3 derivation of the cs estimation equation in order to address the parameter estimation issue of the predictions in ungauged basins we developed a physically based method to estimate the values of cs from the analytic solutions of the partial differential equations with proper definite solution conditions which describes the dynamic changes of flow routing processes of the river network this method can be easily applied to the ungauged basins the new cs estimation method is described in details as follows here we assume that the river network structure is a binary tree structure and all links in a river network have the same length each link is indexed by a number k which quantifies the total number of upstream links draining into it the index of a river link from the source is 1 fig 3 the network magnitude m denotes the total number of source streams it is well known that k 2 m 1 which is proportional to the total drainage area draining into this link fig 3 a brief description of deducing the dynamic discharge is based on menabde et al 2001 according to the mass conservation the storage variation of river link k can be written as 22 d w k t dt i k t o k t k 1 2 n where t is time w k t is the storage volume of link k m3 i k t is inflow of link k in t time m3 s and o k t is outflow of link k at time t m3 s for the binary tree river network i k t consists of two parts 23 i k t o k 1 t o k 2 t where k 1 and k 2 are two upstream links of k o k 1 t and o k 2 t m3 s are the outflow of k 1 and k 2 respectively assuming that the channel is a rectangular channel the outflow of k is 24 o k t b d v the channel storage volume is 25 w k t d b l where b is the mean river width m d is the mean link depth m v is the mean link velocity m s and l is the mean link length m the above definitions produce a relationship between discharge and storage 26 o k t v l w k t the mean link length l is approximately assumed as a constant over the entire network moreover v is assumed as a constant velocity parameter this assumption makes eq 26 equivalent to the well known linear reservoir equation proposed by nash nash 1957 the assumption of an instantaneously applied rainfall is equivalent to the assumption that all links initially received the same water storage w 0 which becomes an initial condition for the dynamics equation the eqs 23 and 26 are substituted for eq 22 to obtain 27 d w k t d t v l w k 1 t v l w k 2 t v l w k t to solve the above equation a dimensionless time t v t l is introduced converting w k t w k 1 t and w k 2 t into f k t f k 1 t and f k 2 t respectively eq 27 can be converted to 28 d f k t d t v l f k 1 t v l f k 2 t v l f k t eq 28 can be further reduced to 29 d f k t d t f k 1 t f k 2 t f k t the storage equation of k is 30 f k t e t w 0 0 t e τ f k 1 τ f k 2 τ d τ for the link numbered as 1 f k 1 τ and f k 2 τ are both 0 its storage equation of river link is 31 f 1 t w 0 e t if hour h is taken as the unit of time the expression of t can be written as 32 t 3 6 v l t the above equations can be further used to derive the cs parameter through the least square method according to rodríguez iturbe et al 1982 the eagleson bras formula can be used for estimating velocity in the ungauged basins the formula has a certain hydraulic basis and considers the impacts of natural geographical factors and rainfall making it more appropriate than many other empirical formulas 33 v 0 665 α 0 6 i r a tot 0 4 34 α s 0 1 2 n b 2 3 where i r is mean rainfall intensity cm h a tot is the total drainage area of a catchment km2 b is mean link width m s 0 is mean link slope and n is the manning roughness based on many trial and error attempts manning roughness can all be set to 0 025 since it has little impact on the final results according to the formula of the lag and route method we can regard cs as the regression coefficient of a univariate regression equation in which f t is the independent variable and f t δ t is the dependent variable if only a set of f t f t δ t are used to determine the river network recession constant cs the estimation error of parameters will be caused to minimize this effect cs is calculated using the least square method by n sets of

catchment is located in the southern mountainous region of huangshan city anhui province china and has a typical humid subtropical climate it has a drainage area of 2692 km2 the terrain is high in the south and low in the north with elevation ranging between 115 and 1614 m fig 4 it has a monsoon dominant climate with more than 60 of annual rainfall concentrated in the flood season may to august the long term annual average rainfall from 1982 to 2005 is 1600 mm yr 1 river discharge varies seasonally and inter annually floods in the tunxi catchment are characterized by high peak flow and short duration besides the hydrological station at the outlet of tunxi catchment there are two interior hydrological stations named chengcun and yuetan nine rain gauge stations including wucheng shimen zuolong dalian shangxikou rucun yixian yanqian and xiuning fig 4 dem data with a 90 m 90 m resolution were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud of the computer network information center chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn while the original source of the dem data is the nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm 1 arc second global dem dataset https earthexplorer usgs gov the dem data were mainly used for determining flow direction river network and watershed delineation 3 2 model calibration and evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the xaj dch model the performances of the original xaj model and the xaj dch model were first evaluated and compared at hourly time scale we selected 32 flood events from 1981 to 2005 for simulation and comparison when selecting flood events it is necessary to ensure the representativeness of large medium and small flood events and cover the flood events with as many various peak shapes and durations as possible the first 19 floods are used for calibration and the rest is used for verification the shuffled complex evolution sce ua global optimization algorithm duan et al 1992 was adopted for the calibration of the model parameters since the mct and diffusion wave methods are based on grid cells both methods can not only predict hydrologic processes at the outlet but also at any channel grid cell two internal locations chengcun and yuetan in the tunxi catchment were modeled as ungauged therefore their measured streamflow data are used to test the model s abilities to simulate rainfall runoff responses at the ungauged areas it should be noted that the observed streamflow data at the interior locations were not used for the calibration and validation at all we chose 11 flood events in chengcun and yuetan for model validation to verify the effectiveness of the cs estimation method we calculated the cs value of each sub catchment using the proposed cs estimation method all simulations using the estimated cs values are compared with the simulations with the calibrated cs values while holding the other parameters as the same calibrated ones since cs is determined as each channel reach the calculated cs value can reflect the regulation and storage capacity of the river network in each sub catchment in the xaj model the regulation and storage capacity of sub catchment is completely computed by the lag and route method so that the calculated cs value can be used directly in the xaj model in contrast both the lag and route method and channel routing method jointly contribute to the storage capacity in sub catchments in the xaj dch model so the cs values in the xaj dch model need be assigned lower values than the calculated cs values for example there are no channels within the source sub catchments zuolong dalian shimen yixian and rucun involving the channel routing only lag and route method therefore is applied in these sub catchments for flow routing as a result we directly adopted the calculated cs values in these sub catchments for the remaining six sub catchments i e chengcun shangxikou wucheng tunxi xiuning and yanqian lag and route method and channel routing method jointly contribute to flow routing therefore the cs values were slightly reduced relative to the calculated cs values in these sub catchments in accordance with the accuracy standard established by ministry of water resources china mwr 2008 four metrics were chosen as evaluation criteria including relative runoff volume error rre relative peak discharge error rpe peak time error

the absolute value of peak time error is within 3 h this simulation is regarded as a qualified simulation with regard to peak time error if the nse is greater than 0 7 this simulation is regarded as a qualified simulation with regard to goodness of fit yao et al 2012 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of the xaj and xaj dch performance the calibrated model parameters were listed in table 1 it is not surprise that both the xaj and xaj dch models have the same runoff generation parameter values because the two models shares the same runoff generation modules however the routing parameter cs value of the xaj dch model was 0 87 while the cs value of the xaj model was 0 90 it is clear that the calibrated cs value in the xaj model is larger than that in the xaj dch model this is because cs represents the regulation and storage capacity of the whole river network in the xaj model while cs represents the regulation and storage capacity of the remaining river network in each sub catchment excluding the main channels used for channel routing in the xaj dch model higher cs means stronger regulation and storage capacity therefore the calibrated cs value in xaj model is larger than that in xaj dch model fig 5 shows the distributions of the rre rpe pte and nse statistics for the simulations of all flood events both calibration and validation using the xaj model and xaj dch model the top and bottom lines of these box plots represent the maximum and minimum values respectively while the top middle and bottom of the box represent the 75th 50th and 25th percentiles respectively the accuracy statistics of model performance are summarized in table 3 which shows the percentages of qualified simulations with respect to rre rpe pte and nse for all flood events at the catchment outlet the qualified ratios relative to rre rpe and pte for all calibration and validation events using the muskingum method of xaj model were 93 8 84 3 and 87 5 respectively with a mean nse of 0 94 the qualified ratios relative to rre rpe and pte using the mct method of xaj dch model were 96 9 93 8 and 81 3 respectively with a mean nse of 0 94 the qualified ratios relative to rre rpe and pte using the diffusion wave method of xaj dch were 96 9 90 6 and 87 5 respectively with a mean nse of 0 93 these results suggest the performance of the xaj and xaj dch models are comparable and satisfactory although xaj dch has overall smaller runoff and peak errors table 3 shows that the absolute mean value of pte using muskingum method of the xaj model was 1 3 h while that using the mct and diffusion wave methods of xaj dch model were 1 9 h and 1 9 h respectively this result suggests that the xaj dch model has a slightly higher peak time error than the xaj model fig 5c although the simulation results of the mct and diffusion wave methods of the xaj dch model are similar the mct method is more efficient than the diffusion wave method the mct method just needs a time step of 200 s to ensure the numerical stability while the diffusion wave method requires a time step of 3 s at the interior station chengcun the average nse values using the mct and diffusion wave methods were 0 88 and 0 89 respectively that reached the second level standard values falling between 0 7 and 0 9 the average nse values for the interior location yuetan using the mct and diffusion wave methods were 0 92 and 0 91 respectively that reached the first level standard i e the nse value is greater than 0 9 it suggests the xaj dch model is able to produce promising simulations for the nested points without recalibration although errors are typically greater than the errors for the parent tunxi watershed 4 2 effectiveness of the physics based cs estimation on flood simulations in order to test the applicability of the cs estimation method and test whether improving the spatial distribution of cs can improve the simulation accuracy of xaj model and xaj dch model cs value of each sub catchment was calculated the channel width formula eq 5 was applied to calculate the width of river cross sections and then the mean river width of every sub catchment is calculated the mean river slopes are computed as the average slopes of the longest flow path traced from dem at different locations over the tunxi catchment the estimated cs value of each catchment for two models was listed in table 2 fig 6 illustrates the fitted relationships of the estimated cs values with sub catchment area mean river slope and mean river width it shows that the cs values tend to increase with drainage area number of river chains and river width in contrast the cs values tend to decrease with the increase of river slope these results conform to the physical principle of flow routing since the cs value has a positive correlation with the storage capacity of the basin larger cs value represents a stronger retention capacity a sub catchment with a larger drainage area or more links means the path of water droplets to the outlet of the basin is longer i e a stronger retention capacity wider river channel also contributes to storage capacity in addition the values of cs commonly tend to decrease from downstream to upstream areas due to the influence of increasing slope on flow velocity these results implied that the proposed cs estimation method is consistent with the physical rules of channel routing figs 5 and 7 show the distributions of rre rpe pte and nse statistics for all flood event simulations using the calibrated and estimated cs values in both models respectively selected events from hourly streamflow simulations for the catchment outlet and nested stations are shown in fig 8 the accuracy statistics of model performance using the calibrated and estimated cs values are summarized in tables 3 and 4 respectively it can be seen from the comparison of tables 3 and 4 and figs 5 and 7 that the simulations using the estimated cs values generally perform better than the simulations using the calibrated cs values for both models comparing with these simulations using the calibrated cs values in both models simulations using the estimated cs values show a slightly improvement on the simulations of peak discharge peak time and nse the ranges of absolute mean rpe were narrowed from 8 4 14 to 7 2 11 5 the ranges of absolute mean pte were narrowed from 1 2 h 2 3 h to 0 6 h 2 3 h the average nse for these simulations using calibrated cs values ranged from 0 88 to 0 94 while the average nse for these simulations using the estimated cs values ranged from 0 91 to 0 95 these results underscore that the simulation accuracy of both models can be improved by accounting for the spatial variation of cs values furthermore fig 8 also demonstrates estimated cs values in both models can reasonably simulate the observed flow hydrographs moreover the flow hydrographs by the model using the estimated cs values are more consistent with the observed hydrographs than those using calibrated cs values consequently all these results indicate the cs estimation method is effective 4 3 discussion according to the simulation results of the xaj and xaj dch models at the outlet one can see that the peak time error of the xaj dch model is slightly higher than that of xaj model there are two possible causes for it the first reason is likely that the lateral inflow of each subcatchment is evenly routed to each channel grid cell in the xaj dch model without considering the non uniform routing of the lateral inflow into the river channel second the calculation of wave velocity and cross section velocity may be not accurate enough which can lead to an increase in peak time error through the comparison of the simulation results at the internal stations and the outlet we can find that the nses at the internal stations yuetan and chengcun have reached over 0 8 but these values are not as high as those at the outlet that are greater than 0 9 this is because the model parameters were calibrated on the observed flow at outlet one can also note that the mean nse value of yuetan is larger than that of chengcun see fig 5 and table 3 implying that the goodness of fit of the flood hydrograph at yuetan is better than that at chengcun a possible cause is that the spatial variation of rainfall and the underlying surface conditions are not less well considered at chengcun for example the spatial variation of rainfall may not have been accurately captured because the density of rain gauges is low the geometry of the channel is assumed to be rectangular and the width of the river is calculated according to the formula of the width of the river which may not be consistent with the actual situation in addition yuetan is located in the downstream while chengcun is located in the upstream therefore the discharge and runoff volume at yuetan are larger than that at chengcun if the absolute errors at the two stations are the same the relative error at yuetan which has a higher runoff volume and discharge will be larger overall comparing with the original xaj model the xaj dch model has several advantages first the mct method and the diffusion wave method account for the spatial variability of river channel characteristics such as river width riverbed slope channel roughness and initial water depth these corresponding channel parameters can be adjusted without recalibrating the model if the geometric characteristics or hydraulic properties of a sub reach are changed second the xaj dch model computes discharge on a grid to grid basis without recalibration which makes it more flexible to couple with other hydrological modules such as reservoir third the diffusion wave method can be reasonably used in hydraulically mild slope as the water surface slope term is included in the equation to account for backwater effects in addition when applying the estimated cs values to the xaj model and xaj dch model we verify the effectiveness of this method our results have clearly demonstrated that considering the spatial variability of the model parameters such as cs to a certain extent can lead to improved model simulation accuracy fig 8 unlike the previous studies that applied empirical or statistical methods to estimate the cs hu et al 2017 xu et al 2008 this new cs estimation method developed in this study is based on the formula derived from the water balance of links which has a relatively strong physical basis and can be applied to any watershed however one must also notice that the estimated cs value need be fine tuned when it is used in different sub watersheds 5 conclusion and perspective this study proposed a new model named xaj dch model by coupling the xaj model with the mct method and diffusion wave method the performance of the xaj dch model has been verified successfully at tunxi catchment in comparison to the traditional xaj model compared with the xaj model the xaj dch model can not only easily estimate the channel parameters according to the topographic geomorphic and hydraulic characteristics of a channel but also predict the discharges of the internal stations without recalibration in addition this study also proposed an estimation method for the key routing parameter cs based on the river link storage equations by adopting this method the cs values can be obtained in the ungauged basins and make it easier to apply the xaj and xaj dch models in ungauged basins in summary the new routing framework and cs estimation approach have the potential to produce substantially improved flood predictions in small and medium sized river basins further work should be conducted to refine the modeling approach and facilitate its operational implementation first although the mct and diffusion wave methods have an advantage of ensuring accuracy and mass conservation their numerical robustness is still an issue sharp gradients in the inflow may lead to unphysical oscillations in the solution and negative flows especially in the rising limb of a hydrograph in our study we can only prevent the oscillation and overshoot by shortening the time step of channel calculation the stability of river routing methods need be further studied and improved second the mct and diffusion wave methods cannot only simulate the discharge but also calculate the water level of each reach however due to the generalization of the geometric and hydraulic characteristics of the river the simulated water level is not very accurate further work need be done to resolve this issue declaration of competing

4127,increased attention to precipitation changes in permafrost dominated siberia is promoted by intensified flooding under climate warming the observed daily precipitation spanning 60 years 1959 2018 from 129 meteorological stations across the siberian lowlands with elevations less than 500 m 50 n 70 n 60 e 140 e captures significant changes in both annual and extreme precipitation for 1959 2018 the average annual precipitation over the siberian lowlands was 428 110 mm the average annual precipitation in non permafrost zones was approximately 458 114 mm larger than that in permafrost zones 407 102 mm additionally non permafrost zones experienced greater intensities and frequencies of precipitation extremes than permafrost zones according to four extreme precipitation indices i e r99p r95p r 5d and r10mm however the rate of increase in precipitation and precipitation extremes was greater in permafrost zones than in non permafrost zones these results obtained from in situ observations are generally consistent with era5 precipitation reanalysis data given faster warming in permafrost than in non permafrost zones the rate of increase in precipitation and precipitation extremes in permafrost zones also respond more than those in non permafrost zones in particular summer precipitation in permafrost zones accelerates permafrost degradation and the release of carbon dioxide and methane from permafrost sediments is very likely to have positive feedback effects on regional temperature and precipitation increases our results indicate that siberia will face risks attributable to increased precipitation and precipitation extremes in the context of climate warming and such risks will be greater in the permafrost zones than in the non permafrost zones keywords

permafrost warming has posed serious impacts on the local changes in the topography hydrological conditions infrastructure and vegetation dynamics as well as global impacts on climate streletskiy et al 2015 recent observations confirmed that increased precipitation is likely to accelerate permafrost degradation because precipitation deepens the active layer by enhancing heat transfer zhu et al 2017 according to douglas et al 2020 an additional 1 cm of summer precipitation could lead to an increase in the ground thawing depth of 0 7 0 1 cm in addition a mechanistic ecosystem model demonstrated that the contribution of precipitation to permafrost degradation is comparable to that of the air temperature in a warmer climate mekonnen et al 2021 furthermore the release of soil organic carbon from sediments into the atmosphere as a consequence of permafrost thawing has the potential to amplify the climate change worldwide biskaborn et al 2019 despite recognizing the positive feedback of climate warming in response to permafrost degradation koven et al 2011 we still do not fully understand the roles of permafrost degradation in the total precipitation variation and the intensification of extreme events do precipitation and extreme precipitation increase faster in permafrost zones than in non permafrost zones under a warming climate to address this question we collected daily precipitation data from 129 low elevation 500 m a s l meteorological stations fig 1 across siberia between 50 n and 70 n and obtained era5 reanalysis data from 1959 to 2018 then we divided siberia into permafrost and non permafrost zones in accordance with the circum arctic map of permafrost and ground ice conditions version 2 brown et al 1997 the main objective of this study was to identify the temporal and spatial variability of the amount and extremes of precipitation between permafrost and non permafrost zones across the siberian lowlands to this end we first analysed the differences in the annual precipitation change rates between permafrost and non permafrost zones over the past 60 years section 3 1 then four extreme precipitation indices were selected to quantify the trends in the intensity and frequency of precipitation extremes occurring in those permafrost and non permafrost zones over the past 60 years section 3 2 finally we analysed the temporal changes in precipitation on a seasonal scale and the potential impacts on natural hazards such as flooding and vegetation responses section 3 3 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area siberia is an extensive geographical region in north asia that includes the west siberian plain central siberian plateau and east siberian highlands the research area in this study 50 n 70 n 60 e 140 e covers the three major siberian river basins the ob yenisei and lena basins the total area is approximately 7 98 million km2 this is a typical cold northern hemisphere region with a large areal extent of permafrost that accounts for approximately 69 of the total area the predominant land covers from north to south are tundra forest tundra taiga and forest steppe tchebakova et al 2009 in the context of global warming siberia is experiencing notable changes including significant rises in the surface temperature groisman et al 2013 substantial permafrost degradation with widespread landscape collapse nitzbon et al 2020 shifting vegetation zones tchebakova et al 2009 and increasing precipitation and surface runoff wang et al 2021 details of the study area can be found in wang et al 2021 and tang and tang 2021 2 2 data the climatology data we used for calculating and analysing the spatial and temporal variations in precipitation were taken from an extensive network of metrological stations in siberia daily 2 m air temperature and precipitation data from 129 low elevation 500 m a s l meteorological stations fig 1 during the period of 1959 2018 were obtained from the russian meteorological station database http aisori m meteo ru waisori index xhtml idata 5 bulygina et al 2020 in addition daily precipitation across siberia from the 5th generation reanalysis dataset era5 https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets reanalysis datasets era5 for the period from 1959 to 2018 was used for the analysis in this study for the era5 gridded data analysis we excluded data above 500 m a s l with the help of a digital elevation model dem data produced by the global 30 arc second elevation gtopo30 model from the usgs usgs 1996 2 3 precipitation indices to better quantify the changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation four extreme precipitation indices were selected namely r99p r95p r 5d and r10mm from among the 27 indices defined by the expert team on climate change detection monitoring and indices etccdmi international clivar project office 2001 karl et al 1999 zhang et al 2005 these selected indices are commonly used to assess extreme precipitation and potential flood risks including the risks of flash floods and large scale river flooding kirchmeier young and zhang 2020 the indices r99p and r95p represent the annual total precipitation when the daily precipitation amount rr is larger than the 99th and 95th percentiles for the reference period respectively r 99 p w 1 w rr wj i f rr wj rr ref 99 r 95 p w 1 w rr wj i f rr wj rr ref 95 where rr is the daily precipitation amount the subscript w refers to a wet day j denotes the index of the counting period ref is the reference period and w is the total amount of wet days in the counting period a wet day is defined as rr 1 0 m m in this study the counting period j is one year and the reference period is 1961 1990 the index r 5 day denotes the maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation in the counting period r 5 d a y m a x rr kj where j is the counting period and k is the index of the 5 day interval ending within the counting period r10mm is the total number of days with daily precipitation larger than 10 mm in the counting period a brief summary of the four indices is given in table 1 all of these values were calculated based on the daily precipitation data from 1959 to 2018 for both the station observations and the era5 data 2 4 trend analysis with linear regression and statistical methods based on the permafrost distribution map presented by brown et al 1997 we divided the siberian lowlands into two zones permafrost zones continuous and discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost and non permafrost zones of the 129 meteorological stations 75 are located within permafrost zones while the remaining stations are located in non permafrost zones linear trends in the annually or seasonally averaged time series of the observed and era5 precipitation data were analysed by ordinary least squares linear regression all fitting curves were evaluated using a t test with a significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion in this section we show the mean precipitation as well as the extreme precipitation indices calculated for the in situ observations and the era5 dataset 3 1 increases in annual precipitation table 2 gives an overview of the average annual precipitation for the permafrost and non permafrost zones within siberia for 1959 2018 the average annual precipitation calculated over 129 stations denoted as the global average is 428 mm among these stations the maximum value reaches 886 mm wmo no 36064 and the minimum value is 236 mm wmo no 24959 as shown in supplementary table s1 the average precipitation is 407 mm for the permafrost zones which is 5 lower than the global average for the non permafrost zones the average precipitation is 458 mm which is 7 higher than the global average and 13 higher than that for the permafrost zones the temporal evolution of the average annual precipitation for the permafrost and non permafrost zones is shown in fig 2 b for comparison purposes the temporal evolution of the average annual temperature is also given see fig 2 a over the past 60 years the rate of warming in the permafrost zones has been 0 35 c decade and that in the non permafrost zones has been 0 30 c decade the average annual rate of increase in the temperature has been 16 7 larger for the permafrost zones than for the non permafrost zones correspondingly the average annual precipitation within the permafrost zones has increased 7 17 mm decade approximately 8 1 faster than that in the non permafrost zones 6 63 mm decade clearly siberia has experienced notable warming over the last 60 years along with a significant increase in precipitation this suggests that the increase in precipitation is likely a response to the increase in temperature which is governed by the clausius clapeyron equation parsons et al 2003 the standard deviation std of the average annual precipitation calculated over 75 stations in the permafrost zones is 102 mm which is 12 smaller than the std calculated over 54 stations in the non permafrost zones 114 mm this implies slightly less variability for the permafrost zones than for the non permafrost zones differing from the in situ observations the std values for the era5 data are 168 mm for the permafrost zones and 153 mm for the non permafrost zones it is worth mentioning that these two std values are not comparable to those calculated for the observations from the stations as these stations are not homogeneously distributed within the research area while the era5 dataset comprises grid based data from regular meshes in addtion much more data were used for the calculations in the era5 dataset than for the station observations to further analyse the spatial variation of the average annual precipitation we calculated semi variograms for the permafrost and non permafrost zones for both the observations and the era5 data as shown in fig 3 the sills are 0 08 for the permafrost zones and 0 11 for the non permafrost zones fig 3 a b the permafrost zones have a range of 9 km which is 36 less than that of the non permafrost zones the spatial variability of the average annual precipitation for the permafrost zones seems to be smaller than that for the non permafrost zones in situ precipitation and temperature observations over the past 60 years indicate that significant climate changes are occurring in siberia in particular the rate of temperature warming in siberia 0 30 c decade and 0 35 c decade in the non permafrost and permafrost zones respectively is much greater than the global average post et al 2019 rahmstorf et al 2017 this suggests that siberia is becoming one of the hotspots of global climate change as evidenced by the northward shifts of forests tchebakova et al 2011 warming generally leads to considerable increases in precipitation on a global scale the rate of increase in precipitation is expected to be approximately 2 c in response to climate warming held and soden 2006 in the arctic regions local warming is likely to explain approximately 70 of the increase in precipitation bintanja 2018 our results show that annual precipitation and its spatio temporal variability differ significantly between permafrost and non permafrost zones during the past 60 years the rate of increase in precipitation in the permafrost zones has been much greater than that in the non permafrost zones this may be related to the fact that the warming rate in the permafrost zones is greater than that in the non permafrost zones equally important increased precipitation accelerates the degradation of permafrost douglas et al 2020 which further has a positive feedback to climate warming cheng and wu 2007 our results demonstrated that the annual precipitation and active layer thickness in the permafrost zones exhibited simultaneous increasing trends during the period 1980 2016 fig 4 it can therefore be assumed that under global warming temperature and precipitation will change more rapidly in the permafrost zones than in the non permafrost zones the spatial variability of precipitation will likely increase further as permafrost degradation is accompanied by the rapid expansion of thermokarst lakes in t zandt et al 2020 sannel and kuhry 2011 walter anthony et al 2018 and landscape changes from ice rich tundra to shrubs magnússon et al 2020 nevertheless the temperature precipitation permafrost feedback in permafrost zones is extremely complex and requires further investigation grosse et al 2016 3 2 intensification of precipitation extremes the average and std values of the four extreme precipitation indices for the permafrost and non permafrost zones are given in table 2 in general for all four indices the values for the permafrost zones are smaller than those for the non permafrost zones this result is consistent with that for the average annual precipitation fig 5 shows the temporal evolution of four extreme precipitation indices for the permafrost and non permafrost zones these indices are calculated from the station observations for 1959 2018 in general for both the permafrost and the non permafrost zones precipitation extremes are becoming more intense and more frequent the average annual rate of increase in r99p is 1 09 mm decade for the permafrost zones which is almost twice as large as that for the non permafrost zones 0 58 mm decade for r95p the difference between these two zones is even larger the permafrost zones have an average annual rate of increase of 2 82 mm decade which is 129 3 larger than that of the non permafrost zones 1 23 mm decade for r10mm the value for the permafrost zones increases 26 7 faster than that for the non permafrost zones r 5d shows similar performance for these two zones with a slightly larger 7 9 rate of increase for the permafrost zones the temporal evolution characteristics of the extreme precipitation indices calculated from the era5 data for the permafrost and non permafrost zones for 1959 2018 are shown in fig 6 all four indices indicate that extreme precipitation events are becoming more intense and frequent in both permafrost and non permafrost zones which is consistent with the results obtained from the in situ observations however there are some discrepancies between the rates of increase in the extreme precipitation indices obtained from the in situ observations and era5 data in both the permafrost and the non permafrost zones as shown in fig 6 a the annual rate of increase in r99p is only 37 4 larger for the permafrost zones than for the non permafrost zones this value is much smaller than the difference in the rate of increase calculated for the observation data for r95p the permafrost zones exhibit a rate of increase of 2 02 mm decade which is 135 larger than that of the non permafrost zones this result is generally consistent with the results calculated for the station observations the annual rate of increase in r10mm is 0 09 day decade for the permafrost zones which is only half of that calculated from the station observations however this value is still four times larger than the rate for the non permafrost zones differing from the above three indices the rate of increase in r 5d for the permafrost zones 0 10 mm decade is less than that for the non permafrost zones 0 15 mm decade the selected four indices demonstrate that precipitation extremes have intensified across siberia over the past 60 years these results are consistent with previous in situ station observations e g sun et al 2021 and climate model simulations suggesting an overall intensification of precipitation extremes as a result of climate warming asadieh and krakauer 2015 o gorman 2015 the effect of climate warming on extreme precipitation is expected to approach the clausius clapeyron relationship at a rate of 7 c pall et al 2007 in the eastern siberia an increase in both average and extreme precipitation can reach a thermodynamically constrained 8 c during the autumn chen and wang 2021 further myhre et al 2019 projected that the most intense precipitation events observed today could double in intensity for each degree of further climate warming for the rapidly warming region of siberia such extreme precipitation events will most likely be further enhanced additionally observations over the past 60 years demonstrate that extreme precipitation events have increased at a higher rate in permafrost zones than in non permafrost zones this implies that permafrost zones are more sensitive to climate warming than non permafrost zones 3 3 consequences of precipitation changes on a seasonal scale the precipitation observations show an increasing trend over the past 60 years for all four seasons in both the permafrost and the non permafrost zones see fig 7 the increase in precipitation is significantly larger in spring than in the other three seasons with rates of increase in the permafrost and non permafrost zones of 2 4 mm decade and 4 4 mm decade respectively the rates of increase in precipitation are lower in autumn than in spring with rates of 1 5 mm decade and 3 6 mm decade in permafrost and non permafrost zones respectively winter precipitation also shows an increasing trend but the rate of increase is larger in permafrost zones 0 4 mm decade than in non permafrost zones 0 3 mm decade in contrast precipitation in summer varies smoothly with rates of increase of 1 8 mm decade and 1 5 mm decade in the permafrost and non permafrost zones respectively siberia is characterized by a high flood risk with large floods i e causing significant damage to structures and agriculture having occurred in 7 out of 10 years during 2007 2016 kichigina 2020 according to statistics from 1985 to 2016 rainfall floods 53 and snowmelt floods that overlapped with rainfall 28 are the most common floods in siberia kichigina 2020 as seen from table 2 the average annual precipitation in the permafrost and non permafrost zones increased by 5 0 and 5 6 respectively from 1959 1988 to 1989 2018 the extreme precipitation r99p and r95p indices in permafrost and non permafrost zones has also increased by 7 8 in the last 30 years 1989 2018 compared to the previous 30 years 1959 1988 a comparative analysis of seasonal precipitation over the preceding and following 30 years shows that the rapid increase in spring and autumn precipitation table 3 is probably the main cause of the high frequency of flooding in siberia in recent years recent observations in the middle lena river of eastern siberia provided evidence that early floods are occurring more frequently in spring with secondary floods in summer and such changes have been reinforced since 2004 2005 gautier et al 2018 this suggests that against the background of future warming the siberian region will be at greater risk of extreme precipitation and flooding especially in spring and autumn with climate change the seasonal distribution of precipitation patterns will change portmann et al 2009 as will precipitation extremes which will affect vegetation growth conditions thus vegetation dynamics may respond to these changes and in turn affect ecosystem services gessner et al 2013 sohoulande djebou et al 2015 recently precipitation vegetation interactions have become increasingly important chen et al 2020 triggered by precipitation vegetation affects the water and energy cycles ellison et al 2017 vegetation not only depends on precipitation but also plays a critical role in generating precipitation acting as a driving force for climate regulation on the one hand precipitation provides plentiful water for vegetation to grow and it will be essential for vegetation to counteract global warming zhang et al 2020 on the other hand vegetation accelerates the hydrologic process of ecosystems through canopy interception and evaporation uddin et al 2016 wu et al 2019 therefore understanding the effects of precipitation especially extreme precipitation on vegetation is essential for realistic projections of changes in the water cycle under climate change 4 conclusions in this study we analysed daily precipitation data from 129 meteorological stations and the era5 reanalysis dataset at elevations below 500 m in siberia 50 n 70 n 60 e 140 e the results shown in this study clearly demonstrate that siberia as a global hotspot has experienced a notable increasing trend in mean and extreme precipitation over the past 60 years the increases in mean and extreme precipitation are believed to be responses to global warming bintanja 2018 held and soden 2006 pall et al 2007 in general the average annual multi year precipitation is smaller in the permafrost zones than in the non permafrost zones and the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation is lower in permafrost zones than in non permafrost zones this suggests that not only the mean and extreme precipitation but also the spatial variability of precipitation increases in response to warming pendergrass et al 2017 as noted by donat et al 2013 changes in precipitation and precipitation extremes appear to be more spatially heterogeneous than the consistent warming pattern in contrast to those in non permafrost zones both temperature warming and summer precipitation in permafrost zones accelerate permafrost degradation mekonnen et al 2021 and in turn lead to further climate warming and increased precipitation extremes the increasing frequency of flooding due to extreme precipitation in siberia in recent years kichigina 2020 is further evidence of increased spring and autumn precipitation in permafrost dominated regions under a warmer climate our results generally confirm that the permafrost dominated northern hemisphere is experiencing rapid changes in precipitation patterns under a warming climate thus in the context of rapid warming ecosystems and hydrological systems will face great uncertainties influenced by changes in precipitation regimes our concerns regarding extreme precipitation are closely related to the increased frequency and intensity of floods under a warming climate tabari 2020 as flooding disasters are accompanied by considerable economic losses it is clear that a warmer climate has led to earlier spring snowmelt induced floods and later winter floods blöschl et al 2017 however increased precipitation extremes do not correspond to an increase in flooding moreover decreases in antecedent soil moisture and snowmelt sharma et al 2018 and increases in evaporation blöschl et al 2019 likely lead to a decrease in flooding for permafrost developed regions in the northern high latitudes on one hand permafrost degradation results in significant drying of soil moisture andresen et al 2020 lawrence et al 2015 on the other hand such degradation increases baseflow evans et al 2020 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 thus how such changes in soil moisture and baseflow caused by permafrost degradation will affect the flood inundation dynamics across the northern high latitudes remains unclear and requires further investigation for the siberian region where observations are scarce the conclusions reached in this study are strictly limited to data from only 129 meteorological stations as stated by alexander et al 2019 additional observations and reliable reanalysis product data are needed to ensure that these data meet the necessary requirements for assessing long term climate change and trends in addition to achieve accurate extreme precipitation predictions in a warming climate an improved understanding of the physical feedback mechanisms by which permafrost degradation and climate change occur is needed muller and takayabu 2020 credit authorship contribution statement ping wang conceptualization

4127,increased attention to precipitation changes in permafrost dominated siberia is promoted by intensified flooding under climate warming the observed daily precipitation spanning 60 years 1959 2018 from 129 meteorological stations across the siberian lowlands with elevations less than 500 m 50 n 70 n 60 e 140 e captures significant changes in both annual and extreme precipitation for 1959 2018 the average annual precipitation over the siberian lowlands was 428 110 mm the average annual precipitation in non permafrost zones was approximately 458 114 mm larger than that in permafrost zones 407 102 mm additionally non permafrost zones experienced greater intensities and frequencies of precipitation extremes than permafrost zones according to four extreme precipitation indices i e r99p r95p r 5d and r10mm however the rate of increase in precipitation and precipitation extremes was greater in permafrost zones than in non permafrost zones these results obtained from in situ observations are generally consistent with era5 precipitation reanalysis data given faster warming in permafrost than in non permafrost zones the rate of increase in precipitation and precipitation extremes in permafrost zones also respond more than those in non permafrost zones in particular summer precipitation in permafrost zones accelerates permafrost degradation and the release of carbon dioxide and methane from permafrost sediments is very likely to have positive feedback effects on regional temperature and precipitation increases our results indicate that siberia will face risks attributable to increased precipitation and precipitation extremes in the context of climate warming and such risks will be greater in the permafrost zones than in the non permafrost zones keywords

by climate warming have already been widely observed e g moustakis et al 2021 parsons et al 2003 unfortunately these changes can lead to increases in extreme precipitation events and associated

of precipitation are notably increasing due to enhanced regional evaporation and atmospheric moisture transport bintanja 2018 in addition to the arctic oscillation frey and smith 2016 furthermore

al 2007 compared to non permafrost permafrost is more sensitive to climate change and the degradation of permafrost has a positive feedback effect on the climate system chadburn et al 2017 recently permafrost warming has posed serious impacts on the local changes in the topography hydrological conditions infrastructure and vegetation dynamics as well as global impacts on climate streletskiy et al 2015 recent observations confirmed that increased precipitation is likely to accelerate permafrost degradation because precipitation deepens the active layer by enhancing heat transfer zhu et al 2017 according to douglas et al 2020 an additional 1 cm of summer precipitation could lead to an increase in the ground thawing depth of 0 7 0 1 cm in addition a mechanistic ecosystem model demonstrated that the contribution of precipitation to permafrost degradation is comparable to that of the air temperature in a warmer climate mekonnen et al 2021 furthermore the release of soil organic carbon from sediments into the atmosphere as a consequence of permafrost thawing has the potential to amplify the climate change worldwide biskaborn et al 2019 despite recognizing the positive feedback of climate warming in response to permafrost degradation koven et al 2011 we still do not fully understand the roles of permafrost degradation in the total precipitation variation and the intensification of extreme events do precipitation and extreme precipitation increase faster in permafrost zones than in non permafrost zones under a warming climate to address this question we collected daily precipitation data from 129 low elevation 500 m a s l meteorological stations fig 1 across siberia between 50 n and 70 n and obtained era5 reanalysis data from 1959 to 2018 then we divided siberia into permafrost and non permafrost zones in accordance with the circum arctic map of permafrost and ground ice conditions version 2 brown et al 1997 the main objective of this study was to identify the temporal and spatial variability of the amount and extremes of precipitation between permafrost and non permafrost zones across the siberian lowlands to this end we first analysed the differences in the annual precipitation change rates between permafrost and non permafrost zones over the past 60 years section 3 1 then four extreme precipitation indices were selected to quantify the trends in the intensity and frequency of precipitation extremes occurring in those permafrost and non permafrost zones over the past 60 years section 3 2 finally we analysed the temporal changes in precipitation on a seasonal scale and the potential impacts on natural hazards such as flooding and vegetation responses section 3 3 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area siberia is an extensive geographical region in north asia that includes the west siberian plain central siberian plateau and east siberian highlands the research area in this study 50 n 70 n 60 e 140 e covers the three major siberian river basins the ob yenisei and lena basins the total area is approximately 7 98 million km2 this is a typical cold northern hemisphere region with a large areal extent of permafrost that accounts for approximately 69 of the total area the predominant land covers from north to south are tundra forest tundra taiga and forest steppe tchebakova et al 2009 in the context of global warming siberia is experiencing notable changes including significant rises in the surface temperature groisman et al 2013 substantial permafrost degradation with widespread landscape collapse nitzbon et al 2020 shifting vegetation zones tchebakova et al 2009 and increasing precipitation and surface runoff wang et al 2021 details of the study area can be found in wang et al 2021 and tang and tang 2021 2 2 data the climatology data we used for calculating and analysing the spatial and temporal variations in precipitation were taken from an extensive network of metrological stations in siberia daily 2 m air temperature and precipitation data from 129 low elevation 500 m a s l meteorological stations fig 1 during the period of 1959 2018 were obtained from the russian meteorological station database http aisori m meteo ru waisori index xhtml idata 5 bulygina et al 2020 in addition daily precipitation across siberia from the 5th generation reanalysis dataset era5 https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets reanalysis datasets era5 for the period from 1959 to 2018 was used for the analysis in this study for the era5 gridded data analysis we excluded data above 500 m a s l with the help of a digital elevation model dem data produced by the global 30 arc second elevation gtopo30 model from the usgs usgs 1996 2 3 precipitation indices to better quantify the changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation four extreme precipitation indices were selected namely r99p r95p r 5d and r10mm from among the 27 indices defined by the expert team on climate change detection monitoring and indices etccdmi international clivar project office 2001 karl et al 1999 zhang et al 2005 these selected indices are commonly used to assess extreme precipitation and potential flood risks including the risks of flash floods and large scale river flooding kirchmeier young and zhang 2020 the indices r99p and r95p represent the annual total precipitation when the daily precipitation amount rr is larger than the 99th and 95th percentiles for the reference period respectively r 99 p w 1 w rr wj i f rr wj rr ref 99 r 95 p w 1 w rr wj i f rr wj rr ref 95 where rr is the daily precipitation amount the subscript w refers to a wet day j denotes the index of the counting period ref is the reference period and w is the total amount of wet days in the counting period a wet day is defined as rr 1 0 m m in this study the counting period j is one year and the reference period is 1961 1990 the index r 5 day denotes the maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation in the counting period r 5 d a y m a x rr kj where j is the counting period and k is the index of the 5 day interval ending within the counting period r10mm is the total number of days with daily precipitation larger than 10 mm in the counting period a brief summary of the four indices is given in table 1 all of these values were calculated based on the daily precipitation data from 1959 to 2018 for both the station observations and the era5 data 2 4 trend analysis with linear regression and statistical methods based on the permafrost distribution map presented by brown et al 1997 we divided the siberian lowlands into two zones permafrost zones continuous and discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost and non permafrost zones of the 129 meteorological stations 75 are located within permafrost zones while the remaining stations are located in non permafrost zones linear trends in the annually or seasonally averaged time series of the observed and era5 precipitation data were analysed by ordinary least squares linear regression all fitting curves were evaluated using a t test with a significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion in this section we show the mean precipitation as well as the extreme precipitation indices calculated for the in situ observations and the era5 dataset 3 1 increases in annual precipitation table 2 gives an overview of the average annual precipitation for the permafrost and non permafrost zones within siberia for 1959 2018 the average annual precipitation calculated over 129 stations denoted as the global average is 428 mm among these stations the maximum value reaches 886 mm wmo no 36064 and the minimum value is 236 mm wmo no 24959 as shown in supplementary table s1 the average precipitation is 407 mm for the permafrost zones which is 5 lower than the global average for the non permafrost zones the average precipitation is 458 mm which is 7 higher than the global average and 13 higher than that for the permafrost zones the temporal evolution of the average annual precipitation for the permafrost and non permafrost zones is shown in fig 2 b for comparison purposes the temporal evolution of the average annual temperature is also given see fig 2 a over the past 60 years the rate of warming in the permafrost zones has been 0 35 c decade and that in the non permafrost zones has been 0 30 c decade the average annual rate of increase in the temperature has been 16 7 larger for the permafrost zones than for the non permafrost zones correspondingly the average annual precipitation within the permafrost zones has increased 7 17 mm decade approximately 8 1 faster than that in the non permafrost zones 6 63 mm decade clearly siberia has experienced notable warming over the last 60 years along with a significant increase in precipitation this suggests that the increase in precipitation is likely a response to the increase in temperature which is governed by the clausius clapeyron equation parsons et al 2003 the standard deviation std of the average annual precipitation calculated over 75 stations in the permafrost zones is 102 mm which is 12 smaller than the std calculated over 54 stations in the non permafrost zones 114 mm this implies slightly less variability for the permafrost zones than for the non permafrost zones differing from the in situ observations the std values for the era5 data are 168 mm for the permafrost zones and 153 mm for the non permafrost zones it is worth mentioning that these two std values are not comparable to those calculated for the observations from the stations as these stations are not homogeneously distributed within the research area while the era5 dataset comprises grid based data from regular meshes in addtion much more data were used for the calculations in the era5 dataset than for the station observations to further analyse the spatial variation of the average annual precipitation we calculated semi variograms for the permafrost and non permafrost zones for both the observations and the era5 data as shown in fig 3 the sills are 0 08 for the permafrost zones and 0 11 for the non permafrost zones fig 3 a b the permafrost zones have a range of 9 km which is 36 less than that of the non permafrost zones the spatial variability of the average annual precipitation for the permafrost zones seems to be smaller than that for the non permafrost zones in situ precipitation and temperature observations over the past 60 years indicate that significant climate changes are occurring in siberia in particular the rate of temperature warming in siberia 0 30 c decade and 0 35 c decade in the non permafrost and permafrost zones respectively is much greater than the global average post et al 2019 rahmstorf et al 2017 this suggests that siberia is becoming one of the hotspots of global climate change as evidenced by the northward shifts of forests tchebakova et al 2011 warming generally leads to considerable increases in precipitation on a global scale the rate of increase in precipitation is expected to be approximately 2 c in response to climate warming held and soden 2006 in the arctic regions local warming is likely to explain approximately 70 of the increase in precipitation bintanja 2018 our results show that annual precipitation and its spatio temporal variability differ significantly between permafrost and non permafrost zones during the past 60 years the rate of increase in precipitation in the permafrost zones has been much greater than that in the non permafrost zones this may be related to the fact that the warming rate in the permafrost zones is greater than that in the non permafrost zones equally important increased precipitation accelerates the degradation of permafrost douglas et al 2020 which further has a positive feedback to climate warming cheng and wu 2007 our results demonstrated that the annual precipitation and active layer thickness in the permafrost zones exhibited simultaneous increasing trends during the period 1980 2016 fig 4 it can therefore be assumed that under global warming temperature and precipitation will change more rapidly in the permafrost zones than in the non permafrost zones the spatial variability of precipitation will likely increase further as permafrost degradation is accompanied by the rapid expansion of thermokarst lakes in t zandt et al 2020 sannel and kuhry 2011 walter anthony et al 2018 and landscape changes from ice rich tundra to shrubs magnússon et al 2020 nevertheless the temperature precipitation permafrost feedback in permafrost zones is extremely complex and requires further investigation grosse et al 2016 3 2 intensification of precipitation extremes the average and std values of the four extreme precipitation indices for the permafrost and non permafrost zones are given in table 2 in general for all four indices the values for the permafrost zones are smaller than those for the non permafrost zones this result is consistent with that for the average annual precipitation fig 5 shows the temporal evolution of four extreme precipitation indices for the permafrost and non permafrost zones these indices are calculated from the station observations for 1959 2018 in general for both the permafrost and the non permafrost zones precipitation extremes are becoming more intense and more frequent the average annual rate of increase in r99p is 1 09 mm decade for the permafrost zones which is almost twice as large as that for the non permafrost zones 0 58 mm decade for r95p the difference between these two zones is even larger the permafrost zones have an average annual rate of increase of 2 82 mm decade which is 129 3 larger than that of the non permafrost zones 1 23 mm decade for r10mm the value for the permafrost zones increases 26 7 faster than that for the non permafrost zones r 5d shows similar performance for these two zones with a slightly larger 7 9 rate of increase for the permafrost zones the temporal evolution characteristics of the extreme precipitation indices calculated from the era5 data for the permafrost and non permafrost zones for 1959 2018 are shown in fig 6 all four indices indicate that extreme precipitation events are becoming more intense and frequent in both permafrost and non permafrost zones which is consistent with the results obtained from the in situ observations however there are some discrepancies between the rates of increase in the extreme precipitation indices obtained from the in situ observations and era5 data in both the permafrost and the non permafrost zones as shown in fig 6 a the annual rate of increase in r99p is only 37 4 larger for the permafrost zones than for the non permafrost zones this value is much smaller than the difference in the rate of increase calculated for the observation data for r95p the permafrost zones exhibit a rate of increase of 2 02 mm decade which is 135 larger than that of the non permafrost zones this result is generally consistent with the results calculated for the station observations the annual rate of increase in r10mm is 0 09 day decade for the permafrost zones which is only half of that calculated from the station observations however this value is still four times larger than the rate for the non permafrost zones differing from the above three indices the rate of increase in r 5d for the permafrost zones 0 10 mm decade is less than that for the non permafrost zones 0 15 mm decade the selected four indices demonstrate that precipitation extremes have intensified across siberia over the past 60 years these results are consistent with previous in situ station observations e g sun et al 2021 and climate model simulations suggesting an overall intensification of precipitation extremes as a result of climate warming asadieh and krakauer 2015 o gorman 2015 the effect of climate warming on extreme precipitation is expected to approach the clausius clapeyron relationship at a rate of 7 c pall et al 2007 in the eastern siberia an increase in both average and extreme precipitation can reach a thermodynamically constrained 8 c during the autumn chen and wang 2021 further myhre et al 2019 projected that the most intense precipitation events observed today could double in intensity for each degree of further climate warming for the rapidly warming region of siberia such extreme precipitation events will most likely be further enhanced additionally observations over the past 60 years demonstrate that extreme precipitation events have increased at a higher rate in permafrost zones than in non permafrost zones this implies that permafrost zones are more sensitive to climate warming than non permafrost zones 3 3 consequences of precipitation changes on a seasonal scale the precipitation observations show an increasing trend over the past 60 years for all four seasons in both the permafrost and the non permafrost zones see fig 7 the increase in precipitation is significantly larger in spring than in the other three seasons with rates of increase in the permafrost and non permafrost zones of 2 4 mm decade and 4 4 mm decade respectively the rates of increase in precipitation are lower in autumn than in spring with rates of 1 5 mm decade and 3 6 mm decade in permafrost and non permafrost zones respectively winter precipitation also shows an increasing trend but the rate of increase is larger in permafrost zones 0 4 mm decade than in non permafrost zones 0 3 mm decade in contrast precipitation in summer varies smoothly with rates of increase of 1 8 mm decade and 1 5 mm decade in the permafrost and non permafrost zones respectively siberia is characterized by a high flood risk with large floods i e causing significant damage to structures and agriculture having occurred in 7 out of 10 years during 2007 2016 kichigina 2020 according to statistics from 1985 to 2016 rainfall floods 53 and snowmelt floods that overlapped with rainfall 28 are the most common floods in siberia kichigina 2020 as seen from table 2 the average annual precipitation in the permafrost and non permafrost zones increased by 5 0 and 5 6 respectively from 1959 1988 to 1989 2018 the extreme precipitation r99p and r95p indices in permafrost and non permafrost zones has also increased by 7 8 in the last 30 years 1989 2018 compared to the previous 30 years 1959 1988 a comparative analysis of seasonal precipitation over the preceding and following 30 years shows that the rapid increase in spring and autumn precipitation table 3 is probably the main cause of the high frequency of flooding in siberia in recent years recent observations in the middle lena river of eastern siberia provided evidence that early floods are occurring more frequently in spring with secondary floods in summer and such changes have been reinforced since 2004 2005 gautier et al 2018 this suggests that against the background of future warming the siberian region will be at greater risk of extreme precipitation and flooding especially in spring and autumn with climate change the seasonal distribution of precipitation patterns will change portmann et al 2009 as will precipitation extremes which will affect vegetation growth conditions thus vegetation dynamics may respond to these changes and in turn affect ecosystem services gessner et al 2013 sohoulande djebou et al 2015 recently precipitation vegetation interactions have become increasingly important chen et al 2020 triggered by precipitation vegetation affects the water and energy cycles ellison et al 2017 vegetation not only depends on precipitation but also plays a critical role in generating precipitation acting as a driving force for climate regulation on the one hand precipitation provides plentiful water for vegetation to grow and it will be essential for vegetation to counteract global warming zhang et al 2020 on the other hand vegetation accelerates the hydrologic process of ecosystems through canopy interception and evaporation uddin et al 2016 wu et al 2019 therefore understanding the effects of precipitation especially extreme precipitation on vegetation is essential for realistic projections of changes in the water cycle under climate change 4 conclusions in this study we analysed daily precipitation data from 129 meteorological stations and the era5 reanalysis dataset at elevations below 500 m in siberia 50 n 70 n 60 e 140 e the results shown in this study clearly demonstrate that siberia as a global hotspot has experienced a notable increasing trend in mean and extreme precipitation over the past 60 years the increases in mean and extreme precipitation are believed to be responses to global warming bintanja 2018 held and soden 2006 pall et al 2007 in general the average annual multi year precipitation is smaller in the permafrost zones than in the non permafrost zones and the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation is lower in permafrost zones than in non permafrost zones this suggests that not only the mean and extreme precipitation but also the spatial variability of precipitation increases in response to warming pendergrass et al 2017 as noted by donat et al 2013 changes in precipitation and precipitation extremes appear to be more spatially heterogeneous than the consistent warming pattern in contrast to those in non permafrost zones both temperature warming and summer precipitation in permafrost zones accelerate permafrost degradation mekonnen et al 2021 and in turn lead to further climate warming and increased precipitation extremes the increasing frequency of flooding due to extreme precipitation in siberia in recent years kichigina 2020 is further evidence of increased spring and autumn precipitation in permafrost dominated regions under a warmer climate our results generally confirm that the permafrost dominated northern hemisphere is experiencing rapid changes in precipitation patterns under a warming climate thus in the context of rapid warming ecosystems and hydrological systems will face great uncertainties influenced by changes in precipitation regimes our concerns regarding extreme precipitation are closely related to the increased frequency and intensity of floods under a warming climate tabari 2020 as flooding disasters are accompanied by considerable economic losses it is clear that a warmer climate has led to earlier spring snowmelt induced floods and later winter floods blöschl et al 2017 however increased precipitation extremes do not correspond to an increase in flooding moreover decreases in antecedent soil moisture and snowmelt sharma et al 2018 and increases in evaporation blöschl et al 2019 likely lead to a decrease in flooding for permafrost developed regions in the northern high latitudes on one hand permafrost degradation results in significant drying of soil moisture andresen et al 2020 lawrence et al 2015 on the other hand such degradation increases baseflow evans et al 2020 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 thus how such changes in soil moisture and baseflow caused by permafrost degradation will affect the flood inundation dynamics across the northern high latitudes remains unclear and requires further investigation for the siberian region where observations are scarce the conclusions reached in this study are strictly limited to data from only 129 meteorological stations as stated by alexander et al 2019 additional observations and reliable reanalysis product data are needed to ensure that these data meet the necessary requirements for assessing long term climate change and trends in addition to achieve accurate extreme precipitation predictions in a warming climate an improved understanding of the physical feedback mechanisms by which permafrost degradation and climate change occur is needed muller and takayabu 2020 credit authorship contribution statement ping wang conceptualization

4128,stable carbon isotopic composition δ13c of speleothems has often been recognized as a proxy of vegetation and soil processes in many climatic regimes in monsoonal regions the speleothem δ13c records are thought to be able to document changes in local and or regional precipitation as well due to the complexity of carbon isotopic evolution within heterogeneous karst aquifers accurate interpretations of this proxy are challenging it is essential to carry out detailed monitoring of cave dripwater δ13cdic to disentangle various processes governing carbon isotopic evolution and decipher the hydroclimatic constraints here we reported the results of a five year monitoring of the δ13cdic as well as hydrochemical compositions of dripwaters in the maomaotou big cave guilin south china great spatiotemporal variations in the dripwater δ13cdic values were observed i seepage flow fed drips commonly had lower δ13cdic values with smaller temporal variation ii the lowest δ13cdic values were found at fracture fed drips that had a large supply of soil co2 whereas the fracture fed drips with less episodic co2 recharge had much more positive δ13cdic iii the δ13cdic exhibits remarkable season changes particularly at fracture fed drips where higher δ13cdic values were observed in winter seasons and iv an increasing trend in mean value of δ13cdic at individual sites during 2015 2019 was found both hydrochemical and isotopic analyses revealed that the dripwater δ13cdic is mainly controlled by spatiotemporal variations in water co2 rock interactions in association with hydrological processes coupled with soil co2 dynamics which are closely linked to changes in local rainfall at monthly to annual timescales prior calcite precipitation pcp along the flow path above the cave could also affect the δ13cdic of fracture fed dripwaters in dry periods comparisons of the dripwater δ13cdic records with local climate showed that the change of summer monsoonal rainfall particularly the august september october precipitation significantly influences the annual mean δ13cdic value of dripwaters in caves of south china further comparison analyses of dripwater δ13cdic records from both southern and northern china suggested that variations of dripwater δ13cdic could reflect changes of regional monsoonal precipitation over inter annual and maybe decadal timescale this demonstrates that the δ13c of speleothems if precipitated at isotopic equilibrium and not greatly influenced by the co2 degassing is likely to be a valuable proxy of monsoon rainfall variability across east asia keywords heterogeneous karst aquifers water co2 rock interactions prior calcite precipitation hydrological dynamics monsoonal rainfall 1 introduction speleothems have been demonstrated to be one of excellent archives for the reconstruction of hemispheric or global climate cheng et al 2016 wang et al 2001 yuan et al 2004 by using precisely dated and high resolution stalagmite δ18o records from monsoonal china for example cheng et al 2016 successfully reconstructed the history of asian summer monsoon over the past 640 000 years besides δ18o speleothem δ13c has also been considered as one of important proxies of climate and environmental change previous studies have used it to reconstruct changes of air temperature in the mediterranean region martín chivelet

that has been recently argued to mainly reflect the precipitation δ18o rather than rainfall amount in east asia cai et al 2018 hu et al 2019 speleothem δ13c records are found to be able to provide additional information on variability in precipitation at local and regional scales e g li and li 2018 li et al 2021a because of the complex carbon isotopic evolution within heterogeneous karst aquifers however the use of speleothem δ13c as a reliable climatic proxy is challenging a number of studies have revealed that the speleothem δ13c is affected by various factors such as air

that the vegetation and soil processes above the cave has a major control on the δ13c of speleothems worldwide in regions under the influence of summer monsoon the δ13c of speleothems has been found to be strongly modulated by monsoonal precipitation as well li and li 2018 li et al 2021a yin et al 2019 due to the influence of various local processes however the speleothem δ13c records from different caves in the same region or even at different drip sites in the same cave often generate differed information on climatic and environmental change thus it is essential to disentangle these various processes governing the speleothem δ13c and assess their relative importance if the speleothems formed at isotopic equilibrium their δ13c is mainly dependent on the carbon isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic of cave dripwaters owing to strong heterogeneity and dynamics of karst hydrosystems great spatiotemporal variations of dripwater δ13cdic are often observed a study of dripwater monitoring in panlong cave guilin south china reported that the δ13cdic values of seepage flow fed drips that have higher drip rate commonly exhibited a marked decreasing trend with smaller amplitude of variation during 2010 2015 whereas larger amplitude and no obvious trend of variations in dripwater δ13cdic were observed at extremely slow seepage drips during the same time period zhang et al 2017 furthermore results of artificial trace test in another cave the xiaoyan cave guilin showed that the dripwater can be recharged by both fast fracture flow and slow seepage flow and the fast flow could accounts for 90 of the total dripwater discharge in rainy seasons while the slow flow is the main recharge in dry seasons yin et al 2017b such heterogeneity of hydrological process over space and time would inevitably result in great spatiotemporal variations in water co2 rock interactions within the aquifer and thus the dripwaters δ13cdic to date the understanding of how the heterogeneous hydrogeological processes influence the dripwater δ13cdic is still limited it is necessary to conduct long term monitoring of different types of drips to gain more insights into the spatiotemporal variation of dripwater δ13cdic and the climatic and environmental constraints in this study we conducted a five year monitoring of hydrochemical compositions and δ13cdic of dripwaters in maomaotou big cave guilin south china that is located in the domain of the east asian summer monsoon easm in order to characterize the spatiotemporal variations of dripwater δ13cdic and elucidate various processes influencing the δ13cdic in particular different types of dripwater were investigated so as to carefully explore the control of coupled hydrological and biogeochemical processes on dripwater δ13cdic by comparing with data of local and regional climate the temporal variation of dripwater δ13cdic from the maomaotou big cave along with other caves in monsoonal china in response to changes of local or regional precipitation at monthly seasonal and annual timescales were discussed which in turn helping in deciphering the hydroclimatic significance of the δ13cdic of dripwater the study will lay a foundation for the reconstruction of monsoonal precipitation based on the δ13c of speleothems from east asia 2 the study site the maomaotou big cave is located in the northwest of guilin city guangxi south china fig 1 a it lies on the middle slope of the maomaotou mountain in which another three caves including reed flute cave feisi cave and the through cave are found too these four caves are developed on thick massive devonian limestones that are intercalated with cretaceous breccia and tectonically accommodated by two local faults that are nne and nww trending respectively deng et al 1988 the maomaotou big cave is the longest one with a length of 975 m it is about 5 30 m wide and 5 25 m high the elevation of the cave entrance is 209 m above sea level a s l about 50 m above the local floodplain in peak forest karst about 100 200 m of highly karstified host carbonate rocks is overlying the cave at the surface soil cover is usually 1 m and often absent in the steepest area of the mountain the vegetation is dominated by shrubs and vines fig 1b abundant speleothems such as stalagmites stalactites columns and flowstones are found inside the cave the climate in the region of guilin is currently dominated by the asian summer monsoon with humid hot summer and short mild winter the annual mean air temperature is 19 1 c and annual mean precipitation is 1897 mm 70 of the total annual rainfall occurs during the summer season between april and september in winter seasons the monsoonal precipitation decreases significantly and the occurrence of rainfall in this season is associated with continental cold fronts yin et al 2020 seasonal to inter annual variations of monsoonal rainfall in this region are observed and climatic anomalies often occur due to the change of atmospheric oceanic circulation yin et al 2020 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analytical methods six drip sites in the maomaotou big cave were chosen for monitoring and sampling see their locations in fig 1c the drips are discharged at the tip of stalactites or soda straw on the cave ceiling under the drips there are stalagmites the dripwaters were sampled in monthly or seasonal strategies from december 2014 to december 2019 when sampling dripwaters a hand held meter smart sensor as847 was used to measure air temperature and relative humidity rh in the cave with precisions of 1 c and 3 respectively also the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in cave was measured using a hand held co2 meter testo 535 germany rang 0 9999 ppm precision 50 ppm at individual sites the drip rates were determined by manual measurement of the volume of dripwater in a definite time dripwaters were collected manually using a raingauge like bucket water temperature

ca2 and hco3 in water were determined using the calcium and alkalinity test kits mcolortest merck kgaa germany with a precision of 2 mg l and 0 1 mmol l respectively water samples were placed in pre cleaned polyethylene bottles in different size 15 ml for the analysis of δ13cdic and 60 ml and 120 ml for cation and anion analyses respectively 2 3 drops of saturated hgcl2 were added to the sample for δ13c analysis to avoid any influence of microbial activity and then the bottle for δ13cdic analyses was tightly capped without headspace and stored at 4 c before measurement ultrapure hno3 1 1 was

between 1948 and 2019 obtained from the ncep ncar re analysis data sets kalnay et al 1996 and the grid analysis and display system grads 4 results 4 1 cave climate the maomaotou big cave had a relatively stable air temperature throughout the year during the investigation period it was 18 8 0 4 c in the inner section of the cave while 18 0 1 1 c at sites close to the entrance the rh was 96 0 5 3 in the outer section and 98 2 2 6 in the inner section cave air pco2 ranged from 438 to 1374 ppm and tended to be higher between june and october but lower from november to the next may 4 2 drip rate drip rates at the monitoring sites in the cave exhibited great spatiotemporal variations table 1 drips m 2 m 3 and m 5 had relatively lower drip rate mostly 10 ml min while drips m 1 m 6 and m 7 had higher drip rates mostly 15 ml l up to 90 ml min at drip m 6 temporally smaller variations of drip rate were observed at drips m 1 m 2 and m 3 with relative standard deviation rsd of 50 and according to fairchild et al 2006 these drips can thus be identified as seepage drips fed by micro fracture flows and percolated water through porous limestone matrix in contrast larger temporal variations of drip rate rsd 75 were observed at drips m 5 m 6 and m 7 an indicative of the recharge of fast fissure flows in particular the drip m 7 was only active after heavy rainfall events implying that the water flows through larger fractures at all drip sites higher drip rates commonly occurred in the rainy season from april may to august september while lower drip rates in the dry winter season such seasonal variations of flow rate were particularly evident for drip m 6 4 3 hydrochemical compositions the seepage drips incl m 1 m 2 and m 3 had similar water temperature to each other about 18 6 c with small variations table 1 in contrast larger variations of water temperature were observed at the fracture fed drips incl m 5 m 6 and m 7 at drip m 6 the water temperature varied greatly from 14 8 to 24 3 c in the investigated period generally the water temperature of these fracture fed drips changed synchronously with the drip rate the ph values of all seepage drips were similar to each other whereas distinct ph values were shown for the fracture fed drips the highest values at m 5 8 2 the lowest values at m 6 7 7 table 1 normally relatively higher dripwater ph values were observed in the dry winter season compared with that in rainy summer season fig 2 the water chemistry of all dripwaters from the cave was characterized by the dominance of ca2 and hco3 accounting for 95 and 80 of the total concentrations of cations and anions respectively the k na mg2 no3 so4 2 and cl were present at a very low level great spatiotemporal variations were observed for the chemical compositions of dripwater table 1 in general all seepage drips had roughly similar chemical compositions to each other for the fracture fed drips lower ec ca2 and hco3 concentrations and pco2 but higher mg ca and sr ca molar ratios were found at m 5 and m 7 in contrast the drip m 6 had the highest ec ca2 and hco3 concentrations and pco2 but the lowest mg ca and sr ca molar ratios a very large variation of the pco2 in water was also observed at drip m 6 all the dripwaters were saturated with respect to calcite as shown by elevated sic 0 28 0 87 table 1 a slightly larger variation of sic could be found at the fracture fed drips temporally the drips m 5 and m 6 had higher ec and concentration of ca2 and hco3 in the summer season between april may and august september and lower ec ca2 and hco3 concentration in the winter season fig 2 less significant seasonal variations of these chemical compositions were found at the seepage drips at inter annual scale there was an increasing trend for dripwater ph value but a decreasing trend for ec ca2 and hco3 concentrations observed at all drip sites during the monitoring period of december 2014 to december 2019 fig 2 4 4 δ13cdic the δ13cdic values of dripwaters from the maomaotou big cave ranged from 16 3 to 3 1 with an average of 12 6 similar to the hydrochemical compositions the dripwater δ13cdic values also displayed great spatiotemporal variations table 1 fig 2 the most depleted δ13cdic value was observed at site m 6 15 2 0 8 and the most enriched δ13cdic at site m 5 7 5 2 4 the lowest δ13cdic value 16 3 was observed at drip m 6 in august 2016 and the highest δ13cdic 3 1 at m 5 in december 2019 the amplitudes of variation in δ13cdic values varied at different drip sites 2 for individual seepage drips m 1 m 2 and m 3 and 3 5 to 8 1 for the fracture fed drips m 5 m 6 and m 7 at individual drip sites the dripwater δ13cdic values commonly showed marked seasonal variations fig 2 generally lower dripwater δ13cdic values tended to be observed in the period between april may and october while higher values from november to the next march april nevertheless less enriched dripwater δ13cdic occurred in the winter season of 2015 2016 fig 2 within the period of summer season slightly more enriched dripwater δ13cdic was also found in some months for example late july and august of both 2018 and 2019 at most drip sites obvious spatial difference in the temporal variation of δ13cdic among different drips was observed smaller variation for the seepage drips while larger enrichment for the fracture fed drips between august and december 2019 at inter annual scale an enriching trend of dripwater δ13cdic along with increasing ph but decreasing ec ca2 and hco3 concentration was observed at individual sites in the monitoring period from december 2014 to december 2019 fig 2 5 discussion 5 1 processes governing dripwater δ13cdic 5 1 1 water co2 rock interactions in karst catchments the infiltrating meteoric water dissolves plenty of soil co2 and delivers them into the carbonate aquifer the carbonic acids generated by soil co2 dissolution in water are then largely involved in the dissolution of carbonate minerals both calcite and dolomite as a result a great amount of ca2 and dic are produced and transported by groundwater in general the soil co2 has depleted δ13c e g about 23 in the region of guilin south china with vegetation dominated by c3 plants cao et al 2011 pan et al 2002 as the carbonate dissolution proceeds the δ13c can evolve to more enriched value and the degree of the isotopic enrichment depends on whether the system with respect to co2 is open or closed clark and fritz 1997 according to theoretical modeling the open system dissolution of carbonate i e with a constant supply of soil co2 at 19 c would yield a δ13cdic value of 16 at calcite saturation if using δ13c values of 23 and 0 for local soil co2 and limestones respectively for the closed system in which the soil co2 is not immediately replenished a value around 12 would be attained in the heterogeneous karst aquifers both open and closed system conditions exist and could change over space and time which leads to great spatiotemporal variations in δ13cdic of groundwater fohlmeister et al 2020 owen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 theoretically the groundwater would have lower ph values but higher concentrations of ca2 and dic when the carbonate dissolution occurs under open system conditions whereas higher ph values but lower concentrations of ca2 and dic would be obtained in closed systems with respect to soil co2 dreybrodt and scholz 2011 fohlmeister et al 2020 owen et al 2018 in the maomaotou big cave dripwater at site m 6 had the lowest ph value 7 7 and the highest pco2 10 2 2 atm and ca2 concentration 3 mmol l such geochemical signatures suggest that the dissolution of carbonate is likely to occur under conditions towards an open system thus the dripwater had more depleted δ13c about 15 2 close to the theoretical value of 16 fig 3 in contrast the lowest pco2 10 2 8 atm and ca2 concentrations 1 6 mmol l and 1 7 mmol l respectively were observed at sites m 5 and m 7 an indicative of closed system condition as a result of closed system dissolution more positive dripwater δ13cdic values were yielded fig 3 compared with these three drips seepage drips m 1 m 2 and m 3 had intermediate pco2 10 2 5 10 2 4 atm and ca2 concentrations 2 2 2 5 mmol l implying that the systems for carbonate dissolution are partially open i e mixed open closed dreybrodt and scholz 2011 in this case intermediate δ13cdic values were produced ranging from 12 to 16 fig 3 the spatial variations in the condition for water co2 carboante interactions are mainly related to the heterogeneity of flow path and water movement across the soil layer epikarst to the lower vadose zone fairchild and baker 2012 tooth and fairchild 2003 for the drips fed by fracture flows like the m 7 that is only active after heavy rainfall the recharge of soil co2 to the system might be episodic due to fast movement of infiltrated water the co2 is not immediately replenished at lower levels of the aquifer thereby favoring the closed system dissolution of carbonate similar condition probably exists along the flow path for the drip m 5 although the drip m 6 is recharged by fracture flow both hydrochemical and isotopic signatures show the behavior of open system carbonate dissolution the reason might be that there is thicker soil cover and denser vegetation in the recharge area of the fracture flows and larger amounts of soil co2 are available because of the enhanced transport of infiltrating water this can be proved by the higher pco2 in the dripwater at this site table 1 since the drips m 1 m 2 and m 3 are mainly fed by slow diffusive flows through porous limestone matrix and micro fractures well mixing and storage of soil co2 and water flows likely take place within the aquifer providing a condition of mixed open closed system for carbonate dissolution 5 1 2 vegetation and soil activities the water co2 rock interactions within karst aquifers can be temporally regulated by vegetation and soil activities which control the soil co2 production i e soil pco2 in the monsoonal region of china higher soil pco2 are produced between june and october as the increase in both temperature and moisture enhances biological productivity and thus root respiration and microbial activities in soil zone while lower soil pco2 is observed in winter seasons when the soil respiration rate is low cao et al 2020 liu et al 2007 2010 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 2021 accordingly larger supply of soil co2 is available and thus carbonate dissolution occurs under more open system conditions during the summer season this is demonstrated by increased air pco2 in the cave too in addition more depleted δ13c values of soil co2 are often observed in summer cao et al 2011 pan et al 2002 the dripwater δ13cdic in the maomaotou big cave showed marked seasonal variations lower values between april may and october but higher values in the winter season fig 2 which was quite consistent with seasonal changes in both soil pco2 and the δ13c of soil co2 such variations are typical of many cave dripwaters as well as other types of karst groundwater in monsoonal china cao et al 2020 li and li 2018 li et al 2021a liu et al 2007 wang et al 2020 2021 zhao et al 2015 5 1 3 hydrological dynamics besides the influence of soil processes hydrological dynamics is also one of important processes governing the water co2 rock interactions previous studies have revealed that enhanced and more frequent meteoric recharge could dissolve and deliver constant and larger amount of co2 from soil into epikarst and the lower vadose zone causing more open system conditions for carbonate dissolution and thus lower dripwater δ13cdic values conversely reduced water recharge results in more closed system dissolution and higher δ13cdic values dreybrodt and scholz 2011 li and li 2018 li et al 2021a in particular enriched δ13cdic values are often observed during drought events due to the lack of sufficient supply of water and soil co2 large variations of both drip rate and δ13cdic were observed at the fracture fed drip m 5 in the maomaotou big cave fig 4 a and there was a significantly correlation between them with a coefficient r of 0 68 also significant correlations between δ13cdic and indicators of the intensity of carbonate dissolution e g δ13cdic vs ec r 0 68 δ13cdic vs ca2 r 0 74 δ13cdic vs hco3 0 76 were found hence we infer that the hydrological processes play an important role in regulating the temporal variation of dripwater δ13cdic for the seepage drips like the m 3 smaller variations in drip rate were shown but slightly higher drip rates between april and august could be still found fig 4b during this period slightly elevated dripwater δ13cdic values were shown before the decline of them the reason might be that the enhanced water infiltration and hydraulic head caused by increasing rainfall lead to the release of waters previously stored in the aquifer which has more positive δ13cdic first the peaks of depleted δ13cdic values often lagged behind the drip rate by 1 3 months which is attributed to the longer residence time of seepage flows up to half a year as revealed by data of dripwater δ18o from these sites yin et al 2020 5 1 4 prior calcite precipitation pcp potential co2 degassing and pcp along the flow path could affect the dripwater δ13cdic too fairchild and treble 2009 since the percolation water is commonly rich in co2 i e high pco2 in water degassing of co2 are prone to occur when the water flows become in contact with air spaces within the aquifer first of all the physically dissolved aqueous co2 would escape driven by molecular diffusion causing the ph and sic to rise dreybrodt and scholz 2011 if the sic reaches or exceeds the critical threshold for calcite precipitation there would be the occurrence of pcp both the co2 degassing and pcp processes could lead to carbon isotopic fractionation to various degrees according to the theory of isotopic fractionation the degassing of aqueous co2 results in only a small isotope enrichment about 1 1 while the calcite precipitation and associated co2 degassing could cause larger 13c enrichment up to 10 20 hansen et al 2019 previous studies found that the influence of co2 degassing should be minor when the flow movement is fast dreybrodt and romanov 2016 hansen et al 2019 however our study shows that the fracture fed drips m 5 and m 7 had higher ph 8 0 indicating the occurrence of co2 degassing higher sic 0 5 was attained at these drips all these observations suggest that there are possibly co2 degassing and pcp occurred before the water arrives in the cave data of dripwater δ13cdic at these two sites are mostly off the modeling line of closed system carbonate dissolution and there is a negative correlation between δ13cdic values and ca2 concentrations fig 3 showing an evidence of pcp effects particularly larger 13c enrichment was found in dry seasons when the water movement was slower and there was longer time for co2 degassing and pcp to occur no significant 13c enrichment was found at seepage drips including m 1 m 2 and m 3 implying less influence of pcp processes along the flow path trace elemental ratios such as mg ca and sr ca molar ratios can be used as a useful tool to identify the pcp influences fairchild and baker 2012 fairchild et al 2000 li et al 2021b the seepage drips had small amplitudes of variation in trace elemental ratios and there is no significant correlation between δ13cdic and mg ca and sr ca molar ratios fig 4b again indicating that the pcp has minor impacts on the dripwater δ13cdic however larger amplitudes of variations and positive correlations between dripwater δ13cdic and mg ca and sr ca molar ratios were found for the fracture fed drips e g at m 5 mg ca r 0 75 1000 sr ca r 0 63 fig 4a this further indicates the pcp process has likely affected the δ13cdic of fracture fed drips especially in the dry periods 5 1 5 in cave processes when the dripwater arrives at the ceiling of cave and is dwelling on the stalactites or soda straw the co2 degassing could easily take place due to the great gradient between the pco2 in dripwater and the pco2 in cave atmosphere this phenomenon appears to be evident when the drip rate is very low as a result calcite precipitation may occur before dripping down causing the dripwater δ13cdic to be enriched laboratory experiments and theoretical simulation suggest that the diffusive degassing of aqueous co2 only needs 2 s up to 30 s for a thin film water 0 01 0 04 cm thick while the isotopic equilibrium during the process of calcite precipitation needs longer time usually ranging between 2000 s and 250 s for a 0 01 cm thick layer of water at t 0 c and 25 c respectively dreybrodt 2019 hansen et al 2013 hendy 1971 if the drip interval is longer than the total time of degassing and precipitation needed kinetic isotopic fractionation will occur in the maomaotou big cave all the monitoring drips had high drip rate 3 drops min and thus the influence of isotopic fractionation caused by calcite precipitation at the cave ceiling on dripwater δ13cdic should be minor cave climates such cave air temperature humidity and ventilation can affect the co2 degassing and calcite precipitation in caves it was reported that better cave ventilation observed in winter could enhance the degassing of co2 in dripwater and calcite precipitation and thus result in elevated dripwater speleothem δ13c breitenbach et al 2015 vieten et al 2016 the air temperature and rh in the middle and inner sections of the maomaotou big cave exhibited small variations 2 c for air temperature and 10 for the rh so less influence of in cave process on the dripwater δ13cdic is expected in contrast larger amplitudes of variations in air temperature 3 4 c and rh 16 20 were observed at both sites m 5 and m 6 which are located near the cave entrance however the δ13cdic variations at these two sites showed distinct relationship with changes of cave conditions at the m 5 site with lower drip rate more significant correlation between dripwater δ13cdic and air temperature r 0 54 rh r 0 51 and co2 r 0 35 was found however there was no significant correlation at drip m 6 which had higher drip rate about 30 6 ml min these findings may suggest that cave environments could have an effect on the dripwater δ13cdic but not serious especially for the drips with high discharge rate 5 2 hydroclimatic control on dripwater δ13cdic based on the abovementioned analyses of individual processes governing the dripwater δ13cdic we see that the dripwater δ13cdic is principally controlled by water co2 rock interactions in association with coupled processes of soil activity and hydrological dynamics in particular the hydrological process plays an important role in the delivery of soil co2 and larger amount of soil co2 can be transported into the aquifer by enhanced water flow which resulting in stronger dissolution of carbonate and more depleted dripwater δ13cdic under conditions with reduced flow rate co2 degassing and pcp processes is likely to occur along the flow path causing the dripwater δ13cdic to be enriched such opposite effects of enhanced water co2 rock interactions in wet periods and stronger pcp in dry periods lead to large temporal variations in dripwater δ13cdic as also revealed by other studies of dripwaters in caves from monsoonal china li and li et al 2018 li et al 2021a zhang et al 2017 therefore the dripwater δ13cdic is supposed to be sensitively responding to rainfall driven water recharge and thus can be identified as a potential proxy of hydroclimatic change in this section we try to further explore the hydroclimatic control on dripwater δ13cdic by comparing the δ13cdic record of the maomaotou big cave with local and regional climate mainly monsoonal rainfall at intraseasonal to inter annual timescales 5 2 1 seasonal scale because of the easm influence the climate in subtropical regions of south china is characterized by seasonally synchronous variations of air temperature and precipitation such seasonal climate change exerts great impacts on soil respiration rate water recharge and water co2 rock interactions resulting in great seasonal variation in the δ13cdic of groundwater within the karst aquifers li et al 2011a 2011b li and li 2018 liu et al 2007 wang et al 2020 at individual drip sites in the maomaotou big cave depleted δ13cdic values were observed in wet summer seasons while enriched δ13cdic values in dry winter seasons except that of 2015 2016 fig 5 this seasonal variation was generally consistent with changes in local air temperature and rainfall relatively depleted δ13cdic values were also observed in the period from november 2015 to april 2016 which might be related to abnormally higher precipitation in autumn and winter of 2015 about twice higher than the ordinary year fig 4 the positive precipitation anomaly is inferred to be linked to the strong el niño conditions occurred in 2015 yin et al 2020 slightly less depleted δ13cdic was sometimes observed at individual sites except drips m 5 and m 7 during the summer season for example in late july and august of both 2018 and 2019 when relatively less precipitation occurred fig 5 the reduced rainfall in the region of guilin is attributed to the fact that the monsoonal rain belt in east asia has migrated to northern china in late july and august driven by the expansion of asian summer monsoon ding et al 2008 meanwhile the south china is controlled by the west pacific subtropical high wpsh in these months resulting in higher air temperature but less rainfall dry conditions in july august of both years of 2018 and 2019 are shown by local drought index which shifts from positive to negative in the region of guilin fig 5 when the drought happens both soil respiration rate and water infiltration are likely to decline to some degrees and thus slightly weakened water rock interactions and more enriched dripwater δ13cdic occur cook and orchard 2008 zhou et al 2019 in addition higher co2 degassing and pcp could take place in drought events elevating the δ13cdic values and trace element ratios of dripwater fig 4 after the droughts in july and august the dripwater δ13cdic could become depleted again or more enriched depending on the precipitation in the following months fig 5 for example the precipitation data show that about 127 mm rainfall occurred in september 2018 but only 13 mm in september 2019 accordingly it can be seen that the δ13cdic of fracture fed drips like drips m 5 and m 6 became depleted in september 2018 again but got more enriched in september 2019 at seepage drips the δ13cdic values decreased back to the average level and varied with small amplitudes after october the dripwater δ13cdic values were enriched as both soil pco2 and rainfall greatly declined especially at fracture fed drip sites figs 4 and 5 5 2 2 inter annual scale during the monitoring period from december 2014 to december 2019 more depleted dripwater δ13cdic was observed in summer seasons of 2017 and 2019 corresponding to larger amount of monsoonal precipitation occurred in the region of guilin fig 5 in summer of 2018 however less rainfall occurred and there was less depletion in dripwater δ13cdic this suggests that the annual variation of summer monsoonal precipitation has an important influence on the cave dripwater δ13cdic an overall decreasing trend of dripwater ec ca2 and hco3 concentrations but an enriching trend of average δ13cdic were found at all drip sites in the maomaotou big cave during 2015 2019 figs 2 and 6 such trends were particularly evident at drips m 3 and m 6 where stronger water co2 rock interactions occurred along the flow path as suggested by the geochemical data given the close correlation between dripwater δ13cdic and hydrological conditions the increasing average δ13cdic values may suggest there was a decreasing trend in local precipitation however climate data show that the annual precipitation in the region of guilin did not show any obvious trends between 2015 and 2019 further analyses also show that there was no trend in the variation of local rainfall in april may june july amjj at the inter annual scale as well surprisingly we find that the august september october aso rainfall exhibited a decreasing trend from 2015 to 2019 fig 6 the analysis of integrated vapor flux reveals that the mean value of amjj vapor flux in the region of guilin between 2015 and 2019 was similar to that between 1948 and 2019 whereas there was a distinct difference of the mean value of the aso vapor flux between periods of 2015 2019 and 1948 2019 existed fig 7 this may suggest that the variation of aso precipitation could greatly affect the annual change of monsoonal rainfall in monsoonal regions of china soil respiration rate and thus soil pco2 are higher in the period from july to october cao et al 2005 2011 li and li 2018 li et al 2021a since the water co2 rock interactions are controlled by coupled hydrological and biological soil processes the change of aso precipitation should have a great influence on the annual mean values of dripwater δ13cdic under conditions with higher aso rainfall larger amount of soil co2 could be continuously transported into the aquifer and thus stronger water co2 rock interactions occur and more depleted dripwater δ13cdic is yielded e g abnormal rainfall in 2015 particularly the increased soil co2 supply would have a prolonged effect on δ13cdic of seepage drips which have the longer residence time with the decrease of aso precipitation however an overall annual decrease in mean values of ec ca2 hco3 and but increase in the dripwater δ13cdic occurred this increasing trend of dripwater δ13cdic values is also synchronous with the increase in the annual mean value of dripwater δ18o in the maomaotou big cave in 2015 2019 which indicating a weakening of easm yin et al 2020 for better understanding the control of the monsoonal rainfall on the inter annual variation of dripwater δ13cdic we compared the dripwater δ13cdic record of maomaotou big cave with that of jiguan cave north central china during 2015 2019 li et al 2021a differed from the record of maomaotou big cave the δ13cdic values of dripwaters from the jiguan cave exhibited an overall decreasing trend fig 6 this should imply an increase in local precipitation but it contradicts the fact of a decreasing trend in the local annual precipitation as shown by meteorological data from the region of the jiguan cave in 2015 2019 similar to the annual precipitation the local amjj rainfall also displayed a decreasing trend but an increasing trend of local aso rainfall is found which is consistent with the decreasing trend of dripwater δ13cdic values from the jiguan cave indeed the aso rainfall represents the majority of summer monsoonal precipitation as the rain belt has migrated to the northern china another monitoring study of dripwater δ13cdic in the panlong cave guilin south china showed that there was a decreasing trend of dripwater δ13cdic values but increasing trends in ec ca2 and hco3 during 2010 2015 in response to increased local aso rainfall fig 6 zhang et al 2017 by contrast an enriching trend of dripwater δ13cdic was observed in the jiguan cave during this period li et al 2021a all these observations support our speculations that there is possibly a great control of the local aso rainfall on the annual mean values of dripwater δ13cdic by comparing the dripwater δ13cdic records of both northern china e g the jiguan cave and southern china e g the maomaotou big cave and panlong cave with the east asian summer monsoon index easmi an indicator of summer monsoon intensity li and zeng 2002 fig 6 we further find that with the increase of easmi during 2015 2019 the aso rainfall was increasing in northern china but decreasing in southern china in contrast the opposite pattern was found for the aso rainfall variation from 2010 to 2014 when the easmi was declining such spatial difference in the aso rainfall between north central and southern china is consistent with the spatial pattern of summer monsoonal rainfall variation across east asia i strong easm phases would lead to the northward migration of average position of rain belt resulting in more monsoonal precipitation in northern china but decreased precipitation occurring between august and october in southern china and ii during weakened easm phases the average position of rain belt migrate southwards causing less monsoonal precipitation in northern china but increased precipitation in all months of the summer season in southern china this spatial difference in monsoonal precipitation is described as a pattern of wet northern but dry southern dry northern but dry southern in monsoonal china ding et al 2008 these findings suggest that the variations of dripwater δ13cdic may have the potential to be a proxy of changes of regional monsoonal precipitation at inter annual scale and maybe decadal timescales as well 5 3 implications for the study of speleothem δ13c when calcite precipitation occurs under an isotopically equilibrium condition in cave the δ13c of speleothems is principally determined by the dripwater δ13cdic signatures li et al 2021a mattey et al 2008 our unpublished data show that there is only a small difference between dripwater δ13cdic values and the δ13c values of farmed calcite precipitates under individual drips from the maomaotou big cave 1 6 except m 5 which is similar to many other studies el shenawy et al 2020 levitt et al 2018 romanek et al 1992 li et al 2021a this indicates that the speleothem is precipitated approximately under isotope equilibrium in cave processes for example temperature driven cave ventilation could cause larger isotopic fractionation at sites that are located near the cave entrance and has relatively lower drip rate especially during dry winter seasons e g up to 3 4 at drip m 5 nevertheless less influence of cave ventilation on the δ13c of speleothem that formed by drips with high drip rate e g at m 6 are found since the monsoonal rainfall has been recognized to be the main control of cave dripwater δ13cdic the speleothem δ13c records from monsoonal china can be inferred to be able to provide an amount of information of local and even regional hydroclimate variability at various timescales the dripwaters fed by fracture flows e g m 5 and m 6 are highly sensitive to monthly to seasonal rainfall and thus the δ13c of speleothem formed by this type of drip should be able to record hydroclimate variability at short timescales such as droughts and floods events this study li and li 2018 li et al 2021a zhang et al 2017 smaller amplitudes of dripwater δ13cdic variation are found at drips fed by seepage flows that have longer residence time within the aquifer for speleothems formed by this type of dripwaters annual to inter annual and maybe longer time scale hydroclimatic change could be retrieved by the δ13c proxy this study li et al 2021a zhang et al 2017 due to such spatially heterogeneous signature of δ13c we suggest that careful selection of speleothem sampling sites and conducting monitoring of dripwater are useful for successful hydroclimatic reconstruction based on speleothem δ13c in monsoonal china anti phased monsoonal precipitation is reconstructed based on dripwater δ13cdic records from southern e g the maomaotou big cave and panlong cave guilin and northern china e g the jiguan cave this is in line with the spatial pattern of monsoonal precipitation across east asia which is generally associated with the migration of rain belt and shifts in its mean position driven by the asian summer monsoon variability ding et al 2008 in the region of guilin south china the variation of dripwater δ13cdic values are synchronous with that of dripwater δ18o over inter annual timescale this study yin et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 we thus infer that both δ13c and δ18o of speleothems from this region are reliable proxies of monsoonal precipitation because the δ18o is more sensitive to the variability of summer monsoon intensity seasonal precipitation and moisture sources in the broad easm region hu et al 2019 yin et al 2020 the speleothem δ13c combined with trace element ratios would provide additional information on variability of summer monsoon precipitation besides the monsoonal rainfall variability changes of local land cover and vegetation for example deforestation and the occurrence of rocky desertification caused by human activities could also exert great influences on the δ13c of speleothems yin et al 2017a 2021 6 conclusions our data of a five year monitoring of dripwaters in the maomaotou big cave south china show that both dripwater δ13cdic and hydrochemical compositions exhibit great spatiotemporal variations which is related to the strong heterogeneity and dynamics of karst hydrosystems detailed data analyses revealed that the dripwater δ13cdic is principally controlled by water co2 rock interactions in association with coupled hydrological and biological vegetation and soil processes in particular the hydrological dynamics plays an important role in the transport of soil co2 which modulate the variation of dripwater δ13cdic thus the dripwater δ13cdic is sensitively responding to changes in local rainfall at monthly to annual timescales comparisons of the dripwater δ13cdic records with local climate further showed that the change of summer monsoonal rainfall particularly the aso precipitation significantly influences the annual mean δ13cdic value of dripwaters in caves of monsoonal china anti phased monsoonal precipitation variation between northern and southern china are reconstructed by dripwater δ13cdic records which suggests that the δ13c of dripwater and thus speleothems could be interpreted to reflect changes of regional monsoonal precipitation in east asia over inter annual and maybe longer timescales because of the complex hydrological process within the aquifer above the cave conducting monitoring of dripwater above interested speleothems is of great importance for the reconstruction of hydroclimatic change based on speleothem δ13c and other geochemical proxies credit authorship

4128,stable carbon isotopic composition δ13c of speleothems has often been recognized as a proxy of vegetation and soil processes in many climatic regimes in monsoonal regions the speleothem δ13c records are thought to be able to document changes in local and or regional precipitation as well due to the complexity of carbon isotopic evolution within heterogeneous karst aquifers accurate interpretations of this proxy are challenging it is essential to carry out detailed monitoring of cave dripwater δ13cdic to disentangle various processes governing carbon isotopic evolution and decipher the hydroclimatic constraints here we reported the results of a five year monitoring of the δ13cdic as well as hydrochemical compositions of dripwaters in the maomaotou big cave guilin south china great spatiotemporal variations in the dripwater δ13cdic values were observed i seepage flow fed drips commonly had lower δ13cdic values with smaller temporal variation ii the lowest δ13cdic values were found at fracture fed drips that had a large supply of soil co2 whereas the fracture fed drips with less episodic co2 recharge had much more positive δ13cdic iii the δ13cdic exhibits remarkable season changes particularly at fracture fed drips where higher δ13cdic values were observed in winter seasons and iv an increasing trend in mean value of δ13cdic at individual sites during 2015 2019 was found both hydrochemical and isotopic analyses revealed that the dripwater δ13cdic is mainly controlled by spatiotemporal variations in water co2 rock interactions in association with hydrological processes coupled with soil co2 dynamics which are closely linked to changes in local rainfall at monthly to annual timescales prior calcite precipitation pcp along the flow path above the cave could also affect the δ13cdic of fracture fed dripwaters in dry periods comparisons of the dripwater δ13cdic records with local climate showed that the change of summer monsoonal rainfall particularly the august september october precipitation significantly influences the annual mean δ13cdic value of dripwaters in caves of south china further comparison analyses of dripwater δ13cdic records from both southern and northern china suggested that variations of dripwater δ13cdic could reflect changes of regional monsoonal precipitation over inter annual and maybe decadal timescale this demonstrates that the δ13c of speleothems if precipitated at isotopic equilibrium and not greatly influenced by the co2 degassing is likely to be a valuable proxy of monsoon rainfall variability across east asia keywords heterogeneous karst aquifers water co2 rock interactions prior calcite precipitation hydrological dynamics monsoonal rainfall 1 introduction speleothems have been demonstrated to be one of excellent archives for the reconstruction of hemispheric or global climate cheng et al 2016 wang et al 2001 yuan et al 2004 by using precisely dated and high resolution stalagmite δ18o records from monsoonal china for example cheng et al 2016 successfully reconstructed the history of asian summer monsoon over the past 640 000 years besides δ18o speleothem δ13c has also been considered as one of important proxies of climate and environmental change previous studies have used it to reconstruct changes of air temperature in the mediterranean region martín chivelet et al 2011 atmospheric precipitation in monsoonal regions li et al 2020 novello et al 2021 as well as local vegetation dorale et al 1992 1998 yin et al 2017a yin et al 2019 compared to the δ18o proxy that has been recently argued to mainly reflect the precipitation δ18o rather than rainfall amount in east asia cai et al 2018 hu et al 2019 speleothem δ13c records are found to be able to provide additional information on variability in precipitation at local and regional scales e g li and li 2018 li et al 2021a because of the complex carbon isotopic evolution within heterogeneous karst aquifers however the use of speleothem δ13c as a reliable climatic proxy is challenging a number of studies have revealed that the speleothem δ13c is affected by various factors such as air temperature and rainfall fohlmeister et al 2020 li and li 2018 meyer et al 2014 vegetation cover baldini et al 2005 dorale et al 1992 1998 lyu et al 2020 soil process baker et al 1997 genty et al 2003

that the vegetation and soil processes above the cave has a major control on the δ13c of speleothems worldwide in regions under the influence of summer monsoon the δ13c of speleothems has been found to be strongly modulated by monsoonal precipitation as well li and li 2018 li et al 2021a yin et al 2019 due to the influence of various local processes however the speleothem δ13c records from different caves in the same region or even at different drip sites in the same cave often generate differed information on climatic and environmental change thus it is essential to disentangle these various processes governing the speleothem δ13c and assess their relative importance if the speleothems formed at isotopic equilibrium their δ13c is mainly dependent on the carbon isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic of cave dripwaters owing to strong heterogeneity and dynamics of karst hydrosystems great spatiotemporal variations of dripwater δ13cdic are often observed a study of dripwater monitoring in panlong cave guilin south china reported that the δ13cdic values of seepage flow fed drips that have higher drip rate commonly exhibited a marked decreasing trend with smaller amplitude of variation during 2010 2015 whereas larger amplitude and no obvious trend of variations in dripwater δ13cdic were observed at extremely slow seepage drips during the same time period zhang et al 2017 furthermore results of artificial trace test in another cave the xiaoyan cave guilin showed that the dripwater can be recharged by both fast fracture flow and slow seepage flow and the fast flow could accounts for 90 of the total dripwater discharge in rainy seasons while the slow flow is the main recharge in dry seasons yin et al 2017b such heterogeneity of hydrological process over space and time would inevitably result in great spatiotemporal variations in water co2 rock interactions within the aquifer and thus the dripwaters δ13cdic to date the understanding of how the heterogeneous hydrogeological processes influence the dripwater δ13cdic is still limited it is necessary to conduct long term monitoring of different types of drips to gain more insights into the spatiotemporal variation of dripwater δ13cdic and the climatic and environmental constraints in this study we conducted a five year monitoring of hydrochemical compositions and δ13cdic of dripwaters in maomaotou big cave guilin south china that is located in the domain of the east asian summer monsoon easm in order to characterize the spatiotemporal variations of dripwater δ13cdic and elucidate various processes influencing the δ13cdic in particular different types of dripwater were investigated so as to carefully explore the control of coupled hydrological and biogeochemical processes on dripwater δ13cdic by comparing with data of local and regional climate the temporal variation of dripwater δ13cdic from the maomaotou big cave along with other caves in monsoonal china in response to changes of local or regional precipitation at monthly seasonal and annual timescales were discussed which in turn helping in deciphering the hydroclimatic significance of the δ13cdic of dripwater the study will lay a foundation for the reconstruction of monsoonal precipitation based on the δ13c of speleothems from east asia 2 the study site the maomaotou big cave is located in the northwest of guilin city guangxi south china fig 1 a it lies on the middle slope of the maomaotou mountain in which another three caves including reed flute cave feisi cave and the through cave are found too these four caves are developed on thick massive devonian limestones that are intercalated with cretaceous breccia and tectonically accommodated by two local faults that are nne and nww trending respectively deng et al 1988 the maomaotou big cave is the longest one with a length of 975 m it is about 5 30 m wide and 5 25 m high the elevation of the cave entrance is 209 m above sea level a s l about 50 m above the local floodplain in peak forest karst about 100 200 m of highly karstified host carbonate rocks is overlying the cave at the surface soil cover is usually 1 m and often absent in the steepest area of the mountain the vegetation is dominated by shrubs and vines fig 1b abundant speleothems such as stalagmites stalactites columns and flowstones are found inside the cave the climate in the region of guilin is currently dominated by the asian summer monsoon with humid hot summer and short mild winter the annual mean air temperature is 19 1 c and annual mean precipitation is 1897 mm 70 of the total annual rainfall occurs during the summer season between april and september in winter seasons the monsoonal precipitation decreases significantly and the occurrence of rainfall in this season is associated with continental cold fronts yin et al 2020 seasonal to inter annual variations of monsoonal rainfall in this region are observed and climatic anomalies often occur due to the change of atmospheric oceanic circulation yin et al 2020 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analytical methods six drip sites in the maomaotou big cave were chosen for monitoring and sampling see their locations in fig 1c the drips are discharged at the tip of stalactites or soda straw on the cave ceiling under the drips there are stalagmites the dripwaters were sampled in monthly or seasonal strategies from december 2014 to december 2019 when sampling dripwaters a hand held meter smart sensor as847 was used to measure air temperature and relative humidity rh in the cave with precisions of 1 c and 3 respectively also the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in cave was measured using a hand held co2 meter testo 535 germany rang 0 9999 ppm precision 50 ppm at individual sites the drip rates were determined by manual measurement of the volume of dripwater in a definite time dripwaters were collected manually using a raingauge like bucket water temperature ph and electric conductivity ec were immediately measured using a portable wtw multi 3430 multi parameter meter precisions 0 03 for ph 0 1 c for temperature and 1 μs cm for ec also concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in water were determined using the calcium and alkalinity test kits mcolortest merck kgaa germany with a precision of 2 mg l and 0 1 mmol l respectively water samples were placed in pre cleaned polyethylene bottles in different size 15 ml for the analysis of δ13cdic and 60 ml and 120 ml for cation and anion analyses respectively 2 3 drops of saturated hgcl2 were added to the sample for δ13c analysis to avoid any influence of microbial activity and then the bottle for δ13cdic analyses was tightly capped without headspace and stored at 4 c before measurement ultrapure hno3 1 1 was

between 1948 and 2019 obtained from the ncep ncar re analysis data sets kalnay et al 1996 and the grid analysis and display system grads 4 results 4 1 cave climate the maomaotou big cave had a relatively stable air temperature throughout the year during the investigation period it was 18 8 0 4 c in the inner section of the cave while 18 0 1 1 c at sites close to the entrance the rh was 96 0 5 3 in the outer section and 98 2 2 6 in the inner section cave air pco2 ranged from 438 to 1374 ppm and tended to be higher between june and october but lower from november to the next may 4 2 drip rate drip rates at the monitoring sites in the cave exhibited great spatiotemporal variations table 1 drips m 2 m 3 and m 5 had relatively lower drip rate mostly 10 ml min while drips m 1 m 6 and m 7 had higher drip rates mostly 15 ml l up to 90 ml min at drip m 6 temporally smaller variations of drip rate were observed at drips m 1 m 2 and m 3 with relative standard deviation rsd of 50 and according to fairchild et al 2006 these drips can thus be identified as seepage drips fed by micro fracture flows and percolated water through porous limestone matrix in contrast larger temporal variations of drip rate rsd 75 were observed at drips m 5 m 6 and m 7 an indicative of the recharge of fast fissure flows in particular the drip m 7 was only active after heavy rainfall events implying that the water flows through larger fractures at all drip sites higher drip rates commonly occurred in the rainy season from april may to august september while lower drip rates in the dry winter season such seasonal variations of flow rate were particularly evident for drip m 6 4 3 hydrochemical compositions the seepage drips incl m 1 m 2 and m 3 had similar water temperature to each other about 18 6 c with small variations table 1 in contrast larger variations of water temperature were observed at the fracture fed drips incl m 5 m 6 and m 7 at drip m 6 the water temperature varied greatly from 14 8 to 24 3 c in the investigated period generally the water temperature of these fracture fed drips changed synchronously with the drip rate the ph values of all seepage drips were similar to each other whereas distinct ph values were shown for the fracture fed drips the highest values at m 5 8 2 the lowest values at m 6 7 7 table 1 normally relatively higher dripwater ph values were observed in the dry winter season compared with that in rainy summer season fig 2 the water chemistry of all dripwaters from the cave was characterized by the dominance of ca2 and hco3 accounting for 95 and 80 of the total concentrations of cations and anions respectively the k na mg2 no3 so4 2 and cl were present at a very low level great spatiotemporal variations were observed for the chemical compositions of dripwater table 1 in general all seepage drips had roughly similar chemical compositions to each other for the fracture fed drips lower ec ca2 and hco3 concentrations and pco2 but higher mg ca and sr ca molar ratios were found at m 5 and m 7 in contrast the drip m 6 had the highest ec ca2 and hco3 concentrations and pco2 but the lowest mg ca and sr ca molar ratios a very large variation of the pco2 in water was also observed at drip m 6 all the dripwaters were saturated with respect to calcite as shown by elevated sic 0 28 0 87 table 1 a slightly larger variation of sic could be found at the fracture fed drips temporally the drips m 5 and m 6 had higher ec and concentration of ca2 and hco3 in the summer season between april may and august september and lower ec ca2 and hco3 concentration in the winter season fig 2 less significant seasonal variations of these chemical compositions were found at the seepage drips at inter annual scale there was an increasing trend for dripwater ph value but a decreasing trend for ec ca2 and hco3 concentrations observed at all drip sites during the monitoring period of december 2014 to december 2019 fig 2 4 4 δ13cdic the δ13cdic values of dripwaters from the maomaotou big cave ranged from 16 3 to 3 1 with an average of 12 6 similar to the hydrochemical compositions the dripwater δ13cdic values also displayed great spatiotemporal variations table 1 fig 2 the most depleted δ13cdic value was observed at site m 6 15 2 0 8 and the most enriched δ13cdic at site m 5 7 5 2 4 the lowest δ13cdic value 16 3 was observed at drip m 6 in august 2016 and the highest δ13cdic 3 1 at m 5 in december 2019 the amplitudes of variation in δ13cdic values varied at different drip sites 2 for individual seepage drips m 1 m 2 and m 3 and 3 5 to 8 1 for the fracture fed drips m 5 m 6 and m 7 at individual drip sites the dripwater δ13cdic values commonly showed marked seasonal variations fig 2 generally lower dripwater δ13cdic values tended to be observed in the period between april may and october while higher values from november to the next march april nevertheless less enriched dripwater δ13cdic occurred in the winter season of 2015 2016 fig 2 within the period of summer season slightly more enriched dripwater δ13cdic was also found in some months for example late july and august of both 2018 and 2019 at most drip sites obvious spatial difference in the temporal variation of δ13cdic among different drips was observed smaller variation for the seepage drips while larger enrichment for the fracture fed drips between august and december 2019 at inter annual scale an enriching trend of dripwater δ13cdic along with increasing ph but decreasing ec ca2 and hco3 concentration was observed at individual sites in the monitoring period from december 2014 to december 2019 fig 2 5 discussion 5 1 processes governing dripwater δ13cdic 5 1 1 water co2 rock interactions in karst catchments the infiltrating meteoric water dissolves plenty of soil co2 and delivers them into the carbonate aquifer the carbonic acids generated by soil co2 dissolution in water are then largely involved in the dissolution of carbonate minerals both calcite and dolomite as a result a great amount of ca2 and dic are produced and transported by groundwater in general the soil co2 has depleted δ13c e g about 23 in the region of guilin south china with vegetation dominated by c3 plants cao et al 2011 pan et al 2002 as the carbonate dissolution proceeds the δ13c can evolve to more enriched value and the degree of the isotopic enrichment depends on whether the system with respect to co2 is open or closed clark and fritz 1997 according to theoretical modeling the open system dissolution of carbonate i e with a constant supply of soil co2 at 19 c would yield a δ13cdic value of 16 at calcite saturation if using δ13c values of 23 and 0 for local soil co2 and limestones respectively for the closed system in which the soil co2 is not immediately replenished a value around 12 would be attained in the heterogeneous karst aquifers both open and closed system conditions exist and could change over space and time which leads to great spatiotemporal variations in δ13cdic of groundwater fohlmeister et al 2020 owen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 theoretically the groundwater would have lower ph values but higher concentrations of ca2 and dic when the carbonate dissolution occurs under open system conditions whereas higher ph values but lower concentrations of ca2 and dic would be obtained in closed systems with respect to soil co2 dreybrodt and scholz 2011 fohlmeister et al 2020 owen et al 2018 in the maomaotou big cave dripwater at site m 6 had the lowest ph value 7 7 and the highest pco2 10 2 2 atm and ca2 concentration 3 mmol l such geochemical signatures suggest that the dissolution of carbonate is likely to occur under conditions towards an open system thus the dripwater had more depleted δ13c about 15 2 close to the theoretical value of 16 fig 3 in contrast the lowest pco2 10 2 8 atm and ca2 concentrations 1 6 mmol l and 1 7 mmol l respectively were observed at sites m 5 and m 7 an indicative of closed system condition as a result of closed system dissolution more positive dripwater δ13cdic values were yielded fig 3 compared with these three drips seepage drips m 1 m 2 and m 3 had intermediate pco2 10 2 5 10 2 4 atm and ca2 concentrations 2 2 2 5 mmol l implying that the systems for carbonate dissolution are partially open i e mixed open closed dreybrodt and scholz 2011 in this case intermediate δ13cdic values were produced ranging from 12 to 16 fig 3 the spatial variations in the condition for water co2 carboante interactions are mainly related to the heterogeneity of flow path and water movement across the soil layer epikarst to the lower vadose zone fairchild and baker 2012 tooth and fairchild 2003 for the drips fed by fracture flows like the m 7 that is only active after heavy rainfall the recharge of soil co2 to the system might be episodic due to fast movement of infiltrated water the co2 is not immediately replenished at lower levels of the aquifer thereby favoring the closed system dissolution of carbonate similar condition probably exists along the flow path for the drip m 5 although the drip m 6 is recharged by fracture flow both hydrochemical and isotopic signatures show the behavior of open system carbonate dissolution the reason might be that there is thicker soil cover and denser vegetation in the recharge area of the fracture flows and larger amounts of soil co2 are available because of the enhanced transport of infiltrating water this can be proved by the higher pco2 in the dripwater at this site table 1 since the drips m 1 m 2 and m 3 are mainly fed by slow diffusive flows through porous limestone matrix and micro fractures well mixing and storage of soil co2 and water flows likely take place within the aquifer providing a condition of mixed open closed system for carbonate dissolution 5 1 2 vegetation and soil activities the water co2 rock interactions within karst aquifers can be temporally regulated by vegetation and soil activities which control the soil co2 production i e soil pco2 in the monsoonal region of china higher soil pco2 are produced between june and october as the increase in both temperature and moisture enhances biological productivity and thus root respiration and microbial activities in soil zone while lower soil pco2 is observed in winter seasons when the soil respiration rate is low cao et al 2020 liu et al 2007 2010 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 2021 accordingly larger supply of soil co2 is available and thus carbonate dissolution occurs under more open system conditions during the summer season this is demonstrated by increased air pco2 in the cave too in addition more depleted δ13c values of soil co2 are often observed in summer cao et al 2011 pan et al 2002 the dripwater δ13cdic in the maomaotou big cave showed marked seasonal variations lower values between april may and october but higher values in the winter season fig 2 which was quite consistent with seasonal changes in both soil pco2 and the δ13c of soil co2 such variations are typical of many cave dripwaters as well as other types of karst groundwater in monsoonal china cao et al 2020 li and li 2018 li et al 2021a liu et al 2007 wang et al 2020 2021 zhao et al 2015 5 1 3 hydrological dynamics besides the influence of soil processes hydrological dynamics is also one of important processes governing the water co2 rock interactions previous studies have revealed that enhanced and more frequent meteoric recharge could dissolve and deliver constant and larger amount of co2 from soil into epikarst and the lower vadose zone causing more open system conditions for carbonate dissolution and thus lower dripwater δ13cdic values conversely reduced water recharge results in more closed system dissolution and higher δ13cdic values dreybrodt and scholz 2011 li and li 2018 li et al 2021a in particular enriched δ13cdic values are often observed during drought events due to the lack of sufficient supply of water and soil co2 large variations of both drip rate and δ13cdic were observed at the fracture fed drip m 5 in the maomaotou big cave fig 4 a and there was a significantly correlation between them with a coefficient r of 0 68 also significant correlations between δ13cdic and indicators of the intensity of carbonate dissolution e g δ13cdic vs ec r 0 68 δ13cdic vs ca2 r 0 74 δ13cdic vs hco3 0 76 were found hence we infer that the hydrological processes play an important role in regulating the temporal variation of dripwater δ13cdic for the seepage drips like the m 3 smaller variations in drip rate were shown but slightly higher drip rates between april and august could be still found fig 4b during this period slightly elevated dripwater δ13cdic values were shown before the decline of them the reason might be that the enhanced water infiltration and hydraulic head caused by increasing rainfall lead to the release of waters previously stored in the aquifer which has more positive δ13cdic first the peaks of depleted δ13cdic values often lagged behind the drip rate by 1 3 months which is attributed to the longer residence time of seepage flows up to half a year as revealed by data of dripwater δ18o from these sites yin et al 2020 5 1 4 prior calcite precipitation pcp potential co2 degassing and pcp along the flow path could affect the dripwater δ13cdic too fairchild and treble 2009 since the percolation water is commonly rich in co2 i e high pco2 in water degassing of co2 are prone to occur when the water flows become in contact with air spaces within the aquifer first of all the physically dissolved aqueous co2 would escape driven by molecular diffusion causing the ph and sic to rise dreybrodt and scholz 2011 if the sic reaches or exceeds the critical threshold for calcite precipitation there would be the occurrence of pcp both the co2 degassing and pcp processes could lead to carbon isotopic fractionation to various degrees according to the theory of isotopic fractionation the degassing of aqueous co2 results in only a small isotope enrichment about 1 1 while the calcite precipitation and associated co2 degassing could cause larger 13c enrichment up to 10 20 hansen et al 2019 previous studies found that the influence of co2 degassing should be minor when the flow movement is fast dreybrodt and romanov 2016 hansen et al 2019 however our study shows that the fracture fed drips m 5 and m 7 had higher ph 8 0 indicating the occurrence of co2 degassing higher sic 0 5 was attained at these drips all these observations suggest that there are possibly co2 degassing and pcp occurred before the water arrives in the cave data of dripwater δ13cdic at these two sites are mostly off the modeling line of closed system carbonate dissolution and there is a negative correlation between δ13cdic values and ca2 concentrations fig 3 showing an evidence of pcp effects particularly larger 13c enrichment was found in dry seasons when the water movement was slower and there was longer time for co2 degassing and pcp to occur no significant 13c enrichment was found at seepage drips including m 1 m 2 and m 3 implying less influence of pcp processes along the flow path trace elemental ratios such as mg ca and sr ca molar ratios can be used as a useful tool to identify the pcp influences fairchild and baker 2012 fairchild et al 2000 li et al 2021b the seepage drips had small amplitudes of variation in trace elemental ratios and there is no significant correlation between δ13cdic and mg ca and sr ca molar ratios fig 4b again indicating that the pcp has minor impacts on the dripwater δ13cdic however larger amplitudes of variations and positive correlations between dripwater δ13cdic and mg ca and sr ca molar ratios were found for the fracture fed drips e g at m 5 mg ca r 0 75 1000 sr ca r 0 63 fig 4a this further indicates the pcp process has likely affected the δ13cdic of fracture fed drips especially in the dry periods 5 1 5 in cave processes when the dripwater arrives at the ceiling of cave and is dwelling on the stalactites or soda straw the co2 degassing could easily take place due to the great gradient between the pco2 in dripwater and the pco2 in cave atmosphere this phenomenon appears to be evident when the drip rate is very low as a result calcite precipitation may occur before dripping down causing the dripwater δ13cdic to be enriched laboratory experiments and theoretical simulation suggest that the diffusive degassing of aqueous co2 only needs 2 s up to 30 s for a thin film water 0 01 0 04 cm thick while the isotopic equilibrium during the process of calcite precipitation needs longer time usually ranging between 2000 s and 250 s for a 0 01 cm thick layer of water at t 0 c and 25 c respectively dreybrodt 2019 hansen et al 2013 hendy 1971 if the drip interval is longer than the total time of degassing and precipitation needed kinetic isotopic fractionation will occur in the maomaotou big cave all the monitoring drips had high drip rate 3 drops min and thus the influence of isotopic fractionation caused by calcite precipitation at the cave ceiling on dripwater δ13cdic should be minor cave climates such cave air temperature humidity and ventilation can affect the co2 degassing and calcite precipitation in caves it was reported that better cave ventilation observed in winter could enhance the degassing of co2 in dripwater and calcite precipitation and thus result in elevated dripwater speleothem δ13c breitenbach et al 2015 vieten et al 2016 the air temperature and rh in the middle and inner sections of the maomaotou big cave exhibited small variations 2 c for air temperature and 10 for the rh so less influence of in cave process on the dripwater δ13cdic is expected in contrast larger amplitudes of variations in air temperature 3 4 c and rh 16 20 were observed at both sites m 5 and m 6 which are located near the cave entrance however the δ13cdic variations at these two sites showed distinct relationship with changes of cave conditions at the m 5 site with lower drip rate more significant correlation between dripwater δ13cdic and air temperature r 0 54 rh r 0 51 and co2 r 0 35 was found however there was no significant correlation at drip m 6 which had higher drip rate about 30 6 ml min these findings may suggest that cave environments could have an effect on the dripwater δ13cdic but not serious especially for the drips with high discharge rate 5 2 hydroclimatic control on dripwater δ13cdic based on the abovementioned analyses of individual processes governing the dripwater δ13cdic we see that the dripwater δ13cdic is principally controlled by water co2 rock interactions in association with coupled processes of soil activity and hydrological dynamics in particular the hydrological process plays an important role in the delivery of soil co2 and larger amount of soil co2 can be transported into the aquifer by enhanced water flow which resulting in stronger dissolution of carbonate and more depleted dripwater δ13cdic under conditions with reduced flow rate co2 degassing and pcp processes is likely to occur along the flow path causing the dripwater δ13cdic to be enriched such opposite effects of enhanced water co2 rock interactions in wet periods and stronger pcp in dry periods lead to large temporal variations in dripwater δ13cdic as also revealed by other studies of dripwaters in caves from monsoonal china li and li et al 2018 li et al 2021a zhang et al 2017 therefore the dripwater δ13cdic is supposed to be sensitively responding to rainfall driven water recharge and thus can be identified as a potential proxy of hydroclimatic change in this section we try to further explore the hydroclimatic control on dripwater δ13cdic by comparing the δ13cdic record of the maomaotou big cave with local and regional climate mainly monsoonal rainfall at intraseasonal to inter annual timescales 5 2 1 seasonal scale because of the easm influence the climate in subtropical regions of south china is characterized by seasonally synchronous variations of air temperature and precipitation such seasonal climate change exerts great impacts on soil respiration rate water recharge and water co2 rock interactions resulting in great seasonal variation in the δ13cdic of groundwater within the karst aquifers li et al 2011a 2011b li and li 2018 liu et al 2007 wang et al 2020 at individual drip sites in the maomaotou big cave depleted δ13cdic values were observed in wet summer seasons while enriched δ13cdic values in dry winter seasons except that of 2015 2016 fig 5 this seasonal variation was generally consistent with changes in local air temperature and rainfall relatively depleted δ13cdic values were also observed in the period from november 2015 to april 2016 which might be related to abnormally higher precipitation in autumn and winter of 2015 about twice higher than the ordinary year fig 4 the positive precipitation anomaly is inferred to be linked to the strong el niño conditions occurred in 2015 yin et al 2020 slightly less depleted δ13cdic was sometimes observed at individual sites except drips m 5 and m 7 during the summer season for example in late july and august of both 2018 and 2019 when relatively less precipitation occurred fig 5 the reduced rainfall in the region of guilin is attributed to the fact that the monsoonal rain belt in east asia has migrated to northern china in late july and august driven by the expansion of asian summer monsoon ding et al 2008 meanwhile the south china is controlled by the west pacific subtropical high wpsh in these months resulting in higher air temperature but less rainfall dry conditions in july august of both years of 2018 and 2019 are shown by local drought index which shifts from positive to negative in the region of guilin fig 5 when the drought happens both soil respiration rate and water infiltration are likely to decline to some degrees and thus slightly weakened water rock interactions and more enriched dripwater δ13cdic occur cook and orchard 2008 zhou et al 2019 in addition higher co2 degassing and pcp could take place in drought events elevating the δ13cdic values and trace element ratios of dripwater fig 4 after the droughts in july and august the dripwater δ13cdic could become depleted again or more enriched depending on the precipitation in the following months fig 5 for example the precipitation data show that about 127 mm rainfall occurred in september 2018 but only 13 mm in september 2019 accordingly it can be seen that the δ13cdic of fracture fed drips like drips m 5 and m 6 became depleted in september 2018 again but got more enriched in september 2019 at seepage drips the δ13cdic values decreased back to the average level and varied with small amplitudes after october the dripwater δ13cdic values were enriched as both soil pco2 and rainfall greatly declined especially at fracture fed drip sites figs 4 and 5 5 2 2 inter annual scale during the monitoring period from december 2014 to december 2019 more depleted dripwater δ13cdic was observed in summer seasons of 2017 and 2019 corresponding to larger amount of monsoonal precipitation occurred in the region of guilin fig 5 in summer of 2018 however less rainfall occurred and there was less depletion in dripwater δ13cdic this suggests that the annual variation of summer monsoonal precipitation has an important influence on the cave dripwater δ13cdic an overall decreasing trend of dripwater ec ca2 and hco3 concentrations but an enriching trend of average δ13cdic were found at all drip sites in the maomaotou big cave during 2015 2019 figs 2 and 6 such trends were particularly evident at drips m 3 and m 6 where stronger water co2 rock interactions occurred along the flow path as suggested by the geochemical data given the close correlation between dripwater δ13cdic and hydrological conditions the increasing average δ13cdic values may suggest there was a decreasing trend in local precipitation however climate data show that the annual precipitation in the region of guilin did not show any obvious trends between 2015 and 2019 further analyses also show that there was no trend in the variation of local rainfall in april may june july amjj at the inter annual scale as well surprisingly we find that the august september october aso rainfall exhibited a decreasing trend from 2015 to 2019 fig 6 the analysis of integrated vapor flux reveals that the mean value of amjj vapor flux in the region of guilin between 2015 and 2019 was similar to that between 1948 and 2019 whereas there was a distinct difference of the mean value of the aso vapor flux between periods of 2015 2019 and 1948 2019 existed fig 7 this may suggest that the variation of aso precipitation could greatly affect the annual change of monsoonal rainfall in monsoonal regions of china soil respiration rate and thus soil pco2 are higher in the period from july to october cao et al 2005 2011 li and li 2018 li et al 2021a since the water co2 rock interactions are controlled by coupled hydrological and biological soil processes the change of aso precipitation should have a great influence on the annual mean values of dripwater δ13cdic under conditions with higher aso rainfall larger amount of soil co2 could be continuously transported into the aquifer and thus stronger water co2 rock interactions occur and more depleted dripwater δ13cdic is yielded e g abnormal rainfall in 2015 particularly the increased soil co2 supply would have a prolonged effect on δ13cdic of seepage drips which have the longer residence time with the decrease of aso precipitation however an overall annual decrease in mean values of ec ca2 hco3 and but increase in the dripwater δ13cdic occurred this increasing trend of dripwater δ13cdic values is also synchronous with the increase in the annual mean value of dripwater δ18o in the maomaotou big cave in 2015 2019 which indicating a weakening of easm yin et al 2020 for better understanding the control of the monsoonal rainfall on the inter annual variation of dripwater δ13cdic we compared the dripwater δ13cdic record of maomaotou big cave with that of jiguan cave north central china during 2015 2019 li et al 2021a differed from the record of maomaotou big cave the δ13cdic values of dripwaters from the jiguan cave exhibited an overall decreasing trend fig 6 this should imply an increase in local precipitation but it contradicts the fact of a decreasing trend in the local annual precipitation as shown by meteorological data from the region of the jiguan cave in 2015 2019 similar to the annual precipitation the local amjj rainfall also displayed a decreasing trend but an increasing trend of local aso rainfall is found which is consistent with the decreasing trend of dripwater δ13cdic values from the jiguan cave indeed the aso rainfall represents the majority of summer monsoonal precipitation as the rain belt has migrated to the northern china another monitoring study of dripwater δ13cdic in the panlong cave guilin south china showed that there was a decreasing trend of dripwater δ13cdic values but increasing trends in ec ca2 and hco3 during 2010 2015 in response to increased local aso rainfall fig 6 zhang et al 2017 by contrast an enriching trend of dripwater δ13cdic was observed in the jiguan cave during this period li et al 2021a all these observations support our speculations that there is possibly a great control of the local aso rainfall on the annual mean values of dripwater δ13cdic by comparing the dripwater δ13cdic records of both northern china e g the jiguan cave and southern china e g the maomaotou big cave and panlong cave with the east asian summer monsoon index easmi an indicator of summer monsoon intensity li and zeng 2002 fig 6 we further find that with the increase of easmi during 2015 2019 the aso rainfall was increasing in northern china but decreasing in southern china in contrast the opposite pattern was found for the aso rainfall variation from 2010 to 2014 when the easmi was declining such spatial difference in the aso rainfall between north central and southern china is consistent with the spatial pattern of summer monsoonal rainfall variation across east asia i strong easm phases would lead to the northward migration of average position of rain belt resulting in more monsoonal precipitation in northern china but decreased precipitation occurring between august and october in southern china and ii during weakened easm phases the average position of rain belt migrate southwards causing less monsoonal precipitation in northern china but increased precipitation in all months of the summer season in southern china this spatial difference in monsoonal precipitation is described as a pattern of wet northern but dry southern dry northern but dry southern in monsoonal china ding et al 2008 these findings suggest that the variations of dripwater δ13cdic may have the potential to be a proxy of changes of regional monsoonal precipitation at inter annual scale and maybe decadal timescales as well 5 3 implications for the study of speleothem δ13c when calcite precipitation occurs under an isotopically equilibrium condition in cave the δ13c of speleothems is principally determined by the dripwater δ13cdic signatures li et al 2021a mattey et al 2008 our unpublished data show that there is only a small difference between dripwater δ13cdic values and the δ13c values of farmed calcite precipitates under individual drips from the maomaotou big cave 1 6 except m 5 which is similar to many other studies el shenawy et al 2020 levitt et al 2018 romanek et al 1992 li et al 2021a this indicates that the speleothem is precipitated approximately under isotope equilibrium in cave processes for example temperature driven cave ventilation could cause larger isotopic fractionation at sites that are located near the cave entrance and has relatively lower drip rate especially during dry winter seasons e g up to 3 4 at drip m 5 nevertheless less influence of cave ventilation on the δ13c of speleothem that formed by drips with high drip rate e g at m 6 are found since the monsoonal rainfall has been recognized to be the main control of cave dripwater δ13cdic the speleothem δ13c records from monsoonal china can be inferred to be able to provide an amount of information of local and even regional hydroclimate variability at various timescales the dripwaters fed by fracture flows e g m 5 and m 6 are highly sensitive to monthly to seasonal rainfall and thus the δ13c of speleothem formed by this type of drip should be able to record hydroclimate variability at short timescales such as droughts and floods events this study li and li 2018 li et al 2021a zhang et al 2017 smaller amplitudes of dripwater δ13cdic variation are found at drips fed by seepage flows that have longer residence time within the aquifer for speleothems formed by this type of dripwaters annual to inter annual and maybe longer time scale hydroclimatic change could be retrieved by the δ13c proxy this study li et al 2021a zhang et al 2017 due to such spatially heterogeneous signature of δ13c we suggest that careful selection of speleothem sampling sites and conducting monitoring of dripwater are useful for successful hydroclimatic reconstruction based on speleothem δ13c in monsoonal china anti phased monsoonal precipitation is reconstructed based on dripwater δ13cdic records from southern e g the maomaotou big cave and panlong cave guilin and northern china e g the jiguan cave this is in line with the spatial pattern of monsoonal precipitation across east asia which is generally associated with the migration of rain belt and shifts in its mean position driven by the asian summer monsoon variability ding et al 2008 in the region of guilin south china the variation of dripwater δ13cdic values are synchronous with that of dripwater δ18o over inter annual timescale this study yin et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 we thus infer that both δ13c and δ18o of speleothems from this region are reliable proxies of monsoonal precipitation because the δ18o is more sensitive to the variability of summer monsoon intensity seasonal precipitation and moisture sources in the broad easm region hu et al 2019 yin et al 2020 the speleothem δ13c combined with trace element ratios would provide additional information on variability of summer monsoon precipitation besides the monsoonal rainfall variability changes of local land cover and vegetation for example deforestation and the occurrence of rocky desertification caused by human activities could also exert great influences on the δ13c of speleothems yin et al 2017a 2021 6 conclusions our data of a five year monitoring of dripwaters in the maomaotou big cave south china show that both dripwater δ13cdic and hydrochemical compositions exhibit great spatiotemporal variations which is related to the strong heterogeneity and dynamics of karst hydrosystems detailed data analyses revealed that the dripwater δ13cdic is principally controlled by water co2 rock interactions in association with coupled hydrological and biological vegetation and soil processes in particular the hydrological dynamics plays an important role in the transport of soil co2 which modulate the variation of dripwater δ13cdic thus the dripwater δ13cdic is sensitively responding to changes in local rainfall at monthly to annual timescales comparisons of the dripwater δ13cdic records with local climate further showed that the change of summer monsoonal rainfall particularly the aso precipitation significantly influences the annual mean δ13cdic value of dripwaters in caves of monsoonal china anti phased monsoonal precipitation variation between northern and southern china are reconstructed by dripwater δ13cdic records which suggests that the δ13c of dripwater and thus speleothems could be interpreted to reflect changes of regional monsoonal precipitation in east asia over inter annual and maybe longer timescales because of the complex hydrological process within the aquifer above the cave conducting monitoring of dripwater above interested speleothems is of great importance for the reconstruction of hydroclimatic change based on speleothem δ13c and other geochemical proxies credit authorship

examined the sandy reaches downstream of the china three gorges project along the yangtze river for river erosion and siltation riverbed morphology beach evolution and other physical processes over the past 40 years to explain the evolution of river geomorphology under human activities such as reservoirs improvement projects and sand mining the shashi reach is approximately 52 km in length it is the first sandy riverbed downstream of the china three gorges dam analysis of topographic data from 1975 to 2018 showed that decreased sediment from the basin resulted in increased riverbed erosion 93

and the riverbed became narrower and deeper the erosion and deposition patterns of the shashi reach beach and channel have changed from low shoal erosion high shoal deposition to both low and high shoal erosion additionally waterway engineering has changed sandbar boundaries and impacted the evolution of interactions among beach groups under quasi natural conditions strong interactions occur in sandbar evolution such as the development of the taipingkou channel bar tpkcb which led to lalinzhou point bar llzpb erosion tail section widening as well as sanbatan sbt shrinkage and recession of its eastward edge owing to the implementation of waterway engineering the linkage between the tpkcb and the upper section of the llzpb weakened the widening of the lower section of the latter has caused the sbt to shrink further and shift westward changes in the morphologies and dynamic axes of upstream beach groups have resulted in a sharp reduction of incoming sediment causing the downstream

1 introduction in recent decades extreme natural conditions and anthropogenic activities have severely impacted riverbed morphology rinaldi and simon 1998 dang et al 2014 darby et al 2016 mei et al 2018 disturbances caused by these activities often accelerate or change natural processes and patterns decreasing the temporal scale of river adjustment rinaldi and simon 1998 although large reservoirs provide extensive benefits such as flood control power generation transportation and enhanced ecology zheng 2016 they also change water and sediment conditions in downstream river channels

increasing the scale of waterways these projects have also changed the evolution and relationship of shoals and channels yang et al 2018b local deep pits produced by sand mining activities along the river channel have affected branching channel diversion thalweg hydrodynamic axis and other factors brunier et al 2014 mei et al 2015a mei et al 2015b therefore investigating the influences of large scale reservoir operations along a river basin the impact of human activities from waterway improvement projects sand mining and other factors on the river geomorphic system is important the three gorges project is the world s largest hydro junction engineering design zheng 2016 and its operation has profoundly impacted the downstream hydrological geomorphic especially in highly mobile sandy sections of the riverbed and ecological conditions approximately 116 km downstream of the three gorges dam is a sandy cobble or sandy cobble sand transition section after the bed surface was roughened the ability of the cobble sandy riverbed to compensate for suspended sediment has weakened yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 notably the erosion intensity of the riverbed weakened after 2009 dai et al

been studied the shashi reach has the most complex navigation obstruction characteristics in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and poor beach stability makes river channel and waterway management challenging previous studies have analyzed the shashi reach focusing on the mechanisms and trends of waterway evolution jiang et al 2010 xue et al 2018 the relationship between sandbar evolution and degree of navigation obstruction zhu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 and river channel and waterway engineering deng et al 2013 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b li et al 2019 regarding the evolution among beach groups it was initially believed that the lalinzhou point bar dominated the shashi reach deng et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b however holistic studies have ignored the differences in the shashi reach response relationship between the evolution of its up and downstream sections the taipingkou tpk and sanbatan sbt channel bars respectively hu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 meanwhile multiphase waterway projects were implemented in the shashi reach the improvements made to waterway conditions have impacted the boundaries and morphology of the sandbars however previous research has not addressed the correlation between these periodic impacts of waterway engineering and the evolution of linkages among beach groups river sand mining wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 dredging and dumping projects brunier et al 2014 and other anthropogenic activities have also changed the intensity of riverbed erosion deposition and processes of sandbar morphology these activities have further impacted the strength among beach group linkages however existing analyses on the causes have failed to consider the periodic impacts of human activities on riverbed evolution taking the shashi reach downstream of the three gorges dam as a case study water and sediment data from 1955 to 2018 as well as topographic information from 1975 to 2018 were used to examine the amount and intensity of riverbed erosion and deposition the evolution of beach group linkages and morphology and changes to riverbed thalwegs and profiles moreover this study presents the impact of the three gorges project waterway engineering and channel sand mining activities on riverbed morphology and evolution of linkages among beach groups 2 study area data

after 2009 in the shashi reach fig 3 a table 2 from 2004 to 2012 three channel improvement projects were carried out in the sbt area to improve the stability and integrity of sbt and achieved a 2 9 m 150 m 1000 m water depth width bend radius channel scale from 2008 to 2011 the first phase of the wakouzi channel improvement project was carried out to restrain the scouring of jczpb and achieved a 2 9 m 150 m 1000 m channel scale from 2010 to 2013 the llzpb guardianship project was implemented to achieve a 3 0 m 80 m 750 m channel scale from 2010 to 2013 the wakouzi majiazui channel improvement project was implemented to continue to improve the integrity and stability of jczpb and achieved a 3 5 m 150 m 1000 m channel scale during the period of 2013 2017 the first phase of the jingjiang river channel improvement project was implemented to improve the stability of sbt llzpb and jczpb as a whole and achieved a 3 5 m 150 m 750 m channel scale table 2 the jingzhou yangtze river bridge

morphology adjustment based on characteristic discharges of 5000 m3 s 1 30 000 m3 s 1 and 50 000 m3 s 1 obtained at yichang hydrological station the riverbed can be classified into low water bankfull and flood channels changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources 2016 the water level between low water and bankfull channels is regarded as a low beach and that between flat and flood channels as a high beach the cross section volume method was used to calculate the erosion and deposition patterns of river channels yang et al 2018c 3 1 1 riverbed erosion and deposition from 1975 to 2016 the river section in this study experienced cumulative erosion the total erosion volumes of low water bankfull and flood channels were 2 96 108 m3 3 27 108 m3 and 3 18 108 m3 respectively fig 4 a thus the erosion volume of the low water channel was 93 1 of the flood channel erosion regarding riverbed erosion and deposition intensity 1975 1986 and 2002 2009 were periods of low beach erosion and high beach deposition respectively 1986 2002 was a period of low beach erosion with minor changes to high beaches and 2009 2016 was characterized by both low and high beach erosion the riverbed erosion intensity was higher from 2003 to 2016 than 1975 2002 and has significantly increased since 2009 fig 4b the decrease in the sediment quantity from the basin has led to an increase in riverbed erosion of the shashi reach 3 1 2 changes in riverbed morphology to analyze the cross sectional changes in morphology for 1975 2018 sandbar locations were selected fig 1 the results show that over the analysis period the left bank of myz was eroded beach peak elevation changed minimally and low beach erosion along the right edge of the sandbar was apparent fig 5 a the tpkcb has gradually deposited upward since its formation but eroded downward since 2008 by 2018 its cross section had been eroded and the morphology of the riverbed changed from a w to u shape fig 5b over the analysis period the cross section of sbt changed markedly where from 1975 to 1993 the old sbt was located at the center of the river channel and shifted leftward with the large scale erosion of its right edge and surface forming a new sbt the southern branch was originally in a state of deposition while the new southern and northern branches were being deeply eroded fig 5c in 1975 1993 jczpb was on the central left side of the river channel shifting towards the right in 1993 2008 and since 2008 the left edge of the sandbar has been heavily eroded and maximum beach width and elevation have decreased fig 5d during the analysis period the overall thalweg in the shashi reach was in a downcutting posture fig 6 a the average depths of thalweg downcutting in 2018 compared to 1975 2002 and 2008 were 5 2 1 2 and 3 3 m respectively for the riverbed cross sectional morphology the fluvial facies coefficient was selected to characterize the relationship between channel width and depth according to eq 5 5 φ b h where φ is the fluvial facies coefficient b is the river width m and h is the average depth m along with the increase in riverbed thalweg downcutting and the area of 15 m and 20 m deep channels the fluvial facies coefficients of all representative sections decreased in 1975 2018 and the riverbed cross sectional morphology gradually narrowed and deepened fig 6b c 3 1 3 changes in branching channel diversion relationships fig 7 shows the changes in the branching channel diversion ratio between tpkcb and the sbt section the main characteristics of the changes are during the period of 2004 2013 four channel improvement projects were implemented in the central bar area of sbt the diversion ratio of the south branch of sbt was reduced by approximately 19 73 in 2004 and 54 in 2007 accumulatively during the period of 2004 2007 at the beginning of the project construction and the change in diversion relationship between the south branch and north branch of sbt was less than 5 during the period of 2007 2010 i e the waterway regulation project played a role in controlling the diversion relationship during the period of 2010 2012 the alternation phenomenon had occurred during the dry period in the branching section of sbt and the cumulative decrease in the diversion ratio of its south branch was approximately 27 59 in 2010 and 32 in 2012 during the period of 2012 2014 the cumulative increase in the diversion ratio of the south branch of sbt was approximately 53 32 in 2012 and 85 in 2014 and the diversion relationship in the branching section of sbt was basically stable during 2014 2017 with a variation of less than 6 in the diversion ratio since the development of tpkcb there have been no channel improvement projects implemented at tpkcb the cumulative increase in the diversion ratio of the south branch of tpkcb during 2001 2010 was approximately 27 38 in 2001 and 65 in 2010 and the variation in the diversion relationship during 2010 2017 was less than 8 assessing the changes in the branching channel diversion ratio during the dry season the main and branch channels of both sbt and tpkcb alternated with the sbt completing five and the tpkcb completing one alternation since the channel bar formation fig 7 before the operation of the three gorges project the alternation cycle of the sbt channel was 20 years 1978 1980 to 1998 1999 but following project implementation the cycle decreased to 2 8 years 1998 1999 2006 2007 2010 and 2012 and the stability of the branching relationship deteriorated 3 1 4 variation in the relationship between flow and water level fig 8 shows the water level variation of minimum and maximum flows at the shashi hydrographic station and the analysis shows that the minimum flow at the shashi hydrographic station during the period of 1955 2002 had little variation the minimum water level showed a decreasing trend and both the minimum flow and the minimum water level increased during the period of 2002 2019 the maximum flow and the maximum water level showed relatively good synchronization during the period of 1955 2019 and the maximum flow and the high water level during the period of 2003 2019 period were both lower than those in the period of 1955 2002 for the same flow water level corresponding relationship the flow water level during the dry period in the four periods of 1955 1968 1969 1987 1988 2002 and 2003 2019 was in a decreasing phase and the flood flow water level first experienced a lowering and then raising change characteristic during the periods of 1955 2019 and 1988 2019 the water level corresponding to 6000 m3 s at the shashi hydrological station decreased by 3 26 m and 1 87 m respectively and the water level corresponding to 45000 m3 s increased by 0 08 m and 0 44 m respectively 5 changes in point and channel bar morphologies fig 9 shows the evolutionary processes for each sandbar in 1975 2018 highlighting the following main characteristic changes hjz and myz these sandbars showed relative stability in 1975 2018 their areas increased then decreased and as of 2018 their head sections have retreated by 583 m and 118 m respectively tpkcb in 1975 a large point bar was present on the right bank however the tpkcb has not yet developed by 1986 the upper middle section of the point bar was eroded and one section shifted toward the middle of the river that formed the proto form of the tpkcb meanwhile river channel widening provided favorable conditions for the bar s development and the lower section of the point bar extended downstream to become the llzpb tpkcb gradually developed and increased in area up to 1993 and decreased until 1998 in 1998 2008 the tpkcb area increased whereas the llzpb head section simultaneously retreated due to erosion with its tail portion widening through deposition in 2008 2018 the area rapidly decreased although the llzpb was relatively stable indicating that the beach protection project for llzpb had achieved the expected results from 1986 to 2018 the tpkcb head section shifted downstream by approximately 5040 m by 2018 the head section had moved downstream to approximately 990 m beyond the hudu river branch mouth llzpb in 1975 the llzpb was large with the head section located 3300 m upstream from the hudu river branch mouth by 1986 the head section had receded 2830 m and in 1993 the llzpb head section receded to downstream of the hudu river branch mouth in 1986 2008 the head section receded laterally becoming restrained in 2011 2018 after implementation of the channel project the location changed little in 1975 2018 as the lower and tail sections of the llzpb were slowly deposited and widened laterally sbt in 1975 sbt maintained an area of 6 33 106 m2 with a maximum length and width of 5620 m and 2050 m respectively by 2018 its area had decreased to 5 24 105 m2 with a maximum length and width of 2287 m and 343 m respectively the area maximum length and maximum width were reduced by 91 7 59 3 and 83 3 respectively the head and the right edge of sbt were scoured and affected by the silting up of the llzpb the position of sbt shifted to the left and formed a new sbt since 2013 the north branch inlet of sbt formed the yljpb in 2013 and 2018 the areas were 7 936 105 m2 and 7 22 104 m2 respectively showing a reduction of 90 9 jczpb in 1975 1986 jczpb evolved from a point bar to a channel bar it has remained as such through 2018 although the area increased in 1986 2002 it has been decreasing since that time 3 2 three gorges project operation and riverbed geomorphology 3 2 1 riverbed scouring and siltation from 1955 to 2018 the annual runoff at shashi reach was relatively constant whereas the suspended sediment decreased fig 10 from 2003 to 2018 annual runoff decreased by 2 6 and 5 5 compared to 1955 2002 and 1981 2002 respectively while sediment transportation decreased by 87 6 and 86 7 respectively during 1975 1993 bend cut off projects were implemented in the lower jingjiang reach causing headcut scouring of the riverbed owing to a comparative increase in water surface this led to abundant riverbed scouring in the shashi reach over this period fig 11 a in 1993 1998 there was a low amount of incoming sediment in the shashi reach and during the 1998 basin flood riverbed scouring intensity increased since 2003 the three gorges dam and combined operation of the upstream terrace reservoir complex has had little effect on total runoff and the sediment detention effect resulted in a significant reduction of sediment entering the river channel downstream of the dam the primary factor causing riverbed scouring there with the cumulative scouring of the shashi reach the fluvial facies coefficients showed a simultaneous decreasing trend and the riverbed morphology narrowed and deepened fig 11b 3 2 2 beach morphology there was a lag between riverbed morphology adjustments water and sediment conditions with the channel morphology of the jingjiang reach maintaining the most optimal relationship with water sediment conditions across the first five years yang et al 2019 overall sandbar area decreased with the amount of sediment transported to shashi reach and the increase in cumulative riverbed erosion fig 12 a in 1975 2018 the sandbar areas correlated strongly with sediment transport to shashi reach r2 0 85 in hjz myz the tpkcb the llzpb sbt and jczpb fig 12 4 discussion 4 1 impact of river bed scouring and silting on water level changes in the river channel before and after commencing the operation of the three gorges project the low water channel in the shashi reach has been in a scouring posture especially the declining posture of the same flow low water level was in synchronization with the trend of river scouring fig 13 after the commencement of the project the trend of flood level adjustment at the same flow at shashi hydrological station was not significant and showed a certain uplifting trend after the commencement of the three gorges project river scour in the shashi river section was mainly concentrated in the low flow channel approximately 93 of the river scour occurred in the low flow channel after the project started and 7 was distributed in the beach area the scouring of the river channel did not cause a decrease in the flood level at the same flow but due to the decrease in the duration of the flood flow days the exposure events in the beach area were increasing which made the vegetation flourish more and there was increased human activity along the beach area which increased the bed resistance of the beach area and made the flood level at the same flow rise to a certain extent 4 1 1 impacts of river sand mining sand mining activities in the river channel directly changed the intensity of local riverbed scouring and silting particularly when mining activities were in the vicinity of beaches further impacting the relevance of beach evolution over the analysis period the intensity of riverbed scouring in the shashi reach peaked in 2013 2018 topographic examinations since 2014 revealed nine isolated deep pits in the riverbed fig 1b after one hydrological year if the deep pits resumed siltation their formation was considered to be derived from the mining activities and if the scouring patterns continued they were the result of riverbed scouring and silting adaptations to water and sediment conditions four cross sections were selected to analyze the changes in deep pits fig 14 two scouring processes at location a from 2014 to 2018 with the first one from december 2014 december 2015 containing two deep pits maximum scouring depth 15 2 m which were silted over as of october 2016 and the second from january october 2016 maximum scouring depth 12 7 m where the deep pits remained in a siltation state until february 2017 followed by an alternation of scouring and silting in 2014 2018 two downcutting processes took place at location b the first from december 2014 december 2015 maximum scouring depth 6 2 m after which it gradually connected with the deep pits from the second downcutting process of january october 2016 maximum scouring depth 14 1 m the pits were significantly silted up by march 2018 there were single downcutting processes at locations c and d in december 2014 august 2018 and december 2014 december 2015 maximum scouring depths of 18 4 m and 10 5 m respectively the pits were silted up after the hydrological year of 2016 sand mining activities in the shashi reach were concentrated in december 2014 october 2016 and the isolated deep pits formed were all restored by siltation to an extent the low and decreasing trend of sediment transport at shashi reach since 2014 caused significant riverbed scouring the modern water and sediment conditions have promoted further scouring of the deep pits and restoration of siltation was delayed for a short period of time calculating sand mining volume from the changes in channel volume during deep pit formation the deep pit volume in the shashi reach in 2014 2016 was 13 2 million m3 accounting for 15 9 of the scouring volume of the flat shoal river channel i e sand mining activities have intensified the scouring intensity of the riverbed simultaneously sand mining activities were concentrated on the left side of the tpkcb and in the deep river channel increasing the scouring intensity of both the tpkcb and the north river channel sand mining activities can disrupt the planform of tpkcb first it intensified the rate of reduction in tpkcb reducing the area by 16 km2 y and 22 km2 y during 2008 2013 and 2013 2018 respectively the head recession rate of tpkcb increased significantly during 2002 2018 with average annual recession distances of 159 m y and 460 m y during 2002 2014 and 2014 2018 respectively 4 1 2 channel dredging maintenance to ensure the continuity of channel depth in the shashi reach dredging maintenance has been carried out during the post flood dry season the dredging volumes in the shashi reach in 1997 2012 and 2013 2016 october to march of the next year were 5 334 million m3 and 10 634 million m3 respectively fig 15 accounting for 3 3 and 12 8 of the scouring volume in the flat shoal river channel dredging maintenance was carried out by trailing suction or cutter suction dredgers and dumping mud in the lower section of the llzpb thus both dredging and dumping were within the shashi reach and although the mud dumping maintained a small impact on the overall scouring and silting of the channel it affected local beach channel morphology widening the siltation in the lower section of the llzpb in 2013 2016 this perpetuated further changes in the linkages and morphology of sbt and passed on the evolutionary dynamics to jczpb 4 2 channel improvement projects on beach evolution to implement the state of the waterway regulation project the sandbar evolution process was divided into two periods the first is the project pre implementation period when the river channel was in a quasi natural state and the second was the post channel project implementation period because of the different project implementation time points at various sandbars the cut off years between the periods were different as well the revealed evolution of the sandbar linkages are as follows 1 linkage between tpkcb sbt and llzpb fig 16 a before implementation of the channel project the area of the llzpb decreased and the tpkcb area increased r2 0 70 the channel project protected the boundary of the llzpb notably its area shrunk during mutual adaptation between the project and riverbed topography however the area was still larger than during the initial stage of project implementation 2011 the correlation between the areas of sbt and the tpkcb was relatively weak with their intersection correlating to changes in the tpkcb area r2 0 47 moreover it was weaker than the linkage to the llzpb area meanwhile the distance between the head section of the tpkcb and jingzhou yangtze river bridge was positively correlated with the upper section of the llzpb retreat distance r2 0 59 a summary of areal changes further indicated a strongly evolved relationship of the linkage between the tpkcb and llzpb it was observed that erosion and retreat of the upper llzpb section were controlled after the implementation of the waterway regulation project regardless of whether the head section of the tpkcb had retreated the distance between the upper section of the llzpb and the right bank was relatively stable fig 8c 2 linkage between llzpb and sbt fig 16b the llzpb was divided into upper and lower sections with a strong evolutionary relationship between their areas r2 0 62 characterized by changes in erosion at the head section deposition at the tail section the evolution of the linkage between llzpb and sbt was not significantly correlated in this area and remained weak even post implementation of the protection project in the lower section of the llzpb r2 0 32 there was a strong relationship in linkage evolution between sbt and the lower section of the llzpb r2 0 97 which remained strong after implementation of the protection project in the lower section of llzpb r2 0 64 that is the llzpb lower section was widened by deposition while the sbt area shrunk regarding the cross section area the lower section of the llzpb widened by deposition and the right edge of the old sbt eroded backward and shifted left gradually forming the new sbt 3 linkage between the jczpb sbt and llzpb fig 16c and 16d the area of jczpb was related to the total area of sbt and the llzpb r2 0 36 although it was more closely related to sbt r2 0 51 there was good correlation between the reduction area of jcz and the widening deposition area of the lower section of the llzpb r2 0 83 as well as the receding right edge of sbt r2 0 87 this indicated a stronger relationship between the areal changes of the jczpb and morphological adjustments in the upstream sandbars because the widening of the lower section of llzpb due to deposition pushed the water flow toward the right edge of sbt and led to its erosion during this period the hydrodynamic axis of the main stem of jczpb was in the center of the river channel caused erosion in the jczpb head section as the lower section of the llzpb was eroding the hydrodynamic axis of the main stem moved downward closer to the right bank entered the main stem of jcz and shifted toward the left bank of the channel during this period e g 1975 jcz existed in a relatively large and complete form of a right bank point bar 4 3 branching channel diversion beach evolution and anthropogenic activities 4 3 1 tpkcb based on the classification of branch diversion properties han et al 2018 the south branch of sbt is a flood prone branch i e the increase in the number of flood flow days promotes the development of the south branch during 2004 2012 2012 2014 and 2014 2018 the diversion ratio of the south branch of sbt experienced a change process it first decreased and then increased to stabilize it has been shown yang et al 2018c that after the commencement of the three gorges project the number of days of flood flow duration at the shashi hydrological station showed a decreasing trend overall the decrease in the number of sustained days of flood flow is contradictory to the change in the diversion ratio of the southern branch of sbt i e the relationship between the adjustment of the diversion ratio of sbt branch channel and the adjustment of the flow process after the commencement of the three gorges project was not significant since 1986 the silting up of the tpkcb gradually developed a central bar by 1993 with its bar position and shape progressively stabilizing fig 17 after the flood of 1998 the head of the tpkcb was extended upward by 1900 m in 2003 the three gorges reservoir commenced operations the head of the tpkcb retreated from 2003 to 2009 corresponding to a decrease in the north branch diversion ratio during the dry season fig 17 in 2010 2018 the head of the tpkcb steadily retreated and the north branch diversion ratio during the dry season increased fig 17 since 2010 the relationship between the north branch diversion ratio and the head location of the tpkcb has been significantly different from that in 2003 2009 primarily because of sand mining activities in the north branch increasing channel volume which in turn increased the north branch diversion thus the decrease in the north branch diversion ratio was caused by the downstream shift of the head position of the tpkcb in 2003 2009 and the increase in sand mining activities since 2010 was the dominant factor of the increasing ratio 4 3 2 channel diversion relationship between the tpkcb and sbt branches the diversion relationship between the tpkcb and sbt branching channels in 2001 2018 since the formation of the tpkcb was as follows when the diversion ratio of the northern branch of the tpkcb was 45 the ratio was greater than that of the northern branch of the sbt that is a portion of the flow from the northern branch of the tpkcb entered the southern branch of the sbt fig 18 a in 2001 2003 the average diversion ratio in the northern branch of the tpkcb was 59 25 of this water entered the southern branch of the sbt during this period the tpkcb was developing and sbt was scouring however the bar size was still relatively large and the middle and upper sections of the llzpb were fairly constant overall the beach pattern and branching channel diversion relationship at the shashi reach were in a relatively stable state when the diversion ratio of the north branch of the tpkcb was equal to 45 the ratio was equal to the diversion ratio of the northern branch of the sbt that is the flow in the northern and southern branches of the tpkcb entered the northern and southern branches of the sbt respectively fig 18b in 2004 2006 the tpkcb was in a silting up state the head of the llzpb was scoured and its tail was silted up from 2004 to 2005 the changjiang waterway bureau guarded sbt and with beach pattern stabilization regional beach scouring in the southern sub pier was significant in the downstream section the llzpb was in a silting up posture which together allowed the position of sbt to shift to the left bank side overall the channel shoal patterns and diversion relationships in the branching channels of the shashi reach were in a transitional period in 2004 2006 when the diversion ratio of the northern branch of the tpkcb was less than 45 the ratio was smaller than that of the northern branch of sbt that is a part of the flow in the southern branch of the tpkcb entered the northern branch of the sbt fig 18c during the period 2007 2013 the area of tpkcb reached its maximum in 2008 and turned into a significant scouring pattern in 2009 2013 from 2010 to 2013 the guarding of the upper section of the llzpb and the left bank shore protection project caused the main stream of the sbt branching channel section to shift to the left bank side and 11 of the water in the southern branch of the tpkcb entered the northern branch of sbt during this period the lower section of the llzpb was in a silting up state and the continuous shrinkage caused the south side of sbt to scour and shrink in size forming a new sbt and making the diversion relationship of the sbt branching channel section unstable in 2014 2018 there were significant differences in the diversion relationship between the tpkcb and sbt branching channels from that of the three preceding periods in 2001 2013 fig 18d from 2013 to 2018 the tpkcb maintained a scouring pattern but the channel sections in the middle section of the llzpb and sbt were guarded and reinforced in an attempt to regulate the diversion relationship between the tpkcb and sbt branching channels however in 2014 2018 the yljpb developed between the outlet of the northern branch of tpkcb and the inlet of the northern branch of the sbt creating a weak flow between the branches and with 21 of the flow from the northern branch of the tpkcb entering the south branch of sbt as a large alluvial river the yangtze river has a number of riverside beaches and middle channel bars in the evolution process of long river reaches there is a strong correlation between the evolution of riverside beaches and middle channel bars especially in the reaches of sandy bed near the dam at the same time the comprehensive impacts of channel regulation bridge engineering sand mining activities and dredging increase the complexity of the evolution relationship between riverside beaches and middle channel bars the investigation treats the implementation of the channel regulation project as the time node and the important human activities have been take into consideration such as sand mining and dredging and the impact of human activities on the time differences of the evolution relationship between riverside beaches and middle channel bars in the first sandy reach of the yangtze river 5 conclusions 1 in 1955 2018 the amount of sediment from the river basin decreased and in 1975 2018 the shashi reach experienced increased erosion low water channel erosion accounted for 93 1 of total channel erosion sandbar areas showed similar trends decreasing with the amount of sediment transportation and river channel erosion since 2009 riverbed scour intensity has increased sand mining in the river channel accounted for 15 9 of the riverbed scour of the flat shoal whereas dredging and mud dumping had a relatively small impact on the river channel scour 2 since the operation of the three gorges project river channel patterns of the shashi reach gradually evolved from the erosion of low shoal and deposition or minimal changes in the high shoals to both low and high shoal erosion in 1975 2018 along with channel erosion and increases in deep channel areas thalweg incision and decreases in river morphological coefficients the riverbeds narrowed and deepened 3 before implementation of the waterway regulation project there was a relationship between the evolution of linkages among sandbar groups the development of the tpkcb and the downward shift of its head section caused the upper section of the llzpb to recede and decrease the channel bar development and shift also increased and widened the tail section of the llzpb leading to area shrinkage of sbt and erosion of its right edge the combination of changes to the morphologies and areas of sbt with the lower section of the llzpb caused jczpb to evolve from a point to a channel bar after implementation of the channel project the relationship between the evolutions of linkages among sandbar groups gradually weakened owing to the decreasing relationship between the tpkcb and llzpb recently the lower section of the llzpb has widened due to deposition and sbt continues to decrease in area and recede along its right edge causing the area of jczpb to shrink and separate credit authorship contribution statement yunping yang

4129,large scale reservoirs change downstream water and sediment conditions causing adaptive adjustments in erosion and deposition along the riverbed ultimately impacting sandbar morphology this study examined the sandy reaches downstream of the china three gorges project along the yangtze river for river erosion and siltation riverbed morphology beach evolution and other physical processes over the past 40 years to explain the evolution of river geomorphology under human activities such as reservoirs improvement projects and sand mining the shashi reach is approximately 52 km in length it is the first sandy riverbed downstream of the china three gorges dam analysis of topographic data from 1975 to 2018 showed that decreased sediment from the basin resulted in increased riverbed erosion 93 1 in low water channel with sand mining activities destroying the integrity of the central bar simultaneously total sandbar area decreased thalwegs deepened river morphological coefficients decreased and the riverbed became narrower and deeper the erosion and deposition patterns of the shashi reach beach and channel have changed from low shoal erosion high shoal deposition to both low and high shoal erosion additionally waterway engineering has changed sandbar boundaries and impacted the evolution of interactions among beach groups under quasi natural conditions strong interactions occur in sandbar evolution such as the development of the taipingkou channel bar tpkcb which led to lalinzhou point bar llzpb erosion tail section widening as well as sanbatan sbt shrinkage and recession of its eastward edge owing to the implementation of waterway engineering the linkage between the tpkcb and the upper section of the llzpb weakened the widening of the lower section of the latter has caused the sbt to shrink further and shift westward changes in the morphologies and dynamic axes of upstream beach groups have resulted in a sharp reduction of incoming sediment causing the downstream jinchengzhou point bar jczpb to gradually evolve into a shrunken channel bar keywords riverbed morphology evolution of sandbar linkage waterway regulation the china three gorges project yangtze river 1 introduction in recent decades extreme natural conditions and anthropogenic activities have severely impacted riverbed morphology rinaldi and simon 1998 dang et al 2014 darby et al 2016 mei et al 2018 disturbances caused by these activities often accelerate or change natural processes and patterns decreasing the temporal scale of river adjustment rinaldi and simon 1998 although large reservoirs provide extensive benefits such as flood control power generation transportation and enhanced ecology zheng 2016 they also change water and sediment conditions in downstream river channels dai and lu 2014 mei et al 2015a mei et al 2015b yang et al 2015 yu et al 2018 as well as the processes and trends of riverbed geomorphology ronco et al 2010 moretto et al 2014 legleiter 2015 han et al 2017 yang et al 2017 amissah et al 2018 amenuvor et al 2020 as reservoir operations progress spatiotemporal differences in the morphological adjustment of the downstream river channels hoyle et al 2008 have been observed in the yangtze yang et al 2017 yang et al 2018a yellow wang et al 2016 mississippi nittrouer and viparelli 2014 missouri pinter and heine 2005 and parana rivers stevaux et al 2009 to further develop and utilize water depth resources within the watershed in addition to reservoirs a large number of waterway improvement projects have been implemented yang et al 2019 while increasing the scale of waterways these projects have also changed the evolution and relationship of shoals and channels yang et al 2018b local deep pits produced by sand mining activities along the river channel have affected branching channel diversion thalweg hydrodynamic axis and other factors brunier et al 2014 mei et al 2015a mei et al 2015b therefore investigating the influences of large scale reservoir operations along a river basin the impact of human activities from waterway improvement projects sand mining and other factors on the river geomorphic system is important the three gorges project is the world s largest hydro junction engineering design zheng 2016 and its operation has profoundly impacted the downstream hydrological geomorphic especially in highly mobile sandy sections of the riverbed and ecological conditions approximately 116 km downstream of the three gorges dam is a sandy cobble or sandy cobble sand transition section after the bed surface was roughened the ability of the cobble sandy riverbed to compensate for suspended sediment has weakened yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 notably the erosion intensity of the riverbed weakened after 2009 dai et al 2018 yang et al 2018b yang et al 2018c the sandy riverbed sections showed strong erosion han et al 2014 xia et al 2016 xia et al 2017a chen et al 2019 and the erosion of banks and shoals increased xia

been studied the shashi reach has the most complex navigation obstruction characteristics in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and poor beach stability makes river channel and waterway management challenging previous studies have analyzed the shashi reach focusing on the mechanisms and trends of waterway evolution jiang et al 2010 xue et al 2018 the relationship between sandbar evolution and degree of navigation obstruction zhu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 and river channel and waterway engineering deng et al 2013 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b li et al 2019 regarding the evolution among beach groups it was initially believed that the lalinzhou point bar dominated the shashi reach deng et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b however holistic studies have ignored the differences in the shashi reach response relationship between the evolution of its up and downstream sections the taipingkou tpk and sanbatan sbt channel bars respectively hu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 meanwhile multiphase waterway projects were implemented in the shashi reach the improvements made to waterway conditions have impacted the boundaries and morphology of the sandbars however previous research has not addressed the correlation between these periodic impacts of waterway engineering and the evolution of linkages among beach groups river sand mining wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 dredging and dumping projects brunier et al 2014 and other anthropogenic activities have also changed the intensity of riverbed erosion deposition and processes of sandbar morphology these activities have further impacted the strength among beach group linkages however existing analyses on the causes have failed to consider the periodic impacts of human activities on riverbed evolution taking the shashi reach downstream of the three gorges dam as a case study water and sediment data from 1955 to 2018 as well as topographic information from 1975 to 2018 were used to examine the amount and intensity of riverbed erosion and deposition the evolution of beach group linkages and morphology and changes to riverbed thalwegs and profiles moreover this study presents the impact of the three gorges project waterway engineering and channel sand mining activities on riverbed morphology and evolution of linkages among beach groups 2 study area data

calculation method 2 2 1 data source annual runoff and sediment transportation data for the shashi reach and the hudu river were collected from 1955 to 2018 and changes in incoming water and sediment conditions were analyzed a total of 12 sets of topographic surveys from 1975 to 2018 scale 1 10 000 except for beaches and waterway remediation buildings which 1 500 to 1 2000 were used to monitor changes in the distribution of riverbed erosion deposition river channel and sandbar morphology and sand mining activities hydrological and topographic data were obtained from the bureau of hydrology changjiang water resources commission and changjiang waterway bureau survey center table 1 2 2 2 riverbed erosion and deposition based on the relationship between water level and river channel

after 2009 in the shashi reach fig 3 a table 2 from 2004 to 2012 three channel improvement projects were carried out in the sbt area to improve the stability and integrity of sbt and achieved a 2 9 m 150 m 1000 m water depth width bend radius channel scale from 2008 to 2011 the first phase of the wakouzi channel improvement project was carried out to restrain the scouring of jczpb and achieved a 2 9 m 150 m 1000 m channel scale from 2010 to 2013 the llzpb guardianship project was implemented to achieve a 3 0 m 80 m 750 m channel scale from 2010 to 2013 the wakouzi majiazui channel improvement project was implemented to continue to improve the integrity and stability of jczpb and achieved a 3 5 m 150 m 1000 m channel scale during the period of 2013 2017 the first phase of the jingjiang river channel improvement project was implemented to improve the stability of sbt llzpb and jczpb as a whole and achieved a 3 5 m 150 m 750 m channel scale table 2 the jingzhou yangtze river bridge

morphology adjustment based on characteristic discharges of 5000 m3 s 1 30 000 m3 s 1 and 50 000 m3 s 1 obtained at yichang hydrological station the riverbed can be classified into low water bankfull and flood channels changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources 2016 the water level between low water and bankfull channels is regarded as a low beach and that between flat and flood channels as a high beach the cross section volume method was used to calculate the erosion and deposition patterns of river channels yang et al 2018c 3 1 1 riverbed erosion and deposition from 1975 to 2016 the river section in this study experienced cumulative erosion the total erosion volumes of low water bankfull and flood channels were 2 96 108 m3 3 27 108 m3 and 3 18 108 m3 respectively fig 4 a thus the erosion volume of the low water channel was 93 1 of the flood channel erosion regarding riverbed erosion and deposition intensity 1975 1986 and 2002 2009 were periods of low beach erosion and high beach deposition respectively 1986 2002 was a period of low beach erosion with minor changes to high beaches and 2009 2016 was characterized by both low and high beach erosion the riverbed erosion intensity was higher from 2003 to 2016 than 1975 2002 and has significantly increased since 2009 fig 4b the decrease in the sediment quantity from the basin has led to an increase in riverbed erosion of the shashi reach 3 1 2 changes in riverbed morphology to analyze the cross sectional changes in morphology for 1975 2018 sandbar locations were selected fig 1 the results show that over the analysis period the left bank of myz was eroded beach peak elevation changed minimally and low beach erosion along the right edge of the sandbar was apparent fig 5 a the tpkcb has gradually deposited upward since its formation but eroded downward since 2008 by 2018 its cross section had been eroded and the morphology of the riverbed changed from a w to u shape fig 5b over the analysis period the cross section of sbt changed markedly where from 1975 to 1993 the old sbt was located at the center of the river channel and shifted leftward with the large scale erosion of its right edge and surface forming a new sbt the southern branch was originally in a state of deposition while the new southern and northern branches were being deeply eroded fig 5c in 1975 1993 jczpb was on the central left side of the river channel shifting towards the right in 1993 2008 and since 2008 the left edge of the sandbar has been heavily eroded and maximum beach width and elevation have decreased fig 5d during the analysis period the overall thalweg in the shashi reach was in a downcutting posture fig 6 a the average depths of thalweg downcutting in 2018 compared to 1975 2002 and 2008 were 5 2 1 2 and 3 3 m respectively for the riverbed cross sectional morphology the fluvial facies coefficient was selected to characterize the relationship between channel width and depth according to eq 5 5 φ b h where φ is the fluvial facies coefficient b is the river width m and h is the average depth m along with the increase in riverbed thalweg downcutting and the area of 15 m and 20 m deep channels the fluvial facies coefficients of all representative sections decreased in 1975 2018 and the riverbed cross sectional morphology gradually narrowed and deepened fig 6b c 3 1 3 changes in branching channel diversion relationships fig 7 shows the changes in the branching channel diversion ratio between tpkcb and the sbt section the main characteristics of the changes are during the period of 2004 2013 four channel improvement projects were implemented in the central bar area of sbt the diversion ratio of the south branch of sbt was reduced by approximately 19 73 in 2004 and 54 in 2007 accumulatively during the period of 2004 2007 at the beginning of the project construction and the change in diversion relationship between the south branch and north branch of sbt was less than 5 during the period of 2007 2010 i e the waterway regulation project played a role in controlling the diversion relationship during the period of 2010 2012 the alternation phenomenon had occurred during the dry period in the branching section of sbt and the cumulative decrease in the diversion ratio of its south branch was approximately 27 59 in 2010 and 32 in 2012 during the period of 2012 2014 the cumulative increase in the diversion ratio of the south branch of sbt was approximately 53 32 in 2012 and 85 in 2014 and the diversion relationship in the branching section of sbt was basically stable during 2014 2017 with a variation of less than 6 in the diversion ratio since the development of tpkcb there have been no channel improvement projects implemented at tpkcb the cumulative increase in the diversion ratio of the south branch of tpkcb during 2001 2010 was approximately 27 38 in 2001 and 65 in 2010 and the variation in the diversion relationship during 2010 2017 was less than 8 assessing the changes in the branching channel diversion ratio during the dry season the main and branch channels of both sbt and tpkcb alternated with the sbt completing five and the tpkcb completing one alternation since the channel bar formation fig 7 before the operation of the three gorges project the alternation cycle of the sbt channel was 20 years 1978 1980 to 1998 1999 but following project implementation the cycle decreased to 2 8 years 1998 1999 2006 2007 2010 and 2012 and the stability of the branching relationship deteriorated 3 1 4 variation in the relationship between flow and water level fig 8 shows the water level variation of minimum and maximum flows at the shashi hydrographic station and the analysis shows that the minimum flow at the shashi hydrographic station during the period of 1955 2002 had little variation the minimum water level showed a decreasing trend and both the minimum flow and the minimum water level increased during the period of 2002 2019 the maximum flow and the maximum water level showed relatively good synchronization during the period of 1955 2019 and the maximum flow and the high water level during the period of 2003 2019 period were both lower than those in the period of 1955 2002 for the same flow water level corresponding relationship the flow water level during the dry period in the four periods of 1955 1968 1969 1987 1988 2002 and 2003 2019 was in a decreasing phase and the flood flow water level first experienced a lowering and then raising change characteristic during the periods of 1955 2019 and 1988 2019 the water level corresponding to 6000 m3 s at the shashi hydrological station decreased by 3 26 m and 1 87 m respectively and the water level corresponding to 45000 m3 s increased by 0 08 m and 0 44 m respectively 5 changes in point and channel bar morphologies fig 9 shows the evolutionary processes for each sandbar in 1975 2018 highlighting the following main characteristic changes hjz and myz these sandbars showed relative stability in 1975 2018 their areas increased then decreased and as of 2018 their head sections have retreated by 583 m and 118 m respectively tpkcb in 1975 a large point bar was present on the right bank however the tpkcb has not yet developed by 1986 the upper middle section of the point bar was eroded and one section shifted toward the middle of the river that formed the proto form of the tpkcb meanwhile river channel widening provided favorable conditions for the bar s development and the lower section of the point bar extended downstream to become the llzpb tpkcb gradually developed and increased in area up to 1993 and decreased until 1998 in 1998 2008 the tpkcb area increased whereas the llzpb head section simultaneously retreated due to erosion with its tail portion widening through deposition in 2008 2018 the area rapidly decreased although the llzpb was relatively stable indicating that the beach protection project for llzpb had achieved the expected results from 1986 to 2018 the tpkcb head section shifted downstream by approximately 5040 m by 2018 the head section had moved downstream to approximately 990 m beyond the hudu river branch mouth llzpb in 1975 the llzpb was large with the head section located 3300 m upstream from the hudu river branch mouth by 1986 the head section had receded 2830 m and in 1993 the llzpb head section receded to downstream of the hudu river branch mouth in 1986 2008 the head section receded laterally becoming restrained in 2011 2018 after implementation of the channel project the location changed little in 1975 2018 as the lower and tail sections of the llzpb were slowly deposited and widened laterally sbt in 1975 sbt maintained an area of 6 33 106 m2 with a maximum length and width of 5620 m and 2050 m respectively by 2018 its area had decreased to 5 24 105 m2 with a maximum length and width of 2287 m and 343 m respectively the area maximum length and maximum width were reduced by 91 7 59 3 and 83 3 respectively the head and the right edge of sbt were scoured and affected by the silting up of the llzpb the position of sbt shifted to the left and formed a new sbt since 2013 the north branch inlet of sbt formed the yljpb in 2013 and 2018 the areas were 7 936 105 m2 and 7 22 104 m2 respectively showing a reduction of 90 9 jczpb in 1975 1986 jczpb evolved from a point bar to a channel bar it has remained as such through 2018 although the area increased in 1986 2002 it has been decreasing since that time 3 2 three gorges project operation and riverbed geomorphology 3 2 1 riverbed scouring and siltation from 1955 to 2018 the annual runoff at shashi reach was relatively constant whereas the suspended sediment decreased fig 10 from 2003 to 2018 annual runoff decreased by 2 6 and 5 5 compared to 1955 2002 and 1981 2002 respectively while sediment transportation decreased by 87 6 and 86 7 respectively during 1975 1993 bend cut off projects were implemented in the lower jingjiang reach causing headcut scouring of the riverbed owing to a comparative increase in water surface this led to abundant riverbed scouring in the shashi reach over this period fig 11 a in 1993 1998 there was a low amount of incoming sediment in the shashi reach and during the 1998 basin flood riverbed scouring intensity increased since 2003 the three gorges dam and combined operation of the upstream terrace reservoir complex has had little effect on total runoff and the sediment detention effect resulted in a significant reduction of sediment entering the river channel downstream of the dam the primary factor causing riverbed scouring there with the cumulative scouring of the shashi reach the fluvial facies coefficients showed a simultaneous decreasing trend and the riverbed morphology narrowed and deepened fig 11b 3 2 2 beach morphology there was a lag between riverbed morphology adjustments water and sediment conditions with the channel morphology of the jingjiang reach maintaining the most optimal relationship with water sediment conditions across the first five years yang et al 2019 overall sandbar area decreased with the amount of sediment transported to shashi reach and the increase in cumulative riverbed erosion fig 12 a in 1975 2018 the sandbar areas correlated strongly with sediment transport to shashi reach r2 0 85 in hjz myz the tpkcb the llzpb sbt and jczpb fig 12 4 discussion 4 1 impact of river bed scouring and silting on water level changes in the river channel before and after commencing the operation of the three gorges project the low water channel in the shashi reach has been in a scouring posture especially the declining posture of the same flow low water level was in synchronization with the trend of river scouring fig 13 after the commencement of the project the trend of flood level adjustment at the same flow at shashi hydrological station was not significant and showed a certain uplifting trend after the commencement of the three gorges project river scour in the shashi river section was mainly concentrated in the low flow channel approximately 93 of the river scour occurred in the low flow channel after the project started and 7 was distributed in the beach area the scouring of the river channel did not cause a decrease in the flood level at the same flow but due to the decrease in the duration of the flood flow days the exposure events in the beach area were increasing which made the vegetation flourish more and there was increased human activity along the beach area which increased the bed resistance of the beach area and made the flood level at the same flow rise to a certain extent 4 1 1 impacts of river sand mining sand mining activities in the river channel directly changed the intensity of local riverbed scouring and silting particularly when mining activities were in the vicinity of beaches further impacting the relevance of beach evolution over the analysis period the intensity of riverbed scouring in the shashi reach peaked in 2013 2018 topographic examinations since 2014 revealed nine isolated deep pits in the riverbed fig 1b after one hydrological year if the deep pits resumed siltation their formation was considered to be derived from the mining activities and if the scouring patterns continued they were the result of riverbed scouring and silting adaptations to water and sediment conditions four cross sections were selected to analyze the changes in deep pits fig 14 two scouring processes at location a from 2014 to 2018 with the first one from december 2014 december 2015 containing two deep pits maximum scouring depth 15 2 m which were silted over as of october 2016 and the second from january october 2016 maximum scouring depth 12 7 m where the deep pits remained in a siltation state until february 2017 followed by an alternation of scouring and silting in 2014 2018 two downcutting processes took place at location b the first from december 2014 december 2015 maximum scouring depth 6 2 m after which it gradually connected with the deep pits from the second downcutting process of january october 2016 maximum scouring depth 14 1 m the pits were significantly silted up by march 2018 there were single downcutting processes at locations c and d in december 2014 august 2018 and december 2014 december 2015 maximum scouring depths of 18 4 m and 10 5 m respectively the pits were silted up after the hydrological year of 2016 sand mining activities in the shashi reach were concentrated in december 2014 october 2016 and the isolated deep pits formed were all restored by siltation to an extent the low and decreasing trend of sediment transport at shashi reach since 2014 caused significant riverbed scouring the modern water and sediment conditions have promoted further scouring of the deep pits and restoration of siltation was delayed for a short period of time calculating sand mining volume from the changes in channel volume during deep pit formation the deep pit volume in the shashi reach in 2014 2016 was 13 2 million m3 accounting for 15 9 of the scouring volume of the flat shoal river channel i e sand mining activities have intensified the scouring intensity of the riverbed simultaneously sand mining activities were concentrated on the left side of the tpkcb and in the deep river channel increasing the scouring intensity of both the tpkcb and the north river channel sand mining activities can disrupt the planform of tpkcb first it intensified the rate of reduction in tpkcb reducing the area by 16 km2 y and 22 km2 y during 2008 2013 and 2013 2018 respectively the head recession rate of tpkcb increased significantly during 2002 2018 with average annual recession distances of 159 m y and 460 m y during 2002 2014 and 2014 2018 respectively 4 1 2 channel dredging maintenance to ensure the continuity of channel depth in the shashi reach dredging maintenance has been carried out during the post flood dry season the dredging volumes in the shashi reach in 1997 2012 and 2013 2016 october to march of the next year were 5 334 million m3 and 10 634 million m3 respectively fig 15 accounting for 3 3 and 12 8 of the scouring volume in the flat shoal river channel dredging maintenance was carried out by trailing suction or cutter suction dredgers and dumping mud in the lower section of the llzpb thus both dredging and dumping were within the shashi reach and although the mud dumping maintained a small impact on the overall scouring and silting of the channel it affected local beach channel morphology widening the siltation in the lower section of the llzpb in 2013 2016 this perpetuated further changes in the linkages and morphology of sbt and passed on the evolutionary dynamics to jczpb 4 2 channel improvement projects on beach evolution to implement the state of the waterway regulation project the sandbar evolution process was divided into two periods the first is the project pre implementation period when the river channel was in a quasi natural state and the second was the post channel project implementation period because of the different project implementation time points at various sandbars the cut off years between the periods were different as well the revealed evolution of the sandbar linkages are as follows 1 linkage between tpkcb sbt and llzpb fig 16 a before implementation of the channel project the area of the llzpb decreased and the tpkcb area increased r2 0 70 the channel project protected the boundary of the llzpb notably its area shrunk during mutual adaptation between the project and riverbed topography however the area was still larger than during the initial stage of project implementation 2011 the correlation between the areas of sbt and the tpkcb was relatively weak with their intersection correlating to changes in the tpkcb area r2 0 47 moreover it was weaker than the linkage to the llzpb area meanwhile the distance between the head section of the tpkcb and jingzhou yangtze river bridge was positively correlated with the upper section of the llzpb retreat distance r2 0 59 a summary of areal changes further indicated a strongly evolved relationship of the linkage between the tpkcb and llzpb it was observed that erosion and retreat of the upper llzpb section were controlled after the implementation of the waterway regulation project regardless of whether the head section of the tpkcb had retreated the distance between the upper section of the llzpb and the right bank was relatively stable fig 8c 2 linkage between llzpb and sbt fig 16b the llzpb was divided into upper and lower sections with a strong evolutionary relationship between their areas r2 0 62 characterized by changes in erosion at the head section deposition at the tail section the evolution of the linkage between llzpb and sbt was not significantly correlated in this area and remained weak even post implementation of the protection project in the lower section of the llzpb r2 0 32 there was a strong relationship in linkage evolution between sbt and the lower section of the llzpb r2 0 97 which remained strong after implementation of the protection project in the lower section of llzpb r2 0 64 that is the llzpb lower section was widened by deposition while the sbt area shrunk regarding the cross section area the lower section of the llzpb widened by deposition and the right edge of the old sbt eroded backward and shifted left gradually forming the new sbt 3 linkage between the jczpb sbt and llzpb fig 16c and 16d the area of jczpb was related to the total area of sbt and the llzpb r2 0 36 although it was more closely related to sbt r2 0 51 there was good correlation between the reduction area of jcz and the widening deposition area of the lower section of the llzpb r2 0 83 as well as the receding right edge of sbt r2 0 87 this indicated a stronger relationship between the areal changes of the jczpb and morphological adjustments in the upstream sandbars because the widening of the lower section of llzpb due to deposition pushed the water flow toward the right edge of sbt and led to its erosion during this period the hydrodynamic axis of the main stem of jczpb was in the center of the river channel caused erosion in the jczpb head section as the lower section of the llzpb was eroding the hydrodynamic axis of the main stem moved downward closer to the right bank entered the main stem of jcz and shifted toward the left bank of the channel during this period e g 1975 jcz existed in a relatively large and complete form of a right bank point bar 4 3 branching channel diversion beach evolution and anthropogenic activities 4 3 1 tpkcb based on the classification of branch diversion properties han et al 2018 the south branch of sbt is a flood prone branch i e the increase in the number of flood flow days promotes the development of the south branch during 2004 2012 2012 2014 and 2014 2018 the diversion ratio of the south branch of sbt experienced a change process it first decreased and then increased to stabilize it has been shown yang et al 2018c that after the commencement of the three gorges project the number of days of flood flow duration at the shashi hydrological station showed a decreasing trend overall the decrease in the number of sustained days of flood flow is contradictory to the change in the diversion ratio of the southern branch of sbt i e the relationship between the adjustment of the diversion ratio of sbt branch channel and the adjustment of the flow process after the commencement of the three gorges project was not significant since 1986 the silting up of the tpkcb gradually developed a central bar by 1993 with its bar position and shape progressively stabilizing fig 17 after the flood of 1998 the head of the tpkcb was extended upward by 1900 m in 2003 the three gorges reservoir commenced operations the head of the tpkcb retreated from 2003 to 2009 corresponding to a decrease in the north branch diversion ratio during the dry season fig 17 in 2010 2018 the head of the tpkcb steadily retreated and the north branch diversion ratio during the dry season increased fig 17 since 2010 the relationship between the north branch diversion ratio and the head location of the tpkcb has been significantly different from that in 2003 2009 primarily because of sand mining activities in the north branch increasing channel volume which in turn increased the north branch diversion thus the decrease in the north branch diversion ratio was caused by the downstream shift of the head position of the tpkcb in 2003 2009 and the increase in sand mining activities since 2010 was the dominant factor of the increasing ratio 4 3 2 channel diversion relationship between the tpkcb and sbt branches the diversion relationship between the tpkcb and sbt branching channels in 2001 2018 since the formation of the tpkcb was as follows when the diversion ratio of the northern branch of the tpkcb was 45 the ratio was greater than that of the northern branch of the sbt that is a portion of the flow from the northern branch of the tpkcb entered the southern branch of the sbt fig 18 a in 2001 2003 the average diversion ratio in the northern branch of the tpkcb was 59 25 of this water entered the southern branch of the sbt during this period the tpkcb was developing and sbt was scouring however the bar size was still relatively large and the middle and upper sections of the llzpb were fairly constant overall the beach pattern and branching channel diversion relationship at the shashi reach were in a relatively stable state when the diversion ratio of the north branch of the tpkcb was equal to 45 the ratio was equal to the diversion ratio of the northern branch of the sbt that is the flow in the northern and southern branches of the tpkcb entered the northern and southern branches of the sbt respectively fig 18b in 2004 2006 the tpkcb was in a silting up state the head of the llzpb was scoured and its tail was silted up from 2004 to 2005 the changjiang waterway bureau guarded sbt and with beach pattern stabilization regional beach scouring in the southern sub pier was significant in the downstream section the llzpb was in a silting up posture which together allowed the position of sbt to shift to the left bank side overall the channel shoal patterns and diversion relationships in the branching channels of the shashi reach were in a transitional period in 2004 2006 when the diversion ratio of the northern branch of the tpkcb was less than 45 the ratio was smaller than that of the northern branch of sbt that is a part of the flow in the southern branch of the tpkcb entered the northern branch of the sbt fig 18c during the period 2007 2013 the area of tpkcb reached its maximum in 2008 and turned into a significant scouring pattern in 2009 2013 from 2010 to 2013 the guarding of the upper section of the llzpb and the left bank shore protection project caused the main stream of the sbt branching channel section to shift to the left bank side and 11 of the water in the southern branch of the tpkcb entered the northern branch of sbt during this period the lower section of the llzpb was in a silting up state and the continuous shrinkage caused the south side of sbt to scour and shrink in size forming a new sbt and making the diversion relationship of the sbt branching channel section unstable in 2014 2018 there were significant differences in the diversion relationship between the tpkcb and sbt branching channels from that of the three preceding periods in 2001 2013 fig 18d from 2013 to 2018 the tpkcb maintained a scouring pattern but the channel sections in the middle section of the llzpb and sbt were guarded and reinforced in an attempt to regulate the diversion relationship between the tpkcb and sbt branching channels however in 2014 2018 the yljpb developed between the outlet of the northern branch of tpkcb and the inlet of the northern branch of the sbt creating a weak flow between the branches and with 21 of the flow from the northern branch of the tpkcb entering the south branch of sbt as a large alluvial river the yangtze river has a number of riverside beaches and middle channel bars in the evolution process of long river reaches there is a strong correlation between the evolution of riverside beaches and middle channel bars especially in the reaches of sandy bed near the dam at the same time the comprehensive impacts of channel regulation bridge engineering sand mining activities and dredging increase the complexity of the evolution relationship between riverside beaches and middle channel bars the investigation treats the implementation of the channel regulation project as the time node and the important human activities have been take into consideration such as sand mining and dredging and the impact of human activities on the time differences of the evolution relationship between riverside beaches and middle channel bars in the first sandy reach of the yangtze river 5 conclusions 1 in 1955 2018 the amount of sediment from the river basin decreased and in 1975 2018 the shashi reach experienced increased erosion low water channel erosion accounted for 93 1 of total channel erosion sandbar areas showed similar trends decreasing with the amount of sediment transportation and river channel erosion since 2009 riverbed scour intensity has increased sand mining in the river channel accounted for 15 9 of the riverbed scour of the flat shoal whereas dredging and mud dumping had a relatively small impact on the river channel scour 2 since the operation of the three gorges project river channel patterns of the shashi reach gradually evolved from the erosion of low shoal and deposition or minimal changes in the high shoals to both low and high shoal erosion in 1975 2018 along with channel erosion and increases in deep channel areas thalweg incision and decreases in river morphological coefficients the riverbeds narrowed and deepened 3 before implementation of the waterway regulation project there was a relationship between the evolution of linkages among sandbar groups the development of the tpkcb and the downward shift of its head section caused the upper section of the llzpb to recede and decrease the channel bar development and shift also increased and widened the tail section of the llzpb leading to area shrinkage of sbt and erosion of its right edge the combination of changes to the morphologies and areas of sbt with the lower section of the llzpb caused jczpb to evolve from a point to a channel bar after implementation of the channel project the relationship between the evolutions of linkages among sandbar groups gradually weakened owing to the decreasing relationship between the tpkcb and llzpb recently the lower section of the llzpb has widened due to deposition and sbt continues to decrease in area and recede along its right edge causing the area of jczpb to shrink and separate credit authorship contribution statement yunping yang
