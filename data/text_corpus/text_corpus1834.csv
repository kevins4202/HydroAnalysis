9170,grain mechanical harvesting can decrease the harvest cost and improve the efficiency of maize production however the optimization of the sowing date and irrigation schedule of maize in existing studies rarely considered the grain mechanical harvesting therefore the sowing date and irrigation schedule of two maize cultivars in three cropping systems was optimized by considering yield water use efficiency wue and grain mechanical harvesting the quality of grain mechanical harvesting is mainly influenced by grain moisture content thus agricultural production systems simulator apsim was coupled with a grain dry down model to simulate maize production in the northern part of the north china plain ncp the latest date for grain mechanical harvesting of maize was analyzed using the date when the grain moisture content decreased to 25 for the first time dcm25 the dcm25 yield wue and irrigation amount were used as constraints in the optimization the results showed that the optimal sowing dates under full irrigation of spring maize in sm monocropping maize system spring maize and summer maize in wmm winter wheat summer maize spring maize system for huanong887 were from 6th may to 10th june from 6th may to 16th may and 10th june respectively the optimal sowing dates of spring maize in sm were from 1st may to 5th june for zhengdan958 the summer maize in dwm winter wheat summer maize double cropping system could not achieve high quality grain mechanical harvesting when using huanong887 and zhengdan958 in different hydrological year types the optimal irrigation schedule with grain mechanical harvesting involved irrigation 80 mm each time 1 3 times during sowing jointing and flowering stages of spring maize in sm and summer maize in wmm for spring maize in wmm the optimal irrigation schedule involved irrigation 2 3 times during sowing jointing and flowering stages the optimization method could provide a reference for other sites to promote high

available on request 1 introduction the expanding global population makes it necessary to produce more food and promote sustainable agriculture godfray et al 2010 however the increasing water scarcity has hindered food production and induced many ecological issues kang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 in addition reduced rural populations due to urbanization population aging and increased labor cost have limited food production akdemir et al 2021 guo et al 2015 maize is one of the most important cereals worldwide and plays a crucial role in feeding the increasing population and livestock and acting as a biofuel resource meng et al 2016 shiferaw et al 2011 the cropping system musokwa and mafongoya 2021 sun et al 2019 sowing date gao et al 2021 sun et al 2016 irrigation strategy wang et al 2017a westgate 1994 and environment zhao et al 2018 significantly impact the growth and production of maize xin and tao 2019 therefore it is necessary to systematically optimize management practices such as sowing date and irrigation in different cropping systems according to the regional environmental characteristics to achieve water saving high yield and high efficiency maize production compared with manual harvesting and ear mechanical harvesting high quality grain mechanical harvesting can improve the harvest efficiency and decrease the production cost and yield loss of maize by eliminating the intermediate steps such as ear transportation drying and threshing however the maize production area using this technique in developing countries is very limited for example this area in china was less than 5 in 2017 wang et al 2021 grain moisture content is closely related to the quality of grain mechanical harvesting dictated by the broken grain rate total loss rate and impurity rate wang et al 2020a according to the chinese national standard the broken grain rate should be 5 the total loss rate should be 5 and the impurity rate should be 3 and the appropriate grain moisture content for grain mechanical harvesting in china is 15 25 gb t 21962 2008 wang et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2021 plett 1994 also indicated that when the grain moisture content was between 18 and 23 the broken grain rate was the lowest however higher grain moisture content at maturity or harvest lowers the quality of grain mechanical harvesting and limits its development the dry down process of maize grain can be divided into two phases the first phase is before physiological maturity which is driven by grain filling the second phase is after physiological maturity which is driven by meteorological factors such as temperature and relative humidity martinez feria et al 2019 wang et al 2017b made a literature review on influencing factors on the kernel dehydration rate of maize hybrids they found that the maize grain moisture content at harvest was controlled by the grain dry down rate around physiological maturity this characteristic is heritable with significant differences among cultivars grain dry down rate was influenced by agronomic traits of maize cultivars e g length and thickness of bract thickness of cob shape of kernel and size of ear environment e g air humidity temperature solar radiation wind speed and rainfall and management practices e g sowing date plant density row spacing irrigation and fertilization wang et al 2017b indicated that the proper time for grain mechanical harvesting could be predicted by maize grain moisture content at physiological maturity and grain dry down rate after physiological maturity they also suggested that the maize cultivars with characteristics of suitable early maturity and rapid drying rate of ear and low grain moisture content at physiological maturity should be selected to realize grain mechanical harvesting in china however how to consider grain mechanical harvesting in optimization of crop management was still rarely studied the north china plain ncp is an important cereal production area in china jeong et al 2014 sun et al 2016 and produces approximately 30 of the national maize and wheat zhang et al 2021 for the past four decades the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system dwm has been the main cropping system in the ncp however the continuous adoption of dwm resulted in groundwater overdraft mainly due to the pumping of groundwater in the wheat season to make up for the rainfall shortage sun et al 2019 to reduce groundwater overdraft farmers in these areas have recently begun adopting the winter wheat summer maize spring maize system three crops in two years wmm and the monocropping maize system sm with the encouragement of the government in 2018 the percentage of double cropping system and single cropping system was about 80 and 20 respectively zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 moreover the irrigation schedule also needs to be optimized to conserve groundwater compared with dwm and full irrigation wheat fallow in wmm and sm and deficit irrigation has reduced the annual yield and income of the farmers while grain mechanical harvesting can greatly save labor cost there is an urgent need to realize maize grain mechanical harvesting in the ncp to increase production efficiency and compensate for some income loss caused by fallow however grain mechanical harvesting is still rarely used in this area mainly due to the high grain moisture content at harvest wang et al 2019b 2021 in the ncp summer maize can only be sown in summer after wheat harvesting in dwm and wmm is always sown in mid june after wheat harvest sun et al 2007 xin and tao 2019 spring maize can be sown from spring to summer after winter fallow in wmm and sm can be sown as early as late march gao et al 2021 random changes in the sowing date may suffer from spring drought and temperature stress appearing in the ncp which will lead to fluctuations in the yield water use efficiency wue and physiological maturity date of maize sun et al 2016 xin and tao 2019 therefore it is necessary to optimize the sowing date and irrigation schedule of maize in different cropping systems to increase the yield wue and production efficiency under rainfed conditions the optimal sowing date of summer maize in dwm is from 17th june to 29th june according to the simulated average yield of maize and wheat in 1981 2009 the extended length of the grain filling stage was considered the main factor contributing to the increased yield compared with the earlier sowing date however the effect of increased rainfall in late june was not discussed xin and tao 2019 irrigating only once at sowing could mitigate drought ensure normal emergence and achieve a relatively high yield of summer maize sun et al 2014 yan et al 2020 and the optimal sowing window of summer maize in dwm was determined to be from 30th may to 14th june based on the simulated yield sun et al 2016 in the future the rising temperature could postpone the optimal sowing date of summer maize in dwm to 30th june for the highest yield and to 5th july for the highest wue under full irrigation xiao et al 2020 for spring maize in sm a high maize yield was obtained when sown in early and mid april in a two year field experiment under full irrigation gao et al 2021 a high simulated yield in 1988 2017 was obtained when the sowing date of spring maize in sm was between early april and late may owing to the sufficient solar radiation and accumulated temperature gao et al 2021 however most studies on the sowing date and irrigation schedule of maize in the ncp have been conducted only with one cropping system and have used a single index either yield or wue moreover few studies have considered grain mechanical harvesting when optimizing the sowing date and irrigation schedule of maize grain mechanical harvesting can improve harvesting efficiency and save labor cost of maize production however when optimizing the sowing date and irrigation schedule of maize few studies have considered grain mechanical harvesting moreover the way for considering grain mechanical harvesting in the optimization was also rarely studied therefore the objective of this study was to optimize the sowing date and irrigation schedule of different maize cultivars in different cropping systems to achieve high quality grain mechanical harvesting obtain high yield and save water in the northern part of the ncp agricultural production systems simulator apsim was coupled with a grain dry down model to achieve this objective the main novelty of this study was using dmc25 the date when the grain moisture content decreases to 25 for the first time and dp25 the probability that dmc25 is not after the latest harvest date as constraints to achieve high quality grain mechanical harvesting in optimization of the sowing date and irrigation schedule 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments and four maize types in three cropping systems the sowing date experiments of maize were conducted from 2016 to 2018 at nanpi eco agricultural experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences 116 40 e 38 00 n in cangzhou china the station is located in the bohai sea area of the ncp with an altitude of 11 0 m the station has a semi humid monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 12 3 and an average annual precipitation of 520 mm the soil has a silt loam texture and the physical and chemical properties of soil are shown in table 1 maize cultivars of zhengdan958 and huanong887 were used in the sowing date experiment three sowing dates 1st may 15th may and 30th may in 2016 and five sowing dates 20th april 30th april 10th may 20th may and 30th may in 2017 and 2018 were set the plant density was 67500 plants ha 1 with a row spacing of 60 cm each treatment had three replicates and the plot area was 8 m 6 m with a randomized block arrangement irrigation was conducted before or after sowing according to the soil moisture content and precipitation the irrigation amount of each treatment is displayed in table 2 in 2016 a top dressing of 240 kg n ha 1 with urea 46 n was applied at the booting stage in 2017 and 2018 basal fertilizer of 240 kg n ha 1 with urea 225 kg ha 1 and diammonium phosphate 750 kg ha 1 n p k 18 46 0 was applied on 19th april before rotary tillage other field management measures were consistent with local practices the dates of maize jointing flowering and physiological maturity were observed in 2016 and 2018 soil moisture content was measured by the soil sampling method at sowing and physiological maturity of spring maize with a layer of 20 cm interval and a sampling depth of 100 cm the soil water balance method sun et al 2010 was used to calculate the water consumption of spring maize in the whole growth period of each treatment the daily precipitation temperature solar radiation relative humidity wind speed and other basic meteorological data from 2016 to 2018 were recorded by an automatic meteorological station at physiological maturity from 2016 to 2018 and the flowering stage in 2018 three representative maize plants were selected from each plot the total biomass was determined after heating at 105 for 30 min and drying at 80 to a constant weight at physiological maturity from 2016 to 2018 the middle four rows in the length of 3 m were selected for yield measurement in each plot there were four types of maize cropping mode in dwm wmm and sm fig 1 the first type was summer maize in dwm both its sowing and harvesting were limited by the winter wheat the second type was summer maize in wmm only its sowing was limited by the winter wheat and the harvesting was not limited by the winter wheat because of the fallow from october to the spring of the coming year the third type was spring maize in wmm only its harvesting was limited by the winter wheat and the sowing was not limited by the winter wheat because of the fallow from october of the previous year the last type was spring maize in sm neither its sowing nor harvesting was limited by the winter wheat because of the fallow from october to the spring of the coming year for the spring maize in sm grain mechanical harvesting was easily achieved as the sowing and harvesting was not constrained by winter wheat however the yield of sm per year was low compared with dmw and wmm the wmm could mitigate the groundwater overdraft and ensure food safety the wmm may also guarantee income of farmers when adopting grain mechanical harvesting and saving labor cost however the harvesting of spring maize in wmm was constrained by winter wheat sowing and the sowing of summer maize in wmm was constrained by winter wheat harvesting 2 2 climate data and division of hydrological year type the daily meteorological data of botou station from 1961 to 2020 were obtained from china meteorological data service center including daily air pressure maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature precipitation relative humidity wind direction and wind speed and sunshine hours the estimated solar radiation was calculated by the latitude altitude days in a year and sunshine hours of the station allen et al 1998 el shirbeny et al 2022 valipour 2017 according to the pearson type iii distribution model precipitation with an exceedance probability of 25 50 and 75 for annual precipitation was 589 mm 495 mm and 402 mm respectively sun et al 2010 the precipitation year is considered a wet year wet normal year dry normal year and dry year when the annual precipitation is more than 589 mm between 495 mm and 589 mm between 402 mm and 495 mm and less than 402 mm respectively 2 3 apsim model the apsim model was developed by the agricultural production systems research unit of australia as a component driven model it contains several modules and can simulate crop growth soil water and soil nitrogen under different management practices cropping systems and environments in a daily time step holzworth et al 2014 keating et al 2003 many studies have tested and applied apsim to simulate agricultural production systems in the ncp luo et al 2018 sun et al 2016 xiao et al 2020 yan et al 2020 the input data of the model are daily meteorological data e g solar radiation maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation and relative humidity as well as soil hydraulic parameters e g bulk density saturated water content field water capacity and wilting point as shown in table 1 the model can output information such as physiological maturity or death date yield and evapotranspiration of maize the wue of maize can be calculated as follows 1 w u e y 10 e t where wue is the water use efficiency kg m 3 y is the yield kg ha 1 et is the evapotranspiration mm the phenophases evapotranspiration biomass and yield data of maize in the sowing date experiments from 2016 to 2018 were used to calibrate and validate maize cultivar parameters in the apsim model the classification of the calibration and validation datasets is shown in table 2 the calibration results of zhengdan958 and huanong887 are shown in table 3 the comparison of the observed and simulated values of phenophases evapotranspiration biomass and yield is shown in fig s1 and fig s2 the linear regression coefficient determination coefficient and relative root mean square error were used to evaluate the comparative effect of observed and simulated values in calibration and validation wang et al 2019a however apsim cannot simulate grain moisture content especially after maturity hence we introduced a grain dry down model after physiological maturity to estimate grain moisture content as described in the following section 2 4 grain dry down process after physiological maturity the grain moisture content of maize mainly influences the quality of grain mechanical harvesting the appropriate grain moisture content for grain mechanical harvesting in china is 15 25 gb t 21962 2008 wang et al 2019b wang et al 2021 the grain dry down process of maize is driven by grain filling before physiological maturity and by temperature and relative humidity after physiological maturity martinez feria et al 2019 the grain moisture content of maize at physiological maturity is around 30 brooking 1990 borrás and westgate 2006 wang et al 2020b different sowing dates and irrigation schedules result in different growth periods and maturity dates of maize which then cause different meteorological conditions during the grain dry down process after physiological maturity therefore the date when the grain moisture content of maize decreases to 25 should be considered in optimizing the sowing date and irrigation schedule based on the diffusion theory fick s second law henderson and perry 1966 proposed a model simulating the grain dry down of maize after physiological maturity the model was modified to the following form by martinez feria et al 2019 2 m x m 0 m e e k x m e where m is the grain moisture content of maize m 0 is the grain moisture content of maize at physiological maturity k is the diffusion coefficient which indicates the rate of grain dry down x is the number of days after physiological maturity m e is the equilibrium moisture content the m 0 and k are 31 89 and 0 023 respectively for zhengdan958 and 29 26 and 0 036 respectively for huanong887 wang et al 2020b the dynamic of m e can be calculated as 3 m e ln 1 r h 100 a t b 1 c where rh is the daily relative humidity t is the daily average temperature a b and c are empirical constants and equal to 0 0001557 45 5 and 2 respectively martinez feria et al 2019 the model was used to calculate the date when the grain moisture content of maize decreased to 25 after physiological maturity because the model can simulate the phenomenon in which the grain moisture content increases due to rainfall or fog the date when the grain moisture content decreases to 25 for the first time dmc25 was used as the criterion for judging the suitable date of grain mechanical harvesting the grain dry down model and apsim can be coupled to optimize the sowing date and irrigation schedule of maize in different cropping systems for grain mechanical harvesting 2 5 optimization of sowing date the base temperature for maize growth is 8 c lizaso et al 2007 the average date from 1961 to 2020 is between 22nd march and 8th november when the 10 day moving average temperature is higher than 8 c fig 2a therefore the sowing date was set every 5 days from 22nd march to 5th july xiao et al 2020 with a total of 22 sowing dates in the apsim model the planting density was set at 67500 plants ha 1 all sowing dates were simulated from 1961 1 1 to 2020 12 31 the initial soil water content was set at 40 of the maximum available water and the nitrogen application rate was 240 kg ha 1 it is assumed that there was no stress from diseases pests and weeds in the model the full irrigation fi was conducted as follows xiao et al 2020 4 i r r i 0 w h e n taw a w d 80 m m taw a w t w h e n taw awd 80 m m where irri is the irrigation amount mm taw is the total available soil water in the root zone mm awt is the available soil water in the root zone in each day mm the

of years from 1961 to 2020 when determining the optimal sowing date or is the total number of years of each hydrological year type when optimizing the irrigation schedule the sowing dates under which yr wuer and dp25 are all not lower than 95 are considered optimal for grain mechanical harvesting 2 6 optimization of irrigation schedule in different hydrological year types the representative optimal sowing dates under different cropping systems were selected to optimize the irrigation schedule there were four irrigation scenarios i1 irrigating at sowing i2 i1 irrigating at jointing i3 i2 irrigating at tasseling i4 i3 irrigation at the beginning of grain filling the amount of each irrigation was 80 mm the average yield wue irrigation amount and dp25 of each hydrological year type were selected as the evaluation indexes when the grain mechanical harvesting of maize was limited by wheat sowing when it was not limited by wheat sowing the average yield wue and irrigation amount of each hydrological year type were selected as the evaluation indexes to eliminate the dimensional effect between different indicators the positive indexes i e yield wue and dp25 were normalized according to formula 8 while the negative index i e irrigation amount was normalized according to formula 9 wang et al 2020a technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis was used to evaluate the irrigation schedule liu et al 2021 the weight of each evaluation index was set equal the irrigation schedule with the highest comprehensive score among i1 i4 was considered the optimal irrigation schedule the topsis was implemented in python software 8 x i j a i j min j a i j max j a i j min j a i j 9 x i j max j a i j a i j max j a i j min j a i j where x ij is the normalized value of the i th treatment on the j th evaluation index a ij is the value of the i th treatment on the j th evaluation index 3 results 3 1 latest date for the grain mechanical harvesting of maize in different cropping systems the latest date for grain mechanical harvesting can be a key constraint when optimizing the management practices for achieving high quality grain mechanical harvesting therefore the latest date for the grain mechanical harvesting of the four maize types in the three cropping systems should be discussed and determined for summer maize in dwm and spring maize in wmm the optimal sowing time of the next crop i e wheat is around 10th october therefore the latest harvest time of maize should be considered in the management to achieve grain mechanical harvesting in normal production it takes at least 5 days for maize harvesting irrigation and soil preparation before wheat sowing therefore the dmc25 of summer maize in dwm and spring maize in wmm should not be later than 5th october after physiological maturity of summer maize in wmm and spring maize in sm the next crop will not be sown until next spring therefore the period for grain dry down can be very long and the sowing of the next crop is not a limiting factor for grain dry down eqs 2 and 3 show that the difference between grain moisture content and equilibrium moisture content me is the driving force for grain dry down after physiological maturity the me is closely related to atmospheric temperature and relative humidity fig 2b shows that the me from 20th april to 20th september is mainly related to relative humidity and the me in other periods is affected by both relative humidity and temperature the main period of grain dry down is from september to november every year for september october and november the monthly average relative humidity is 70 0 64 9 and 64 8 respectively the monthly average temperature is 21 0 c 14 3 c and 5 6 c respectively and the monthly average me is 10 8 10 6 and 11 5 respectively fig 2c shows that even with a relative humidity of 80 and air temperature of 25 c the me is 22 5 which is lower than 25 therefore the grain moisture content of maize can be reduced to 25 in winter fig 2d shows that the dmc25 of zhengdan958 and huanong887 in the period of september november is 18 days and 8 days after physiological maturity respectively therefore from the perspective of grain moisture content the latest harvest time can be ignored in the management for grain mechanical harvesting of summer maize in wmm and spring maize in sm 3 2 the yield wue maturity or death date modd and grain dry down performance of maize for different sowing dates the highest yield of zhengdan958 and huanong887 was 10901 3 kg ha 1 and 10773 3 kg ha 1 respectively when sown on 22nd march fig 3a and fig 4a with a delay in the sowing date the yield of spring maize decreased gradually the yield was significantly less than the highest yield when sown after 11th may for zhengdan958 and sown after 16th may for huanong887 the yield of zhengdan958 and huanong887 sown on 31st may was 10516 4 and 10675 2 kg ha 1 respectively the yr of zhengdan958 was 95 1 and 92 1 fig 5a when sown on 5th june and 10st june with a yield of 10366 9 kg ha 1 and 10040 2 kg ha 1 respectively the yr of huanong887 was 96 3 and 93 7 fig 5b when sown on 10th june and 15th june with a yield of 10557 3 kg ha 1 and 10274 7 kg ha 1 respectively starting from 5th june for zhengdan958 and 10th june for huanong887 the yield decreased significantly with every 5 day delay in the sowing date and the decline was in the range of 326 7 1161 8 kg ha 1 for zhengdan958 and 282 6 1278 4 kg ha 1 for huanong887 the highest wue of zhengdan958 and huanong887 was 1 88 kg m 3 and 2 00 kg m 3 when sown on 31st may respectively fig 3b and fig 4b with an advance or delay in the sowing date the wue decreased gradually the wue was significantly less than the highest value for zhengdan958 when sown before 11th may and after 15th june the wue was significantly less than the highest value for huanong887 when sown before 11th may and after 20th june the wuer of zhengdan958 was 94 0 95 0 98 8 and 94 8 fig 5a when sown on 26th april 1st may 10th june and 15th june respectively with a wue of 1 77 kg m 3 1 79 kg m 3 1 86 kg m 3 and 1 79 kg m 3 respectively the wuer of huanong887 was 94 4 95 5 95 9 and 91 2 fig 5b when sown on 1st may 6th may 20th june and 25th june respectively with a wue of 1 89 kg m 3 1 91 kg m 3 1 92 kg m 3 and 1 82 kg m 3 respectively starting from 25th june for zhengdan958 and 30 h june for huanong887 the wue decreased significantly with every 5 day delay in the sowing date and the decline was in the range of 0 18 0 19 kg m 3 for zhengdan958 and 0 19 kg m 3 for huanong887 the average physiological maturity date of zhengdan958 and huanong887 sown on 22nd march was 23rd august and 15th august respectively the modd was significantly postponed with every 5 day delay in the sowing date fig 3c and fig 4c when the sowing date of zhengdan958 and huanong887 was delayed by 5 days from 31st may and 10th june respectively the postponing of modd was the greatest about 11 days there was no significant difference among modds of maize sown on and after 20th june for zhengdan958 and 25th june for huanong887 the dmc25 of zhengdan958 and huanong887 sown on 22nd march was 10th september and 23rd august respectively and the dmc25 was significantly postponed with every 5 day delay in the sowing date fig 3d and fig 4d the dp25 was 95 0 and 73 3 respectively for zhengdan958 sown on 26th april and 1st may fig 5a and was 98 3 and 81 7 respectively for huanong887 sown on 16th may and 21st may fig 5b the dmc25 of maize sown on and after 31st may for zhengdan958 and 15th june for huanong887 was not calculated because the probability of normal physiological maturity was less than 95 during 1961 2020 3 3 optimization of sowing date base on the criterion of yr and wuer both above 95 the optimal sowing dates of spring maize in sm were from 1st may to 5th june for zhengdan958 and 6th may to 10th june for huanong887 under the condition of full irrigation fig 5 base on the criterion of yr wuer and dp25 all above 95 the optimal sowing dates of spring maize in wmm were from 6th may to 16th may for huanong887 fig 5b however zhengdan958 has a long growth period high moisture content of grain at physiological maturity and slow grain dry down rate after physiological maturity accordingly the dp25 was greater than 95 only when zhengdan958 was sown before 26th april however the wuer of zhengdan958 was less than 95 when sown before 26th april therefore zhengdan958 as a spring maize cultivar in wmm needs to compromise wue under the grain mechanical harvesting condition fig 5a since the harvest time of previous wheat is in early june the sowing date of summer maize falls in the middle of june the yr and wuer of zhengdan958 was 92 1 and 98 8 respectively when sown on 10th june and was 85 6 and 94 8 respectively when sown on 15th june fig 5a the yr and wuer of huanong887 was 96 3 and 99 8 respectively when sown on 10th june and was 93 7 and 99 1 respectively when sown on 15th june fig 5b in wmm the harvest of summer maize is not affected by the sowing of winter wheat therefore to obtain a higher yield and wue under the grain mechanical harvesting condition summer maize in wmm should be sown as early as possible around 10th june huanong887 is the more optimal cultivar than zhengdan958 the harvest of summer maize in dwm is affected by the sowing of winter wheat the dp25 of the two cultivars was about 0 when sown in the middle of june making it difficult to achieve high quality grain mechanical harvesting therefore it is necessary to select summer maize cultivars with a shorter growth period lower m 0 higher k high yield and high wue the summary of the optimal sowing dates of two maize cultivars in each cropping system is presented in table 4 3 4 optimization of irrigation schedule in different hydrological year types the proportion of wet years wet normal years dry normal years and dry years was 28 33 17 60 26 67 16

4 1 effects of sowing date a lower temperature in the period from sowing to flowering of maize sown on an early date lengthens the vegetative growth period and a higher temperature in the period from flowering to maturity of maize sown on an early date slightly shortens the reproductive growth period table s2 and table s3 therefore more radiation is received by maize in the longer growing period leading to higher biomass and yield grassini et al 2009 however the temperature stress caused by low temperature during the vegetative stage may increase the risk of yield reduction the longer growth period also leads to higher et0 and et and the increase of et is greater than the increase of yield resulting in lower wue although the growth period is longer the modd and dmc25 are earlier due to the earlier sowing date with the delay in the sowing date the temperature in the period from sowing to flowering increases rapidly and the temperature in the period from flowering to maturity decreases slowly until 10th june table s2 and table s3 this trend is accompanied by the reduction of solar radiation and et0 which further leads to a decline in biomass yield and et due to the non uniform decrease in yield and et the wue reaches the highest value when sown on 31st may the length of the period from sowing to flowering decreases gradually and the length of the period from flowering to maturity increases gradually until 10th june and maize sown around 11th may has the shortest growth period when sown after 20th june the temperature in the period from sowing to flowering begins to decrease and the temperature in the period from flowering to maturity decreases rapidly the lower temperature results in a lower grain filling rate and even death before maturity further leading to a large reduction in yield the wue reduction is attributed to the non uniform decrease in yield and et the delayed sowing date and the increasing growth period of maize sown after 11th may result in delayed modd and dmc25 4 2 effects of irrigation as shown in fig 2b precipitation mainly occurs from july and august in the ncp and drought in spring is the main factor limiting crop growth sun et al 2010 gao et al 2018 the 50 80 of annual precipitation occurs from july to september which are the summer monsoon months in the ncp xiao et al 2017 therefore irrigation at sowing can mitigate the influence of drought in the early growth period in the ncp thus i1 is the optimal irrigation schedule for spring maize sown on 26th may and summer maize sown on 10th june in the wet and normal wet years whose proportion is 55 zhang et al 2006 indicated that full irrigation only at sowing of summer maize can provide relatively high yield in most year types in the ncp however spring maize sown on 11th may exhibits a long growth period under drought stress in spring because of the earlier sowing date irrigating only at sowing i1 may meet the water requirement of maize at the seedling stage but maize may undergo water deficit during the jointing stage which delays the growth and decreases yield and dp25 therefore additional irrigation at the jointing stage of maize sown on 11th may is needed for high yield wue and dp25 in some wet years much more precipitation in summer makes the degree of drought in spring similar to that of dry years and as such i2 is the optimal irrigation schedule of maize sown on 11th may in the wet years in the normally dry and dry years irrigation at the flowering stage is needed because of less precipitation and severer drought 4 3 characteristics of maize cultivar for grain mechanical harvesting maize cultivars with a long post flowering duration fast potential grain filling rate large maximum grain number and high radiation use efficiency may exhibit a high yield xiao et al 2020 however the yield may not be high for the cultivar only with a long post flowering duration e g zhengdan958 and it may be difficult to achieve grain mechanical harvesting growth duration m 0 and k are determinants of dmc25 wang et al 2019b reported that a higher translocation rate from stalk to grain results in a lower m 0 li et al 2018 believed that cultivars with shorter bract lower moisture content of cob at physiological maturity larger ear angle fewer grain number per ear and smaller grain can exhibit a higher grain dry down rate therefore under grain mechanical harvesting conditions the cultivar should have the proper growth duration fast potential grain filling rate proper maximum grain number high radiation use efficiency high biomass translocation rate short bract low moisture content of cob at physiological maturity large ear angle and small grain especially for spring maize in wmm and summer maize in dwm in addition to these characteristics lodging resistance is also a key characteristic of maize that needs to be considered to achieve high quality grain mechanical harvesting because the plant must stand in the field for some time after physiological maturity until grain dry down xue et al 2020 4 4 effects of climate change the increasing trend of temperature from 1961 2020 has accelerated the growth and development of maize fig s2 consequently the growth duration of maize has shown a significant decreasing trend when sown before mid june however the increasing temperature also increases the grain filling length of maize sown after mid june causing an increasing trend of the whole growth duration fig s3 the increasing temperature together with the decreasing rh could lead to a decreasing m e which accelerates grain dry down therefore the dmc25 shows a decreasing trend the decreasing trend of growth duration and solar radiation jointly decrease the yield of maize sown before mid june however the increasing grain filling rate and length due to the increasing temperature mitigate the effect of decreased solar radiation which can cause an increased yield of maize sown after mid june in the future the temperature will increase qiu et al 2021 and the solar radiation of the ncp will increase according to the result of a global climate model bcc csm2 mr under the fossil fueled development trends and representative concentration pathway 8 5 i e ssp5 85 xiao et al 2020 under this condition the physiological maturity date of maize may be earlier but the yield may not decrease moreover the yield of maize sown on a later date may even increase the rate of grain dry down after physiological maturity may be accelerated the dmc25 may be earlier and the dp25 of maize sown on a later date may be higher the increasing temperature can also lead to late sowing of wheat sun et al 2007 xin and tao 2019 consequently the optimal sowing date of maize may be postponed in the future and the summer maize in dwm can achieve grain mechanical harvesting even if the maize cultivar has a long growth duration a high m 0 and a low k 4 5 expansion and limitation of the study the dp25 along with yield wue or irrigation amount was used as constraints in optimizing the sowing date and irrigation schedule of the four maize types in the three cropping systems with two maize cultivars as the quality of grain mechanical harvesting was mainly affected by the grain moisture content wang et al 2019b the dp25 or the dcm25 was used as the key constraint to achieving high quality grain mechanical harvesting although the results of optimization at the specific site were not suitable for the whole of ncp the method could be used for reference in other places the appropriate grain moisture content for grain mechanical harvesting in china is 25 wang et al 2019b 2021 however plett 1994 also reported that the broken grain rate of mechanical harvesting is the lowest when the grain moisture content is between 18 and 23 therefore the dp25 or dmc25 can be changed e g dp23 or dmc23 according to the relationship between the quality of grain mechanical harvesting and grain moisture content grain moisture content was the most important factor for achieving grain mechanical harvesting and lodging resistance and ear rot were also important wang et al 2020a however since lodging resistance and ear rot failed to be simulated by models only the grain moisture content was considered by dcm25 and dp25 in the optimization of the sowing date and irrigation schedule to achieve grain mechanical harvesting 5 conclusions in the northern part of the ncp the dmc25 is about 8 18 days after physiological maturity from september to november the dmc25 should be no later than 5th october for summer maize in dwm and spring maize in wmm under the present meteorological conditions and normal management of wheat for summer maize in wmm and spring maize in sm the sowing of the next crop is not a limiting factor for grain dry down the criterion for optimizing the sowing date is that yr wuer and dp25 are all not lower than 95 in the northern part of the ncp the optimal sowing dates under full irrigation of spring maize in sm spring maize in wmm and summer maize in wmm for huanong887 are from 6th may to 10th june from 6th may to 16th may and 10th june respectively the optimal sowing dates of spring maize in sm are from 1st may to 5th june for zhengdan958 zhengdan958 is not a good cultivar in wmm under the grain mechanical harvesting condition because of the longer growth period higher m 0 and lower k for summer maize in dwm it is necessary to select new cultivars with a shorter growth period lower m 0 higher k high yield and high wue in the northern part of the ncp the irrigation schedules of huanong887 and zhengdan958 were optimized to achieve goals of high yield high wue saving water and high quality grain mechanical harvesting for spring maize in wmm sown on 11th may with huanong887 the optimal irrigation schedule in wet wet moderate dry moderate and dry years was 160 mm 160 mm 240 mm and 240 mm respectively with 80 mm each time at the sowing jointing and flowering stages for spring maize in sm sown on 26th may and summer maize in wmm sown 10th june with huanong887 the optimal irrigation schedule in wet wet moderate dry moderate and dry years was 80 mm 80 mm 160 mm and 240 mm respectively with 80 mm each time at the sowing jointing and flowering stages for spring maize in sm sown on 26th may with zhengdan958 the optimal irrigation schedule in wet wet moderate

9170,grain mechanical harvesting can decrease the harvest cost and improve the efficiency of maize production however the optimization of the sowing date and irrigation schedule of maize in existing studies rarely considered the grain mechanical harvesting therefore the sowing date and irrigation schedule of two maize cultivars in three cropping systems was optimized by considering yield water use efficiency wue and grain mechanical harvesting the quality of grain mechanical harvesting is mainly influenced by grain moisture content thus agricultural production systems simulator apsim was coupled with a grain dry down model to simulate maize production in the northern part of the north china plain ncp the latest date for grain mechanical harvesting of maize was analyzed using the date when the grain moisture content decreased to 25 for the first time dcm25 the dcm25 yield wue and irrigation amount were used as constraints in the optimization the results showed that the optimal sowing dates under full irrigation of spring maize in sm monocropping maize system spring maize and summer maize in wmm winter wheat summer maize spring maize system for huanong887 were from 6th may to 10th june from 6th may to 16th may and 10th june respectively the optimal sowing dates of spring maize in sm were from 1st may to 5th june for zhengdan958 the summer maize in dwm winter wheat summer maize double cropping system could not achieve high quality grain mechanical harvesting when using huanong887 and zhengdan958 in different hydrological year types the optimal irrigation schedule with grain mechanical harvesting involved irrigation 80 mm each time 1 3 times during sowing jointing and flowering stages of spring maize in sm and summer maize in wmm for spring maize in wmm the optimal irrigation schedule involved irrigation 2 3 times during sowing jointing and flowering stages the optimization method could provide a reference for other sites to promote high

available on request 1 introduction the expanding global population makes it necessary to produce more food and promote sustainable agriculture godfray et al 2010 however the increasing water scarcity has hindered food production and induced many ecological issues kang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 in addition reduced rural populations due to urbanization population aging and increased labor cost have limited food production akdemir et al 2021 guo et al 2015 maize is one of the most important cereals worldwide and plays a crucial role in feeding the increasing population and livestock and acting as a biofuel resource meng et al 2016 shiferaw et al 2011 the cropping system musokwa and mafongoya 2021 sun et al 2019 sowing date gao et al 2021 sun et al 2016 irrigation strategy wang et al 2017a westgate 1994 and environment zhao et al 2018 significantly impact the growth and production of maize xin and tao 2019 therefore it is necessary to systematically optimize management practices such as sowing date and irrigation in different cropping systems according to the regional environmental characteristics to achieve water saving high yield and high efficiency maize production compared with manual harvesting and ear mechanical harvesting high quality grain mechanical harvesting can improve the harvest efficiency and decrease the production cost and yield loss of maize by eliminating the intermediate steps such as ear transportation drying and threshing however the maize production area using this technique in developing countries is very limited for example this area in china was less than 5 in 2017 wang et al 2021 grain moisture content is closely related to the quality of grain mechanical harvesting dictated by the broken grain rate total loss rate and impurity rate wang et al 2020a according to the chinese national standard the broken grain rate should be 5 the total loss rate should be 5 and the impurity rate should be 3 and the appropriate grain moisture content for grain mechanical harvesting in china is 15 25 gb t 21962 2008 wang et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2021 plett 1994 also indicated that when the grain moisture content was between 18 and 23 the broken grain rate was the lowest however higher grain moisture content at maturity or harvest lowers the quality of grain mechanical harvesting and limits its development the dry down process of maize grain can be divided into two phases the first phase is before physiological maturity which is driven by grain filling the second phase is after physiological maturity which is driven by meteorological factors such as temperature and relative humidity martinez feria et al 2019 wang et al 2017b made a literature review on influencing factors on the kernel dehydration rate of maize hybrids they found that the maize grain moisture content at harvest was controlled by the grain dry down rate around physiological maturity this characteristic is heritable with significant differences among cultivars grain dry down rate was influenced by agronomic traits of maize cultivars e g length and thickness of bract thickness of cob shape of kernel and size of ear environment e g air humidity temperature solar radiation wind speed and rainfall and management practices e g sowing date plant density row spacing irrigation and fertilization wang et al 2017b indicated that the proper time for grain mechanical harvesting could be predicted by maize grain moisture content at physiological maturity and grain dry down rate after physiological maturity they also suggested that the maize cultivars with characteristics of suitable early maturity and rapid drying rate of ear and low grain moisture content at physiological maturity should be selected to realize grain mechanical harvesting in china however how to consider grain mechanical harvesting in optimization of crop management was still rarely studied the north china plain ncp is an important cereal production area in china jeong et al 2014 sun et al 2016 and produces approximately 30 of the national maize and wheat zhang et al 2021 for the past four decades the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system dwm has been the main cropping system in the ncp however the continuous adoption of dwm resulted in groundwater overdraft mainly due to the pumping of groundwater in the wheat season to make up for the rainfall shortage sun et al 2019 to reduce groundwater overdraft farmers in these areas have recently begun adopting the winter wheat summer maize spring maize system three crops in two years wmm and the monocropping maize system sm with the encouragement of the government in 2018 the percentage of double cropping system and single cropping system was about 80 and 20 respectively zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 moreover the irrigation schedule also needs to be optimized to conserve groundwater compared with dwm and full irrigation wheat fallow in wmm and sm and deficit irrigation has reduced the annual yield and income of the farmers while grain mechanical harvesting can greatly save labor cost there is an urgent need to realize maize grain mechanical harvesting in the ncp to increase production efficiency and compensate for some income loss caused by fallow however grain mechanical harvesting is still rarely used in this area mainly due to the high grain moisture content at harvest wang et al 2019b 2021 in the ncp summer maize can only be sown in summer after wheat harvesting in dwm and wmm is always sown in mid june after wheat harvest sun et al 2007 xin and tao 2019 spring maize can be sown from spring to summer after winter fallow in wmm and sm can be sown as early as late march gao et al 2021 random changes in the sowing date may suffer from spring drought and temperature stress appearing in the ncp which will lead to fluctuations in the yield water use efficiency wue and physiological maturity date of maize sun et al 2016 xin and tao 2019 therefore it is necessary to optimize the sowing date and irrigation schedule of maize in different cropping systems to increase the yield wue and production efficiency under rainfed conditions the optimal sowing date of summer maize in dwm is from 17th june to 29th june according to the simulated average yield of maize and wheat in 1981 2009 the extended length of the grain filling stage was considered the main factor contributing to the increased yield compared with the earlier sowing date however the effect of increased rainfall in late june was not discussed xin and tao 2019 irrigating only once at sowing could mitigate drought ensure normal emergence and achieve a relatively high yield of summer maize sun et al 2014 yan et al 2020 and the optimal sowing window of summer maize in dwm was determined to be from 30th may to 14th june based on the simulated yield sun et al 2016 in the future the rising temperature could postpone the optimal sowing date of summer maize in dwm to 30th june for the highest yield and to 5th july for the highest wue under full irrigation xiao et al 2020 for spring maize in sm a high maize yield was obtained when sown in early and mid april in a two year field experiment under full irrigation gao et al 2021 a high simulated yield in 1988 2017 was obtained when the sowing date of spring maize in sm was between early april and late may owing to the sufficient solar radiation and accumulated temperature gao et al 2021 however most studies on the sowing date and irrigation schedule of maize in the ncp have been conducted only with one cropping system and have used a single index either yield or wue moreover few studies have considered grain mechanical harvesting when optimizing the sowing date and irrigation schedule of maize grain mechanical harvesting can improve harvesting efficiency and save labor cost of maize production however when optimizing the sowing date and irrigation schedule of maize few studies have considered grain mechanical harvesting moreover the way for considering grain mechanical harvesting in the optimization was also rarely studied therefore the objective of this study was to optimize the sowing date and irrigation schedule of different maize cultivars in different cropping systems to achieve high quality grain mechanical harvesting obtain high yield and save water in the northern part of the ncp agricultural production systems simulator apsim was coupled with a grain dry down model to achieve this objective the main novelty of this study was using dmc25 the date when the grain moisture content decreases to 25 for the first time and dp25 the probability that dmc25 is not after the latest harvest date as constraints to achieve high quality grain mechanical harvesting in optimization of the sowing date and irrigation schedule 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments and four maize types in three cropping systems the sowing date experiments of maize were conducted from 2016 to 2018 at nanpi eco agricultural experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences 116 40 e 38 00 n in cangzhou china the station is located in the bohai sea area of the ncp with an altitude of 11 0 m the station has a semi humid monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 12 3 and an average annual precipitation of 520 mm the soil has a silt loam texture and the physical and chemical properties of soil are shown in table 1 maize cultivars of zhengdan958 and huanong887 were used in the sowing date experiment three sowing dates 1st may 15th may and 30th may in 2016 and five sowing dates 20th april 30th april 10th may 20th may and 30th may in 2017 and 2018 were set the plant density was 67500 plants ha 1 with a row spacing of 60 cm each treatment had three replicates and the plot area was 8 m 6 m with a randomized block arrangement irrigation was conducted before or after sowing according to the soil moisture content and precipitation the irrigation amount of each treatment is displayed in table 2 in 2016 a top dressing of 240 kg n ha 1 with urea 46 n was applied at the booting stage in 2017 and 2018 basal fertilizer of 240 kg n ha 1 with urea 225 kg ha 1 and diammonium phosphate 750 kg ha 1 n p k 18 46 0 was applied on 19th april before rotary tillage other field management measures were consistent with local practices the dates of maize jointing flowering and physiological maturity were observed in 2016 and 2018 soil moisture content was measured by the soil sampling method at sowing and physiological maturity of spring maize with a layer of 20 cm interval and a sampling depth of 100 cm the soil water balance method sun et al 2010 was used to calculate the water consumption of spring maize in the whole growth period of each treatment the daily precipitation temperature solar radiation relative humidity wind speed and other basic meteorological data from 2016 to 2018 were recorded by an automatic meteorological station at physiological maturity from 2016 to 2018 and the flowering stage in 2018 three representative maize plants were selected from each plot the total biomass was determined after heating at 105 for 30 min and drying at 80 to a constant weight at physiological maturity from 2016 to 2018 the middle four rows in the length of 3 m were selected for yield measurement in each plot there were four types of maize cropping mode in dwm wmm and sm fig 1 the first type was summer maize in dwm both its sowing and harvesting were limited by the winter wheat the second type was summer maize in wmm only its sowing was limited by the winter wheat and the harvesting was not limited by the winter wheat because of the fallow from october to the spring of the coming year the third type was spring maize in wmm only its harvesting was limited by the winter wheat and the sowing was not limited by the winter wheat because of the fallow from october of the previous year the last type was spring maize in sm neither its sowing nor harvesting was limited by the winter wheat because of the fallow from october to the spring of the coming year for the spring maize in sm grain mechanical harvesting was easily achieved as the sowing and harvesting was not constrained by winter wheat however the yield of sm per year was low compared with dmw and wmm the wmm could mitigate the groundwater overdraft and ensure food safety the wmm may also guarantee income of farmers when adopting grain mechanical harvesting and saving labor cost however the harvesting of spring maize in wmm was constrained by winter wheat sowing and the sowing of summer maize in wmm was constrained by winter wheat harvesting 2 2 climate data and division of hydrological year type the daily meteorological data of botou station from 1961 to 2020 were obtained from china meteorological data service center including daily air pressure maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature precipitation relative humidity wind direction and wind speed and sunshine hours the estimated solar radiation was calculated by the latitude altitude days in a year and sunshine hours of the station allen et al 1998 el shirbeny et al 2022 valipour 2017 according to the pearson type iii distribution model precipitation with an exceedance probability of 25 50 and 75 for annual precipitation was 589 mm 495 mm and 402 mm respectively sun et al 2010 the precipitation year is considered a wet year wet normal year dry normal year and dry year when the annual precipitation is more than 589 mm between 495 mm and 589 mm between 402 mm and 495 mm and less than 402 mm respectively 2 3 apsim model the apsim model was developed by the agricultural production systems research unit of australia as a component driven model it contains several modules and can simulate crop growth soil water and soil nitrogen under different management practices cropping systems and environments in a daily time step holzworth et al 2014 keating et al 2003 many

maize in the sowing date experiments from 2016 to 2018 were used to calibrate and validate maize cultivar parameters in the apsim model the classification of the calibration and validation datasets is shown in table 2 the calibration results of zhengdan958 and huanong887 are shown in table 3 the comparison of the observed and simulated values of phenophases evapotranspiration biomass and yield is shown in fig s1 and fig s2 the linear regression coefficient determination coefficient and relative root mean square error were used to evaluate the comparative effect of observed and simulated values in calibration and validation wang et al 2019a however apsim cannot simulate grain moisture content especially after maturity hence we introduced a grain dry down model after physiological maturity to estimate grain moisture content as described in the following section 2 4 grain dry down process after physiological maturity the grain moisture content of maize mainly influences the quality of grain mechanical harvesting the appropriate grain moisture content for grain mechanical harvesting in china is 15 25 gb t 21962 2008 wang et al 2019b wang et al 2021 the grain dry down process of maize is driven by grain filling before physiological maturity and by temperature and relative humidity after physiological maturity martinez feria et al 2019 the grain moisture content of maize at physiological maturity is around 30 brooking 1990 borrás and westgate 2006 wang et al 2020b different sowing dates and irrigation schedules result in different growth periods and maturity dates of maize which then cause different meteorological conditions during the grain dry down process after physiological maturity therefore the date when the grain moisture content of maize decreases to 25 should be considered in optimizing the sowing date and irrigation schedule based on the diffusion theory fick s second law henderson and perry 1966 proposed a model simulating the grain dry down of maize after physiological maturity the model was modified to the following form by martinez feria et al 2019 2 m x m 0 m e e k x m e where m is the grain moisture content of maize m 0 is the grain moisture content of maize at physiological maturity k is the diffusion coefficient which indicates the rate of grain dry down x is the number of days after physiological maturity m e is the equilibrium moisture content the m 0 and k are 31 89 and 0 023 respectively for zhengdan958 and 29 26 and 0 036 respectively for huanong887 wang et al 2020b the dynamic of m e can be calculated as 3 m e ln 1 r h 100 a t b 1 c where rh is the daily relative humidity t is the daily average temperature a b and c are empirical constants and equal to 0 0001557 45 5 and 2 respectively martinez feria et al 2019 the model was used to calculate the date when the grain moisture content of maize decreased to 25 after physiological maturity because the model can simulate the phenomenon in which the grain moisture content increases due to rainfall or fog the date when the grain moisture content decreases to 25 for the first time dmc25 was used as the criterion for judging the suitable date of grain mechanical harvesting the grain dry down model and apsim can be coupled to optimize the sowing date and irrigation schedule of maize in different cropping systems for grain mechanical harvesting 2 5 optimization of sowing date the base temperature for maize growth is 8 c lizaso et al 2007 the average date from 1961 to 2020 is between 22nd march and 8th november when the 10 day moving average temperature is higher than 8 c fig 2a therefore the sowing date was set every 5 days from 22nd march to 5th july xiao et al 2020 with a total of 22 sowing dates in the apsim model the planting density was set at 67500 plants ha 1 all sowing dates were simulated from 1961 1 1 to 2020 12 31 the initial soil water content was set at 40 of the maximum available water and the nitrogen application rate was 240 kg ha 1 it is assumed that there was no stress from diseases pests and weeds in the model the full irrigation fi was conducted as follows xiao et al 2020 4 i r r i 0 w h e n taw a w d 80 m m

of years from 1961 to 2020 when determining the optimal sowing date or is the total number of years of each hydrological year type when optimizing the irrigation schedule the sowing dates under which yr wuer and dp25 are all not lower than 95 are considered optimal for grain mechanical harvesting 2 6 optimization of irrigation schedule in different hydrological year types the representative optimal sowing dates under different cropping systems were selected to optimize the irrigation schedule there were four irrigation scenarios i1 irrigating at sowing i2 i1 irrigating at jointing i3 i2 irrigating at tasseling i4 i3 irrigation at the beginning of grain filling the amount of each irrigation was 80 mm the average yield wue irrigation amount and dp25 of each hydrological year type were selected as the evaluation indexes when the grain mechanical harvesting of maize was limited by wheat sowing when it was not limited by wheat sowing the average yield wue and irrigation amount of each hydrological year type were selected as the evaluation indexes to eliminate the dimensional effect between different indicators the positive indexes i e yield wue and dp25 were normalized according to formula 8 while the negative index i e irrigation amount was normalized according to formula 9 wang et al 2020a technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis was used to evaluate the irrigation schedule liu et al 2021 the weight of each evaluation index was set equal the irrigation schedule with the highest comprehensive score among i1 i4 was considered the optimal irrigation schedule the topsis was implemented in python software 8 x i j a i j min j a i j max j a i j min j a i j 9 x i j max j a i j a i j max j a i j min j a i j where x ij is the normalized value of the i th treatment on the j th evaluation index a ij is the value of the i th treatment on the j th evaluation index 3 results 3 1 latest date for the grain mechanical harvesting of maize in different cropping systems the latest date for grain mechanical harvesting can be a key constraint when optimizing the management practices for achieving high quality grain mechanical harvesting therefore the latest date for the grain mechanical harvesting of the four maize types in the three cropping systems should be discussed and determined for summer maize in dwm and spring maize in wmm the optimal sowing time of the next crop i e wheat is around 10th october therefore the latest harvest time of maize should be considered in the management to achieve grain mechanical harvesting in normal production it takes at least 5 days for maize harvesting irrigation and soil preparation before wheat sowing therefore the dmc25 of summer maize in dwm and spring maize in wmm should not be later than 5th october after physiological maturity of summer maize in wmm and spring maize in sm the next crop will not be sown until next spring therefore the period for grain dry down can be very long and the sowing of the next crop is not a limiting factor for grain dry down eqs 2 and 3 show that the difference between grain moisture content and equilibrium moisture content me is the driving force for grain dry down after physiological maturity the me is closely related to atmospheric temperature and relative humidity fig 2b shows that the me from 20th april to 20th september is mainly related to relative humidity and the me in other periods is affected by both relative humidity and temperature the main period of grain dry down is from september to november every year for september october and november the monthly average relative humidity is 70 0 64 9 and 64 8 respectively the monthly average temperature is 21 0 c 14 3 c and 5 6 c respectively and the monthly average me is 10 8 10 6 and 11 5 respectively fig 2c shows that even with a relative humidity of 80 and air temperature of 25 c the me is 22 5 which is lower than 25 therefore the grain moisture content of maize can be reduced to 25 in winter fig 2d shows that the dmc25 of zhengdan958 and huanong887 in the period of september november is 18 days and 8 days after physiological maturity respectively therefore from the perspective of grain moisture content the latest harvest time can be ignored in the management for grain mechanical harvesting of summer maize in wmm and spring maize in sm 3 2 the yield wue maturity or death date modd and grain dry down performance of maize for different sowing dates the highest yield of zhengdan958 and huanong887 was 10901 3 kg ha 1 and 10773 3 kg ha 1 respectively when sown on 22nd march fig 3a and fig 4a with a delay in the sowing date the yield of spring maize decreased gradually the yield was significantly less than the highest yield when sown after 11th may for zhengdan958 and sown after 16th may for huanong887 the yield of zhengdan958 and huanong887 sown on 31st may was 10516 4 and 10675 2 kg ha 1 respectively the yr of zhengdan958 was 95 1 and 92 1 fig 5a when sown on 5th june and 10st june with a yield of 10366 9 kg ha 1 and 10040 2 kg ha 1 respectively the yr of huanong887 was 96 3 and 93 7 fig 5b when sown on 10th june and 15th june with a yield of 10557 3 kg ha 1 and 10274 7 kg ha 1 respectively starting from 5th june for zhengdan958 and 10th june for huanong887 the yield decreased significantly with every 5 day delay in the sowing date and the decline was in the range of 326 7 1161 8 kg ha 1 for zhengdan958 and 282 6 1278 4 kg ha 1 for huanong887 the highest wue of zhengdan958 and huanong887 was 1 88 kg m 3 and 2 00 kg m 3 when sown on 31st may respectively fig 3b and fig 4b with an advance or delay in the sowing date the wue decreased gradually the wue was significantly less than the highest value for zhengdan958 when sown before 11th may and after 15th june the wue was significantly less than the highest value for huanong887 when sown before 11th may and after 20th june the wuer of zhengdan958 was 94 0 95 0 98 8 and 94 8 fig 5a when sown on 26th april 1st may 10th june and 15th june respectively with a wue of 1 77 kg m 3 1 79 kg m 3 1 86 kg m 3 and 1 79 kg m 3 respectively the wuer of huanong887 was 94 4 95 5 95 9 and 91 2 fig 5b when sown on 1st may 6th may 20th june and 25th june respectively with a wue of 1 89 kg m 3 1 91 kg m 3 1 92 kg m 3 and 1 82 kg m 3 respectively starting from 25th june for zhengdan958 and 30 h june for huanong887 the wue decreased significantly with every 5 day delay in the sowing date and the decline was in the range of 0 18 0 19 kg m 3 for zhengdan958 and 0 19 kg m 3 for huanong887 the average physiological maturity date of zhengdan958 and huanong887 sown on 22nd march was 23rd august and 15th august respectively the modd was significantly postponed with every 5 day delay in the sowing date fig 3c and fig 4c when the sowing date of zhengdan958 and huanong887 was delayed by 5 days from 31st may and 10th june respectively the postponing of modd was the greatest about 11 days there was no significant difference among modds of maize sown on and after 20th june for zhengdan958 and 25th june for huanong887 the dmc25 of zhengdan958 and huanong887 sown on 22nd march was 10th september and 23rd august respectively and the dmc25 was significantly postponed with every 5 day delay in the sowing date fig 3d and fig 4d the dp25 was 95 0 and 73 3 respectively for zhengdan958 sown on 26th april and 1st may fig 5a and was 98 3 and 81 7 respectively for huanong887 sown on 16th may and 21st may fig 5b the dmc25 of maize sown on and after 31st may for zhengdan958 and 15th june for huanong887 was not calculated because the probability of normal physiological maturity was less than 95 during 1961 2020 3 3 optimization of sowing date base on the criterion of yr and wuer both above 95 the optimal sowing dates of spring maize in sm were from 1st may to 5th june for zhengdan958 and 6th may to 10th june for huanong887 under the condition of full irrigation fig 5 base on the criterion of yr wuer and dp25 all above 95 the optimal sowing dates of spring maize in wmm were from 6th may to 16th may for huanong887 fig 5b however zhengdan958 has a long growth period high moisture content of grain at physiological maturity and slow grain dry down rate after physiological maturity accordingly the dp25 was greater than 95 only when zhengdan958 was sown before 26th april however the wuer of zhengdan958 was less than 95 when sown before 26th april therefore zhengdan958 as a spring maize cultivar in wmm needs to compromise wue under the grain mechanical harvesting condition fig 5a since the harvest time of previous wheat is in early june the sowing date of summer maize falls in the middle of june the yr and wuer of zhengdan958 was 92 1 and 98 8 respectively when sown on 10th june and was 85 6 and 94 8 respectively when sown on 15th june fig 5a the yr and wuer of huanong887 was 96 3 and 99 8 respectively when sown on 10th june and was 93 7 and 99 1 respectively when sown on 15th june fig 5b in wmm the harvest of summer maize is not affected by the sowing of winter wheat therefore to obtain a higher yield and wue under the grain mechanical harvesting condition summer maize in wmm should be sown as early as possible around 10th june huanong887 is the more optimal cultivar than zhengdan958 the harvest of summer maize in dwm is affected by the sowing of winter wheat the dp25 of the two cultivars was about 0 when sown in the middle of june making it difficult to achieve high quality grain mechanical harvesting therefore it is necessary to select summer maize cultivars with a shorter growth period lower m 0 higher k high yield and high wue the summary of the optimal sowing dates of two maize cultivars in each cropping system is presented in table 4 3 4 optimization of irrigation schedule in different hydrological year types the proportion of wet years wet normal years dry normal years and dry years was 28 33 17 60 26 67 16

respectively in conclusion compared with full irrigation the optimized irrigation schedules reduced the yield by 8 27 increased the wue by 7 02 and reduced the irrigation amount by 48 85 4 discussion 4 1 effects of sowing date a lower temperature in the period from sowing to flowering of maize sown on an early date lengthens the vegetative growth period and a higher temperature in the period from flowering to maturity of maize sown on an early date slightly shortens the reproductive growth period table s2 and table s3 therefore more radiation is received by maize in the longer growing period leading to higher biomass and yield grassini et al 2009 however the temperature stress caused by low temperature during the vegetative stage may increase the risk of yield reduction the longer growth period also leads to higher et0 and et and the increase of et is greater than the increase of yield resulting in lower wue although the growth period is longer the modd and dmc25 are earlier due to the earlier sowing date with the delay in the sowing date the temperature in the period from sowing to flowering increases rapidly and the temperature in the period from flowering to maturity decreases slowly until 10th june table s2 and table s3 this trend is accompanied by the reduction of solar radiation and et0 which further leads to a decline in biomass yield and et due to the non uniform decrease in yield and et the wue reaches the highest value when sown on 31st may the length of the period from sowing to flowering decreases gradually and the length of the period from flowering to maturity increases gradually until 10th june and maize sown around 11th may has the shortest growth period when sown after 20th june the temperature in the period from sowing to flowering begins to decrease and the temperature in the period from flowering to maturity decreases rapidly the lower temperature results in a lower grain filling rate and even death before maturity further leading to a large reduction in yield the wue reduction is attributed to the non uniform decrease in yield and et the delayed sowing date and the increasing growth period of maize sown after 11th may result in delayed modd and dmc25 4 2 effects of irrigation as shown in fig 2b precipitation mainly occurs from july and august in the ncp and drought in spring is the main factor limiting crop growth sun et al 2010 gao et al 2018 the 50 80 of annual precipitation occurs from july to september which are the summer monsoon months in the ncp xiao et al 2017 therefore irrigation at sowing can mitigate the influence of drought in the early growth period in the ncp thus i1 is the optimal irrigation schedule for spring maize sown on 26th may and summer maize sown on 10th june in the wet and normal wet years whose proportion is 55 zhang et al 2006 indicated that full irrigation only at sowing of summer maize can provide relatively high yield in most year types in the ncp however spring maize sown on 11th may exhibits a long growth period under drought stress in spring because of the earlier sowing date irrigating only at sowing i1 may meet the water requirement of maize at the seedling stage but maize may undergo water deficit during the jointing stage which delays the growth and decreases yield and dp25 therefore additional irrigation at the jointing stage of maize sown on 11th may is needed for high yield wue and dp25 in some wet years much more precipitation in summer makes the degree of drought in spring similar to that of dry years and as such i2 is the optimal irrigation schedule of maize sown on 11th may in the wet years in the normally dry and dry years irrigation at the flowering stage is needed because of less precipitation and severer drought 4 3 characteristics of maize cultivar for grain mechanical harvesting maize cultivars with a long post flowering duration fast potential grain filling rate large maximum grain number and high radiation use efficiency may exhibit a high yield xiao et al 2020 however the yield may not be high for the cultivar only with a long post flowering duration e g zhengdan958 and it may be difficult to achieve grain mechanical harvesting growth duration m 0 and k are determinants of dmc25 wang et al 2019b reported that a higher translocation rate from stalk to grain results in a lower m 0 li et al 2018 believed that cultivars with shorter bract lower moisture content of cob at physiological maturity larger ear angle fewer grain number per ear and smaller grain can exhibit a higher grain dry down rate therefore under grain mechanical harvesting conditions the cultivar should have the proper growth duration fast potential grain filling rate proper maximum grain number high radiation use efficiency high biomass translocation rate short bract low moisture content of cob at physiological maturity large ear angle and small grain especially for spring maize in wmm and summer maize in dwm in addition to these characteristics lodging resistance is also a key characteristic of maize that needs to be considered to achieve high quality grain mechanical harvesting because the plant must stand in the field for some time after physiological maturity until grain dry down xue et al 2020 4 4 effects of climate change the increasing trend of temperature from 1961 2020 has accelerated the growth and development of maize fig s2 consequently the growth duration of maize has shown a significant decreasing trend when sown before mid june however the increasing temperature also increases the grain filling length of maize sown after mid june causing an increasing trend of the whole growth duration fig s3 the increasing temperature together with the decreasing rh could lead to a decreasing m e which accelerates grain dry down therefore the dmc25 shows a decreasing trend the decreasing trend of growth duration and solar radiation jointly decrease the yield of maize sown before mid june however the increasing grain filling rate and length due to the increasing temperature mitigate the effect of decreased solar radiation which can cause an increased yield of maize sown after mid june in the future the temperature will increase qiu et al 2021 and the solar radiation of the ncp will increase according to the result of a global climate model bcc csm2 mr under the fossil fueled development trends and representative concentration pathway 8 5 i e ssp5 85 xiao et al 2020 under this condition the physiological maturity date of maize may be earlier but the yield may not decrease moreover the yield of maize sown on a later date may even increase the rate of grain dry down after physiological maturity may be accelerated the dmc25 may be earlier and the dp25 of maize sown on a later date may be higher the increasing temperature can also lead to late sowing of wheat sun et al 2007 xin and tao 2019 consequently the optimal sowing date of maize may be postponed in the future and the summer maize in dwm can achieve grain mechanical harvesting even if the maize cultivar has a long growth duration a high m 0 and a low k 4 5 expansion and limitation of the study the dp25 along with yield wue or irrigation amount was used as constraints in optimizing the sowing date and irrigation schedule of the four maize types in the three cropping systems with two maize cultivars as the quality of grain mechanical harvesting was mainly affected by the grain moisture content wang et al 2019b the dp25 or the dcm25 was used as the key constraint to achieving high quality grain mechanical harvesting although the results of optimization at the specific site were not suitable for the whole of ncp the method could be used for reference in other places the appropriate grain moisture content for grain mechanical harvesting in china is 25 wang et al 2019b 2021 however plett 1994 also reported that the broken grain rate of mechanical harvesting is the lowest when the grain moisture content is between 18 and 23 therefore the dp25 or dmc25 can be changed e g dp23 or dmc23 according to the relationship between the quality of grain mechanical harvesting and grain moisture content grain moisture content was the most important factor for achieving grain mechanical harvesting and lodging resistance and ear rot were also important wang et al 2020a however since lodging resistance and ear rot failed to be simulated by models only the grain moisture content was considered by dcm25 and dp25 in the optimization of the sowing date and irrigation schedule to achieve grain mechanical harvesting 5 conclusions in the northern part of the ncp the dmc25 is about 8 18 days after physiological maturity from september to november the dmc25 should be no later than 5th october for summer maize in dwm and spring maize in wmm under the present meteorological conditions and normal management of wheat for summer maize in wmm and spring maize in sm the sowing of the next crop is not a limiting factor for grain dry down the criterion for optimizing the sowing date is that yr wuer and dp25 are all not lower than 95 in the northern part of the ncp the optimal sowing dates under full irrigation of spring maize in sm spring maize in wmm and summer maize in wmm for huanong887 are from 6th may to 10th june from 6th may to 16th may and 10th june respectively the optimal sowing dates of spring maize in sm are from 1st may to 5th june for zhengdan958 zhengdan958 is not a good cultivar in wmm under the grain mechanical harvesting condition because of the longer growth period higher m 0 and lower k for summer maize in dwm it is necessary to select new cultivars with a shorter growth period lower m 0 higher k high yield and high wue in the northern part of the ncp the irrigation schedules of huanong887 and zhengdan958 were optimized to achieve goals of high yield high wue saving water and high quality grain mechanical harvesting for spring maize in wmm sown on 11th may with huanong887 the optimal irrigation schedule in wet wet moderate dry moderate and dry years was 160 mm 160 mm 240 mm and 240 mm respectively with 80 mm each time at the sowing jointing and flowering

9171,water and fertilizer are two important factors affecting crop growth and yield crop growth models are powerful tools for making irrigation and fertilization scheduling and predicting crop yield the performance of crop models on potato under different irrigation amounts along with different n p and k rates has been rarely evaluated especially under drip fertigation in this study the accuracy of aquacrop and dssat substor potato models in simulating potato growth yield and water productivity under different drip fertigation regimes was compared for model calibration and validation a two

calibration and validation scenarios analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction affected by multiple factors such as conflict extreme weather and the covid 19 many countries and regions are experiencing serious food shortages potato is the fourth largest food crop after wheat maize and rice in the world in recent years the planting area and yield of potato have increased year by year because of its wide adaptability rich nutrition multi purpose processing and great potential for increasing production and income which plays an important role in ensuring food security and increasing farmers income fao 2022 wang et al 2019a b as a shallow root crop potato is sensitive to both excess and deficit in soil water nurmanov et al 2019 king et al 2020 the rapid population growth and economic development have intensified the competition of water resources which resulted in the reduction of irrigation water for agriculture fao 2022 wang et al 2021a together with climate change and erratic rainfall they have restricted the development of potato industry in northern china tang et al 2019 fertilization is another important factor affecting potato growth while the imbalance fertilization will reduce potato yield moinuddin et al 2005 hannan et al 2011 neshev and manolov 2015 zhou et al 2018 wang et al 2021b therefore it is necessary to optimize the irrigation and fertilization regimes to improve potato yield water productivity and fertilizer use efficiency crop growth is mainly affected by crop genotypes weather soil conditions and field management measures which are also the main modules in crop models crop models could estimate the effects of management practices and various environmental conditions on crops through the weather data soil characteristics and crop characteristics raymundo et al 2014 in the past field experiment was the main means to study the effects of various experimental factors on crop growth however the period of field experiment is long and the experimental treatments are often limited song et al 2015 the combination of field experiment with crop models has been adopted by more and more researchers because the models can effectively supplement the deficiency of experiments and save a lot of human labor material and financial resources each model also has its advantages and disadvantages and is thus still in the process of continuous improvement in recent years the aquacrop dssat ceres and dssat cropgro series models have been widely used to simulate the canopy development crop evapotranspiration nitrate leaching productivity formation and water use efficiency of crops such as maize abedinpour et al 2012 feng et al 2022 kadiyala et al 2015 malik et al 2019 sandhu and irmak et al 2019 chen et al 2020 wheat ding et al 2021 iqbal et al 2014 jalil et al 2020 li et al 2018 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2013 rice kadiyala et al 2015 cotton garibay et al 2019 li et al 2019 2020 linker et al 2016 tan

irrigation methods or irrigation amounts etc the aquacrop is a water driven model for simulating crop growth which is developed by the food and agriculture organization fao to address food security issues and assess the impact of environment and management on crop production the model can simulate the response of herbaceous crops yield to water especially suitable for the condition that water is the key limiting factor of crop production raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 fao 2022 dssat decision support systems for agrotechnology transfer is the combination of various models ceres cropgro substor cropsim oilcrop canegro for different crops which can not only simulate crop growth phenology soil water content but also simulate carbon and nitrogen balance in days and calculate the impact of various factors on crop yield jones et al 2003 song et al 2015 as for the modeling of potato it began during the 1980 s raymundo et al 2014 there are more than 30 models that have been applied to potato e g aquacrop raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 lintul potato kooman and haverkort 1995 substor potato griffin et al 1993 simpotato hodges et al 1992 cropsyst peralta and stockle 2002 simdualkc stewarts paredes et al 2018 and mopeco ortega et al 2004 among them the aquacrop attempts to balance accuracy simplicity and robustness steduto et al 2009 montoya et al 2016 so it was used by many researchers to simulate the potato growth for example montoya et al 2016 and razzaghi et al 2017 used the aquacrop model to simulate the tuber yield and development of potato canopy cover total dry matter tubers dry matter and soil water content under different irrigation amounts in semiarid and temperate conditions jin et al 2019 estimated the growth and yield of potato under different irrigation frequencies in an arid area using the aquacrop model besides the dssat substor potato model has also been widely applied to potato in recent years arora et al 2013 analyzed potato yield responses to different irrigation and nitrogen regimes in a sub tropical environment using the dssat substor potato model woli et al 2016 used the dssat substor potato model to simulate potato yield nitrate leaching and profit margins as influenced by irrigation and nitrogen management in different soils and production regions in addition this model has also been used by daccache et al 2011 vashisht et al 2015 adavi et al 2018 and raymundo et al 2018 to predict the impact of future climate change on potato production in england america iran and globe respectively these studies have confirmed the applicability of aquacrop and dssat substor potato model the improvement of crop yield and water productivity kg m 3 could be achieved through appropriate agronomic management including the selection of deep rooted varieties appropriate planting date and plant density and the optimal water and nitrogen fertilizer management in addition to nitrogen fertilizer phosphorus and potassium are also important for potato growth especially potassium fertilizer which is the most nutrient absorbed by potato and plays an important role in promoting chloroplast development leaf photosynthesis and starch synthesis zhang et al 2018 2022 besides in the process of potato cultivation nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are often applied simultaneously by farmers previous studies have mainly focused on the simulation of potato growth under different irrigation amounts or nitrogen application rates but few studies have evaluated the performance of crop models under different irrigation amounts along with different n p and k application rates under drip fertigation the objectives of this study were thus to 1 validate and compare the performance of aquacrop and dssat substor potato models in simulating the canopy cover lai dry matter soil moisture and tuber yield of potato under different irrigation and fertigation regimes 2 further evaluate the effects of supplementary irrigation and fertilization strategy on potato yield and water productivity and find out the optimal combination of irrigation and fertilization regimes for potato under drip fertigation scenarios 3 determine the validity and limitation of the model in practical application and provide guidance for the application of the models in potato under drip fertigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description a two year field experiment was performed at the potato experimental station of northwest a f university in yulin city shaanxi province china 38 23 n 109

wilting point pwp hydraulic conductivity of soil field capacity fc soil saturation sat and soil nutrient content were measured in the laboratory the soil particle composition were measured using a malvern laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 and the soil texture was then determined with the usda soil texture calculator the nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen were analyzed by a continuous flow analyser auto analyzer iii bran luebbe germany when the fresh soil was extracted with 2 mol l kcl solution soil liquid ratio of 1 10 the other soil samples were air dried and then sieved with a sieve 2 mm the available potassium were analysed by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer hitachi z 2000 tokyo japan when the soil samples was extracted with 1 mol l neutral ch3coonh4

3 field management the potato variety zihuabai was sown on may 3rd 2018 and may 14th 2019 and harvested on september 15th 2018 and september 26th 2019 this variety is one of the most popular varieties in northern china because of its high quality and disease resistance the row spacing was 0 9 m and plant spacing was 0 25 m each plot was 54 m2 5 4 m 10 m and contained six potato rows a 1 0 m wide buffer zone was set between two plots a labyrinth drip tape φ16 mm emitter discharge rate 2 l h emitter spacing 30 cm was laid on each row for irrigation fertilizers were applied into the plots with the drip irrigation system and there was no basal fertilizer application about 20 55 and 25 of the total fertilizer were applied in the tuber formation period tuber expansion period and starch accumulation period respectively jiao et al 2018 the irrigation events occurred about every eight days irrigation amounts were calculated based on crop evapotranspiration etc e t c k c e t o and rainfall if the rainfall was less than the sum of etc within one irrigation cycle the irrigation amount was the sum of etc minus the rainfall if the rainfall was greater than the sum of etc only 20 mm of water w3 was used for fertilization on sunny days the reference crop evapotranspiration eto was calculated according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 with kc of 0 5 0 8 1 2 0 95 and 0 75 at the seedling tuber formation tuber expansion starch accumulation and mature periods of potato respectively the detailed irrigation and fertilization schedules for potato are shown in table 2 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 dry matter tuber yield lai and canopy cover at 45 60 80 100 120 and 135 days after sowing three plants were dug out from each plot to measure the dry matter accumulation the roots tubers stems and leaves were separated after washing the soil then put into the oven to blanch at 105 for half an hour and dried to a constant weight at 75 the dry biomass and dry tuber yield per hectare was calculated according to the individual plant biomass planting density and seedling emergence rate at harvest fresh potatoes in the range of 1 8 m width 2 m length were weighed and repeated three times in each plot the fresh tuber yield of the plot and hectare were then calculated the leaf area was determined using the punch weighing method qiao 2002 part of leaves were selected from the whole and perforated using the puncher the area of the hole is s and the number of holes n were recorded next the leaves taken off by the puncher wp and the remaining leaves wr were dried to constant weights then the area of the whole leaves was calculated according to the formula n s wp wr wp finally the leaf area index lai was then calculated as follows watson 1947 1 lai the total area of the leaf the occupied land area canopy cover cc was converted from leaf area index lai using the cc lai relationship for the potato garcía vila and fereres 2012 2 c c 1 005 1 exp 1 2 l a

w3f2 w3f1 w2f3 and w1f3 since the maximum root depth was 50 cm the sensors were installed at 10 20 30 and 50 cm below the soil surface respectively the volumetric moisture content 0 50 cm recorded by the instrument was corrected by measuring the soil bulk density and gravimetric water content near the probe during installation in addition the soil moisture before sowing and at harvest mm in the 0 100 cm soil profile was measured using the soil drying method at harvest three samples points between the two drippers 15 cm and 30 cm horizontally from the drip tape in each plot were taken and five soil layers every 20 cm per layer 0 100 cm were taken at each point water productivity wp kg m 3 in terms of yield was determined by the following equation fernandez et al 2020 3 w p 100 y e t 4 e t p

the deep percolation and w is the change in soil moisture from the sowing to the harvest mm in the 0 100 cm soil profile due to the small irrigation and precipitation amounts and the deep groundwater depth 10 m during the experiments the contributions of groundwater recharge and deep percolation were negligible since the runoff was difficult to monitor the amount of precipitation infiltrated into the soil p 0 was used instead of precipitation and runoff in this study which was calculated based on an empirical formula p 0 a p if precipitation p 5 mm a 0 5 p 50 mm a 1 0 and 50 mm p a 0 75 guo 1986 2 5 aquacrop model 2 5 1 model description the details of the aquacrop model are described by the fao http www fao org aquacrop the aquacrop model is a crop water productivity model and simulates the achievable yield of herbaceous crops in response to water under rain fed or different irrigation levels based on a function of water consumption steduto et al 2009 the input data of the aquacrop model includes weather data minimum and maximum air temperature rainfall eto and co2 concentration crop characteristics e g planting density phenology root depth etc soil data soil physical parameters initial moisture and management e g irrigation schedule irrigation method mulching etc characteristics which are the environmental factors required by crop growth montoya et al 2016 rainfall and eto are the determinants of soil water balance in the root zone and co2 concentration in the atmosphere affects water productivity and leaf growth raes et al 2009 the model calculates crop growth from the evapotranspiration and uses canopy ground cover instead of leaf area index lai as the basis to calculate transpiration and to separate out soil evaporation from transpiration when canopy coverage and daily meteorological data are given crop transpiration tr can be calculated by the potential evapotranspiration eto eq 6 besides the water stress fertility stress and salt stress functions are used to synthesize the effects of these adverse conditions on canopy cover cc root expansion and biomass accumulation b especially on the final crop yield moreover the temperature is also considered which influences crop s phenology and limits the growth and biomass accumulation the biomass and dry tuber yield were calculated based on eq 5 and eq 6 in addition in order to track the corresponding soil water stress and root zone soil water content the model updates the soil water balance in a daily time step during the calculation of soil water balance the change of soil water content in root zone is monitored by tracking the inflow and outflow flux at the boundary the main inflow sources of soil water are irrigation precipitation some precipitation may be lost as surface runoff and capillary rise of shallow groundwater level the outflow part mainly includes soil evaporation e crop transpiration tr and deep percolation 4 y d f h i h i 0 b 5 b w p i 1 n t ri e t o i 6 t r k s c c k c t r x

tr x is the coefficient for maximum crop transpiration mm under conditions of well watered soil and completely covered canopy raes et al 2009 tsakmakis et al 2019 the effects of water stress are described through four processes including limited leaf growth stomata conductance canopy senescence and alternated harvest index these effects are determined by their sensitivity levels to the depletion of total available soil water taw the volume of water the soil can hold between fc and pwp in the root zone raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 tsakmakis et al 2019 huang et al 2022 the aquacrop model does not simulate nutrient cycles and balances but it uses a semi quantitative method to describe the effect of soil fertility stress on the canopy development and biomass production raes et al 2018 an automatic calibration program was embedded in the model and five stress parameters were used to express the response to fertilizer stress relative biomass production maximum canopy coverage reduction of canopy expansion average decline canopy coverage and biomass water productivity the soil fertility level was selected in the field management menu by specifying a relative biomass production brel 7 b rel b s t r e s s b r e f 100 where the bstress is the biomass t ha 1 obtained under the conditions of fertilizer stress but no water stress bref is the biomass t ha 1 obtained under the condition of no fertilizer stress and water stress brel ranges from 0 to 100 0 indicates crop growth failure under fertilizer stress and 100 indicates no fertilizer stress bstress and bref were determined following experimental fields table 3 2 5 2 input data parameterization calibration and validation in this study the aquacrop version 6 1 was used to simulate the potato growth parameters canopy cover cc total dry matter in season tdm dry tuber yield water productivity wp and soil water content swc a climate file was created with daily meteorological data maximum average and minimum air temperatures eto and rainfall during the two potato growing seasons it was not possible to measure all the data so some default values or data provided by the model were selected for these parameters such as base temperature tbase and upper temperature tupper and the co2 file was built with the yearly atmospheric co2 concentration ipcc rcp 4 5 provided by the software soil physical characteristics such as soil saturation water content sat field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp was determined before the experiment table 1 the soil initial conditions irrigation and fertigation file are shown in tables 1 and 2 to determine the crop file the field experimental data in the 2018 and 2019 potato growing seasons were used for calibration and validation respectively the parameters in this file could be divided into conservative and non conservative types the non conservative parameters may vary significantly due to the year site or variety while the conservative parameters changed slightly in time management practices or geographic locations the parameters were obtained from the field and determined by the trial and error method and the references raes et al 2009 montoya et al 2016 tsakmakis et al 2019 according to the sensitivity analysis conducted by razzaghi et al 2017 the kc tr x hi o cc x and wp were highly sensitive to tuber yield in this study the parameterization process given by vanuytrecht et al 2014 was used first the development of canopy coverage cc was simulated and the parameters relative to cc including the plant density and phenological period time to emergence ccx senescence maturity and the duration of yield formation and hi building up were determined according to the measurements of the w3f4 treatment during the 2018 and 2019 potato cropping seasons these parameters with cc curve parameters i e cc0 cgc ccx cdc were further fine tuned and repeatedly calibrated for the w3f4 treatment until the simulation of cc were close to the observations the effective rooting depths were also observed from the field experiment second the crop transpiration t r and soil water content were simulated the kc tr x was adjusted by the model in this study the value of 1 15 was used taking into account the phenological stages and crop senescence next the values of wp was adjusted to 17 g m2 by the calibration of biomass to obtain a close match between the simulations and observations finally the hi0 66 average field measurement in 2018 was used to convert biomass to tuber dry weight the soil water stress coefficients i e p exp upper p exp lower p sto upper and p sen upper were taken from the manual and adjusted based on the deficit irrigation treatment w2f4 in addition the fertility stress parameters were calibrated using the field data from the four fertigation treatments under three irrigation amounts the average observed brel and ccx values and the qualitative description of cc decline for the fertility stress treatments f3 f2 f1 compared to the reference treatment f4 were used as inputs for calibration table 4 finally the simulated tuber dry weight was converted to fresh weight by assuming a dry matter content of 16 7 0 167 kg of dry matter per kg fresh weight based on the average field measurements in 2018 the simulated water productivity wps kg m 3 was calculated by the ratio of simulated fresh tuber yield to the estimated crop evapotranspiration etx 2 6 dssat substor potato model parameters and input data as a family of dssat the substor potato model also uses daily weather data soil properties cultivar parameters and crop management information to simulate the daily dynamics of water nitrogen phenology biomass and tuber yield accumulation raymundo et al 2017 woli and hoogenboom 2018 in the model potato growth and development were simulated according to the biomass accumulation and partitioning in relation to intercepted radiation photoperiodicity and temperature besides soil water and nitrogen deficit factors were considered and used to modify the rates of growth and phenological development which influenced on the photosynthesis tuber initiation and the carbon demand of tubers griffin et al 1993 raymundo et al 2017 the potato model simulates five phenological stages of the potato growth a pre planting b planting to sprout germination c sprout elongation to emergence d emergence to tuber initiation e tuber initiation to maturity owns five cultivar specific parameters leaf area expansion rate after tuber initiation g2 potential tuber growth rate g3 index that supresses tuber growth pd tuber initiation sensitivity to long photoperiods p2 and upper critical temperature for tuber initiation tc that control the potato development and growth and uses various trapezoidal temperature impact functions to simulate the effect of temperature on leaf root and tuber growth photosynthesis and tuber initiation the parameters p2 and tc influence the tuber initiation and the parameters pd g3 and g2 play a key role in the biomass accumulation and partitioning after tuber initiation tc and p2 are both embedded in the functions that determine tuber initiation and affect tuber expansion if the temperature is higher than tc the tuber initiation and tuber expansion will be reduced or inhibited p2 a dimensionless value between 0 and 1 determines the sensitivity to day length and the closer to 0 the lower the sensitivity of varieties to long photoperiods the parameter pd also ranges between 0 and 1 and describes how fast tubers get full priority over leaf growth the parameters g3 and g2 together with temperature water and nitrogen shortages determine the actual tuber growth and actual leaf expansion respectively the simulated dry tuber yield was converted to fresh weight by using the conversion factor of 20 griffin et al 1993 raymundo et al 2017 in addition soil water balance was calculated based on the precipitation irrigation infiltration deep drainage unsaturated flow soil evaporation and plant transpiration plant transpiration was determined by the potential evapotranspiration plant root distribution and total available soil water taw griffin et al 1993 woli and hoogenboom 2018 for details please refer to griffin et al 1993 and raymundo et al 2017 the input data for the substor potato model are the standard inputs required by dssat including site information daily weather solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation cultivar characteristics soil profile characteristics initial soil condition and field management practices anar et al 2019 the soil initial conditions soil properties irrigation and fertilization file are shown in tables 1 and 2 the five cultivar specific parameters are shown in table 5 measured data from the w3f4 treatment in 2018 was used for model calibration while data from the w3f4 treatment in 2019 was used for model validation the model was then used to simulate the potato growth and yield under different combinations of irrigation and fertigation regimes in 2018 and 2019 2 7 data quality and integrity assessment quality assessment and quality control of any measured data is essential to data integrity the measured data is strongly advised to compare against independent measurements or models allen et al 2011 experimental crop measurements in this study mainly included daily meteorological data dry tuber weight fresh tuber weight root dry weight leaf dry weight stem dry weight and soil water content the meteorological data were collected from an automatic meteorological station hobo event logger onset computer corporation usa about 100 m away from the experimental field and the data was compared with that of the national meteorological administration and the local meteorological bureau the plant growth data mainly adopted the method of taking the average value from multiple measurements to reduce the error the abnormal value of soil water content monitored by the instrument was checked by the oven drying method 2 8 model performance evaluation performance of the aquacrop and dssat substor potato version 4 7

and mccabe jr 1999 besides dev and the slope of a linear regression quantify a possible overestimation or underestimation by the model and a deviation limit around 10 is considered as acceptable 2 9 scenario analysis accurate management of water and fertilizer is essential for potato growth in our study field experiments only included three drip irrigation levels and four fertigation n p2o5 k2o rates and it was found the observed tuber yield increased with the increase of irrigation amount under the same fertilizer rate however the deficit irrigation is conducive to improving water productivity and saving water resources therefore in order to make up for the deficiency of the field experiment the validated aquacrop model was used to simulate the tuber yield of four fertigation rates f1 f4 under irrigation levels of 120 etc irrigation amount was 1 2 times of 100 etc and 40 etc irrigation amount was 40 of 100 etc to test how the tuber yield would change with further increase and decrease of irrigation amount 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of aquacrop model 3 1 1 soil water content simulated by aquacrop model in order to track the root zone soil water content and the corresponding soil water stress the aquacrop model simulated and updated the soil water balance in daily steps during the simulation of soil water balance the root zone can be regarded as a reservoir and the change of soil water content in the root zone can be monitored by tracking the inflow flux and outflow flux at the boundary of the reservoir in this study the observed soil water content swc in the root zone 0 50 cm during the two potato growing seasons were compared to swc simulated by the aquacrop model under different drip fertigation regimes fig 2 generally the measured and simulated swc values of the 0 50 cm soil profile had a good response to precipitation and irrigation the model estimated swc with satisfactory accuracy under different irrigation and fertigation levels with nrmse of 7 8 14 8 and 8 6 13 2 r 2 of 0 40 0 88 and 0 61 0 90 rmse of 6 1 11 5 mm and 7 10 3 mm ef of 0 27 0 75 and 0 55 0 82 and d of 0 77 0 94 and 0 88 0 95 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 6 the results were similar to the findings of montoya et al 2016 and razzaghi et al 2017 who also used the aquacrop model simulated the soil water content fluctuation of potato field under various irrigation levels they found the r 2 values between simulated and observed soil water content for different irrigation levels varying between 0 45 and 0 74 0 34 and 0 92 respectively it was also found the model estimated soil water content with satisfactory accuracy under different irrigation and fertilization levels which indicated that the parameterization of the model for cc and soil water content parameters were suitable paredes et al 2014 nunes et al 2021 additionally the results showed that the simulation accuracy of high fertilizer treatments for swc was better than that of low fertigation level the discrepancies between the observed and simulated swc values increased with the decrease of irrigation amount table 6 this may be because different amounts of irrigation and fertigation affected the distribution of potato roots which further affected plant transpiration and soil evaporation 3 1 2 canopy cover simulated by aquacrop model as a key element in the aquacrop model the accurate simulation of canopy cover cc is necessary for the model to realize satisfactory prediction of soil water content fluctuation evapotranspiration crop biomass and final yield sandhu and irmak 2019 huang et al 2022 the graphical comparison of canopy cover simulated by the aquacrop model with the observations in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 3 during parameterization the parameters relative to cc were calibrated firstly and the soil water stress coefficients affecting canopy cove were adjusted to simulate the cc development under deficit irrigation in this study the canopy expansion ks p exp lower and ks p exp upper were set as 0 3 and 0 7 which were slightly higher than the data in the reference manual and the default value 0 2 and 0 6 in the aquacrop model calendar lima 17 may 95 greenwood et al 2010 found the potato transpiration and growth rate decreased when the water deficit exceeded the maximum allowable soil moisture deficit of 35 additionally the combination of slower canopy expansion reduced maximum canopy cover early decline in canopy cover and lower biomass water productivity were used by the semi quantitative approach in the aquacrop model to simulate the effect of fertility stress on canopy cover gaelen et al 2015 overall the aquacrop model adequately captured the dynamics of canopy cover except for w1f1 the aquacrop model estimated canopy cover with excellent and good accuracy under the different irrigation and fertigation regimes with r 2 0 81 d 0 92 nrmse 20 and rmse 14 2 table 7 the simulation accuracy of w2f4 was highest in 2018 r 2 0 99 rmse 5 2 nrmse 6 2 d 0 99 and ef 0 96 and 2019 r 2 0 98 rmse 3 7 nrmse 4 5 d 0 98 and ef 1 00 satisfactory canopy cover simulation was also obtained by previous studies on rice shrestha et al 2013 winter wheat huang et al 2022 maize abedinpour et al 2012 chen et al 2019 and soybean khoshravesh et al 2013 adeboye et al 2021 under different irrigation and fertilization levels besides the model gave better predictions of canopy cover under high fertigation treatments than low fertigation treatments the simulation accuracy decreased with the decrease of fertilizer application rate this may be due to the limitation of the aquacrop model to simulate the coupling effects of water fertilizer and other factors that affect canopy cover huang et al 2022 3 1 3 total dry matter simulated by aquacrop model the simulated total dry matter by the aquacrop model was compared with the observed values in 2018 and 2019 seasons fig 4 when estimating the dry matter the normalized water productivity wp of 17 g m2 was adopted to convert the crop transpiration to the dry matter similar with the results of cc the aquacrop also gave excellent good and acceptable estimates of total dry matter under different irrigation and fertigation treatments excep for w1f1 as indicated by high r 2 values 0 96 and 0 92 high d values 0 93 and 0 94 and low estimation errors 0 5 rmse 1 8 t ha 1 and 0 7 rmse 2 2 t ha 1 7 7 nrmse 22 1 and 12 2 nrmse 25 0 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 7 however error between simulated and observed values were larger in the high water stress treatments 60 etc w1 than that of 100 etc irrigation w3 and 80 etc irrigation level w2 tables 7 and 8 fig 4 there was a high agreement between the simulated and observed final total dry matter under high irrigation 100 etc w3 with dev ranging 9 75 2 35 and 8 87 0 78 in 2018 and 2019 respectively under 80 etc deficit irrigation w2 dev ranged 2 86 16 65 and 3 74 11 27 in the two seasons under 60 etc deficit irrigation w1 dev ranged 21 11 34 61 and 19 85 29 74 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 8 the model over estimated the final total dry matter under 60 etc and the highest estimation errors occurred in the w1f1 treatment table 8 fig 4 the results were consistent with the findings of afshar and neshat 2013 and razzaghi et al 2017 who also found the aquacrop model performed better in simulation of dry matter under the fully irrigated and mildly stressed treatments overall the simulation accuracy of the final total dry matter was acceptable with r 2 rmse nrmse ef and d of 0 61 1 45 t ha 1 14 25 0 46 and 0 81 in 2018 and 0 66 1 30 t ha 1 12 81 0 47 and 0 83 in 2019 respectively table 9 according to the slopes of the linear regression they were lower than the ideal by 45 2 and 36 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively indicating that the simulated result was better in 2019 than that in 2018 fig 5a 3 1 4 dry tuber yield fresh tuber yield et and water productivity simulated by aquacrop model the simulated dry tuber yield fresh tuber yield et and water productivity by the aquacrop model in 2018 and 2019 seasons were compared with the observed values in tables 8 and 9 and fig 5 when predicting the tuber yield the observed average harvest index hi of 66 was used to convert dry matter into dry tuber yield which was lower than the range of the reference harvest index hio values proposed by raes et al 2018 for potato 70 85 besides an observed average coefficient 16 7 0 167 kg of dry matter per kg fresh weight was used to convert the dry tuber yield into fresh weight which was also smaller than the range of the reference values 20 25 suggested by quiroz et al 2012 this may be because the harvest index of different varieties under different field management measures was diverse mohammadi et al 2013 revealed that the harvest index of marfona was 65 6 83 7 when different fertilizer types were applied wang et al 2019a 2019b found when different nitrogen levels were applied the harvest index of chuanyu 117 and mira were 0 89 0 90 and 0 92 0 93 and the dry matter content in fresh potatoes of the two potato cultivars were 16 2 24 7 and 18 5 27 respectively what s more pu et al 2020 pointed out that the harvest index of cultivar longshu 3 was 0 35 0 47 under different tillage methods in this study the accuracy of dry and fresh tuber yield estimated by the aquacrop model was satisfactory under high irrigation 100 etc w3 and 80 etc irrigation level w2 with dev ranging from 8 98 9 42 and 9 28 9 19 in 2018 and 10 93 5 26 and 6 90 8 49 in 2019 respectively table 8 the fresh tuber yield under 60 etc deficit irrigation w1 was over estimated with dev ranging from 18 74 to 23 04 and 13 16 17 75 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the main reason for this result was that the overestimated total dry matter led to the overestimated tuber yield in addition the observed harvest index under deficit irrigation was lower than that under high irrigation overall the r 2 rmse nrmse ef and d values of dry tuber yield were 0 57 0 83 t ha 1 12 21 0 45 and 0 82 in 2018 and 0 71 0 51 t ha 1 7 07 0 69 and 0 92 in 2019 respectively the r 2 rmse nrmse ef and d values of fresh tuber yield were 0 53 4 91 t ha 1 12 02 0 38 and 0 81 in 2018 and 0 75 3 64 t ha 1 8 83 0 67 and 0 90 in 2019 respectively table 9 besides the slopes of the linear regression for dry and fresh tuber yield were 0 607 and 0 632 in 2018 and 0 843 and 0 738 in 2019 which were lower than the ideal by 39 3 and 36 8 in 2018 and 15 7 and 26 2 in 2019 respectively fig 5b and c water productivity as one of the important indexes to determine the optimal irrigation and fertigation levels were also calculated based on the et simulated by the aquacrop model in the aquacrop model the evaporation part was separated from the transpiration and the model mainly considered the crop transpiration whereas under filed conditions both evaporation and transpiration were involved in the estimation of water consumption afshar et al 2014 instead of that the sum of ex and trx was used to calculate et and water productivity and compared with field water productivity in this study the simulation accuracy of et was acceptable under 100 etc irrigation w3 and 80 etc irrigation level w2 with dev ranging 10 74 2 76 and 7 00 7 34 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 8 under 60 etc irrigation level w1 dev ranged 11 20 14 84 and 12 86 15 12 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 8 this may be the main reason for the overestimation of dry matter and yield under 60 irrigation level however there was a high agreement between the simulated and observed water productivity wp with dev ranging from 4 75 9 77 in 2018 and 5 55 6 45 in 2019 respectively table 8 the r 2 rmse nrmse ef and d values were 0 91 0 48 kg m 3 5 51 0 71 and 0 94 in 2018 and 0 95 0 27 kg m 3 2 98 0 93 and 0 98 in 2019 respectively table 9 the slope of the linear regression in 2019 1 211 was closer to one than that in 2018 1 037 fig 5d 3 2 performance of dssat substor potato models 3 2 1 lai total dry matter tuber yield et and water productivity simulated by dssat substor potato model fig 6 shows the observed lai values and simulated by the dssat substor potato model during the two potato growing seasons the accuracy of lai simulated by dssat substor poatto model was weaker than that of cc simulated by the aquacrop model and the simulation accuracy decreased with the decrease of irrigation and fertigation regimes the simulation accuracy of w3f3 and w3f4 was acceptable with nrmse 30 during calibration and validation while the model estimated lai with unsatisfactory accuracy under the other irrigation and fertility levels with nrmse 30 table 10 the agreement between the simulated and observed total dry matter by the dssat substor potato model was also weaker than that of the aquacrop model table 10 the simulation accuracy of the high fertilizer treatments f3 and f4 were acceptable under high irrigation and 80 etc w2 with r 2 0 83 nrmse 30 ef 0 74 and d 0 94 while the lowest accuracy of total dry matter was observed in the low fertigation treatment with low irrigation amount w1f1 fig 7 table 10 the agreement between the observed and simulated values decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount under f1 and f2 the simulation results of dry tuber yield fresh tuber yield final total dry matter et and water productivity by the dssat substor potato model in 2018 and 2019 seasons are presented in table 11 and fig 8 compared with the aquacrop model the simulation accuracy of tuber yield final total dry matter et and water productivity estimated by dssat substor potato model were also weaker the r 2 values of the final total dry matter dry tuber yield fresh tuber yield and water productivity simulated by the dssat substor potato model were 0 63 0 61 0 64 and 0 15 in 2018 and 0 39 0 42 0 42 and 0 03 in 2019 respectively the corresponding nrmse values were 26 26 26 26 26 17 and 13 38 in 2018 and 35 49 30 57 36 99 and 18 55 in 2019 respectively table 12 the discrepancies between the observed and simulated dry tuber yield and wp values increased with the decrease of fertigation rate and the dry and fresh tuber yield and et was seriously over estimated by the dssat substor potato model under 60 etc w1 with dev ranging from 21 98 to 70 76 20 81 60 73 and 21 93 25 53 in 2018 and 24 31 59 73 29 00 78 06 and 28 3 31 26 in 2019 respectively however the simulation accuracy of et was acceptable under 100 etc irrigation w3 with dev ranging 2 07 1 59 and 4 48 6 18 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 11 the slopes of the linear regression for final dry matter dry and fresh tuber yield and wp were 0 183 0 110 0 122 and 0 079 in 2018 and 0 164 0 131 0 112 and 0 033 in 2019 respectively which were far from one fig 8 3 2 2 soil water content simulated by dssat substor potato model fig 6 shows the observed soil water content swc in the root zone 0 50 cm compared to swc simulated by the dssat substor potato model under different drip fertigation levels in 2018 and 2019 the dssat substor potato model also gave good estimates of swc in different drip fertigation treatments the r 2 rmse nrmse ef and d values were 0 54 0 77 8 81 11 88 mm 10 27 15 08 0 20 0 68 and 0 84 0 93 in 2018 and 0 59 0 91 6 62 12 00 mm 8 29 15 40 0 27 0 87 and 0 87 0 97 in 2019 respectively table 6 fig 9 to sum up the dssat substor potato model produced better estimates of lai total dry matter soil water content and final tuber yield and water productivity under high irrigation with high fertigation the simulation accuracy of total dry matter soil water content tuber yield and water productivity estimated by the dssat substor potato model under different drip irrigation and fertigation levels were lower than that of the aquacrop model however previous studies have shown that the dssat substor potato model had a good performance in the simulated and observed potato yield and nitrate leaching under different irrigation and nitrogen managements vashisht et al 2015 woli et al 2016 this may be because the dssat substor potato model mainly considered the water and nitrogen stress when simulating the lai and biomass accumulation raymundo et al 2017 but phosphorus and potassium were weaker in this model however potato is a crop that requires plenty of potassium fertilizer potassium affects the transport and synthesis of proteins nucleic acids and carbohydrates especially the synthesis of carbohydrates and starch in storage organs su et al 2010 the uptake of potassium was much greater than that of nitrogen and phosphorus zhang et al 2010 in our field experiments the application rate of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium changed at the same time according to a certain proportion besides the initial soil nh4 n and no3 n contents 0 40 cm reached 18 49 mg kg 1 and 12 97 mg kg 1 in 2018 and 22 04 mg kg 1 and 7 59 mg kg 1 in 2019 which may weakened the effect of nitrogen fertilizer therefore little difference in simulated lai dry matter and tuber yield between fertigation levels under three irrigation levels was obtained the coupling effect of water and fertilizer was not reflected in this model however during the application of the aquacrop model although it also could not fully estimate the coupling effect of water and fertilizer it adopted a semi quantitative approach to simulate the effects of soil fertility stress gaelen et al 2015 huang et al 2022 the fertilizer nitrogen phosphorus and potassium stress can be realized through calculation based on the observed canopy cover and biomass therefore the aquacrop model seems to be better if we only simulate potato growth and predict tuber yield under different water and fertilizer n p2o5 k2o regimes without predicting the nutrient cycles and balances 3 3 scenarios simulation the observed tuber yield increased with the increase of irrigation amount 60 100 etc under the same fertigation rate therefore the yield of different fertigation rates under irrigation levels 120 etc and 40 etc were further simulated using the aquacrop model due to its satisfactory accuracy in simulating tuber yield fig 10 compared with 100 etc 120 etc irrigation only increased the fresh tuber yield of by 0 19 1 52 in 2018 and 0 34 1 26 in 2019 but the irrigation amount of 37 2 mm and 48 2 mm was more consumed during the two potato growing seasons the results were consistent with the finding of montoya et al 2016 who also found there was no significant difference in tuber yield between 120 and 100 crop water requirement besides the 40 etc irrigation decreased potato yield by 1 08 4 74 and 4 98 14 61 and the irrigation amount was saved by 111 6 mm and 145 2 mm compared with 100 etc during the two potato growing seasons respectively fig 10 however badr et al 2012 found that compared with 100 etc the tuber yield of irrigation levels 60 etc and 40 etc decreased by 27 3 and 44 6 respectively our field experiments showed that the tuber yield of irrigation level 60 etc decreased more than 20 compared with 100 etc the simulated yield was larger than the observed values under deficit irrigation so the results need to be further verified during the field experiment the early deficit irrigation had a certain impact on potato growth although the later rainfall amount was higher and had a certain compensation effect but the effect was small however in the process of model simulation this aspect was weak comprehensively considering the observed and simulated tuber yield of different drip fertigation levels and the water resources the irrigation amount 100 etc with fertigation n p2o5 k2o rate 200 80 300 kg ha 1 f3 was more suitable for potato production which also complemented and validated our previous findings wang et al 2021b 3 4 limitations and suggestions although the aquacrop model for simulating canopy cover and dry matter soil water content final tuber yield and water productivity had an acceptable goodness of fit between observed and simulated values under different drip fertigation levels the estimation errors between the observed and simulated values still existed especially when the water deficiency and nutrient stress occurred as discussed above this may be due to that the model couldn t completely perform the coupling effects of water and fertilizer compared to the other crop models the nutrient cycles and balances were not considered in this model gaelen et al 2015 however although the dssat substor potato model considered the cycles and balances of nutrient it mainly estimated the balance of nitrogen the balance of phosphorus and potassium were missing potato is a potassium like crop after tuber formation potassium fertilizer may be more important than nitrogen fertilizer for potato which has an influence on the transportation of photosynthetic products to storage organs bishal and devashish 2019 zhang et al 2022 if we only simulate potato growth and predict tuber yield of different water and fertilizer n p2o5 k2o regimes without predicting the nutrient balance the aquacrop model seems to be more competent besides the irrigation and fertilization parameters such as emitter flow emitter spacing layout of drip pipe fertilizer concentration and so on are not considered by the two models which directly affect the distribution of water and nutrients in the field in addition the observed data were limit only a two year field experiment was used to calibrate and validate the two models in this study overall the development of potato model still needs a long way to go 4 conclusions the aquacrop and dssat substor potato models were calibrated validated and used to simulate the canopy cover lai dry matter tuber yield water productivity and soil water content under different drip irrigation and fertigation amounts during two potato growing season 2018 and 2019 except for w1f1 the aquacrop model gave satisfactory predictions of canopy cover total dry matter and soil water content the simulated dry and fresh tuber yield by the aquacrop agreed well with the measured values under high irrigation 100 etc and 80 etc irrigation level but the tuber yield under 60 etc irrigation was over estimated as for the substor potato model because the model did not fully reflect the water and fertilizer nitrogen phosphorus and potassium stresses the simulation accuracy of total dry matter soil water content tuber yield and water productivity of this model was lower than that of aquacrop model the model only showed a goodness of fit between simulated and observed values under high irrigation with high fertigation if it is not necessary to estimate the nutrient cycles and balances and only predict the potato growth and tuber yield under different irrigation amounts along with different n p and k application rates the aquacrop model seems to better the scenario simulation indicated that 120 etc only slightly increased the tuber yield but more water resources were consumed the irrigation amount 100 etc with fertigation n p2o5 k2o rate 200 80 300 kg ha 1 f3 was better for potato production by comprehensively considering the observed and simulated tuber yield and water resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9171,water and fertilizer are two important factors affecting crop growth and yield crop growth models are powerful tools for making irrigation and fertilization scheduling and predicting crop yield the performance of crop models on potato under different irrigation amounts along with different n p and k rates has been rarely evaluated especially under drip fertigation in this study the accuracy of aquacrop and dssat substor potato models in simulating potato growth yield and water productivity under different drip fertigation regimes was compared for model calibration and validation a two year field experiment with three irrigation levels w1 60 etc w2 80 etc and w3 100 etc where etc was the crop evapotranspiration and four fertigation n p2o5 k2o rates f1 100 40 150 kg ha 1 f2 150 60

dry matter and tuber yield under w1 were over estimated the simulated water productivity and soil water content also agreed well with the observations r 2 0 91 nrmse 5 51 d 0 94 and rmse 0 48 kg m 3 and r 2 0 40 nrmse 14 8 d 0 77 and rmse 11 5 mm the simulation accuracy of dssat substor potato model was lower than that of aquacrop model which only showed a goodness of fit between simulated total dry matter soil water content tuber yield water productivity and observations under high irrigation amount with high fertilization rate w3f4 since the observed tuber yield increased with the increase of irrigation level 60 100 etc under the same fertigation rate 120 etc and 40 etc were further simulated using the aquacrop model to test the changes in tuber yield with further increased or decreased irrigation levels the scenarios simulation showed that the tuber yield was only increased by 0 19 1 52 under 120 etc compared with that under 100 etc but 18 0 more irrigation water was consumed comprehensively considering water resources and tuber yield the irrigation level of 100 etc w3 along with fertigation n p2o5 k2o rate of 200 80 300 kg ha 1 f3 was recommended for the sustainable potato production in the study region the results of this study can provide guidance for the application of crop models in drip fertigated potato keywords irrigation amount fertigation rate crop model calibration and validation scenarios analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction affected by multiple factors such as conflict extreme weather and the covid 19 many countries and regions are experiencing serious food shortages potato is the fourth largest food crop after wheat maize and rice in the world in recent years the planting area and yield of potato have increased year by year because of its wide adaptability rich nutrition multi purpose processing and great potential for increasing production and income which plays an important role in ensuring food security and increasing farmers income fao 2022 wang et al 2019a b as a shallow root crop potato is sensitive to both excess and deficit in soil water nurmanov et al 2019 king et al 2020 the rapid population growth and economic development have intensified the competition of water resources which resulted in the reduction of irrigation water for agriculture fao 2022 wang et al 2021a together with climate change and erratic rainfall they have restricted the development of potato industry in northern china tang et al 2019 fertilization is another important factor affecting potato growth while the imbalance fertilization will reduce potato yield moinuddin et al 2005 hannan et al 2011 neshev and manolov 2015 zhou et al 2018 wang et al 2021b therefore it is necessary to optimize the irrigation and fertilization regimes to improve potato yield water productivity and fertilizer use efficiency crop growth is mainly affected by crop genotypes weather soil conditions and field management measures which are also the main modules in crop models crop models could estimate the effects of management practices and various environmental conditions on crops through the weather data soil characteristics and crop characteristics raymundo et al 2014 in the past field experiment was the main means to study the effects of various experimental factors on crop growth however the period of field experiment is long and the experimental treatments are often limited song et al 2015 the combination of field experiment with crop models has been adopted by more and more researchers because the models can effectively supplement the deficiency of experiments and save a lot of human labor material and financial resources each model also has its advantages and disadvantages and is thus still in the process of continuous improvement in recent years the aquacrop dssat ceres and dssat cropgro series models have been widely used to simulate the canopy development crop evapotranspiration nitrate leaching productivity formation and water use efficiency of crops such as maize abedinpour et al 2012 feng et al 2022 kadiyala et al 2015 malik et al 2019 sandhu and irmak et al 2019 chen et

irrigation methods or irrigation amounts etc the aquacrop is a water driven model for simulating crop growth which is developed by the food and agriculture organization fao to address food security issues and assess the impact of environment and management on crop production the model can simulate the response of herbaceous crops yield to water especially suitable for the condition that water is the key limiting factor of crop production raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 fao 2022 dssat decision support systems for agrotechnology transfer is the combination of various models ceres cropgro substor cropsim oilcrop canegro for different crops which can not only simulate crop growth phenology soil water content but also simulate carbon and nitrogen balance in days and calculate the impact of various factors on crop yield jones et al 2003 song et al 2015 as for the modeling of potato it began during the 1980 s raymundo et al 2014 there are more than 30 models that have been applied to potato e g aquacrop raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 lintul potato kooman and haverkort 1995 substor potato griffin et al 1993 simpotato hodges et al 1992 cropsyst peralta and

it was used by many researchers to simulate the potato growth for example montoya et al 2016 and razzaghi et al 2017 used the aquacrop model to simulate the tuber yield and development of potato canopy cover total dry matter tubers dry matter and soil water content under different irrigation amounts in semiarid and temperate conditions jin et al 2019 estimated the growth and yield of potato under different irrigation frequencies in an arid area using the aquacrop model besides the dssat substor potato model has also been widely applied to potato in recent years arora et al 2013 analyzed potato yield responses to different irrigation and nitrogen regimes in a sub tropical environment using the dssat substor potato model woli et al 2016 used the dssat substor potato model to simulate potato yield nitrate leaching and profit margins as influenced by irrigation and nitrogen management in different soils and production regions in addition this model has also been used by daccache et al 2011 vashisht et al 2015 adavi et al 2018 and raymundo et al 2018 to predict the impact of future climate change on potato production in england america iran and globe respectively these studies have confirmed the applicability of aquacrop and dssat substor potato model the improvement of crop yield and water productivity kg m 3 could be achieved through appropriate agronomic management including the selection of deep rooted varieties appropriate planting date and plant density and the optimal water and nitrogen fertilizer management in addition to nitrogen fertilizer phosphorus and potassium are also important for potato growth especially potassium fertilizer which is the most nutrient absorbed by potato and plays an important role in promoting chloroplast development leaf photosynthesis and starch synthesis zhang et al 2018 2022 besides in the process of potato cultivation nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are often applied simultaneously by farmers previous studies have mainly focused on the simulation of potato growth under different irrigation amounts or nitrogen application rates but few studies have evaluated the performance of crop models under different irrigation amounts along with different n p and k application rates under drip fertigation the objectives of this study were thus to 1 validate and compare the performance of aquacrop and dssat substor potato models in simulating the canopy cover lai dry matter soil moisture and tuber yield of potato under different irrigation and fertigation regimes 2 further evaluate the effects of supplementary irrigation and fertilization strategy on potato yield and water productivity and find out the optimal combination of irrigation and fertilization regimes for potato under drip fertigation scenarios 3 determine the validity and limitation of the model in practical application and provide guidance for the application of the models in potato under drip fertigation 2 materials

wilting point pwp hydraulic conductivity of soil field capacity fc soil saturation sat and soil nutrient content were measured in the laboratory the soil particle composition were measured using a malvern laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 and the soil texture was then determined with the usda soil texture calculator the nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen were analyzed by a continuous flow analyser auto analyzer iii bran luebbe germany when the fresh soil was extracted with 2 mol l kcl solution soil liquid ratio of 1 10 the other soil samples were air dried and then sieved with a sieve 2 mm the available potassium were analysed by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer hitachi z 2000 tokyo japan when the soil samples was extracted with 1 mol l neutral ch3coonh4

3 field management the potato variety zihuabai was sown on may 3rd 2018 and may 14th 2019 and harvested on september 15th 2018 and september 26th 2019 this variety is one of the most popular varieties in northern china because of its high quality and disease resistance the row spacing was 0 9 m and plant spacing was 0 25 m each plot was 54 m2 5 4 m 10 m and contained six potato rows a 1 0 m wide buffer zone was set between two plots a labyrinth drip tape φ16 mm emitter discharge rate 2 l h emitter spacing 30 cm was laid on each row for irrigation fertilizers were applied into the plots with the drip irrigation system and there was no basal fertilizer application about 20 55 and 25 of the total fertilizer were applied in the tuber formation period tuber expansion period and starch accumulation period respectively jiao et al 2018 the irrigation events occurred about every eight days irrigation amounts were calculated based on crop evapotranspiration etc e t c k c e t o and rainfall if the rainfall was less than the sum of etc within one irrigation cycle the irrigation amount was the sum of etc minus the rainfall if the rainfall was greater than the sum of etc only 20 mm of water w3 was used for fertilization on sunny days the reference crop evapotranspiration eto was calculated according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 with kc of 0 5 0 8 1 2 0 95 and 0 75 at the seedling tuber formation tuber expansion starch accumulation and mature periods of potato respectively the detailed irrigation and fertilization schedules for potato are shown in table 2 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 dry matter tuber yield lai and canopy cover at 45 60 80 100 120 and 135 days after sowing three plants were dug out from each plot to measure the dry matter accumulation the roots tubers stems and leaves were separated after washing the soil then put into the oven to blanch at 105 for half an hour and dried to a constant weight at 75 the dry biomass and dry tuber yield per hectare was calculated according to the individual plant biomass planting density and seedling emergence rate at harvest fresh potatoes in the range of 1 8 m width 2 m length were weighed and repeated three times in each plot the fresh tuber yield of the plot and hectare were then calculated the leaf area was determined using the punch weighing method qiao 2002 part of leaves were selected from the whole and perforated using the puncher the area of the hole is s and the number of holes n were recorded next the leaves taken off by the puncher wp and the remaining leaves wr were dried to constant weights then the area of the whole leaves was calculated according to the formula n s wp wr wp finally the leaf area index lai was then calculated as follows watson 1947 1 lai the total area of the leaf the occupied land area canopy cover cc was converted from leaf area index lai using the cc lai relationship for the potato garcía vila and fereres 2012 2 c c 1 005 1 exp 1 2 l a

w3f2 w3f1 w2f3 and w1f3 since the maximum root depth was 50 cm the sensors were installed at 10 20 30 and 50 cm below the soil surface respectively the volumetric moisture content 0 50 cm recorded by the instrument was corrected by measuring the soil bulk density and gravimetric water content near the probe during installation in addition the soil moisture before sowing and at harvest mm in the 0 100 cm soil profile was measured using the soil drying method at harvest three samples points between the two drippers 15 cm and 30 cm horizontally from the drip tape in each plot were taken and five soil layers every 20 cm per layer 0 100 cm were taken at each point water productivity wp kg m 3 in terms of yield was determined by the following equation fernandez et al 2020 3 w p 100 y e t 4 e t p

the deep percolation and w is the change in soil moisture from the sowing to the harvest mm in the 0 100 cm soil profile due to the small irrigation and precipitation amounts and the deep groundwater depth 10 m during the experiments the contributions of groundwater recharge and deep percolation were negligible since the runoff was difficult to monitor the amount of precipitation infiltrated into the soil p 0 was used instead of precipitation and runoff in this study which was calculated based on an empirical formula p 0 a p if precipitation p 5 mm a 0 5 p 50 mm a 1 0 and 50 mm p a 0 75 guo 1986 2 5 aquacrop model 2 5 1 model description the details of the aquacrop model are described by the fao http www fao org aquacrop the aquacrop model is a crop water productivity model and simulates the achievable yield of herbaceous crops in response to water under rain fed or different irrigation levels based on a function of water consumption steduto et al 2009 the input data of the aquacrop model includes weather data minimum and maximum air temperature rainfall eto and co2 concentration crop characteristics e g planting density phenology root depth etc soil data soil physical parameters initial moisture and management e g irrigation schedule irrigation method mulching etc characteristics which are the environmental factors required by crop growth montoya et al 2016 rainfall and eto are the determinants of soil water balance in the root zone and co2 concentration in the atmosphere affects water productivity and leaf growth raes et al 2009 the model calculates crop growth from the evapotranspiration and uses canopy ground cover instead of leaf area index lai as the basis to calculate transpiration and to separate out soil evaporation from transpiration when canopy coverage and daily meteorological data are given crop transpiration tr can be calculated by the potential evapotranspiration eto eq 6 besides the water stress fertility stress and salt stress functions are used to synthesize the effects of these adverse conditions on canopy cover cc root expansion and biomass accumulation b especially on the final crop yield moreover the temperature is also considered which influences crop s phenology and limits the growth and biomass accumulation the biomass and dry tuber yield were calculated based on eq 5 and eq 6 in addition in order to track the corresponding soil water stress and root zone soil water content the model updates the soil water balance in a daily time step during the calculation of soil water balance the change of soil water content in root zone is monitored by tracking the inflow and outflow flux at the boundary the main inflow sources of soil water are irrigation precipitation some precipitation may be lost as surface runoff and capillary rise of shallow groundwater level the outflow part mainly includes soil evaporation e crop transpiration tr and deep percolation 4 y d f h i h i 0 b 5 b w p i 1 n t ri e t o i 6 t r k s c c k c t r x

tr x is the coefficient for maximum crop transpiration mm under conditions of well watered soil and completely covered canopy raes et al 2009 tsakmakis et al 2019 the effects of water stress are described through four processes including limited leaf growth stomata conductance canopy senescence and alternated harvest index these effects are determined by their sensitivity levels to the depletion of total available soil water taw the volume of water the soil can hold between fc and pwp in the root zone raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 tsakmakis et al 2019 huang et al 2022 the aquacrop model does not simulate nutrient cycles and balances but it uses a semi quantitative method to describe the effect of soil fertility stress on the canopy development and biomass production raes et al 2018 an automatic calibration program was embedded in the model and five stress parameters were used to express the response to fertilizer stress relative biomass production maximum canopy coverage reduction of canopy expansion average decline canopy coverage and biomass water productivity the soil fertility level was selected in the field management menu by specifying a relative biomass production brel 7 b rel b s t r e s s b r e f 100 where the bstress is the biomass t ha 1 obtained under the conditions of fertilizer stress but no water stress bref is the biomass t ha 1 obtained under the condition of no fertilizer stress and water stress brel ranges from 0 to 100 0 indicates crop growth failure under fertilizer stress and 100 indicates no fertilizer stress bstress and bref were determined following experimental fields table 3 2 5 2 input data parameterization calibration and validation in this study the aquacrop version 6 1 was used to simulate the potato growth parameters canopy cover cc total dry matter in season tdm dry tuber yield water productivity wp and soil water content swc a climate file was created with daily meteorological data maximum average and minimum air temperatures eto and rainfall during the two potato growing seasons it was not possible to measure all the data so some default values or data provided by the model were selected for these parameters such as base temperature tbase and upper temperature tupper and the co2 file was built with the yearly atmospheric co2 concentration ipcc rcp 4 5 provided by the software soil physical characteristics such as soil saturation water content sat field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp was determined before the experiment table 1 the soil initial conditions irrigation and fertigation file are shown in tables 1 and 2 to determine the crop file the field experimental data in the 2018 and 2019 potato growing seasons were used for calibration and validation respectively the parameters in this file could be divided into conservative and non conservative types the non conservative parameters may vary significantly due to the year site or variety while the conservative parameters changed slightly in time management practices or geographic locations the parameters were obtained from the field and determined by the trial and error method and the references raes et al 2009 montoya et al 2016 tsakmakis et al 2019 according to the sensitivity analysis conducted by razzaghi et al 2017 the kc tr x hi o cc x and wp were highly sensitive to tuber yield in this study the parameterization process given by vanuytrecht et al 2014 was used first the development of canopy coverage cc was simulated and the parameters relative to cc including the plant density and phenological period time to emergence ccx senescence maturity and the duration of yield formation and hi building up were determined according to the measurements of the w3f4 treatment during the 2018 and 2019 potato cropping seasons these parameters with cc curve parameters i e cc0 cgc ccx cdc were further fine tuned and repeatedly calibrated for the w3f4 treatment until the simulation of cc were close to the observations the effective rooting depths were also observed from the field experiment second the crop transpiration t r and soil water content were simulated the kc tr x was adjusted by the model in this study the value of 1 15 was used taking into account the phenological stages and crop senescence next the values of wp was adjusted to 17 g m2 by the calibration of biomass to obtain a close match between the simulations and observations finally the hi0 66 average field measurement in 2018 was used to convert biomass to tuber dry weight the soil water stress coefficients i e p exp upper p exp lower p sto upper and p sen upper were taken from the manual and adjusted based on the deficit irrigation treatment w2f4 in addition the fertility stress parameters were calibrated using the field data from the four fertigation treatments under three irrigation amounts the average observed brel and ccx values and the qualitative description of cc decline for the fertility stress treatments f3 f2 f1 compared to the reference treatment f4 were used as inputs for calibration table 4 finally the simulated tuber dry weight was converted to fresh weight by assuming a dry matter content of 16 7 0 167 kg of dry matter per kg fresh weight based on the average field measurements in 2018 the simulated water productivity wps kg m 3 was calculated by the ratio of simulated fresh tuber yield to the estimated crop evapotranspiration etx 2 6 dssat substor potato model parameters and input data as a family of dssat the substor potato model also uses daily weather data soil properties cultivar parameters and crop management information to simulate the daily dynamics of water nitrogen phenology biomass and tuber yield accumulation raymundo et al 2017 woli and hoogenboom 2018 in the model potato growth and development were simulated according to the biomass accumulation and partitioning in relation to intercepted radiation photoperiodicity and temperature besides soil water and nitrogen deficit factors were considered and used to modify the rates of growth and phenological development which influenced on the photosynthesis tuber initiation and the carbon demand of tubers griffin et al 1993 raymundo et al 2017 the potato model simulates five phenological stages of the potato growth a pre planting b planting to sprout germination c sprout elongation to emergence d emergence to tuber initiation e tuber initiation to maturity owns five cultivar specific parameters leaf area expansion rate after tuber initiation g2 potential tuber growth rate g3 index that supresses tuber growth pd tuber initiation sensitivity to long photoperiods p2 and upper critical temperature for tuber initiation tc that control the potato development and growth and uses various trapezoidal temperature impact functions to simulate the effect of temperature on leaf root and tuber growth photosynthesis and tuber initiation the parameters p2 and tc influence the tuber initiation and the parameters pd g3 and g2 play a key role in the biomass accumulation and partitioning after tuber initiation tc and p2 are both embedded in the functions that determine tuber initiation and affect tuber expansion if the temperature is higher than tc the tuber initiation and tuber expansion will be reduced or inhibited p2 a dimensionless value between 0 and 1 determines the sensitivity to day length and the closer to 0 the lower the sensitivity of varieties to long photoperiods the parameter pd also ranges between 0 and 1 and describes how fast tubers get full priority over leaf growth the parameters g3 and g2 together with temperature water and nitrogen shortages determine the actual tuber growth and actual leaf expansion respectively the simulated dry tuber yield was converted to fresh weight by using the conversion factor of 20 griffin et al 1993 raymundo et al 2017 in addition soil water balance was calculated based on the precipitation irrigation infiltration deep drainage unsaturated flow soil evaporation and plant transpiration plant transpiration was determined by the potential evapotranspiration plant root distribution and total available soil water taw griffin et al 1993 woli and hoogenboom 2018 for details please refer to griffin et al 1993 and raymundo et al 2017 the input data for the substor potato model are the standard inputs required by dssat including site information daily weather solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation cultivar characteristics soil profile characteristics initial soil condition and field management practices anar et al 2019 the soil initial conditions soil properties irrigation and fertilization file are shown in tables 1 and 2 the five cultivar specific parameters are shown in table 5 measured data from the w3f4 treatment in 2018 was used for model calibration while data from the w3f4 treatment in 2019 was used for model validation the model was then used to simulate the potato growth and yield under different combinations of irrigation and fertigation regimes in 2018 and 2019 2 7 data quality and integrity assessment quality assessment and quality control of any measured data is essential to data integrity the measured data is strongly advised to compare against independent measurements or models allen et al 2011 experimental crop measurements in this study mainly included daily meteorological data dry tuber weight fresh tuber weight root dry weight leaf dry weight stem dry weight and soil water content the meteorological data were collected from an automatic meteorological station hobo event logger onset computer corporation usa about 100 m away from the experimental field and the data was compared with that of the national meteorological administration and the local meteorological bureau the plant growth data mainly adopted the method of taking the average value from multiple measurements to reduce the error the abnormal value of soil water content monitored by the instrument was checked by the oven drying method 2 8 model performance evaluation performance of the aquacrop and dssat substor potato version 4 7

the number of observations s i and o i are the simulated and observed values respectively s and o are the mean of simulated and observed values respectively the values of r 2 and d range from 0 to 1 the closer the values of r 2 and d are to 1 the more consistent the simulated value is with the observed value generally r 2 greater than 0 5 are considered acceptable santhi et al 2001 ran et al 2018 on the contrary the closer the values of rmse and nrmse are to 0 the better the agreement between the simulated and measured values the simulation is considered excellent when the nrmse less than 10 good when nrmse ranges from 10 to 20 acceptable when nrmse ranges from 20 to 30 and poor when nrmse greater than 30 jamieson et al 1991 the value of the ef ranges from negative infinity to 1 ef 1 indicates a perfect fit while ef 0 suggests the model is only as accurate as the mean of the observed data and ef 0 suggests the mean of the observed data is a better prediction than the model legates and mccabe jr 1999 besides dev and the slope of a linear regression quantify a possible overestimation or underestimation by the model and a deviation limit around 10 is considered as acceptable 2 9 scenario analysis accurate management of water and fertilizer is essential for potato growth in our study field experiments only included three drip irrigation levels and four fertigation n p2o5 k2o rates and it was found the observed tuber yield increased with the increase of irrigation amount under the same fertilizer rate however the deficit irrigation is conducive to improving water productivity and saving water resources therefore in order to make up for the deficiency of the field experiment the validated aquacrop model was used to simulate the tuber yield of four fertigation rates f1 f4 under irrigation levels of 120 etc irrigation amount was 1 2 times of 100 etc and 40 etc irrigation amount was 40 of 100 etc to test how the tuber yield would change with further increase and decrease of irrigation amount 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of aquacrop model 3 1 1 soil water content simulated by aquacrop model in order to track the root zone soil water content and the corresponding soil water stress the aquacrop model simulated and updated the soil water balance in daily steps during the simulation of soil water balance the root zone can be regarded as a reservoir and the change of soil water content in the root zone can be monitored by tracking the inflow flux and outflow flux at the boundary of the reservoir in this study the observed soil water content swc in the root zone 0 50 cm during the two potato growing seasons were compared to swc simulated by the aquacrop model under different drip fertigation regimes fig 2 generally the measured and simulated swc values of the 0 50 cm soil profile had a good response to precipitation and irrigation the model estimated swc with satisfactory accuracy under different irrigation and fertigation levels with nrmse of 7 8 14 8 and 8 6 13 2 r 2 of 0 40 0 88 and 0 61 0 90 rmse of 6 1 11 5 mm and 7 10 3 mm ef of 0 27 0 75 and 0 55 0 82 and d of 0 77 0 94 and 0 88 0 95 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 6 the results were similar to the findings of montoya et al 2016 and razzaghi et al 2017 who also used the aquacrop model simulated the soil water content fluctuation of potato field under various irrigation levels they found the r 2 values between simulated and observed soil water content for different irrigation levels varying between 0 45 and 0 74 0 34 and 0 92 respectively it was also found the model estimated soil water content with satisfactory accuracy under different irrigation and fertilization levels which indicated that the parameterization of the model for cc and soil water content parameters were suitable paredes et al 2014 nunes et al 2021 additionally the results showed that the simulation accuracy of high fertilizer treatments for swc was better than that of low fertigation level the discrepancies between the observed and simulated swc values increased with the decrease of irrigation amount table 6 this may be because different amounts of irrigation and fertigation affected the distribution of potato roots which further affected plant transpiration and soil evaporation 3 1 2 canopy cover simulated by aquacrop model as a key element in the aquacrop model the accurate simulation of canopy cover cc is necessary for the model to realize satisfactory prediction of soil water content fluctuation evapotranspiration crop biomass and final yield sandhu and irmak 2019 huang et al 2022 the graphical comparison of canopy cover simulated by the aquacrop model with the observations in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 3 during parameterization the parameters relative to cc were calibrated firstly and the soil water stress coefficients affecting canopy cove were adjusted to simulate the cc development under deficit irrigation in this study the canopy expansion ks p exp lower and ks p exp upper were set as 0 3 and 0 7 which were slightly higher than the data in the reference manual and the default value 0 2 and 0 6 in the aquacrop model calendar lima 17 may 95 greenwood et al 2010 found the potato transpiration and growth rate decreased when the water deficit exceeded the maximum allowable soil moisture deficit of 35 additionally the combination of slower canopy expansion reduced maximum canopy cover early decline in canopy cover and lower biomass water productivity were used by the semi quantitative approach in the aquacrop model to simulate the effect of fertility stress on canopy cover gaelen et al 2015 overall the aquacrop model adequately captured the dynamics of canopy cover except for w1f1 the aquacrop model estimated canopy cover with excellent and good accuracy under the different irrigation and fertigation regimes with r 2 0 81 d 0 92 nrmse 20 and rmse 14 2 table 7 the simulation accuracy of w2f4 was highest in 2018 r 2 0 99 rmse 5 2 nrmse 6 2 d 0 99 and ef 0 96 and 2019 r 2 0 98 rmse 3 7 nrmse 4 5 d 0 98 and ef 1 00 satisfactory canopy cover simulation was also obtained by previous studies on rice shrestha et al 2013 winter wheat huang et al 2022 maize abedinpour et al 2012 chen et al 2019 and soybean khoshravesh et al 2013 adeboye et al 2021 under different irrigation and fertilization levels besides the model gave better predictions of canopy cover under high fertigation treatments than low fertigation treatments the simulation accuracy decreased with the decrease of fertilizer application rate this may be due to the limitation of the aquacrop model to simulate the coupling effects of water fertilizer and other factors that affect canopy cover huang et al 2022 3 1 3 total dry matter simulated by aquacrop model the simulated total dry matter by the aquacrop model was compared with the observed values in 2018 and 2019 seasons fig 4 when estimating the dry matter the normalized water productivity wp of 17 g m2 was adopted to convert the crop transpiration to the dry matter similar with the results of cc the aquacrop also gave excellent good and acceptable estimates of total dry matter under different irrigation and fertigation treatments excep for w1f1 as indicated by high r 2 values 0 96 and 0 92 high d values 0 93 and 0 94 and low estimation errors 0 5 rmse 1 8 t ha 1 and 0 7 rmse 2 2 t ha 1 7 7 nrmse 22 1 and 12 2 nrmse 25 0 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 7 however error between simulated and observed values were larger in the high water stress treatments 60 etc w1 than that of 100 etc irrigation w3 and 80 etc irrigation level w2 tables 7 and 8 fig 4 there was a high agreement between the simulated and observed final total dry matter under high irrigation 100 etc w3 with dev ranging 9 75 2 35 and 8 87 0 78 in 2018 and 2019 respectively under 80 etc deficit irrigation w2 dev ranged 2 86 16 65 and 3 74 11 27 in the two seasons under 60 etc deficit irrigation w1 dev ranged 21 11 34 61 and 19 85 29 74 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 8 the model over estimated the final total dry matter under 60 etc and the highest estimation errors occurred in the w1f1 treatment table 8 fig 4 the results were consistent with the findings of afshar and neshat 2013 and razzaghi et al 2017 who also found the aquacrop model performed better in simulation of dry matter under the fully irrigated and mildly stressed treatments overall the simulation accuracy of the final total dry matter was acceptable with r 2 rmse nrmse ef and d of 0 61 1 45 t ha 1 14 25 0 46 and 0 81 in 2018 and 0 66 1 30 t ha 1 12 81 0 47 and 0 83 in 2019 respectively table 9 according to the slopes of the linear regression they were lower than the ideal by 45 2 and 36 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively indicating that the simulated result was better in 2019 than that in 2018 fig 5a 3 1 4 dry tuber yield fresh tuber yield et and water productivity simulated by aquacrop model the simulated dry tuber yield fresh tuber yield et and water productivity by the aquacrop model in 2018 and 2019 seasons were compared with the observed values in tables 8 and 9 and fig 5 when predicting the tuber yield the observed average harvest index hi of 66 was used to convert dry matter into dry tuber yield which was lower than the range of the reference harvest index hio values proposed by raes et al 2018 for potato 70 85 besides an observed average coefficient 16 7 0 167 kg of dry matter per kg fresh weight was used to convert the dry tuber yield into fresh weight which was also smaller than the range of the reference values 20 25 suggested by quiroz et al 2012 this may be because the harvest index of different varieties under different field management measures was diverse mohammadi et al 2013 revealed that the harvest index of marfona was 65 6 83 7 when different fertilizer types were applied wang et al 2019a 2019b found when different nitrogen levels were applied the harvest index of chuanyu 117 and mira were 0 89 0 90 and 0 92 0 93 and the dry matter content in fresh potatoes of the two potato cultivars were 16 2 24 7 and 18 5 27 respectively what s more pu et al 2020 pointed out that the harvest index of cultivar longshu 3 was 0 35 0 47 under different tillage methods in this study the accuracy of dry and fresh tuber yield estimated by the aquacrop model was satisfactory under high irrigation 100 etc w3 and 80 etc irrigation level w2 with dev ranging from 8 98 9 42 and 9 28 9 19 in 2018 and 10 93 5 26 and 6 90 8 49 in 2019 respectively table 8 the fresh tuber yield under 60 etc deficit irrigation w1 was over estimated with dev ranging from 18 74 to 23 04 and 13 16 17 75 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the main reason for this result was that the overestimated total dry matter led to the overestimated tuber yield in addition the observed harvest index under deficit irrigation was lower than that under high irrigation overall the r 2 rmse nrmse ef and d values of dry tuber yield were 0 57 0 83 t ha 1 12 21 0 45 and 0 82 in 2018 and 0 71 0 51 t ha 1 7 07 0 69 and 0 92 in 2019 respectively the r 2 rmse nrmse ef and d values of fresh tuber yield were 0 53 4 91 t ha 1 12 02 0 38 and 0 81 in 2018 and 0 75 3 64 t ha 1 8 83 0 67 and 0 90 in 2019 respectively table 9 besides the slopes of the linear regression for dry and fresh tuber yield were 0 607 and 0 632 in 2018 and 0 843 and 0 738 in 2019 which were lower than the ideal by 39 3 and 36 8 in 2018 and 15 7 and 26 2 in 2019 respectively fig 5b and c water productivity as one of the important indexes to determine the optimal irrigation and fertigation levels were also calculated based on the et simulated by the aquacrop model in the aquacrop model the evaporation part was separated from the transpiration and the model mainly considered the crop transpiration whereas under filed conditions both evaporation and transpiration were involved in the estimation of water consumption afshar et al 2014 instead of that the sum of ex and trx was used to calculate et and water productivity and compared with field water productivity in this study the simulation accuracy of et was acceptable under 100 etc irrigation w3 and 80 etc irrigation level w2 with dev ranging 10 74 2 76 and 7 00 7 34 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 8 under 60 etc irrigation level w1 dev ranged 11 20 14 84 and 12 86 15 12 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 8 this may be the main reason for the overestimation of dry matter and yield under 60 irrigation level however there was a high agreement between the simulated and observed water productivity wp with dev ranging from 4 75 9 77 in 2018 and 5 55 6 45 in 2019 respectively table 8 the r 2 rmse nrmse ef and d values were 0 91 0 48 kg m 3 5 51 0 71 and 0 94 in 2018 and 0 95 0 27 kg m 3 2 98 0 93 and 0 98 in 2019 respectively table 9 the slope of the linear regression in 2019 1 211 was closer to one than that in 2018 1 037 fig 5d

simulated by the dssat substor potato model during the two potato growing seasons the accuracy of lai simulated by dssat substor poatto model was weaker than that of cc simulated by the aquacrop model and the simulation accuracy decreased with the decrease of irrigation and fertigation regimes the simulation accuracy of w3f3 and w3f4 was acceptable with nrmse 30 during calibration and validation while the model estimated lai with unsatisfactory accuracy under the other irrigation and fertility levels with nrmse 30 table 10 the agreement between the simulated and observed total dry matter by the dssat substor potato model was also weaker than that of the aquacrop model table 10 the simulation accuracy of the high fertilizer treatments f3 and f4 were acceptable under high irrigation and 80 etc w2 with r 2 0 83 nrmse 30 ef 0 74 and d 0 94 while the lowest accuracy of total dry matter was observed in the low fertigation treatment with low irrigation amount w1f1 fig 7 table 10 the agreement between the observed and simulated values decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount under f1 and f2 the simulation results of dry tuber yield fresh tuber yield final total dry matter et and water productivity by the dssat substor potato model in 2018 and 2019 seasons are presented in table 11 and fig 8 compared with the aquacrop model the simulation accuracy of tuber yield final total dry matter et and water productivity estimated by dssat substor potato model were also weaker the r 2 values of the final total dry matter dry tuber yield fresh tuber yield and water productivity simulated by the dssat substor potato model were 0 63 0 61 0 64 and 0 15 in 2018 and 0 39 0 42 0 42 and 0 03 in 2019 respectively the corresponding nrmse values were 26 26 26 26 26 17 and 13 38 in 2018 and 35 49 30 57 36 99 and 18 55 in 2019 respectively table 12 the discrepancies between the observed and simulated dry tuber yield and wp values increased with the decrease of fertigation rate and the dry and fresh tuber yield and et was seriously over estimated by the dssat substor potato model under 60 etc w1 with dev ranging from 21 98 to 70 76 20 81 60 73 and 21 93 25 53 in 2018 and 24 31 59 73 29 00 78 06 and 28 3 31 26 in 2019 respectively however the simulation accuracy of et was acceptable under 100 etc irrigation w3 with dev ranging 2 07 1 59 and 4 48 6 18 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 11 the slopes of the linear regression for final dry matter dry and fresh tuber yield and wp were 0 183 0 110 0 122 and 0 079 in 2018 and 0 164 0 131 0 112 and 0 033 in 2019 respectively which were far from one fig 8 3 2 2 soil water content simulated by dssat substor potato model fig 6 shows the observed soil water content swc in the root zone 0 50 cm compared to swc simulated by the dssat substor potato model under different drip fertigation levels in 2018 and 2019 the dssat substor potato model also gave good estimates of swc in different drip fertigation treatments the r 2 rmse nrmse ef and d values were 0 54 0 77 8 81 11 88 mm 10 27 15 08 0 20 0 68 and 0 84 0 93 in 2018 and 0 59 0 91 6 62 12 00 mm 8 29 15 40 0 27 0 87 and 0 87 0 97 in 2019 respectively table 6 fig 9 to sum up the dssat substor potato model produced better estimates of lai total dry matter soil water content and final tuber yield and water productivity under high irrigation with high fertigation the simulation accuracy of total dry matter soil water content tuber yield and water productivity estimated by the dssat substor potato model under different drip irrigation and fertigation levels were lower than that of the aquacrop model however previous studies have shown that the dssat substor potato model had a good performance in the simulated and observed potato yield and nitrate leaching under different irrigation and nitrogen managements vashisht et al 2015 woli et al 2016 this may be because the dssat substor potato model mainly considered the water and nitrogen stress when simulating the lai and biomass accumulation raymundo et al 2017 but phosphorus and potassium were weaker in this model however potato is a crop that requires plenty of potassium fertilizer potassium affects the transport and synthesis of proteins nucleic acids and carbohydrates especially the synthesis of carbohydrates and starch in storage organs su et al 2010 the uptake of potassium was much greater than that of nitrogen and phosphorus zhang et al 2010 in our field experiments the application rate of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium changed at the same time according to a certain proportion besides the initial soil nh4 n and no3 n contents 0 40 cm reached 18 49 mg kg 1 and 12 97 mg kg 1 in 2018 and 22 04 mg kg 1 and 7 59 mg kg 1 in 2019 which may weakened the effect of nitrogen fertilizer therefore little difference in simulated lai dry matter and tuber yield between fertigation levels under three irrigation levels was obtained the coupling effect of water and fertilizer was not reflected in this model however during the application of the aquacrop model although it also could not fully estimate the coupling effect of water and fertilizer it adopted a semi quantitative approach to simulate the effects of soil fertility stress gaelen et al 2015 huang et al 2022 the fertilizer nitrogen phosphorus and potassium stress can be realized through calculation based on the observed canopy cover and biomass therefore the aquacrop model seems to be better if we only simulate potato growth and predict tuber yield under different water and fertilizer n p2o5 k2o regimes without predicting the nutrient cycles and balances 3 3 scenarios simulation the observed tuber yield increased with the increase of irrigation amount 60 100 etc under the same fertigation rate therefore the yield of different fertigation rates under irrigation levels 120 etc and 40 etc were further simulated using the aquacrop model due to its satisfactory accuracy in simulating tuber yield fig 10 compared with 100 etc 120 etc irrigation only increased the fresh tuber yield of by 0 19 1 52 in 2018 and 0 34 1 26 in 2019 but the irrigation amount of 37 2 mm and 48 2 mm was more consumed during the two potato growing seasons the results were consistent with the finding of montoya et al 2016 who also found there was no significant difference in tuber yield between 120 and 100 crop water requirement besides the 40 etc irrigation decreased potato yield by 1 08 4 74 and 4 98 14 61 and the irrigation amount was saved by 111 6 mm and 145 2 mm compared with 100 etc during the two potato growing seasons respectively fig 10 however badr et al 2012 found that compared with 100 etc the tuber yield of irrigation levels 60 etc and 40 etc decreased by 27 3 and 44 6 respectively our field experiments showed that the tuber yield of irrigation level 60 etc decreased more than 20 compared with 100 etc the simulated yield was larger than the observed values under deficit irrigation so the results need to be further verified during the field experiment the early deficit irrigation had a certain impact on potato growth although the later rainfall amount was higher and had a certain compensation effect but the effect was small however in the process of model simulation this aspect was weak comprehensively considering the observed and simulated tuber yield of different drip fertigation levels and the water resources the irrigation amount 100 etc with fertigation n p2o5 k2o rate 200 80 300 kg ha 1 f3 was more suitable for potato production which also complemented and validated our previous findings wang et al 2021b 3 4 limitations and suggestions although the aquacrop model for simulating canopy cover and dry matter soil water content final tuber yield and water productivity had an acceptable goodness of fit between observed and simulated values under different drip fertigation levels the estimation errors between the observed and simulated values still existed especially when the water deficiency and nutrient stress occurred as discussed above this may be due to that the model couldn t completely perform the coupling effects of water and fertilizer compared to the other crop models the nutrient cycles and balances were not considered in this model gaelen et al 2015 however although the dssat substor potato model considered the cycles and balances of nutrient it mainly estimated the balance of nitrogen the balance of phosphorus and potassium were missing potato is a potassium like crop after tuber formation potassium fertilizer may be more important than nitrogen fertilizer for potato which has an influence on the transportation of photosynthetic products to storage organs bishal and devashish 2019 zhang et al 2022 if we only simulate potato growth and predict tuber yield of different water and fertilizer n p2o5 k2o regimes without predicting the nutrient balance the aquacrop model seems to be more competent besides the irrigation and fertilization parameters such as emitter flow emitter spacing layout of drip pipe fertilizer concentration and so on are not considered by the two models which directly affect the distribution of water and nutrients in the field in addition the observed data were limit only a two year field experiment was used to calibrate and validate the two models in this study overall the development of potato model still needs a long way to go 4 conclusions the aquacrop and dssat substor potato models were calibrated validated and used to simulate the canopy cover lai dry matter tuber yield water productivity and soil water content under different drip irrigation and fertigation amounts during two potato growing season 2018 and 2019 except for w1f1 the aquacrop model gave satisfactory predictions of canopy cover total dry matter and soil water content the simulated dry and fresh tuber yield by the aquacrop agreed well with the measured values under high irrigation 100 etc and 80 etc irrigation level but the tuber yield under 60 etc irrigation was over estimated as for the substor potato model because the model did not fully reflect the water and fertilizer nitrogen phosphorus and potassium stresses the simulation accuracy of total dry matter soil water content tuber yield and water productivity of this model was lower than that of aquacrop model the model only showed a goodness of fit between simulated and observed values under high irrigation with high fertigation if it is not necessary to estimate the nutrient cycles and balances and only predict the potato growth and tuber yield under different irrigation amounts along with different n p and k application rates the aquacrop model seems to better the scenario simulation indicated that 120 etc only slightly increased the tuber yield but more water resources were consumed the irrigation amount 100 etc with fertigation n p2o5 k2o rate 200 80 300 kg ha 1 f3 was better for potato production by comprehensively considering the observed and simulated tuber yield and water resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9172,inappropriate management of irrigation and nitrogen n fertilization can lead to underground water pollution and soil degradation as well as increase the cost of crop production particularly in humid areas of china in this context the present experiment was designed to determine the appropriate irrigation amount and n fertilization rate for higher crop production enzymatic activities and n content a two years field experiment was conducted during 2020 2021 to assess the effects of two irrigation condition rainfed and supplementary irrigation and five n fertilization rates i e 0 150 200 250 and 300 kg ha 1 thereafter referred as n0 n150 n200 n250 and n300 on aboveground dry biomass soil maize n accumulation n metabolisms related enzymes grain yield and economic efficiency supplementary irrigation n fertilization and their interaction significantly affected the above measured parameters for instance n250 treatment with supplementary irrigation significantly increased grain n content aboveground dry biomass and n metabolisms enzymes nitrate reductase glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase compared to n250 treatment n300 resulted 0 4 lower grain yield under supplementary irrigation similarly the interaction of supplementary irrigation and n250 treatment enhanced the soil total n and nitrate n content compared to other treatments supplementary irrigation significantly increased grain yield by 13 6 compared to rainfed condition more importantly both n use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency and the cost benefit ratio were reduced when n fertilization rate exceed to n300 treatment of the supplemented irrigation plot compared to other n fertilization rates the n250 treatment resulted in a maximum net benefit of 10 082 cny ha 1 under supplementary irrigation condition therefore we suggest that 250 kg n ha 1 with supplementary irrigation is the best choice to improve n use efficiency grain yield and provide a maximum economic benefit of maize crop these finding may facilitate the scientific basis for irrigation and n fertilization management of maize crop in humid areas of china keywords drip irrigation n metabolism grain n content zea mays data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global demand for agricultural crops is increasing and may continue to do so for decades propelled by a 2 3 billion person increase in global population and greater per capita incomes anticipated through mid century tilman et al 2011 in addition water demand for agriculture could double by 2050 whereas the availability of fresh water is predicted to drop by 50 owing to climate change gleick 2000 the impact of climate change is large such as unpredictable rain reduction of water resources and deterioration of water quality together cause decline of agricultural production ultimately threaten food security srivastav et al 2021 china water resources are decreasing from southeast to northwest in spatial distribution and in more recent the rainfall in the area is significantly uneven due to global climate change however the agricultural production potential of southwest china guangxi province is generally increased due to the extensively raining in the current climate change scenario it greatly reduced the consumption of water resources for irrigation purposes which contributes to the sustainable development of regional water resources and ecology cao et al 2021 peng et al 2019 although the rainfall is abundant the temporal and spatial distribution is uneven and the phased drought affects the maize production in this region wang et al 2021 n is one of the most important plant nutrients and plays a crucial role in multiple plant developmental processes it is an important essential element of plant organic compounds accounting for the vast majority of dry matter accumulation cohen et al 2019 cui et al 2019 n metabolism is a crucial fundamental metabolic process of maize and its accumulation during post anthesis stage has a greater impact on crop yield wu et al 2018 crop production is heavily dependent on the supply of exogenous n fertilization in most agricultural areas xing et al 2019 zhen et al 2006 mentioned that intensive use of chemical fertilization has remarkably increased upto three fold the average grain yield of wheat and maize from 1967 to 2000 in china while the average rate of n fertilizer application enhanced five fold during the same period 1967 143 kg ha 1 2000 670 kg ha 1 suggesting that high n fertilizer use increased the crop production but its overuse however leads to decreased n fertilization use efficiency increases nitrate leaching into groundwater and nitrate enrichment of vegetables and is therefore considered an unsustainable method quan et al 2021 in addition the extensive rate of n fertilization produces surplus nutrients flowing from the land to the sea which seriously affects the coastal ecosystem liu et al 2019 reducing the large dependency on overuse of n fertilization for high crop yield can reduce its impact on water acidification and global warming abbas et al 2021 therefore to reduce inputs for maize production it is essential to optimize the rate of n fertilization for different irrigation systems maize is the second largest food crop in guangxi province of china and the sown area of maize in guangxi province accounts for 18 4 20 4 of the total cultivated area seasonal drought often affects corn planting in guangxi province among which spring drought decline the seed germination and affects corn emergence rate n fertilization rate in this province is high but the utilization rate of n fertilization is low which not only leads to low grain yield but also affects the sustainable development of arable land the inappropriate over usage of water and n have no significant positive effect on grain yield increase but it results in high costs and decrease in net income wang et al 2014 previously most of the researchers have focused on the optimization of irrigation and n fertilization rate for different crop species in arid areas while the importance of irrigation in humid areas of china is often neglected due to abundant annual rainfall in addition most previous studies have focused mainly on the effects of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization on soil n residues and or single aspects of crop n fertilization with little attention paid to the role of both on soil plant interactions for n utilization and economic benefits therefore we studied the effects of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization rates on n metabolism related enzymes and soil n pool specifically we aimed to study the response of irrigation and n management to determine how supplementary irrigation and n fertilization affects n use efficiency at the soil plant level grain yield and economic efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description experimental design

experiments duration was comprised of from march 9th to july 9th during 2020 and from march 4th to july 5th during 2021 which was consistent with the local spring maize growth cycle the experiment was arranged in a split plot design applying two factors with ten treatments and three replications the size of each plot was 4 2 m long and 3 9 m wide the treatments were consisted of two irrigation treatments rainfall and supplementary irrigation considered as a main plot and five n fertilization rates i e 0 150 200 250 and 300 kg n ha 1 thereafter designated as n0 n150 n200 n250 and n300 respectively are considered as a sub plot in the rainfed condition all water required during the whole growth stage came from natural rainfall while in supplementary irrigation condition drip irrigation was employed when soil moisture content was became lower than 60 of maximum field moisture holding capacity prior to that the basic macro nutrient fertilization was supplied uniformly such as calcium magnesium phosphorus p2o5 18 0 100 kg ha 1 and potassium chloride k2o 60 0 100 kg ha 1 and urea n 46 0 supplied according to the treatments the p and k fertilization were supplied to each

were directly sown in soil at the density of 55 556 seeds ha 1 with plant to plant and row to row distance were kept 0 3 m and 0 6 m respectively all the remaining standard farming practices including herbicide and insecticides were performed in all treatments during the entire experimental seasons 2 2 soil and plant samples collection and measurement soil samples were obtained by core soil sampler at the depth of 0 20 cm in 3 replicates for each treatment immediately after the plants were harvested using 5 point method the soil samples of each plot were sieved 2 mm and mixed to make a composite sample later each sample was divided into two parts one used for the determination of total soil n kept for natural drying and the other half was stored at 4 c in a refrigerator for the nitrate n no3 n content determination three uniform plants were collected from each treatment at flowering stage r1 and maturity stage r6 after dividing the plant into stem leaf bract cob and grains dried at 105 c for 1 h to inactivate the enzyme and then it was dried at 75 c to a constant weight after being crushed it was screened through 100 mesh for reserve meanwhile three uniform plants were selected from each treatment and the veins were removed from the ear leaves leaving the middle of the ear leaf wrapped in tin foil and marked then quickly placed in liquid n and stored at 80 c in an ultra low temperature refrigerator for measurement of n metabolism enzymes 2 3 determination of soil nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen tn fresh soil 5 00 g was processed with 25 ml of 1 mol l 1 kcl solution

the tn accumulation in maize samples stem leaves bract cob and grain were analyzed at flowering stage r1 and maturity stage r6 during the 2020 and 2021 fig 3 the results showed that tn accumulation increases from r1 to r6 reproductive growth stage and the highest n accumulation was observed in grains during r6 compared with rainfed condition the supplementary irrigation significantly increased tn accumulation in stems leaves and bract cob by 37 6 10 8 37 9 35 1 and 19 1 18 5 at r1 growth stage and stems leaves bract cob and grain tn accumulation by 23 4 28 0 33 9 17 6 33 9 20 5 and 12 2 11 6 at r6 growth stage during 2020 2021 respectively also n accumulation in all samples was increased with increasing n fertilization at r1 growth stage during both growing seasons however altered results were obtained for tn accumulation at r6 growth stage where no significant differences p 0 05 in grain tn accumulation were observed in n250 and n300 treatments during 2020 the aboveground dry biomass was measured only at maturity during both growing seasons 2020 2021 the results showed that n250 and n300 treatments both under supplementary irrigation and rainfed had significantly higher aboveground dry biomass than other treatments during both growing season fig 4 the aboveground dry biomass was higher by the interaction of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization rate n250 and n300 than rainfed condition of same n fertilization treatment in both growing seasons for instance the aboveground biomass of rainfed and supplementary irrigation were 17 334 and 18 998 kg ha 1 during 2020 under n300 treatment and 18 697 and 20 579 kg ha 1 during 2021 under n250 treatments respectively these increases were 106 4 and 109 8 during 2020 and 157 7 and 158 8 during 2021 under n250 and n300 treatments respectively when compared to n0 however its worthy to note that there was no significant difference in average aboveground dry biomass under n250 and n300 during both growing seasons these results suggest that supplementary irrigation and n fertilization have a positive effect on aboveground dry biomass 3 2 changes in nitrogen metabolism related enzymes activities in response to supplementary irrigation and n fertilization rates the changes of ear leaf n metabolisms enzyme activities at r1 and r6 growth stages were shown in fig 5 in 2020 the activities of nr gs and gdh were reduced under rainfed regime than supplementary irrigation condition the addition of n fertilization dose dependently increased the nr gs and gdh activities under both water conditions compared to supplementary irrigation condition at r1 growth stage the nr gs and gdh activities in ear leaf samples were reduced by 19 5 31 5 and 22 4 respectively under rainfall condition when compared to n0 at r1 growth stage the n fertilization dose dependently increased the nr activity 64 1 100 3 138 0 and 159 3 gs activity 70 3 171 4 259 9 and 290 5 and gdh activity 61 6 110 9 161 6 and 181 1 under n150 n200 n250 and n300 treatments respectively the n fertilization dose wise significantly enhanced the activities of these enzymes except nr activity under rainfed condition and gs gdh activities under supplementary irrigation condition in n250 and n300 treatments at r1 growth stage during 2020 when compared r6 to r1 growth stage the activities of nr gs and gdh were reduced under all treatment s combination condition and the changes in nr gs and gdh activities during 2021 were followed the same trend as in 2020 in addition compared to 2020 the nr gs and gdh activities in 2021 were increased by 17 6 18 5 and 13 6 respectively 3 3 effect of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization rates on soil tn soil tn content under varying n fertilization rates and irrigation were significantly affected during both years fig 6 soil tn content increased with increasing n fertilization rates the highest soil tn content was observed in n300 treatment 1 81 g kg 1 during 2020 and 1 84 g kg 1 in 2021 however there was no statistical differences p 0 05 between n250 and n300 in tn content during both growing seasons in contrast to 2020 the soil tn content of n0 and n150 in 2021 showed a decreasing trend while n200 n250 and n300 show the opposite trend which indicated that the n fertilization rates of 200 300 kg ha 1 were more conducive to maintaining soil n balance the total n content of supplementary irrigation decreased in both growing seasons but had no significant difference p 0 05 3 4 changes in soil no3 n under irrigation water and n fertilization rates the soil no3 n content under varying n fertilization rates and irrigation condition has significantly affected during both study year fig 7 for example the no3 n content was ranged from 7 53 to 19 33 kg ha 1 in the first year 2020 and was ranged 7 73 18 89 kg ha 1 in the second study year 2021 compared with rainfed condition the soil no3 n content was significantly decreased in supplementary irrigation by 10 4 furthermore showed an increasing trend when the n fertilization rate increases under both irrigation conditions the highest soil no3 n content was observed under n300 treatment across the irrigation treatments and growing season however there were no statistical differences in soil no3 n content in n250 and n300 treatments except under supplementary irrigation during 2020 for instance compared with n0 n150 and n200 the no3 n content increased by 126 0 49 7 and 27 2 in n300 the general response trend of soil no3 n content to n fertilization rates and supplementary irrigation during 2021 was similar as in 2020 study year though the result showed 5 4 lower no3 n content during 2021 than 2020 growing season 3 5 nitrogen use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency grain yield and economic benefits result showed that n fertilization and supplementary irrigation effectively regulated the accumulation and distribution of n resulting significantly effect on the n and irrigation water use efficiency table 1 and table 2 showed that during both study years 2020 2021 the interactive effect of n fertilization and supplementary irrigation significantly improved the grain yield except under n300 treatment with supplementary irrigation under rainfed condition the grain yield net income and nc increased with increasing n fertilization with maximum grain yield 6967 and 7167 kg ha 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively net income and nc were obtained under n300 treatment whereas under the supplementary irrigation condition the maximum grain yield 7700 and 7783 kg ha 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively net income and nc were found under n250 treatment when the n fertilization rate exceeds 250 kg ha 1 the net income and nc were decreased during both study years under supplementary irrigation for instance the net income during 2020 growing season was 10044 cny ha 1 and during 2021 it was 10119 cny ha 1 under the interactive treatment of supplementary irrigation and n250 treatment in addition the result showed that supplementary irrigation promoted the nue in both growing seasons it suggested that nue increased with appropriate n fertilization while high rate of n fertilization may result in low nue due to growth redundancy similarly iwue increased with an increase n rate reached maximum at n250 treatment and remains the same at n300 treatment under irrigated condition only this showed that proper n fertilization not only improved n utilization but also promoted irrigation water efficiency which also indicated that exogenous n needs water to be absorbed and utilized by the plants 4 discussion 4 1 impact of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization rates on plant nitrogen metabolism n is an important nutrient for plant growth and a major component of amino acids proteins and endogenous hormones in the plant wen et al 2020 as well as an important fundamental part of grain formation zhang et al 2022 water scarcity leads to low n accumulation and shorten the crop growth cycle resulting in reduce biomass and crop growth coelho et al 2020 xia et al 2021 found that the effects of water and n fertilization were different on tn accumulation among plant samples and growth stages for example in peanut n accumulation amount was high in leaf tissue at vegetative stage and was high in pod at reproductive stage our results showed high n accumulation at r1 growth stage by leaf stem bract cob whereas at r6 growth stage grain accounted for the highest proportion of n accumulation under the combined treatment of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization rate surprisingly there was no significant difference in grain tn accumulation in between n250 and n300 probably due to the fact that the high vegetative growth upon n300 treatment affected the reproductive growth in the later stage causing pool limitation and which also affected the redistribution of n to the grain previous study found that high n fertilization reduced the yield of cotton in high fertile soil and suggested that high n rate will only be applied into the low fertile soil in order to increase the yield galdi et al 2022 the crop yield is based on dry matter accumulation soil moisture and nutrient status are the two important factors affecting the dry matter weight accumulation of crops wang et al 2019 amanullah et al 2021 furthermore increasing the amount of n fertilization to a certain range can facilitates dry matter transport to the grains and this might happen due to the fertilization of high n rates after flowering stage yu et al 2021 in this study n fertilization dose dependently along with supplementary irrigation significantly p 0 05 promoted the aboveground dry biomass accumulation of different samples of maize crop with highest accumulation observed under n300 followed by n250 treatment n metabolism is largely involved in routine functional cellular activities and is considered the fundamental components of many processes required for plant growth and development erdal 2019 the n assimilation levels of crop plants are reflected by the activities of key enzymes i e nr gdh gs among others involved in n metabolism pathway ji et al 2020 previous literature demonstrated that n fertilization increased the relative expression and activity of nr and gdh in citrus trees leaves xiong et al 2021 and in wheat leaves ma et al 2019 our results showed that both n fertilization supplementary irrigation and their interaction increased nr gs and gdh activities in leaves at r1 and r6 growth stages the increased in these activities were positively correlated to high n fertilization rates nr and gs play a pivotal role in n metabolism and nr acting as a substrate inducing enzyme triggered by high nitrate content ahmad et al 2022a high root zone nitrate content increased the activity of nr which act as a catalyze to reduced it nitrite in cytosol lee and titus 1992 research showed enhanced activities of nr and gs eliminate the drought stress in maize crop under n and kno3 treatment ahmad et al 2022a b this study suggests that high n treatments n250 and n300 kept the canopy leaves alive at r6 growth stage resulting in assimilation and redistribution of leaf n to the grain ultimately increased the grain n accumulation and dry matter weight antonietta et al 2021 4 2 impact of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization on soil n pool n is a component of many organic molecules and plants are heavily depending on available n stock in root zone in warm and humid regions despite relatively high soil n stocks soil n supply for crop production is very low also due to the uptake of plant the soil n stock might deplete which can be compensated by fertilization of n nendel et al 2019 losacco et al 2021 soil tn which is the sum of inorganic and organic n is one of the main factors impacting the soil fertility it is obvious that n fertilization increases the mineral n concentration in the 0 20 cm soil layer he et al 2021 the high n fertilization increased the no3 n content and storage in the 0 60 cm soil layer and if this content level increases than 94 3 100 0 kg ha 1 then the risk of nitrate leaching in red soil increases exponentially n runoff loss which has counted about 88 3 90 7 of dissolved inorganic n from the surface was mainly due to high fertilization and soil inorganic n content li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 this runoff loss can be control by appropriate water and fertilization management practices by improving soil chemistry and regulate microbial community structure qi et al 2020 ye et al 2021 the results of this study showed that both soil tn and no3 n contents increased and positively correlated with high n fertilization compared with low n treatment probably because the fertilization of low n rates was not sufficient to meet the n requirement of plant growth which in turn depleted the original stock of soil n hence leading to a decrease in soil n content soil tn and no3 n contents were lower in supplementary irrigation than in rainfed condition probably because supplementary irrigation promoted n uptake by crop metabolism 4 3 impact of supplementary irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on economic benefits and n irrigation water use efficiency the appropriate management of water n use efficiencies are the determinant of plant growth and development resulting in high yield yue et al 2021 which are greatly interconnect the choice of proper irrigation system such as drip irrigation is beneficial to improves crop yield reduces the water loss and increases the n use efficiency the study of lu et al 2021 showed that drip irrigation along with n fertilization rate had significant effects on grain yield water productivity and n fertilization efficiency in summer maize in line with that our study found that optimal fertilization of n n250 increased the net grain yield under supplementary irrigation while the high dose of n n300 treatment didn t further increase the net grain yield suggesting that excessive n inputs did not result in significant grain yield increase rather than increase the n fertilization expenditure in contrast under rainfed condition there was positive effect of all n fertilization rates on net grain yield of maize crop table 1 and table 2 li et al 2017 demonstrated that appropriate amount of n fertilization during sowing stage followed by flowering stage for cotton production in the yellow river basin can result in high ecological and economic benefits supplementary irrigation is one of the effective water management practices to improve crop yield and water n use efficiency brar and vashist 2020 liu et al 2022 in this study we found that n250 fertilization treatment significantly increased the uptake and utilization of n under supplementary irrigation than rainfed condition this could be due to supplementary irrigation promoted transport of n in soil which increase n availability to plant and eventually result in increased nue increased however the excessive fertilization of n treatment n300 produced vigorous maize growth and prolonged the vegetative growth duration which had disturbed the reproductive growth duration grain filling time had shortened and irrigation water use efficiency had not increased n use affects n recovery efficiency and n recovery efficiency has a greater effect on increasing grain yield than n use efficiency therefore appropriate water to n ratio can obtain maximum nue and wue hammad et al 2017 kassie and fanataye 2019 furthermore between study years iwue in 2021 was less when compared to 2020 could be related to the increase of total applied water amount for less rainfall amount in march april during 2021 supplementary irrigation can significantly improve water use efficiency and suitable water and n inputs can bring high economic benefits to farmers yuan et al 2022 in this study we found that n250 combined with supplementary irrigation had the maximum nue iwue and net benefits 5 conclusions from the above results we concluded that supplementary irrigation combined with n250 and n300 treatments increased tn accumulation aboveground dry biomass of maize and increased the activities of nr gs and gdh although there was a risk of n losses through runoff under the high dose of n treatment n250 and n300 but it greatly increased the transfer of n from vegetative samples to grains under the supplementary irrigation as evident by low soil tn and no3 n content under supplementary irrigation than that of rainfed condition at some point the grain yield nue iwue and economic benefit was reduced under the n300 than n250 treatments therefore keeping in mind the goal of optimization of n rates and maximum utilization of soil available n and high grain yield a fertilization at the rate 250 kg n ha 1 is recommended to obtain high maize grain yield with maximum grain n accumulation and economic benefit this study is of pivotal importance for n fertilization management in the undeveloped irrigation system of maize crop in humid maize cultivated area of guangxi province declaration of

9172,inappropriate management of irrigation and nitrogen n fertilization can lead to underground water pollution and soil degradation as well as increase the cost of crop production particularly in humid areas of china in this context the present experiment was designed to determine the appropriate irrigation amount and n fertilization rate for higher crop production enzymatic activities and n content a two years field experiment was conducted during 2020 2021 to assess the effects of two irrigation condition rainfed and supplementary irrigation and five n fertilization rates i e 0 150 200 250 and 300 kg ha 1 thereafter referred as n0 n150 n200 n250 and n300 on aboveground dry biomass soil maize n accumulation n metabolisms related enzymes grain yield and economic efficiency supplementary irrigation n fertilization and their interaction significantly affected the above measured parameters for instance n250 treatment with supplementary irrigation significantly increased grain n content aboveground dry biomass and n metabolisms enzymes nitrate reductase glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase compared to n250 treatment n300 resulted 0 4 lower grain yield under supplementary irrigation similarly the interaction of supplementary irrigation and n250 treatment enhanced the soil total n and nitrate n content compared to other treatments supplementary irrigation significantly increased grain yield by 13 6 compared to rainfed condition more importantly both n use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency and the cost benefit ratio were reduced when n fertilization rate exceed to n300 treatment of the supplemented irrigation plot compared to other n fertilization rates the n250 treatment resulted in a maximum net benefit of 10 082 cny ha 1 under supplementary irrigation condition therefore we suggest that 250 kg n ha 1 with supplementary irrigation is the best choice to improve n use efficiency grain yield and provide a maximum economic benefit of maize crop these finding may facilitate the scientific basis for irrigation and n fertilization management of maize crop in humid areas of china keywords drip irrigation n metabolism grain n content zea mays data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global demand for agricultural crops is increasing and may continue to do so for decades propelled by a 2 3 billion person increase in global population and greater per capita incomes anticipated through mid century tilman et al 2011 in addition water demand for agriculture could double by 2050 whereas the availability of fresh water is predicted to drop by 50 owing to climate change gleick 2000 the impact of climate change is large such as unpredictable rain reduction of water resources and deterioration of water quality together cause decline of agricultural production ultimately threaten food security srivastav et al 2021 china water resources are decreasing from southeast to northwest in spatial distribution and in more recent the rainfall in the area is significantly uneven due to global climate change however the agricultural production potential of southwest china guangxi province is generally increased due to the extensively raining in the current climate change scenario it greatly reduced the consumption of water resources for irrigation purposes which contributes to the sustainable development of regional water resources and ecology cao et al 2021 peng et al 2019 although the rainfall is abundant the temporal and spatial distribution is uneven and the phased drought affects the maize production in this region wang et al 2021 n is one of the most important plant nutrients and plays a crucial role in multiple plant developmental processes it is an important essential element of plant organic compounds accounting for the vast majority of dry matter accumulation cohen et al 2019 cui et al 2019 n metabolism is a crucial fundamental metabolic process of maize and its accumulation during post anthesis stage has a greater impact on crop yield wu et al 2018 crop production is heavily dependent on the supply of exogenous n fertilization in most agricultural areas xing et al 2019 zhen et al 2006 mentioned that intensive use of chemical fertilization has remarkably increased upto three fold the average grain yield of wheat and maize from 1967 to 2000 in china while the average rate of n fertilizer application enhanced five fold during the same period 1967 143 kg ha 1 2000 670 kg ha 1 suggesting that high n fertilizer use increased the crop production but its overuse however leads to decreased n fertilization use efficiency increases nitrate leaching into groundwater and nitrate enrichment of vegetables and is therefore considered an unsustainable method quan et al 2021 in addition the extensive rate of n fertilization produces surplus nutrients flowing from the land to the sea which seriously affects the coastal ecosystem liu et al 2019 reducing the large dependency on overuse of n fertilization for high crop yield can reduce its impact on water acidification and global warming abbas et al 2021 therefore to reduce inputs for maize production it is essential to optimize the rate of n fertilization for different irrigation systems maize is the second largest food crop in guangxi province of china and the sown area of maize in guangxi province accounts for 18 4 20 4 of the total cultivated area seasonal drought often affects corn planting in guangxi province among which spring drought decline the seed germination and affects corn emergence rate n fertilization rate in this province is high but the utilization rate of n fertilization is low which not only leads to low grain yield but also affects the sustainable development of arable land the inappropriate over usage of water and n have no significant positive effect on grain yield increase but it results in high costs and decrease in net income wang et al 2014 previously most of the researchers have focused on the optimization of irrigation and n fertilization rate for different crop species in arid areas while the importance of irrigation in humid areas of china is often neglected due to abundant annual rainfall in addition most previous studies have focused mainly on the effects of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization on soil n residues and or single aspects of crop n fertilization with little attention paid to the role of both on soil plant interactions for n utilization and economic benefits therefore we studied the effects of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization rates on n metabolism related enzymes and soil n pool specifically we aimed to study the response of irrigation and n management to determine how supplementary irrigation and n fertilization affects n use efficiency at the soil plant level grain yield and economic efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description experimental design and field management a field experiment was conducted at the maize research field of guangxi university 22 50 n 108 17 e nanning china during 2020 2021 this site has a subtropical monsoon climate with

experiments duration was comprised of from march 9th to july 9th during 2020 and from march 4th to july 5th during 2021 which was consistent with the local spring maize growth cycle the experiment was arranged in a split plot design applying two factors with ten treatments and three replications the size of each plot was 4 2 m long and 3 9 m wide the treatments were consisted of two irrigation treatments rainfall and supplementary irrigation considered as a main plot and five n fertilization rates i e 0 150 200 250 and 300 kg n ha 1 thereafter designated as n0 n150 n200 n250 and n300 respectively are considered as a sub plot in the rainfed condition all water required during the whole growth stage came from natural rainfall while in supplementary irrigation condition drip irrigation was employed when soil moisture content was became lower than 60 of maximum field moisture holding capacity prior to that the basic macro nutrient fertilization was supplied uniformly such as calcium magnesium phosphorus p2o5 18 0 100 kg ha 1 and potassium chloride k2o 60 0 100 kg ha 1 and urea n 46 0 supplied according to the treatments the p and k fertilization were supplied to each

strips were laid between the rows in supplementary irrigated plot at the third leaf stage of maize crop the amount of water of supplementary irrigation plot was measured by using a water meter the data wise data and total amount of irrigation water applied to supplementary irrigation plot are shown in fig 1 c d and f similarly soil water content at the depth of 0 20 cm of each treatment plots during both growing seasons were measured fig 2 by using tdr 100 spectrum technologies inc aurora il usa seed from maize zea mays cv wanchuan 1306 were surface sterilized and uniform healthy seeds were directly sown in soil at the density of 55 556 seeds ha 1 with plant to plant and row to row distance were kept 0 3 m and 0 6 m respectively all the remaining standard farming practices including herbicide and insecticides were performed in all treatments during the entire experimental seasons 2 2 soil and plant samples collection and measurement soil samples were obtained by core soil sampler at the depth of 0 20 cm in 3 replicates for each treatment immediately after the plants were harvested using 5 point method the soil samples of each plot were sieved 2 mm and mixed to make a composite sample later each sample was divided into two parts one used for the determination of total soil n kept for natural drying and the other half was stored at 4 c in a refrigerator for the nitrate n no3 n content determination three uniform plants were collected from each treatment at flowering stage r1 and maturity stage r6 after dividing the plant into stem leaf bract cob and grains dried at 105 c for 1 h to inactivate the enzyme and then it was dried at 75 c to a constant weight after being crushed it was screened through 100 mesh for reserve meanwhile three uniform plants were selected from each treatment and the veins were removed from the ear leaves leaving the middle of the ear leaf wrapped in tin foil and marked then quickly placed in liquid n and stored at 80 c in an ultra low temperature refrigerator for measurement of n metabolism enzymes 2 3 determination of soil nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen tn fresh soil 5 00 g was processed with 25 ml of 1 mol l 1 kcl solution

the tn accumulation in maize samples stem leaves bract cob and grain were analyzed at flowering stage r1 and maturity stage r6 during the 2020 and 2021 fig 3 the results showed that tn accumulation increases from r1 to r6 reproductive growth stage and the highest n accumulation was observed in grains during r6 compared with rainfed condition the supplementary irrigation significantly increased tn accumulation in stems leaves and bract cob by 37 6 10 8 37 9 35 1 and 19 1 18 5 at r1 growth stage and stems leaves bract cob and grain tn accumulation by 23 4 28 0 33 9 17 6 33 9 20 5 and 12 2 11 6 at r6 growth stage during 2020 2021 respectively also n accumulation in all samples was increased with increasing n fertilization at r1 growth stage during both growing seasons however altered results were obtained for tn accumulation at r6 growth stage where no significant differences p 0 05 in grain tn accumulation were observed in n250 and n300 treatments during 2020 the aboveground dry biomass was measured only at maturity during both growing seasons 2020 2021 the results showed that n250 and n300 treatments both under supplementary irrigation and rainfed had significantly higher aboveground dry biomass than other treatments during both growing season fig 4 the aboveground dry biomass was higher by the interaction of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization rate n250 and n300 than rainfed condition of same n fertilization treatment in both growing seasons for instance the aboveground biomass of rainfed and supplementary irrigation were 17 334 and 18 998 kg ha 1 during 2020 under n300 treatment and 18 697 and 20 579 kg ha 1 during 2021 under n250 treatments respectively these increases were 106 4 and 109 8 during 2020 and 157 7 and 158 8 during 2021 under n250 and n300 treatments respectively when compared to n0 however its worthy to note that there was no significant difference in average aboveground dry biomass under n250 and n300 during both growing seasons these results suggest that supplementary irrigation and n fertilization have a positive effect on aboveground dry biomass 3 2 changes in nitrogen metabolism related enzymes activities in response to supplementary irrigation and n fertilization rates the changes of ear leaf n metabolisms enzyme activities at r1 and r6 growth stages were shown in fig 5 in 2020 the activities of nr gs and gdh were reduced under rainfed regime than supplementary irrigation condition the addition of n fertilization dose dependently increased the nr gs and gdh activities under both water conditions compared to supplementary irrigation condition at r1 growth stage the nr gs and gdh activities in ear leaf samples were reduced by 19 5 31 5 and 22 4 respectively under rainfall condition when compared to n0 at r1 growth stage the n fertilization dose dependently increased the nr activity 64 1 100 3 138 0 and 159 3 gs activity 70 3 171 4 259 9 and 290 5 and gdh activity 61 6 110 9 161 6 and 181 1 under n150 n200 n250 and n300 treatments respectively the n fertilization dose wise significantly enhanced the activities of these enzymes except nr activity under rainfed condition and gs gdh activities under supplementary irrigation condition in n250 and n300 treatments at r1 growth stage during 2020 when compared r6 to r1 growth stage the activities of nr gs and gdh were reduced under all treatment s combination condition and the changes in nr gs and gdh activities during 2021 were followed the same trend as in 2020 in addition compared to 2020 the nr gs and gdh activities in 2021 were increased by 17 6 18 5 and 13 6 respectively 3 3 effect of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization rates on soil tn soil tn content under varying n fertilization rates and irrigation were significantly affected during both years fig 6 soil tn content increased with increasing n fertilization rates the highest soil tn content was observed in n300 treatment 1 81 g kg 1 during 2020 and 1 84 g kg 1 in 2021 however there was no statistical differences p 0 05 between n250 and n300 in tn content during both growing seasons in contrast to 2020 the soil tn content of n0 and n150 in 2021 showed a decreasing trend while n200 n250 and n300 show the opposite trend which indicated that the n fertilization rates of 200 300 kg ha 1 were more conducive to maintaining soil n balance the total n content of supplementary irrigation decreased in both growing seasons but had no significant difference p 0 05 3 4 changes in soil no3 n under irrigation water and n fertilization rates the soil no3 n content under varying n fertilization rates and irrigation condition has significantly affected during both study year fig 7 for example the no3 n content was ranged from 7 53 to 19 33 kg ha 1 in the first year 2020 and was ranged 7 73 18 89 kg ha 1 in the second study year 2021 compared with rainfed condition the soil no3 n content was significantly decreased in supplementary irrigation by 10 4 furthermore showed an increasing trend when the n fertilization rate increases under both irrigation conditions the highest soil no3 n content was observed under n300 treatment across the irrigation treatments and growing season however there were no statistical differences in soil no3 n content in n250 and n300 treatments except under supplementary irrigation during 2020 for instance compared with n0 n150 and n200 the no3 n content increased by 126 0 49 7 and 27 2 in n300 the general response trend of soil no3 n content to n fertilization rates and supplementary irrigation during 2021 was similar as in 2020 study year though the result showed 5 4 lower no3 n content during 2021 than 2020 growing season 3 5 nitrogen use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency grain yield and economic benefits result showed that n fertilization and supplementary irrigation effectively regulated the accumulation and distribution of n resulting significantly effect on the n and irrigation water use efficiency table 1 and table 2 showed that during both study years 2020 2021 the interactive effect of n fertilization and supplementary irrigation significantly improved the grain yield except under n300 treatment with supplementary irrigation under rainfed condition the grain yield net income and nc increased with increasing n fertilization with maximum grain yield 6967 and 7167 kg ha 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively net income and nc were obtained under n300 treatment whereas under the supplementary irrigation condition the maximum grain yield 7700 and 7783 kg ha 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively net income and nc were found under n250 treatment when the n fertilization rate exceeds 250 kg ha 1 the net income and nc were decreased during both study years under supplementary irrigation for instance the net income during 2020 growing season was 10044 cny ha 1 and during 2021 it was 10119 cny ha 1 under the interactive treatment of supplementary irrigation and n250 treatment in addition the result showed that supplementary irrigation promoted the nue in both growing seasons it suggested that nue increased with appropriate n fertilization while high rate of n fertilization may result in low nue due to growth redundancy similarly iwue increased with an increase n rate reached maximum at n250 treatment and remains the same at n300 treatment under irrigated condition only this showed that proper n fertilization not only improved n utilization but also promoted irrigation water efficiency which also indicated that exogenous n needs water to be absorbed and utilized by the plants 4 discussion 4 1 impact of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization rates on plant nitrogen metabolism n is an important nutrient for plant growth and a major component of amino acids proteins and endogenous hormones in the plant wen et al 2020 as well as an important fundamental part of grain formation zhang et al 2022 water scarcity leads to low n accumulation and shorten the crop growth cycle resulting in reduce biomass and crop growth coelho et al 2020 xia et al 2021 found that the effects of water and n fertilization were different on tn accumulation among plant samples and growth stages for example in peanut n accumulation amount was high in leaf tissue at vegetative stage and was high in pod at reproductive stage our results showed high n accumulation at r1 growth stage by leaf stem bract cob whereas at r6 growth stage grain accounted for the highest proportion of n accumulation under the combined treatment of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization rate surprisingly there was no significant difference in grain tn accumulation in between n250 and n300 probably due to the fact that the high vegetative growth upon n300 treatment affected the reproductive growth in the later stage causing pool limitation and which also affected the redistribution of n to the grain previous study found that high n fertilization reduced the yield of cotton in high fertile soil and suggested that high n rate will only be applied into the low fertile soil in order to increase the yield galdi et al 2022 the crop yield is based on dry matter accumulation soil moisture and nutrient status are the two important factors affecting the dry matter weight accumulation of crops wang et al 2019 amanullah et al 2021 furthermore increasing the amount of n fertilization to a certain range can facilitates dry matter transport to the grains and this might happen due to the fertilization of high n rates after flowering stage yu et al 2021 in this study n fertilization dose dependently along with supplementary irrigation significantly p 0 05 promoted the aboveground dry biomass accumulation of different samples of maize crop with highest accumulation observed under n300 followed by n250 treatment n metabolism is largely involved in routine functional cellular activities and is considered the fundamental components of many processes required for plant growth and development erdal 2019 the n assimilation levels of crop plants are reflected by the activities of key enzymes i e nr gdh gs among others involved in n metabolism pathway ji et al 2020 previous literature demonstrated that n fertilization increased the relative expression and activity of nr and gdh in citrus trees leaves xiong et al 2021 and in wheat leaves ma et al 2019 our results showed that both n fertilization supplementary irrigation and their interaction increased nr gs and gdh activities in leaves at r1 and r6 growth stages the increased in these activities were positively correlated to high n fertilization rates nr and gs play a pivotal role in n metabolism and nr acting as a substrate inducing enzyme triggered by high nitrate content ahmad et al 2022a high root zone nitrate content increased the activity of nr which act as a catalyze to reduced it nitrite in cytosol lee and titus 1992 research showed enhanced activities of nr and gs eliminate the drought stress in maize crop under n and kno3 treatment ahmad et al 2022a b this study suggests that high n treatments n250 and n300 kept the canopy leaves alive at r6 growth stage resulting in assimilation and redistribution of leaf n to the grain ultimately increased the grain n accumulation and dry matter weight antonietta et al 2021 4 2 impact of supplementary irrigation and n fertilization on soil n pool n is a component of many organic molecules and plants are heavily depending on available n stock in root zone in warm and humid regions despite relatively high soil n stocks soil n supply for crop production is very low also due to the uptake of plant the soil n stock might deplete which can be compensated by fertilization of n nendel et al 2019 losacco et al 2021 soil tn which is the sum of inorganic and organic n is one of the main factors impacting the soil fertility it is obvious that n fertilization increases the mineral n concentration in the 0 20 cm soil layer he et al 2021 the high n fertilization increased the no3 n content and storage in the 0 60 cm soil layer and if this content level increases than 94 3 100 0 kg ha 1 then the risk of nitrate leaching in red soil increases exponentially n runoff loss which has counted about 88 3 90 7 of dissolved inorganic n from the surface was mainly due to high fertilization and soil inorganic n content li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 this runoff loss can be control by appropriate water and fertilization management practices by improving soil chemistry and regulate microbial community structure qi et al 2020 ye et al 2021 the results of this study showed that both soil tn and no3 n contents increased and positively correlated with high n fertilization compared with low n treatment probably because the fertilization of low n rates was not sufficient to meet the n requirement of plant growth which in turn depleted the original stock of soil n hence leading to a decrease in soil n content soil tn and no3 n contents were lower in supplementary irrigation than in rainfed condition probably because supplementary irrigation promoted n uptake by crop metabolism 4 3 impact of supplementary irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on economic benefits and n irrigation water use efficiency the appropriate management of water n use efficiencies are the determinant of plant growth and development resulting in high yield yue et al 2021 which are greatly interconnect the choice of proper irrigation system such as drip irrigation is beneficial to improves crop yield reduces the water loss and increases the n use efficiency the study of lu et al 2021 showed that drip irrigation along with n fertilization rate had significant effects on grain yield water productivity and n fertilization efficiency in summer maize in line with that our study found that optimal fertilization of n n250 increased the net grain yield under supplementary irrigation while the high dose of n n300 treatment didn t further increase the net grain yield suggesting that excessive n inputs did not result in significant grain yield increase rather than increase the n fertilization expenditure in contrast under rainfed condition there was positive effect of all n fertilization rates on net grain yield of maize crop table 1 and table 2 li et al 2017 demonstrated that appropriate amount of n fertilization during sowing stage followed by flowering stage for cotton production in the yellow river basin can result in high ecological and economic benefits supplementary irrigation is one of the effective water management practices to improve crop yield and water n use efficiency brar and vashist 2020 liu et al 2022 in this study we found that n250 fertilization treatment significantly increased the uptake and utilization of n under supplementary irrigation than rainfed condition this could be due to supplementary irrigation promoted transport of n in soil which increase n availability to plant and eventually result in increased nue increased however the excessive fertilization of n treatment n300 produced vigorous maize growth and prolonged the vegetative growth duration which had disturbed the reproductive growth duration grain filling time had shortened and irrigation water use efficiency had not increased n use affects n recovery efficiency and n recovery efficiency has a greater effect on increasing grain yield than n use efficiency therefore appropriate water to n ratio can obtain maximum nue and wue hammad et al 2017 kassie and fanataye 2019 furthermore between study years iwue in 2021 was less when compared to 2020 could be related to the increase of total applied water amount for less rainfall amount in march april during 2021 supplementary irrigation can significantly improve water use efficiency and suitable water and n inputs can bring high economic benefits to farmers yuan et al 2022 in this study we found that n250 combined with supplementary irrigation had the maximum nue iwue and net benefits 5 conclusions from the above results we concluded that supplementary irrigation combined with n250 and n300 treatments increased tn accumulation aboveground dry biomass of maize and increased the activities of nr gs and gdh although there was a risk of n losses through runoff under the high dose of n treatment n250 and n300 but it greatly increased the transfer of n from vegetative samples to grains under the supplementary irrigation as evident by low soil tn and no3 n content under supplementary irrigation than that of rainfed condition at some point the grain yield nue iwue and economic benefit was reduced under the n300 than n250 treatments therefore keeping in mind the goal of optimization of n rates and maximum utilization of soil available n and high grain yield a fertilization at the rate 250 kg n ha 1 is recommended to obtain high maize grain yield with maximum grain n accumulation and economic benefit this study is of pivotal importance for n fertilization management in the undeveloped irrigation system of maize crop in humid maize cultivated area of guangxi province declaration of

9173,biochar application to soils has been proven to be an efficient way for yield enhancement in agricultural systems however what is the most economical biochar application rate bcar for cotton in saline alkali soils in arid and semi arid zones remains unclear to narrow the gap this study aims to investigate how biochar application affected the nutrient content growth yield quality and productivity of cotton and to find the rational bcar the three year field experiments of biochar application combined with plastic film mulched drip irrigation were conducted for cotton in xinjiang china the biochar was continuously applied to the farmland at 0 in 2018 0 in 2019 0 in 2020 10 10 10 nt no test 25 25 50 50 30 and 100 100 nt t ha 1 during cotton growth period of 2018 2020 the cotton growth yield and quality indicators were observed and used for computing water fertilizer productivity the cost benefit analysis was referred to recommend a rational bcar all four biochar application treatments increased the leaf stem root nutrient n p and k content than control during different cotton growth stages the daily relative content of chlorophyll increased with the increasing bcar and were larger at biochar treatments of 50 and 100 t ha 1 than 0 10 and 25 t ha 1 the growth and yield related indicators plant height stem diameter leaf area index and seed yield irrigation water productivity and partial fertilizer n p and k productivity consistently increased than control under biochar application conditions and the bcar of 10 t ha 1 showed the greatest advantages in enhancing germination rates cotton yields water fertilizer productivities and financial income than biochar treatments of 0 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 however neither cotton fiber quality indices length micronaire strength or uniformity index were significantly affected by biochar applications based on the economic analysis the rational bcar was 10 t ha 1 each year continued for three years for

application cotton growth and yield economic benefit plastic film mulched trickle irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cotton gossypium hirsutum l is an essential economic commodity for millions of smallholder farmers in china wang et al 2022a b however soil salinization and water resource shortage are the main factors restricting cotton production and sustainable agricultural development in arid and semi arid regions the combined interactions of low precipitation shallow groundwater level and intense evaporation induce more severe soil salinity the low quality of the saline alkali soils leads to reduced soil water nutrient retention capacity and crop productivity and threatens the sustainable development of agriculture meena et al 2019 therefore many studies have explored the benefits of biochar applications for cotton nutrient content growth yields productivity and economic benefits biochar is produced by the thermal cracking of bio organic materials such as straw under hypoxia or anaerobic conditions at 300 1000 cheng et al 2008 liang 2021 biochar is an economical and efficient soil conditioner to improve the soil environment and enhance crop yields akhtar et al 2014 especially for low quality soils biochar addition to lands has comprehensive positive influences on agricultural systems first biochar improves soil physical properties including enhance water holding capacity streubel et al 2011 decrease bulk density increase soil porosity in the no mulching zones liang et al 2021 it also increases saturated soil water content field capacity and planar soil water storage and improve water retention and crop growth devereux et al 2012 second biochar also enhances soil chemical properties and increase nutrient content biochar increases soil organic carbon xiao et al 2016 enhances nutrient components such as soil mineral n content ammonium nitrate and total nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon nelissen et al 2015 sun et al 2019 karthik et al 2019 found that biochar application rate bcar at 4 0 t ha 1 significantly improved soil physical chemical properties of a cotton field third biochar addition reduced the differences between day and night soil temperatures by 0 66 1 39 c liu et al 2018 and mitigated some of the pulse effects of rainfall on emissions maucieri et al 2017 forth the addition of biochar elevated soil quality and promoted root growth and crop production significantly zhang et al 2020 and the grand mean increase was 10 jeffery et al 2011 finally biochar lowers water demand substantially and provides a novel solution for agricultural sustainability in salt affected regions lee et al 2022 overall biochar addition is an efficient technique for promoting agricultural productivity and profit previous research has assessed biochar application influences on soil environment and crop productivity in order to find the most suitable application rate or threshold for example for rice and durum wheat yields the best application was 10 t ha 1 zhang et al 2012 for a winter wheat plus summer maize rotation it was 16 t ha 1 zhang et al 2017 for wheat higher 50 75 and 100 bcars were good and the maximal 1000 grain weight was obtained under no farm manure and biochar 100 applications qayyum et al 2017 the growth physiology and yield of wheat were affected positively by biochar amendment akhtar et al 2015 particularly under high salinity level for maize the biochar treatment of 5 w w among 1 2 and 5 w w kim et al 2016 or 30 t ha 1 jia et al 2020 resulted in the highest yields pandit et al 2018 recommended 15 t ha 1 for a maize mustard field cropping system conversely researches showed no significant or decreasing effect of biochar application on crop yield bohara et al 2018 lai et al 2013 specifically the optimal rate of 4 t ha 1 among 0 2 4 8 t ha 1 biochar amendment effectively promoted cotton performance singh et al 2021 the determination of rational biochar application parameters is not only important but also necessary for field practices and cost income planning this is due to more biochar application costed higher investment kammann et al 2011 although the most appropriate bcar may induce the highest yields water and fertilizer utilization efficiency and economic benefits it is difficult to determine the best dose because it is affected not only by biochar production sources and soil properties the irrigation and fertilization schedules but also by crop types and varieties not to say most of the experiments are site and time specific compared with the world s major cotton producing countries cotton yields in xinjiang china was 25 and 96 higher than those of brazil and the united states respectively during the past several years feng et al 2017 however extensive salinized land and deserts occupied 31 1 and 22 5 of the arable land of xinjiang respectively liang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the limited land area results in cotton production facing competitive challenges to maintain high quality and productivity and sustainable development in addition the long term mean annual precipitation of xinjiang is below 200 mm and water saving irrigation is necessarily extended especially the plastic film mulched drip irrigation li et al 2021a 2021b 2017 we assume that there were advantages of biochar application in improving soil environment and crop production on saline alkali soils in xinjiang and the investigation of biochar effects on cotton growth yields productivity and benefits are necessary and important considering the inconsistent results from previous studies here we further assume that the most appropriate bcar is within ranges of 0 20 t ha 1 for applying to cotton in arid zones of xinjiang so far few researches have investigated biochar application effects on cotton growth and yields because the relative concentrated distribution of world s cotton planting countries are mainly india the united states of america and china our main goal was to determine which biochar rates resulted in both increased yield and increased economic value to the farmer with this in mind the specific objectives of this research were to 1 test four biochar rates over three years for impacts on in season growth health and final crop yield compared to a fertilized control with no biochar added 2 determine whether crop quality was impacted by biochar application rate and 3 determine the most economical biochar application rate bcar for cotton by conducting an economic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study

treatments were named as b0 b10 b50 and b100 in turn from the test results of 2018 between bcars of 10 and 50 t ha 1 there were a change point of bcar which altered soil physical chemical thermal properties and crop growth features before and after liang et al 2021 between b10 and b50 there are peak values of soil properties or crop growth and yields in 2018 therefore in 2019 bcar of 25 t ha 1 named as b25 treatment was added to find the turning points more accurately the b100 was found to be neither economic nor have typical improvement effects on the soil plant system thus in 2020 treatments b0 b10 b25 and b30 were designed while b100 was not tested table 1 in this year the biochar of 30 t ha 1 was applied to the former two b50 plots each treatment was replicated three times 2

between different treatments by the least significant differences lsd at the p 0 05 level microsoft office excel 2016 and sigmaplot 12 0 were used to draw figures 3 results 3 1 nutrient content and growth indices of cotton affected by biochar 3 1 1 nutrient content of cotton leaf stem and root affected by biochar based on the measurements the nutrient n p and k content of cotton leaf stem and root during anthesis boll development and boll open stages were compared for 2018 and 2019 fig 3 the results showed that leaf n content was larger both at the anthesis and boll open stages than at the bolling stage in 2018 and 2019 root n content were larger at the boll open stage in both years additionally at the boll open stage bcar of 10 t ha 1 achieved the largest root n content in 2018 while in 2019 it was 50 t ha 1 stem n content was smaller at the anthesis stage both for 2018 and 2019 differed for the bolling stage in the two years and occupied around 1 3 of the total n content of cotton total n content of cotton achieved the highest values for bolling and boll open stages at bcar of 10 t ha 1 in 2018 and 50 t ha 1 in 2019 respectively figs 3a and 4f and table s2 p content of leaf stem and root were much smaller than n content at most of the growth stages leaf stem and root p content accounted each 1 3 of the total respectively biochar application changed p content compared to no biochar treatment total p content of cotton achieved the highest values for the anthesis and boll open stages at changing bcars of 10 50 or 100 t ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 3aa ff and table s3 the ranges of leaf stem and root k content were close to those of n content under different conditions bcar of 50 and 10 t ha 1 contributed to the largest k content in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 3aa ff and table s4 overall biochar application increased n p and k contents for cotton growth both in 2018 and 2019 compared to no biochar condition the range of increased percentage of n p and k were n 38 2 in b100 treatment 2019 stem to 219 4 in b10 treatment 2019 taproot table s2 p 37 0 in b100 treatment 2019 stem to 179 2 in b10 treatment 2019 taproot table s3 and k 28 2 in b100 treatment 2019 stem to 154 3 in b10 treatment 2019 taproot respectively table s4 compared to no biochar treatment the content of n p k reached the highest increase at the bcar of 10 t ha 1 too high bcar of biochar 50 t ha 1 was not beneficial to cotton growth 3 1 2 germination and chlorophyll of cotton affected by biochar the main growth stages of cotton are sowing april 10 11 and 15 in 2018 2019 and 2020 seedling june 14 15 and 14 in 2018 2019 and 2020 bud june 25 26 and 28 in 2018 2019 and 2020 anthesis july 7 10 and 13 in 2018 2019 and 2020 bolling august 3 11 and 11 in 2018 2019 and 2020 and boll open august 27 30 and september 3 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the germination rates of cotton with the variate biochar application rate are compared in fig 4 in 2018 2019 and 2020 cotton germination rate ranged between 0 53 and 0 73 0 73 0 93 and 0 88 0 95 respectively the largest values occurred at the bcar of 10 t ha 1 and there were significant differences between the four treatments the ranges of germination rates increased in the 2nd and 3rd years showing positive influence of continuous biochar application however bcar greater than 25 t ha 1 were not appropriate in improving germination rates of cotton the temporal variations and fluctuations of relative content of chlorophyll during cotton growth stages of 2018 and 2019 fig 5 showed the generally higher values of b100 and b50 than b25 b10 and b0 treatments overall chlorophyll fluctuation patterns were similar for inside and outside rows in both 2018 and 2019 the relative content of chlorophyll at inside and outside rows increased first and then decreased to the lowest values before the 90 th days after sowing das and then increased until harvest biochar application increased relative content of chlorophyll during cotton growth stages both in 2018 and 2019 compared to b0 treatment the observed values of relative content of chlorophyll in inside and outside rows of cotton are plotted in fig 6 the values of relative content of chlorophyll in inside rows of cotton were smaller than outside rows of cotton for b0 b10 and b50 treatments but were a little larger than values of outside rows for b100 treatment there were very good linear correlations between the two and the coefficient of determination values varied from 0 691 to 0 849 the linear slopes were smallest for treatment b10 and largest for b100 both in 2018 and 2019 the continuous biochar application slightly changed the relationship between inside and outside rows of cotton chlorophyll 3 1 3 growth indices of cotton affected by biochar the temporal variations of cotton plant height stem diameter and lai during cotton growth stages of 2018 2019 and 2020 fig 7 indicated that 1 the plant height stem diameter and lai increased with the growth stages before the 105th das for all the treatments and years the plant height and stem diameter stopped increasing and the lai decreased after the 105th das since the plants were pinched with tip pruning 2 the differences of cotton growth indicators were smaller in 2018 but larger in the second planting year 2019 and small in 2020 these differences showed an improvement effects of 3 year continuous application of biochar on cotton growth 3 continuous biochar application with bcars of 10 25 and 50 t ha 1 improved cotton growth especially at bcar of 10 t ha 1 however continuous biochar application of 100 100 t ha 1 or 50 50 30 t ha 1 continuously decreased cotton growth we implied that the improper application of 2 year 100 100 t ha 1 or 3 year 50 50 30 t ha 1 were not proper application patterns for cotton planting however 2 year 50 50 t ha 1 application did not decrease cotton growth either 4 overall there was generally a decreasing ranking of continuous application rate for improving cotton growth namely 10 10 10 t ha 1 nt 25 25 t ha 1 50 50 30 t ha 1 0 0 0 ha 1 and 100 100 nt t ha 1 in turn 3 2 yield related indices of cotton affected by biochar 3 2 1 yield compositions of cotton the measured cotton boll density single boll weight branch number per plant lint percentage and lint yield along with the statistical differences p 0 05 were compared for different biochar application treatments in the three years table 3 for boll density branch number and lint yield the bcar of 10 t ha 1 b10 had the peak values of cotton yield compositions in 2018 2020 with significant differences when compared to the other biochar treatments and resulted in the most significant improvement of cotton yield while for single boll weight and lint percentage there were not always significant differences among different biochar treatments additionally the bcar of 25 t ha 1 b25 showed potential in improving boll density branch number and lint yield with significant differences when compared to the other biochar treatments under most conditions bcar of 100 t ha 1 significantly decreased boll density branch number per plant and lint yield of cotton based on these results we consider bcar of 100 t ha 1was too high for cotton growth and yields 3 2 2 quality of cotton the observed quality indices of cotton in 2018 2019 and 2020 table 4 showed that biochar application had little effects on changing cotton fiber quality bcar of 10 t ha 1 b10 increased fiber length and uniformity index but didn t improve micronaire and strength there were no significant differences among the four cotton quality indices at different bcars which were consistent in the all 3 years 3 3 efficiency and productivity of cotton affected by biochar the computed yields irrigation water productivity iwp and partial fertilizer productivity pfp of cotton in 2018 2019 and 2020 are presented in table 5 significant differences were observed among different treatments although there were differences between the three years the yields iwp and pfp for n p and k for b10 treatment consistently had peak values in 2018 2019 and 2020 except b10 treatments b25 and b50 also improved the iwp and pfp of cotton when compared to b0 however the improved effects were generally smaller than b10 the productivity decreasing effects of b100 on iwp and pfp in 2018 and 2019 were consistently shown for cotton in 2020 b30 decreased the iwp and pfp of cotton 3 4 economic benefit of biochar application on cotton the income cost and economic benefit of biochar application on cotton are presented in table 6 for different treatments and planting years notice that not all treatments were applied in 2018 2020 only b0 and b10 were continuously conducted the treatments b0 b10 and b25 had significant higher economic benefits than treatments b25 b50 and b100 of which treatment b10 had the highest economic benefit in 2019 and 2020 bcars of 50 50 30 and 100 100 t ha 1 had negative economic benefits generally there were negative low economic benefits for biochar application treatments of b25 b50 b30 and b100 also there was great economic benefit of no biochar application on cotton and this was attributed to the high economic benefit of cotton itself overall considering the comprehensive responses of nutrient content the relative content of chlorophyll the growth and yield related indicators and the economic benefit of cotton the recommended most appropriate bcar for cotton was 10 t ha 1 per year if continuously applied for 3 years 4 discussions 4 1 influences of biochar application on soil properties the crop yield enhancement by biochar application was activated by the gradually improved soil environments over time biochar application improved soil physical and hydraulic characteristics significantly for example biochar decreased soil bulk density and increase soil macroporosity 50 µm by creating new accommodation pores andrenelli et al 2016 the oxidized biochar can retain more water in sandy soils enhance water holding capacities and increase soil water retention suliman et al 2017 biochar can signiﬁcantly enhance soil ph nutrient contents soil microbial biomass carbon organic carbon nitrogen base cations and enzymatic activities arif et al 2016 jin et al 2019 the alkaline biochar applied at recommended rate e g 10 t ha 1 from sandhu et al 2017 can increase cold water extractable carbon fraction of acidic sandy loam soil additionally our observation in fig 8 for 2019 showed the comprehensive effects of biochar on decreasing soil bulk density especially at the top layers 0 30 cm 1 on improving soil moisture of no mulch and narrow row zones when the biochar application rate was less than 25 t ha 1 2 on decreasing soil salt content at biochar application rate of 10 t ha 1 and 3 on increasing nitrate and organic carbon content when biochar application rate was increasing the overall improvement of soil environment by biochar application provided good water and nutrient environment for crop growth these improvements stabilize the increase of cotton production and improves feasibility in arid and semi arid zones therefore there is strong support for biochar s potential in agriculture we confidently think that biochar application improves soil environment if properly added to soils however there is a significant lack of investigation on biochar application effects on cotton production especially how to determine a rational biochar application rate 4 2 the roles of soil additive or conditioner in saline alkali soils soil conditioner additive played important roles in modifying saline alkali soils in general it changes quality of saline alkali soils by regulating soil ph value reducing soil salt content improving soil structure rising water retention capacity adjusting microbial environment or promoting seed germination and growth for example biochar haider et al 2022 biomass pyrolysis fluid wang et al 2022a b humic acid and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose shan et al 2022 gypsum like ca2 solid agents organic inorganic acids wang et al 2010 and many other types of soil conditioner have been some additives applied to lands in recent years as a water soluble polyelectrolyte hydrolytic polymaleic anhydride reduced the soil ph and ec in saline alkali wang et al 2010 dephenolization pyrolysis fluid is another kind of soil conditioner which reduced total soil salt content effectively wang et al 2022a b as mentioned above biochar was shown to have potentials in changing soil environment and plant yields it could reduce soil bulk density by 9 and increase saturated hydraulic conductivity by 88 from 6 1 to 11 4 cm h 1 oguntunde et al 2008 agegnehu et al 2017 biochar increased soil ph values from 7 1 to 8 1 at 39 t ha 1 granatstein et al 2009 or from 6 0 up to 9 6 steiner et al 2008 from experiment of lashari et al 2013 application of biochar together with poultry manure compost to saline soil significantly decreased salinity by 3 6 g kg 1 and increased soil ph organic c available p bulk density by 0 3 2 6 g kg 1 27 mg kg 1 and 0 1 g cm 3 respectively the added biochar have altered the microbial activity and abundance of denitrifying genes in soils which regulated the emission of n2o shaaban et al 2018 in addition different types of biochar have shown great potential in increasing biomass yield of rice by 14 in china to 294 in colombia of maize by 11 150 in china usa colombia pakistan or japan of cowpea by 45 in brazil of sweet potato by 54 in china and of wheat in pakistan by 65 haider et al 2022 however little research investigated the influences of biochar on cotton nutrient uptake growth and yields and obtained the best bacr for cotton irrigated by plastic film mulched trickle irrigation and planted in arid zone this research has also shown the more positive influences of biochar on plant height stem diameter leaf area index seed yield irrigation water productivity and partial fertilizer n p and k productivity and economic income of cotton especially at the best dose of 10 t ha 1 4 3 rational biochar application rate rational biochar application involves the application pattern the application frequency times and total period the application way apply once or continuously apply and the application amount rate dose the most common and efficient application pattern is to mix biochar uniformly with top layer soils there are a range of popular application period frequency including 1 2 years akhtar et al 2014 arif et al 2016 li et al 2018 maucieri et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 2017 3 6 years jin et al 2019 major et al 2010 pandit et al 2018 and 9 years yi et al 2020 for soil managers there are different aims which determine biochar application one or more times however two year is the recommended minimum observation period because biochar addition may not affect crop yields in the first year under some circumstances pandit et al 2018 the application rate amount dose is a very important technique parameter in biochar addition practice because it can affect crop growth yields and productions to a high extent however researches have seldom directly compared the effects of bcar differences on crop yields because it needs more economic investment some researchers compared influences of biochar addition or no addition on crop yields akhtar et al 2014 several researchers found that as bcar increased from 15 25 40 t ha 1 in pandit et al 2018 and from 0 to 100 in qayyum et al 2017 crop maize mustard and wheat grain yields achieved the peaks at the highest biochar addition levels 40 t ha 1 or biochar percentage of 100 in this research we observed decreasing cotton growth yields with the increasing bcars during 2018 2020 fig 5 there were several reasons for differences in research findings first our studied site belongs to an arid and semi arid region our farmland is highly salinized the trickle irrigation affects the soil water and salt movement along with biochar addition and the internal interaction mechanics of soil and plants are likely to be complex second the biochar itself contains different kinds of chemicals after application these chemicals increased soil salt content liang et al 2021 and therefore too high bcar restricted crop growth from this view a rational bcar is needed for crops planted in saline alkali soils however it is not adequate to determine a rational bcar only through observing how soil quality and crop yields were improved although most of the previous researches focused on this economic benefits at various bcars varied greatly a cost benefit analysis is necessary when assessing biochar effects on agricultural system pandit et al 2018 considered the agronomic costs and biochar production costs including ch4 emission cost and obtained highest benefit at 15 t ha 1 biochar application in our research the highest benefit was obtained at 10 t ha 1 based on the economic analysis this level was close to pandit et al 2018 and suitable for cotton the finally determined rational bcar of 10 t ha 1 for cotton was a key technique parameter which could be used in the farmland for field management under our rational bcar the profit of cotton will be 10 93326 billion rmb about 1 60783 billion us taking exchange rate of 6 8 for xinjiang china is extending cotton area which was 3028 1 thousand hectares in 2021 according to china statistics bureau our research demonstrated considerable economic profit potential if biochar is rationally applied in general the same application rate makes the responses of soil and plant simpler when other factors were fixed however year by year 2018 2020 the application rate of biochar were adjusted according to the observed data of current year which avoid continue the wrong trial e g the b100 which costed highest but produced less further studies are needed to test the effects of non continuously application of biochar or same biochar application rate of continuous application on soil and plant system 5 conclusions biochar applications increased the nutrient n p and k contents during different growth stages of cotton and the peak values were generally at the bcar of 10 50 t ha 1 total 30 130 t ha 1 under three year continuous application the relative content of chlorophyll increased with the increasing bcar and its values in inside rows were highly correlated with values in outside rows the growth and yield related indicators increased significantly under biochar application conditions and the bcar of 10 t ha 1 showed advantages in enhancing cotton growth and yields consequently the irrigation water and partial fertilizer productivities also achieved peak values at bcar of 10 t ha 1 this is a reasonable biochar application dose which was newly presented for cotton planting in arid zone however none of the cotton quality indices length micronaire strength and uniformity index were significantly affected by biochar applications through the economic analysis bcar of 10 t ha 1 total 30 t ha 1 for 3 year continuous application was recommended as the most economic and efficient dose for cotton planting in the arid and semi arid farmland since there were complicated interactions of soil biochar and crops further studies considering multi

9173,biochar application to soils has been proven to be an efficient way for yield enhancement in agricultural systems however what is the most economical biochar application rate bcar for cotton in saline alkali soils in arid and semi arid zones remains unclear to narrow the gap this study aims to investigate how biochar application affected the nutrient content growth yield quality and productivity of cotton and to find the rational bcar the three year field experiments of biochar application combined with plastic film mulched drip irrigation were conducted for cotton in xinjiang china the biochar was continuously applied to the farmland at 0 in 2018 0 in 2019 0 in 2020 10 10 10 nt no test 25 25 50 50 30 and 100 100 nt t ha 1 during cotton growth period of 2018 2020 the cotton growth yield and quality indicators were observed and used for computing water fertilizer productivity the cost benefit analysis was referred to recommend a rational bcar all four biochar application treatments increased the leaf stem root nutrient n p and k content than control during different cotton growth stages the daily relative content of chlorophyll increased with the increasing bcar and were larger at biochar treatments of 50 and 100 t ha 1 than 0 10 and 25 t ha 1 the growth and yield related indicators plant height stem diameter leaf area index and seed yield irrigation water productivity and partial fertilizer n p and k productivity consistently increased than control under biochar application conditions and the bcar of 10 t ha 1 showed the greatest advantages in enhancing germination rates cotton yields water fertilizer productivities and financial income than biochar treatments of 0 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 however neither cotton fiber quality indices length micronaire strength or uniformity index were significantly affected by biochar applications based on the economic analysis the rational bcar was 10 t ha 1 each year continued for three years for cotton planting which was a best dose that could be applied to arid zones and have not been reported before abbreviations bcar biochar application rate lai leaf area index das days after sowing no3

application cotton growth and yield economic benefit plastic film mulched trickle irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cotton gossypium hirsutum l is an essential economic commodity for millions of smallholder farmers in china wang et al 2022a b however soil salinization and water resource shortage are the main factors restricting cotton production and sustainable agricultural development in arid and semi arid regions the combined interactions of low precipitation shallow groundwater level and intense evaporation induce more severe soil salinity the low quality of the saline alkali soils leads to reduced soil water nutrient retention capacity and crop productivity and threatens the sustainable development of agriculture meena et al 2019 therefore many studies have explored the benefits of biochar applications for cotton nutrient content growth yields productivity and economic benefits biochar is produced by the thermal cracking of bio organic materials such as straw under hypoxia or anaerobic conditions at 300 1000 cheng et al 2008 liang 2021 biochar is an economical and efficient soil conditioner to improve the soil environment and enhance crop yields akhtar et al 2014 especially for low quality soils biochar addition to lands has comprehensive positive influences on agricultural systems first biochar improves soil physical properties including enhance water holding capacity streubel et al 2011 decrease bulk density increase soil porosity in the no mulching zones liang et al 2021 it also increases saturated soil water content field capacity and planar soil water storage and improve water retention and crop growth devereux et al 2012 second biochar also enhances soil chemical properties and increase nutrient content biochar increases soil organic carbon xiao et al 2016 enhances nutrient components such as soil mineral n content ammonium nitrate and total nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon nelissen et al 2015 sun et al 2019 karthik et al 2019 found that biochar application rate bcar at 4 0 t ha 1 significantly improved soil physical chemical properties of a cotton field third biochar addition reduced the differences between day and night soil temperatures by 0 66 1 39 c liu et al 2018 and mitigated some of the pulse effects of rainfall on emissions maucieri et al 2017 forth the addition of biochar elevated soil quality and promoted root growth and crop production significantly zhang et al 2020 and the grand mean increase was 10 jeffery et al 2011 finally biochar lowers water demand substantially and provides a novel solution for agricultural sustainability in salt affected regions lee et al 2022 overall biochar addition is an efficient technique for promoting agricultural productivity and profit previous research has assessed biochar application influences on soil environment and crop productivity in order to find the most suitable application rate or threshold for example for rice and durum wheat yields the best application was 10 t ha 1 zhang et al 2012 for a winter wheat plus summer maize rotation it was 16 t ha 1 zhang et al 2017 for wheat higher 50 75 and 100 bcars were good and the maximal 1000 grain weight was obtained under no farm manure and biochar 100 applications qayyum et al 2017 the growth physiology and yield of wheat were affected positively by biochar amendment akhtar et al 2015 particularly under high salinity level for maize the biochar treatment of 5 w w among 1 2 and 5 w w kim et al 2016 or 30 t ha 1 jia et al 2020 resulted in the highest yields pandit et al 2018 recommended 15 t ha 1 for a maize mustard field cropping system conversely researches showed no significant or decreasing effect of biochar application on crop yield bohara et al 2018 lai et al 2013 specifically the optimal rate of 4 t ha 1 among 0 2 4 8 t ha 1 biochar amendment effectively promoted cotton performance singh et al 2021 the determination of rational biochar application parameters is not only important but also necessary for field practices and cost income planning this is due to more biochar application costed higher investment kammann et al 2011 although the most appropriate bcar may induce the highest yields water and fertilizer utilization efficiency and economic benefits it is difficult to determine the best dose because it is affected not only by biochar production sources and soil properties the irrigation and fertilization schedules but also by crop types and varieties not to say most of the experiments are site and time specific compared with the world s major cotton producing countries cotton yields in xinjiang china was 25 and 96 higher than those of brazil and the united states respectively during the past several years feng et al 2017 however extensive salinized land and deserts occupied 31 1 and 22 5 of the arable land of xinjiang respectively liang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the limited land area results in cotton production facing competitive challenges to maintain high quality and productivity and sustainable development in addition the long term mean annual precipitation of xinjiang is below 200 mm and water saving irrigation is necessarily extended especially the plastic film mulched drip irrigation li et al 2021a 2021b 2017 we assume that there were advantages of biochar application in improving soil environment and crop production on saline alkali soils in xinjiang and the investigation of biochar effects on cotton growth yields productivity and benefits are necessary and important considering the inconsistent results from previous studies here we further assume that the most appropriate bcar is within ranges of 0 20 t ha 1 for applying to cotton in arid zones of xinjiang so far few researches have investigated biochar application effects on cotton growth and yields because the relative concentrated distribution of world s cotton planting countries are mainly india the united states of america and china our main goal was to determine which biochar rates resulted in both increased yield and increased economic value to the farmer with this in mind the specific objectives of this research were to 1 test four biochar rates over three years for impacts on in season growth health and final crop yield compared to a fertilized control with no biochar added 2 determine whether crop quality was impacted by biochar application rate and 3 determine the most economical biochar application rate bcar for cotton by conducting an economic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study

the 2 0 m wide protect rows were designed and planted with cotton the biochar was uniformly spread on and thoroughly mixed with the top 30 cm soils biochar was continuously applied from 2018 to 2020 with 0 in 2018 0 in 2019 0 in 2020 10 10 10 nt no test 25 25 50 50 30 and 100 100 nt t ha 1 during cotton growth period in 2018 four bcars of 0 10 50 and 100 t ha 1 were applied correspondingly the treatments were named as b0 b10 b50 and b100 in turn from the test results of 2018 between bcars of 10 and 50 t ha 1 there were a change point of bcar which altered soil physical chemical thermal properties and crop growth features before and after liang et al 2021 between b10 and b50 there are peak values of soil properties or crop growth and yields in 2018 therefore in 2019 bcar of 25 t ha 1 named as b25 treatment was added to find the turning points more accurately the b100 was found to be neither economic nor have typical improvement effects on the soil plant system thus in 2020 treatments b0 b10 b25 and b30 were designed while b100 was not tested table 1 in this year the biochar of 30 t ha 1 was applied to the former two b50 plots each treatment was replicated three times 2

growth indices of cotton affected by biochar 3 1 1 nutrient content of cotton leaf stem and root affected by biochar based on the measurements the nutrient n p and k content of cotton leaf stem and root during anthesis boll development and boll open stages were compared for 2018 and 2019 fig 3 the results showed that leaf n content was larger both at the anthesis and boll open stages than at the bolling stage in 2018 and 2019 root n content were larger at the boll open stage in both years additionally at the boll open stage bcar of 10 t ha 1 achieved the largest root n content in 2018 while in 2019 it was 50 t ha 1 stem n content was smaller at the anthesis stage both for 2018 and 2019 differed for the bolling stage in the two years and occupied around 1 3 of the total n content of cotton total n content of cotton achieved the highest values for bolling and boll open stages at bcar of 10 t ha 1 in 2018 and 50 t ha 1 in 2019 respectively figs 3a and 4f and table s2 p content of leaf stem and root were much smaller than n content at most of the growth stages leaf stem and root p content accounted each 1 3 of the total respectively biochar application changed p content

3aa ff and table s3 the ranges of leaf stem and root k content were close to those of n content under different conditions bcar of 50 and 10 t ha 1 contributed to the largest k content in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 3aa ff and table s4 overall biochar application increased n p and k contents for cotton growth both in 2018 and 2019 compared to no biochar condition the range of increased percentage of n p and k were n 38 2 in b100 treatment 2019 stem to 219 4 in b10 treatment 2019 taproot table s2 p 37 0 in b100 treatment 2019 stem to 179 2 in b10 treatment 2019 taproot table s3 and k 28 2 in b100 treatment 2019 stem to 154 3 in b10 treatment 2019 taproot respectively table s4 compared to no biochar treatment the content of n p k reached the highest increase at the bcar of 10 t ha 1 too high bcar of biochar 50 t ha 1 was not beneficial to cotton growth 3 1 2 germination and chlorophyll of cotton affected by biochar the main growth stages of cotton are sowing april 10 11 and 15 in 2018 2019 and 2020 seedling june 14 15 and 14 in 2018 2019 and 2020 bud june 25 26 and 28 in 2018 2019 and 2020 anthesis july 7 10 and 13 in 2018 2019 and 2020 bolling august 3 11 and 11 in 2018 2019 and 2020 and boll open august 27 30 and september 3 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the germination rates of cotton with the variate biochar application rate are compared in fig 4 in 2018 2019 and 2020 cotton germination rate ranged between 0 53 and 0 73 0 73 0 93 and 0 88 0 95 respectively the largest values occurred at the bcar of 10 t ha 1 and there were significant differences between the four treatments the ranges of germination rates increased in the 2nd and 3rd years showing positive influence of continuous biochar application however bcar greater than 25 t ha 1 were not appropriate in improving germination rates of cotton the temporal variations and fluctuations of relative content of chlorophyll during cotton growth stages of 2018 and 2019 fig 5 showed the generally higher values of b100 and b50 than b25 b10 and b0 treatments overall chlorophyll fluctuation patterns were similar for inside and outside rows in both 2018 and 2019 the relative content of chlorophyll at inside and outside rows increased first and then decreased to the lowest values before the 90 th days after sowing das and then increased until harvest biochar application increased relative content of chlorophyll during cotton growth stages both in 2018 and 2019 compared to b0 treatment the observed values of relative content of chlorophyll in inside and outside rows of cotton are plotted in fig 6 the values of relative content of chlorophyll in inside rows of cotton were smaller than outside rows of cotton for b0 b10 and b50 treatments but were a little larger than values of outside rows for b100 treatment there were very good linear correlations between the two and the coefficient of determination values varied from 0 691 to 0 849 the linear slopes were smallest for treatment b10 and largest for b100 both in 2018 and 2019 the continuous biochar application slightly changed the relationship between inside and outside rows of cotton chlorophyll 3 1 3 growth indices of cotton affected by biochar the temporal variations of cotton plant height stem diameter and lai during cotton growth stages of 2018 2019 and 2020 fig 7 indicated that 1 the plant height stem diameter and lai increased with the growth stages before the 105th das for all the treatments and years the plant height and stem diameter stopped increasing and the lai decreased after the 105th das since the plants were pinched with tip pruning 2 the differences of cotton growth indicators were smaller in 2018 but larger in the second planting year 2019 and small in 2020 these differences showed an improvement effects of 3 year continuous application of biochar on cotton growth 3 continuous biochar application with bcars of 10 25 and 50 t ha 1 improved cotton growth especially at bcar of 10 t ha 1 however continuous biochar application of 100 100 t ha 1 or 50 50 30 t ha 1 continuously decreased cotton growth we implied that the improper application of 2 year 100 100 t ha 1 or 3 year 50 50 30 t ha 1 were not proper application patterns for cotton planting however 2 year 50 50 t ha 1 application did not decrease cotton growth either 4 overall there was generally a decreasing ranking of continuous application rate for improving cotton growth namely 10 10 10 t ha 1 nt 25 25 t ha 1 50 50 30 t ha 1 0 0 0 ha 1 and 100 100 nt t ha 1 in turn 3 2 yield related indices of cotton affected by biochar 3 2 1 yield compositions of cotton the measured cotton boll density single boll weight branch number per plant lint percentage and lint yield along with the statistical differences p 0 05 were compared for different biochar application treatments in the three years table 3 for boll density branch number and lint yield the bcar of 10 t ha 1 b10 had the peak values of cotton yield compositions in 2018 2020 with significant differences when compared to the other biochar treatments and resulted in the most significant improvement of cotton yield while for single boll weight and lint percentage there were not always significant differences among different biochar treatments additionally the bcar of 25 t ha 1 b25 showed potential in improving boll density branch number and lint yield with significant differences when compared to the other biochar treatments under most conditions bcar of 100 t ha 1 significantly decreased boll density branch number per plant and lint yield of cotton based on these results we consider bcar of 100 t ha 1was too high for cotton growth and yields 3 2 2 quality of cotton the observed quality indices of cotton in 2018 2019 and 2020 table 4 showed that biochar application had little effects on changing cotton fiber quality bcar of 10 t ha 1 b10 increased fiber length and uniformity index but didn t improve micronaire and strength there were no significant differences among the four cotton quality indices at different bcars which were consistent in the all 3 years 3 3 efficiency and productivity of cotton affected by biochar the computed yields irrigation water productivity iwp and partial fertilizer productivity pfp of cotton in 2018 2019 and 2020 are presented in table 5 significant differences were observed among different treatments although there were differences between the three years the yields iwp and pfp for n p and k for b10 treatment consistently had peak values in 2018 2019 and 2020 except b10 treatments b25 and b50 also improved the iwp and pfp of cotton when compared to b0 however the improved effects were generally smaller than b10 the productivity decreasing effects of b100 on iwp and pfp in 2018 and 2019 were consistently shown for cotton in 2020 b30 decreased the iwp and pfp of cotton 3 4 economic benefit of biochar application on cotton the income cost and economic benefit of biochar application on cotton are presented in table 6 for different treatments and planting years notice that not all treatments were applied in 2018 2020 only b0 and b10 were continuously conducted the treatments b0 b10 and b25 had significant higher economic benefits than treatments b25 b50 and b100 of which treatment b10 had the highest economic benefit in 2019 and 2020 bcars of 50 50 30 and 100 100 t ha 1 had negative economic benefits generally there were negative low economic benefits for biochar application treatments of b25 b50 b30 and b100 also there was great economic benefit of no biochar application on cotton and this was attributed to the high economic benefit of cotton itself overall considering the comprehensive responses of nutrient content the relative content of chlorophyll the growth and yield related indicators and the economic benefit of cotton the recommended most appropriate bcar for cotton was 10 t ha 1 per year if continuously applied for 3 years 4 discussions 4 1 influences of biochar application on soil properties the crop yield enhancement by biochar application was activated by the gradually improved soil environments over time biochar application improved soil physical and hydraulic characteristics significantly for example biochar decreased soil bulk density and increase soil macroporosity 50 µm by creating new accommodation pores andrenelli et al 2016 the oxidized biochar can retain more water in sandy soils enhance water holding capacities and increase soil water retention suliman et al 2017 biochar can signiﬁcantly enhance soil ph nutrient contents soil microbial biomass carbon organic carbon nitrogen base cations and enzymatic activities arif et al 2016 jin et al 2019 the alkaline biochar applied at recommended rate e g 10 t ha 1 from sandhu et al 2017 can increase cold water extractable carbon fraction of acidic sandy loam soil additionally our observation in fig 8 for 2019 showed the comprehensive effects of biochar on decreasing soil bulk density especially at the top layers 0 30 cm 1 on improving soil moisture of no mulch and narrow row zones when the biochar application rate was less than 25 t ha 1 2 on decreasing soil salt content at biochar application rate of 10 t ha 1 and 3 on increasing nitrate and organic carbon content when biochar application rate was increasing the overall improvement of soil environment by biochar application provided good water and nutrient environment for crop growth these improvements stabilize the increase of cotton production and improves feasibility in arid and semi arid zones therefore there is strong support for biochar s potential in agriculture we confidently think that biochar application improves soil environment if properly added to soils however there is a significant lack of investigation on biochar application effects on cotton production especially how to determine a rational biochar application rate 4 2 the roles of soil additive or conditioner in saline alkali soils soil conditioner additive played important roles in modifying saline alkali soils in general it changes quality of saline alkali soils by regulating soil ph value reducing soil salt content improving soil structure rising water retention capacity adjusting microbial environment or promoting seed germination and growth for example biochar haider et al 2022 biomass pyrolysis fluid wang et al 2022a b humic acid and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose shan et al 2022 gypsum like ca2 solid agents organic inorganic acids wang et al 2010 and many other types of soil conditioner have been some additives applied to lands in recent years as a water soluble polyelectrolyte hydrolytic polymaleic anhydride reduced the soil ph and ec in saline alkali wang et al 2010 dephenolization pyrolysis fluid is another kind of soil conditioner which reduced total soil salt content effectively wang et al 2022a b as mentioned above biochar was shown to have potentials in changing soil environment and plant yields it could reduce soil bulk density by 9 and increase saturated hydraulic conductivity by 88 from 6 1 to 11 4 cm h 1 oguntunde et al 2008 agegnehu et al 2017 biochar increased soil ph values from 7 1 to 8 1 at 39 t ha 1 granatstein et al 2009 or from 6 0 up to 9 6 steiner et al 2008 from experiment of lashari et al 2013 application of biochar together with poultry manure compost to saline soil significantly decreased salinity by 3 6 g kg 1 and increased soil ph organic c available p bulk density by 0 3 2 6 g kg 1 27 mg kg 1 and 0 1 g cm 3 respectively the added biochar have altered the microbial activity and abundance of denitrifying genes in soils which regulated the emission of n2o shaaban et al 2018 in addition different types of biochar have shown great potential in increasing biomass yield of rice by 14 in china to 294 in colombia of maize by 11 150 in china usa colombia pakistan or japan of cowpea by 45 in brazil of sweet potato by 54 in china and of wheat in pakistan by 65 haider et al 2022 however little research investigated the influences of biochar on cotton nutrient uptake growth and yields and obtained the best bacr for cotton irrigated by plastic film mulched trickle irrigation and planted in arid zone this research has also shown the more positive influences of biochar on plant height stem diameter leaf area index seed yield irrigation water productivity and partial fertilizer n p and k productivity and economic income of cotton especially at the best dose of 10 t ha 1 4 3 rational biochar application rate rational biochar application involves the application pattern the application frequency times and total period the application way apply once or continuously apply and the application amount rate dose the most common and efficient application pattern is to mix biochar uniformly with top layer soils there are a range of popular application period frequency including 1 2 years akhtar et al 2014 arif et al 2016 li et al 2018 maucieri et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 2017 3 6 years jin et al 2019 major et al 2010 pandit et al 2018 and 9 years yi et al 2020 for soil managers there are different aims which determine biochar application one or more times however two year is the recommended minimum observation period because biochar addition may not affect crop yields in the first year under some circumstances pandit et al 2018 the application rate amount dose is a very important technique parameter in biochar addition practice because it can affect crop growth yields and productions to a high extent however researches have seldom directly compared the effects of bcar differences on crop yields because it needs more economic investment some researchers compared influences of biochar addition or no addition on crop yields akhtar et al 2014 several researchers found that as bcar increased from 15 25 40 t ha 1 in pandit et al 2018 and from 0 to 100 in qayyum et al 2017 crop maize mustard and wheat grain yields achieved the peaks at the highest biochar addition levels 40 t ha 1 or biochar percentage of 100 in this research we observed decreasing cotton growth yields with the increasing bcars during 2018 2020 fig 5 there were several reasons for differences in research findings first our studied site belongs to an arid and semi arid region our farmland is highly salinized the trickle irrigation affects the soil water and salt movement along with biochar addition and the internal interaction mechanics of soil and plants are likely to be complex second the biochar itself contains different kinds of chemicals after application these chemicals increased soil salt content liang et al 2021 and therefore too high bcar restricted crop growth from this view a rational bcar is needed for crops planted in saline alkali soils however it is not adequate to determine a rational bcar only through observing how soil quality and crop yields were improved although most of the previous researches focused on this economic benefits at various bcars varied greatly a cost benefit analysis is necessary when assessing biochar effects on agricultural system pandit et al 2018 considered the agronomic costs and biochar production costs including ch4 emission cost and obtained highest benefit at 15 t ha 1 biochar application in our research the highest benefit was obtained at 10 t ha 1 based on the economic analysis this level was close to pandit et al 2018 and suitable for cotton the finally determined rational bcar of 10 t ha 1 for cotton was a key technique parameter which could be used in the farmland for field management under our rational bcar the profit of cotton will be 10 93326 billion rmb about 1 60783 billion us taking exchange rate of 6 8 for xinjiang china is extending cotton area which was 3028 1 thousand hectares in 2021 according to china statistics bureau our research demonstrated considerable economic profit potential if biochar is rationally applied in general the same application rate makes the responses of soil and plant simpler when other factors were fixed however year by year 2018 2020 the application rate of biochar were adjusted according to the observed data of current year which avoid continue the wrong trial e g the b100 which costed highest but produced less further studies are needed to test the effects of non continuously application of biochar or same biochar application rate of continuous application on soil and plant system 5 conclusions biochar applications increased the nutrient n p and k contents during different growth stages of cotton and the peak values were generally at the bcar of 10 50 t ha 1 total 30 130 t ha 1 under three year continuous application the relative content of chlorophyll increased with the increasing bcar and its values in inside rows were highly correlated with values in outside rows the growth and yield related indicators increased significantly under biochar application conditions and the bcar of 10 t ha 1 showed advantages in enhancing cotton growth and yields consequently the irrigation water and partial fertilizer productivities also achieved peak values at bcar of 10 t ha 1 this is a reasonable biochar application dose which was newly presented for cotton planting in arid zone however none of the cotton quality indices length micronaire strength and uniformity index were significantly affected by biochar applications through the economic analysis bcar of 10 t ha 1 total 30 t ha 1 for 3 year continuous application was recommended as the most economic and efficient dose for cotton planting in the arid and semi arid farmland since there were complicated interactions of soil biochar and crops further studies considering multi

9174,increasing chemical inputs to improve food security has resulted in worrying environmental consequences recently significant efforts have been made to reduce the environmental impacts of the food supply chain the current study examined the effects of different levels of urea fertilizer on the technical economic and environmental aspects of wheat production in arid and humid climates a questionnaire was used to collect data on wheat cultivation in the 2019 and 2020 crop seasons the calibrated and validated aquacrop model was applied to simulate crop yield under different urea fertilizer levels of 80 160 and 220 kg ha 1 in arid climate and 100 180 and 250 kg ha 1 in humid climate economic productivity water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency indicators was used to assess the economic and technical sustainability of different cropping systems the environmental impacts was investigated by using the life cycle assessment lca approach involving the recipe 2016 method covering 18 midpoints and three endpoint indicators respectively the most important midpoint categories from foreground background analysis were global warming fine particulate matter formation and terrestrial acidification additionally 75 of the total environmental damage was related to the background system on average considering different fertilizer treatments wheat cultivation in the arid climate had a 9 higher environmental damage potential than the humid climate nitrogen played the most significant role in midpoint categories followed by diesel the most appropriate urea fertilizer level in the arid climate compared to the corresponding level in the humid climate increased human health ecosystem and resources by 14 3 12 5 and 3 2 respectively and decreased water and economic productivity by 375 and 8 respectively based on the results combining lca with technical and economic indicators provides an appropriate method for prioritizing the cultivation of different crops in each county keywords aquacrop environmental damage global warming life cycle assessment water productivity data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction due to the growth of the world s population and the demand for agricultural products modern agriculture has led to many negative effects on the planet s ecosystems therefore according to the goals of food security in 2050 the amount of food produced should double with environmentally sustainable solutions mujeeb kazi et al 2019 ramírez gonzález et al 2018 wheat plays an essential role in providing food security for the growing population it is expected that the wheat demand to increase by 60 by 2050 gómez et al 2021 indicating its production will rise from 757 million tons in 2019 fao 2019 to more than 900 million tons in 2050 rosegrant et al 2009 over the past few years most efforts have been devoted to increasing yield per unit area through increasing the use of fertilizers darzi naftchali and mokhtassi bidgoli 2022 if the current trend continues with the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides while ignoring sustainability aspects the cumulative environmental effects will result in a crisis in the future tigchelaar et al 2018 to achieve sustainability in food production it is necessary to change the current methods of food production due to existing inefficiencies ali et al 2016 tariq et al 2018 a review of various studies shows many concerns regarding the increase in the consumption of chemical fertilizers and their negative effects on the environment ai qasi et al 2021 eagle et al 2017 additionally the inefficient irrigation management decreases water productivity and aggravates the environmental effects of the use of chemical fertilizers zhu et al 2018 to compensate for the low water productivity indiscriminate use of groundwater fang et al 2010 leads to the leaching of more fertilizers phosphates and nitrates and more pollution of water resources ju et al 2004 hence agricultural sustainability depends on the balance between food security and environmental protection ipcc 2019 although the application of n fertilizer improves crop performance mosongo et al 2022 excessive amounts can lead to significant environmental damage nitrogen fertilizers account for 63 of all fertilizers consumed with more than half of them being consumed in asia fao 2010 nitrogen fertilizer consumption for wheat production globally averages 98 kg ha 1 west et al 2014 approximately 60 of the n fertilizer used in agricultural fields is out of reach of the plant roots due to evaporation leaching and remaining in the soil after harvesting azad et al 2020 west et al 2014 additionally excessive n losses result in significant economic losses for farmers and environmental damage gruber and galloway 2008 also in order to fully benefit from co2 in the future climate change additional nitrogen and other fertilizers are needed abbass et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to manage the levels of n fertilizer consumption for sustainable production anderson et al 2008a to compensate for the environmental effects caused by the consumption of this fertilizer solutions such as optimizing fertilizer consumption pishgar komleh et al 2020 cultivating organic crops meisterling et al 2009 using nitrogen fixing products and applying organic fertilizers yao et al 2017 are suggested additionally in europe the sustainability of agricultural systems is pursued by implementing the green deal strategy through integrated actions based on sustainable practices in terms of both environment and economy simoniello et al 2022 many efforts have been made to genetically modify cereals including wheat to evolve from annual cultivars to permanent cultivars perennial plants have less environmental impact than annual cultivars gómez and rodríguez 2022 management tools for nitrogen fertilizer have been developed on the basis of improving crop yields but the complex effects of n fertilizer application and its role in damaging the environment are often ignored therefore for a more rational evaluation of n fertilizer consumption a new attitude and integrated application of different indicators are required oecd 2001 different methods and indicators including life cycle assessment lca are used to assess the sustainability of cultivation systems taki et al 2018 however the lca analyzes every stage of product production although social and economic factors are not considered in the analysis of environmental effects morero et al 2015 this concept has been considered suitable for evaluating agriculture s environmental impacts by many researchers canaj et al 2020 taki et al 2018 zhixiang and xing 2020 previous studies have found that n fertilizer and diesel fuel are the most important factors affecting the environment brentrup et al 2004 shrestha et al 2020 taki et al 2018 in various reports different effects of these sources on environmental indicators have been stated such as terrestrial acidification and global warming brentrup et al 2004 the depletion of fossil resources and terrestrial acidification wang et al 2007 depletion of minerals and eutrophication hojjati et al 2019 freshwater ecotoxicity terrestrial acidification and eutrification pourmehdi and kheiralipour 2020 terrestrial acidification eutrophication and global warming and depletion of phosphate resources and eutrification taghinejad and vahedi 2021 during the wheat production period have been mentioned as the most vulnerable environmental indicators additionally the rate of fertilizer consumption can influence each environmental indicator previous research on nitrogen fertilizer management has focused on its direct effects and positive aspects while the related indirect environmental damage has been neglected additionally geographical location has a significant influence on environmental impacts canaj et al 2020 dias et al 2017 regional characterization of environmental impacts which leads to a more realistic and balanced picture of agricultural practices and their potential impacts on the environment has also been neglected in previous studies accordingly this study was designed i to assess technical economic and environmental aspects of wheat production ii to identify the main processes of environmental effects in the background and foreground systems the foreground system includes all direct emissions resulting from the consumption of input resources at the farm level and the background system includes the emission of pollutants resulting from the extraction and production of input resources iii to evaluate the effect of different levels of urea fertilizer on the environmental impacts water and economic productivity and iv to compare the impact of climate conditions on the environmental impacts water and economic productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in two regions of sari 36 56 n 53 05 e 42 m above sea level in the north of iran and sistan 31 03 n 61 49 e 483 m above sea level in the southeast of iran fig 1 according to dumarten s climate classification these regions have humid and arid climates respectively and are an indicative of these two climates of the country according to the 20 year statistics of dasht e naz meteorological station in sari the average annual precipitation of the region is 573 mm the average temperature is 16 4 c and the average annual evaporation is 1002 4 mm based on the 35 year statistics of the zabol meteorological station in sistan the average annual precipitation of this region is 55 mm the maximum temperature is 50 c the average relative humidity is 30 and the average annual evaporation is 4500 mm 2 2 cropping data a questionnaire was used to collect information on wheat production 2019 2020 growing seasons including the cultivated area crop yield inputs fertilizer electricity fossil fuel labor chemical pesticides agricultural machinery and water consumption and costs of different production operations information about wheat cultivation and consumption of agricultural inputs were collected by completing a questionnaire and the ministry of jihad agriculture to determine the sample size random sampling method was used as follows snedecor and cochran 1980 1 n n t 2 s 2 n d 2 t 2 s 2 where n refers to population size t is the confidence level s is the variance d is the optimal probability and n is the sample size based on the wheat cultivated area in sari 9790 ha and sistan 38 500 ha anon 2020 the sample size in each region was 192 and 273 ha respectively considering the average cropping area of each wheat farmer in the country 5 ha statistical center of iran 2015 the number of questionnaires in sari and sistan was selected as 38 and 55 respectively 2 3 aquacrop model aquacrop6 1 a plant growth simulation model developed by fao for simulating plant growth stages and yields raes et al 2009 was used to simulate wheat yield the model requires six input files including climate data plant data soil data management data irrigation information and initial soil water conditions the required climatic data include maximum and minimum daily temperature precipitation carbon dioxide co2 concentration in the atmosphere and potential evaporation and transpiration eto the climate data were prepared from the synoptic weather stations of dasht e naz and zabol also the data were used to estimate eto using the fao penman monteith method allan et al 1998 aquacrop also provides emission values for 1902 2099 which were used for existing conditions the soil types were silty clay and sandy loam in sari and sistan respectively the height values related to these soil texture values on saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat saturated volume moisture ɵsat field capacity fc and wilting point pwp were used for simulations additionally plant data which include two sets of fixed parameters and user specific data were used in this model the default values in the model were adopted for fixed parameters the user specific parameters include planting date planting density canopy cover cc max canopy cover ccx crown cover growth factor cgc crown cover reduction factor cdc depth of root development water productivity wp and harvest index hi nutrient cycles in the soil are not explicitly considered in aquacrop however soil fertility stress is determined using a semi quantitative assessment raes et al 2012 to simulate crop growth under fertilizer stress conditions in this method reductions of cc and wp should be calibrated based on crop type climate and soil conditions the relative biomass brel ccx and the decline canopy cover during the growing season which is qualitatively introduced to the model were entered into the model as input parameters for two treatments under the greatest fertilizer stress field stress and no stress reference field this method shows that fertilizer stress reduces evaporation and transpiration and the amount of crop yield the model uses coefficients including ksccx soil fertilizer stress coefficient for maximum canopy expansion ksexp f fertilizer stress coefficient for canopy expansion and kswp fertilizer stress coefficient for reducing water productivity in addition the model uses the fcdecline coefficient for the daily decline of canopy cover after reaching ccx in conditions without fertility stress fcdecline is zero and in conditions of 100 fertility stress this factor is assumed equal to 1 therefore this coefficient varies between 0 fcdecline 1 per day also the wp coefficient calculated by the model was recalibrated under fertility stress conditions cgc and ccx coefficients are also modified for soil fertility using ksexp f and ksccx coefficients ks coefficients are considered one and close to the minimum theoretical value 0 for non fertility and in 100 stress conditions respectively finally based on brel ccx and recalibrated values the model automatically determines each of the ks curves raes et al 2012 the fields in the study areas were under flood irrigation in sistan irrigation was done four times at a time interval of 35 days supplemental irrigation was practiced in sari in two times during flowering and grain filling stages the amount of irrigation water in certain field in the agricultural research centres were measured using parshall flume which were used in this research due to the model sensitivity on water input as the main factor limiting crop growth adeboye et al 2021 data from 2019 with higher rainfall or lower water stress were used for calibration parameters of the model are classified as conservative or non conservative adeboye et al 2021 unlike conservative parameters non conservative parameters are affected by management and environmental factors non conservative parameters such as planting date growth stage and plant density are derived from observations and measurements conservative parameters cgc cdc and wp are provided as default values in the model model default values are used when measurement of certain parameters is impossible during experimental studies the performance of the model is generally improved by adjusting conservative parameters in the given location sandhu and irmak 2019 the cgc and cdc parameters in the model were generated using observed wheat phenological stages using a trial and error approach fine tuning was performed until the model output grain yields matched the observation the calibration procedure was performed with the data of soil fertility stress a simulation of the crop response to soil fertility stress was performed after calibrating the model the soil fertility was also calibrated for nitrogen levels of maximum stress n0 medium stress and no fertility stress thus the treatment without fertility stress was considered a reference and the maximum fertility stress treatment was considered stress treatment in the model the input data in the calibration process are tabulated in table 1 an important step in model verification is validation which consists of comparing field measurements grain yields with model outputs iqbal et al 2014 validation was conducted using the crop parameters obtained from model calibration by using independent data sets of 2020 from treatments n0 n150 n250 from sari and n0 n100 n220 from sistan the reliability of the aquacrop model was evaluated based on mean square normalized error nrsme model efficiency ef compatibility index d and

positive and negative values of crm indicate underestimation and overestimation of product performance respectively moriasi et al 2007 2 4 management scenarios the calibrated and validated aquacrop was then applied to assess wheat yield under different fertilization scenarios the average rate fertilization in each region was determined using collected questionnaires and technical instructions from agricultural and natural resources research centers to analyze the response of crop yield to different levels of urea fertilizer three levels of fertilization were applied to the model based on the considered fertilizer levels the application of a stress level minimum fertilization and a consumption level higher than the average rate maximum fertilization were considered according to each area in this regard the minimum and maximum levels of urea fertilizer consumption were obtained using past local studies kamali and shahabiyan 2021 sepidehdam and ramroudi 2016 therfore three fertilizer levels were used for sari city 100 180 and 250 kg ha 1 sc 100 sc 180 sc 250 and 80 160 and 220 kg ha 1 sp 80 sp 160 sp 220 of urea fertilizer for sistan plain 2 5 economical and technical sustainability the economic and technical indicators were calculated based on the grain yield calculated using the aquacrop model in the considered fertilizer scenarios the economical sustainability of wheat production was assessed using gross profit per unit volume of water bpd net profit per unit volume of water nbpd and benefit to cost ratio bcr indices kijne et al 2003 7 bpd gm i p 8 nbpd nm i p 9 bcr gm tp where p is the amount of precipitation m3 ha 1 and i is the amount of irrigation m3 ha 1 gm and nm are gross and net profit from wheat production ha 1 y is grain yield kg ha 1 and tp is the total cost of production ha 1 also irrigation and rainwater productivity wpi p irrigation productivity wpi and evapotranspiration productivity wpet were analyzed as technical indices kijne et al 2003 10 wp i p y i p 11 wp i y i 12 wp et y et where et is evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 the nitrogen usage efficiency nue was also calculated based on dividing the grain yield by the amount of cumulative urea fertilizer applied kg kg 1 throughout the growing season lyu et al 2021 finally to investigate the difference of environmental impacts economic and water productivity we used multivariate analysis of variance significant expressions p 0 05 were analysed using the paired comparison test with the monte carlo test statistic statistical analyses were performed using the permanova routine in the primer v6 computer program clarke and gorley 2006 including the permanova extension package anderson et al 2008b 2 6 environmental sustainability a life cycle assessment lca was used to assess the environmental sustainability of wheat production systems this method includes collecting and evaluating the inputs outputs and potential environmental consequences of the final production of a product throughout its life cycle each lca study has four stages determining the goal and scope of the study life cycle audit lci impact assessment lcia and interpretation georgiopoulou and lyberatos 2018 2 6 1 goal functional units and system boundaries the goal definition is the first step of lca nabavi pelesaraei et al 2018 in this research work two study areas are considered for evaluating lca environmental damages including sari and sistan whose comparison was one of the main objectives an essential concept in lca is the functional unit which refers to a reference unit for inventory data in other words it is the unit by which the performance of a production system is quantified in accordance with iso 14040 iso 0 1404 2008 in this research the functional unit was considered one ton of grain wheat in fig 2 the system boundary is the farm gate 2 6 2 input analysis inventory lci all inputs and outputs related to wheat production including resource consumption energy consumption and pollution emissions were collected at this stage a total of two data sets are required for this step including foreground and background data nabavi pelesaraei et al 2017 the foreground includes all direct emissions resulting from the consumption of input resources for wheat production at the field level which leads to the entry of these pollutants into water soil and air also the background includes the emissions of pollutants caused by the production of inputs to the farm the specifications of various cultivation operations and input sources for wheat production are presented in tables 2 and 3 respectively irrigation water in sistan and sari is supplied through surface and groundwater resources respectively irrigation water quality in the study areas was classified by the wilcox index in c3s1 range homayon nejad et al 2015 it also classified chemical fertilizer emissions pesticide emissions and diesel consumption in agricultural machinery the emission of pollutants caused by diesel combustion were calculated using the u s lci database 2015 also the release of toxins into the air and soil the leaching of phosphate and nitrate dinitrogen monoxide n2o ammonia nh3 resulting from the use of chemical fertilizers the release of nitrogen oxide nox resulting from the use of nitrogen fertilizers into the air ipcc 2006 and carbon dioxide co2 caused by human activities in the air mousavi avval et al 2017 also heavy metals released into the soil due to the use of chemical fertilizers have been estimated based on previous studies durlinger et al 2015 mousavi avval et al 2017 the ecoinvent version 3 6 database was also used to calculate other pollutants the yield obtained was the basis for calculating the emissions of pollutants caused by the consumption of input resources to produce one ton of wheat 2 6 3 life cycle impact assessment lcia the lci results were quantitatively analyzed using simapro 9 2 software and the recipe 2016 1 1 methods huijbregts et al 2017 the recipe method addresses 18 environmental concerns at the midpoint level and then aggregates the endpoints into a set of three endpoint categories fig 3 at the midpoint level characteristic factors are located along the impact path but at the endpoint level characteristic factors are located at the end of the impact path in three areas of protection namely human health ecosystem quality and resource scarcity both approaches are complementary since midpoint characterization has a stronger relationship with environmental fluxes and relatively low uncertainty while endpoint characterization provides better insight into the ecological significance of environmental fluxes huijbregts et al 2017 2 6 4 interpretation finally the results of the environmental effects were reviewed and a logical interpretation was presented for each level of urea fertilizer the aquacrop model framework and life cycle assessment steps used for calculations are shown in fig 4 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the aquacrop model the performance of the model during calibration and validation is shown in table 4 the estimated grain yields varied from 2 37 to 4 63 t ha 1 in sari and from 1 74 to 3 14 t ha 1 in sistan indicating that the grain yield was significantly affected by soil fertility the values of nrsme ranged from 7 43 to 13 32 which are considered good for the model also values of d and ef indices varied in the range of 0 98 0 99 and 0 92 0 98 respectively the calibrated data set for 2019 showed acceptable performance between estimated and measured grain yields for both regions crm values indicate that the model tends to underestimate grain yield under maximum soil fertility stress the soil fertility stress had a negative impact on the accuracy of grain yield simulation accuracy based on these results the simulation in sari was more accurate than in sistan in the validation stage the values of ef 0 92 0 96 indicate perfect consistency between estimated and measured data nrmse values calculated for sari and sistan ranged from 8 43 to 11 52 and 9 63 14 62 at different n fertilizer levels respectively the performance of aquacrop decreased with increasing soil fertility stress so that the lowest accuracy was observed for n0 however the model simulated the grain yield more accurately in non stress treatments n250 and n220 nrmse 8 43 ef 0 96 d 0 99 in sari and nrmse 9 63 ef 0 95 d 0 99 in sisatan the results suggest that the grain yield of wheat can be predicted with good reliability using the aquacrop model 3 2 output analysis the emission rate of various pollutants are presented in table 5 for the production of on ton of wheat the highest amount of co2 emission was related to the sc 100 and sp 80 scenarios 104 5 and 142 4 kg respectively co2 emission in sistan was on average 31 higher than that in sari the highest amount of n2o emission in sc 250 and sp 220 was 0 46 and 0 59 kg respectively increasing the use of urea fertilizer in sc 250 compared to sc 100 led to a double increase in n2o emission the emission of n2o was 27 higher in sistan than in sari on average there was a direct relationship between the amount of urea consumption and nh3 emission thus the highest nh3 emission was related to sc 250 3 23 kg and sp 220 4 18 kg treatments the emission of nh3 increased by 0 13 and 0 19 kg for every 10 kg increase in urea fertilizer applied in sari and sistan the amount of nox emission in sistan was 29 higher than that in sari same as the pattern observed for the other greenhouse gases the highest emission of nox occurred for the minimum levels of urea sc 100 1 32 kg and sp 80 1 75 kg in both regions nox emission decreased with increasing urea application an increase in urea application increased in nitrate losses entering into so that the highest losses were observed in sc 250 3 54 kg and sp 220 4 57 kg according to the results every 10 kg of urea fertilizer applied increased nitrate leaching by 0 14 kg in sari and 0 20 kg in sistan the average amount of nitrate leachingin sistan was 28 higher than that in sari the nitrate leaching rate varied among treatments from 12 to 15 of applied nitrogen additionally the rate of urea application affected the release of heavy metals into the soil the highest contamination of heavy metals in the soil was observed for sc 250 and sp 220 the amount of heavy metal pollution in sistan was 25 higher than that in sari the lowest and highest concentrations of heavy metals were related to mercury and lead respectively the lead content of the soil was 87 of the total heavy metals added by chemical fertilizers 3 3 environmental indicators 3 3 1 human health the influence of various midpoint environmental indicators on human health is shown in fig 5 direct emissions from the farms were the most significant factor in sistan the lowest and highest amount of global warming were observed for sp 80 501 9 kg co2 eq and sp 220 567 2 kg co2 eq in terms of co2 eq the values for sc 100 and sc 250 were 47 and 26 less than the sp 220 respectively urea fertilizer contributed 14 to global warming in sp 80 while it contributed 26 to global warming in sp 220 due to an increase in fertilizer consumption similarly sc 100 and sc 250 contribute 15 and 25 to global warming respectively the amount of co2 eq in sistan and sari increased by an average of 2 57 and 1 80 kg per kilogram of urea fertilizer consumed generally sistan is affected by global warming 29 more than sari the urea fertilizer application directly correlated with ozone layer depletion the emissions from the farms played a significant role in ozone depletion the highest amount of degradation occurred for sc 250 0 004 kg cfc11 eq and sp 220 0 003 kg cfc11 eq sistan had a 34 higher ozone depletion potential than sari per kg of fertilizer consumed the increase in ozone concentration is also linked to other activities outside the farms in sistan and sari urea fertilizer contributed 33 and 30 respectively to the total ozone depletion overall the ozone formation potential in sistan was 41 higher than that in sari human health is also affected by the dispersion indicators of the fine particulate matter formation a large portion of this indicator can be attributed to farming activities the results showed that the changing trend of this index was decreasing and its highest values were observed at the minimum fertilizer application level thus sp 80 and sc 100 treatments showed the maximum dispersion of fine particles with 0 28 and 0 20 kg pm2 5 eq respectively the distribution of fine particulate matter formation in sistan was 24 higher than that in sari chemical fertilizers and electricity production also affected carcinogenic toxicity in sistan 72 of the carcinogenic toxicity was related to the production of the three fertilizers nitrogen phosphate and potash urea fertilizer contributed to 34 of the carcinogenic toxicity twice as much as other fertilizers in sari the contribution of urea fertilizer was 28 on average with an increase in fertilizer consumption in sari carcinogenic toxicity also showed an upward trend the maximum amount of urea contribution occurred in sp 220 0 098 kg of 1 4 dcb and sc 250 0 080 kg of 1 4 dcb water consumption indirectly affects human health most of the water consumed was used for wheat irrigation the weather in sistan caused more irrigation water for wheat production maximum water consumption was observed at the minimum fertilizer levels 3 3 2 ecosystem quality fig 6 illustrates how each input source contributes to the indicators of ecosystem quality terrestrial acidification was largely influenced by the activities outside the farms and the direct emission was effectively less than 4 the soil acidification potential was the highest in sp 160 1 18 kg so2 eq and sc 250 0 85 kg so2 eq due to the increased use of urea fertilizer terrestrial acidification was also increased in sistan the soil is exposed to terrestrial acidification with an average of 1 16 kg so2 eq 41 more than that in sari besides soil resources freshwater resources are also at risk of environmental degradation input sources in the outside activities are critical for creating the eutrophication of freshwater resources the main source of eutrophication in sistan was phosphate in the sp 80 treatment and urea fertilizer in the sp 160 and sp 220 however in sari urea fertilizer played the most important role in creating this indicator at the fertilizer levels in the fertilizer treatments the urea fertilizer participated in eutrophication by 38 on average the maximum amount of eutrophication in sp 220 and sc 250 were 0 077 and 0 053 kg p eq respectively urea fertilizer has a significant effect on terrestrial ecotoxicity however no differences were observed among the treatments a high correlation was found between ecotoxicity and the consumption of chemical fertilizers that caused soil toxicity in outside farm activities soil toxicity was more elevated in sistan than in sari by 42 the average amount of soil toxicity in sistan and sari was 318 and 224 kg of 1 4 dcb respectively land use change for agriculture is another factor that impacts land ecosystems the production of chemical fertilizers as an indirect emission was the main cause of change in land use change phosphorous and urea fertilizers had the greatest impact on land use among the input sources by increasing the levels of urea fertilizer and increasing the emission of pollutants the contribution of urea fertilizer was also increased the maximum land use was observed in sp 160 15 23 m2 yr crop eq and sc 250 9 55 m2 yr crop eq generally in sistan 67 more land was needed for wheat production than that in sari 3 3 3 resources the contribution of inputs to each impact subcategory of resources is shown in fig 7 the main contributor to the fossil resource scarcity is indirect emissions from outside farm activities at the minimum fertilizer consumption levels diesel fuel was the most important factor in the scarcity of fossil resources however with increasing the use of urea this fertilizer became the main factor contributing to the fossil resource scarcity electricity was also a major resource of the fossil resource scarcity in sari sp 160 and sc 250 had the greatest depletion of fossil resources 120 61 and 100 69 kg oil equivalent respectively sistan used 21 a more fossil fuel than sari the production of chemical fertilizers and agricultural machinery had a significant impact on the mineral resource scarcity phosphorous fertilizer contributes more than the other fertilizers to mineral resource scarcity the average contribution of phosphorous fertilizer was 50 the highest level of mineral resource scarcity was observed in sp 80 2 99 kg cu eq and sc 100 1 62 kg cu eq a decrease in the mineral resource scarcitywas observed with an increase in urea fertilizer levels because of the production of wheat in sistan 76 more mineral resources were evacuated compared to sari 3 4 final damage categories the final environmental effects of different fertilizer treatments on human health ecosystem quality and resources are categorized in table 6 based on human health the minimum urea fertilizer levels had the greatest environmental impact the amounts of sp 80 and sc 100 were 0 00020 and 0 00017 daly respectively for the damage category of human health increasing the use of fertilizers was accompanied by a decrease in the environmental effects of human health human health was affected in sistan by 18 more than that in sari the fine particulate matter formation in the environment caused approximately 70 of the human health damage fig 8 another effective factor on human health was global warming with a contribution of 20 compared to sari sistan had higher health risks due to the fine particles dispersed by the chemical fertilizers and diesel fuel sp 80 and sc 100 had the lowest values in terms of ecosystem quality in contrast sp 220 and sp 250 treatments were the most damaging treatments to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems global warming 37 acidification of soil resources 30 and land use change 15 were the main causes of ecosystem damage in sistan impacts of global warming on terrestrial ecosystems and soil acidification were 29 and 41 higher than that in sari by increasing the fertilizer levels from sc 100 to sc 250 and from sp 80 to sp 220 the role of global warming in the ecosystem increased by 17 and 13 respectively the resource costs were lower for sp 80 and sc 180 than for the other fertilizer levels sc 250 and sp 160 were also the most expensive fertilizer levels the average cost of resources used in sistan was 3 8 higher than in sari fossil resource scarcity contributed the most 99 to the creation of resource costs the fossil fuels and chemical fertilizers generally had negative environmental effects 3 5 technical and economic assessment the values of water productivity wp nitrogen use efficiency nue and economic productivity ep under different fertilizer levels are presented in table 7 the highest nue was observed in sc 100 34 6 kg kg 1 and sp 80 27 4 kg kg 1 as fertilizer consumption increased in sc 180 and sc 250 the nue decreased by 37 and 50 respectively compared to sc 100 for sp 160 and sp 220 these values decreased by 41 and 51 respectively compared to sp 80 generally the nue in sistan was 30 lower than that in sari in contrast more application of urea fertilizer improved economic and wp indicators the lowest wp indicators included wpip wpi and wpet were related to sp 80 0 20 0 20 and 0 14 kg m 3 and sc 100 0 52 1 69 and 0 84 kg m 3 increasing the application of urea fertilizer in sp 220 and sc 250 increased the wpip 30 and 23 wpi 40 and 25 and wpet 43 and 24 compared to sp 80 and sc 100 respectively on average wp in sistan was 43 lower in fertilizer treatments than in sari also the ep of sc 250 and sp 220 were higher than that of the other fertilizer treatments the bpd and nbpd in sc 250 were 0 15 and 0 14 m 3 respectively according to ep indices sp 220 was 51 more productive than sp 80 overall the increase of 140 and 150 kg ha 1 of urea fertilizer consumption in sistan and sari compared to the minimum levels increased the farmers income by 248 and 327 h 1 respectively according to permanova analysis there was a significant difference p 0 05 in the technical and economic indices in sari and sistan table 8 also the results of statistical analysis showed that there was a significant difference between urea fertilizer levels in terms of nue bpd and bcr indices p 0 05 while no significant difference was found between fertilizer levels in wp indices p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 aquacrop model the aquacrop model successfully estimated the grain yield in arid and humid regions there was a difference in the accuracy of grain yield estimation between the two regions the model showed higher accuracy in a humid climate sari than in an arid climate sistan some previous studies have shown that environmental conditions affect grain yield estimation vanuytrecht et al 2014 xing et al 2017 it was shown that in water stress conditions such that may happen under arid weather conditions the model estimated crop yield with a greater deviation from their actual amounts due to the sensitivity of aquacrop to water adeboye et al 2021 additionally the model could simulate grain yield under fertility stress van gaelen et al 2015 however these conditions decrease the simulation accuracy adeboye et al 2021 reported that the lowest modeling accuracy was observed in the highest soil fertility stress n0 adeboye et al 2021 also the simulated grain yield in both regions was higher than the actual yield other investigations reported an overestimation of the crop yield akumaga et al 2017 iqbal et al 2014 khoshravesh et al 2013 because the model was developed for ideal conditions which cannot be achieved in practice improper fertilization timing and environmental stress can affect grain yield akumaga et al 2017 the model predicted acceptable performance in two regions based on the evaluation indicators asseng et al 2013 recommended a maximum of 13 5 for allowing changes to crop model performance during the calibration stage asseng et al 2013 which is consistent with the results of this study furthermore the nrsme values obtained in this research were within the range of previous studies on wheat modeling iqbal et al 2014 mkhabela and bullock 2012 considering that agricultural models are recommended to have nrsme values greater than 0 7 nielsen et al 2010 the model was highly efficient in this regard as well additionally the ef rate confirmed the model s high efficiency in estimating crop yield the ef index was 0 92 for wheat yield simulation using aquacrop in china xing et al 2017 and in this study it was 0 94 on average 4 2 environmental impact according to our findings crop yield per unit area had a decisive impact on the release of pollutants into air soil and water therefore the lowest wheat yields were associated with the highest emissions compared with the minimum levels the amount of emissions from the farm for sp 220 and sc 250 decreased by 27 and 19 respectively a different trend of pollutant changes was observed compared to the consumption of urea fertilizer thus the consumption of urea fertilizer was positively correlated with the emission of n2o nh3 and no3 and negatively correlated with the emission of co2 and fine particulate formation emission of co2 in the air at the farm level is generally caused due to consumption of diesel fossil fuel in agricultural machinery mousavi awal et al 2017 ipcc 2006 due to the low grain yield at low levels of fertilizer application in each region the input efficiency also decreased in the same proportion and the highest amount of pollutant in this sector was related to the lowest amount of fertilizer also the emission of n2o nh3 and no3 has a direct relationship with the amount of urea fertilizer used brentrup et al 2004 ipcc 2006 therefore at the maximum levels of fertilizer with the increase in the use of nitrogen fertilizer the emission of these gases increased in the same proportion similar results similar have been reported in some previous studies eagle et al 2017 brentrup et al 2004 in sp 220 and sc 250 co2 emissions were reduced by 33 and 24 respectively compared with the minimum urea fertilizer levels according to our results sp 80 and sc 100 have co2 emissions of 142 4 and 104 5 kg respectively the decreasing trend of co2 emissions with the application of 80 and 160 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer has also been reported in a previous study kumar et al 2021 biswas et al 2010 reported that wheat production in australia released 107 kg of co2 into the atmosphere conversely in humid and arid climates every 10 kg of urea increased n2o emissions by 7 1 and 6 6 respectively similarly eagle et al 2017 reported that 10 kg of urea fertilizer increased n2o emissions by 7 the results indicated that urea application at maximum levels can increase n2o losses by 0 26 kg compared with minimum levels kumar et al 2021 determined that n fertilizer applied at 240 kg ha 1 produced 0 36 kg of n2o emission which was 0 08 kg more than the emission of 100 kg ha 1 n fertilizer additionally sp 220 and sc 250 increased nh3 and no3 losses by 100 compared to minimum urea fertilizer levels previous studies have reported increased losses of ammonia and nitrate with higher nitrogen consumption eagle et al 2017 hojjati et al 2019 pan et al 2020 brentrup et al 2004 observed a 92 increase in nh3 losses in the 100 kg h 1 n fertilizer compared to the control according to our results the trend of global warming changes has a positive relationship with the amount of urea fertilizer consumption thus sp 220 and sc 250 increased global warming by 13 and 17 compared to minimum levels higher global warming potential in the arid climate was mainly due to lower wheat yield than in the humid climate some reports have also cited nitrogen fertilizer as the main cause of global warming eagle et al 2017 holka and bieńkowski 2020 in a study the consumption of 50 kg ha 1 urea fertilizer led to 35 more global warming than the control treatment kumar et al 2021 also different studies have reported global warming rates for wheat of 385 biswas et al 2010 390 holka and bieńkowski 2020 and 450 kg co2 eq pishgar komleh et al 2020 global warming of 318 and 585 kg co2 eq was reported in the north and northwest of iran respectively fallahpour et al 2012 hojjati et al 2019 the pollution released into the air also affects the soil nh3 so2 and nox pollutants released from urea fertilizer and diesel fuel lead to terrestrial acidification gonzález garcía et al 2021 van zelm et al 2016 the terrestrial acidification response to fertilizer application in humid climates has followed an increasing pattern the maximum amount of terrestrial acidification potential was in sp 160 1 18 kg so2 eq and sc 250 0 85 kg so2 eq according to kumar et al 2021 nitrogen fertilizer applications of 160 180 kg ha 1 resulted in the highest acidification level with 1 95 so2 eq unlike kumar et al 2021 our study did not consider the transportation of input sources resulting in decreased terrestrial acidification in addition to changing the terrestrial acidification the pollutants caused terrestrial ecotoxicity this study found no particular relationship between terrestrial ecotoxicity and urea consumption however it has been reported that doubling nitrogen fertilizer during the wheat production increases terrestrial ecotoxicity by 50 charles et al 2006 ultimately these environmental effects result in land use changes and prevent the survival of other organisms and plants on land land use change has a direct relationship with urea fertilizer consumption thus the treatments with the maximum use of urea fertilizer had the highest amount of land use change in arid 14 9 m2a crop eq and humid 9 5 m2a crop eq climates our results were higher than the study by shrestha et al 2020 that obtained the amount of land use for wheat production in south dakota of 6 4 m2a crop eq this difference is related to the higher consumption of urea and potassium fertilizers in our research compared to the previous study terrestrial ecosystem degradation eventually leads to the pollution of water resources acid rain results when nh3 so2 nox and n2o gases are emitted into the atmosphere di and cameron 2002 deposition of these pollutants leads to acidification of agricultural soil and groundwater resources van zelm et al 2016 also part of the eutrophication of water resources is caused by the reduction of water infiltration into the soil due to the destruction of the soil structure and the creation of runoff this runoff washes plant nutrients from the soil and discharges them into rivers or marine systems huang et al 2017 the use of urea fertilizers contributes significantly to the polluting of fresh water and marine ecosystems on an average 13 2 of nitrogen used in our study entered water resources as nitrate the amount of nitrogen leaching from urea fertilizers contributed approximately 51 to freshwater eutrophication alternatively freshwater eutrophication is linked to phosphate fertilizers to an extent of 28 previous studies have reported that nitrogen fertilizer leaching rates of 3 54 depending on the method and type of fertilizer used charles et al 2006 huang et al 2017 also 30 of the eutrophication potential was attributed to phosphate fertilizers holka et al 2016 in addition to urea chemical pesticides were another factor that affected the environmental impacts the amount of pesticides used in wheat fields in the humid climate was 1 81 kg ha 1 as reported by holka et al 2016 2 3 kg ha 1 of chemical pesticides were used in wheat fields in poland also chemical pesticides have been used on wheat farms in the mediterranean climate at a rate of 2 3 kg ha 1 syp et al 2012 pesticides were used at lower levels in this study than in other studies chemical pesticides had the lowest impact on environmental indicators with an average of less than 4 4 3 technical and economic efficiency this analysis revealed that n fertilizer input significantly increased wheat yield and resource use efficiency compared to n0 sp 220 and sc 250 increased crop yield by 1 2 and 2 0 t ha 1 respectively the findings of this study were supported in a recent research liu et al 2020 overall the yield increase per kg applied urea fertilizer in humid climate was 40 higher than that in arid climate it was shown that n fertilizer has a greater effect on wheat yield in the humid climate because there is less water requirement more rainfall and favorable weather conditions for wheat growth li et al 2022a thus weather conditions can explain the difference in wheat yields nue could also be decreased by high levels of n fertilizer due to more significant losses rathore et al 2017 nitrogen fertilizer application and yield increase do not follow a linear relationship and after at an optimal point increasing fertilizer application decreases yield arduini et al 2006 furthermore only 40 of the n fertilizer in wheat production is absorbed and consumed nassiri and koocheki 2014 the highest nue was obtained in sc 100 at 34 67 kg kg 1 belete et al 2018 showed that the highest and lowest nue were 38 2 and 4 6 kg kg 1 for 120 and 360 kg fertilizer respectively belete et al 2018 several other factors can affect the nue including planting time fertilizer distribution weather condition soil type and crop type li et al 2022a the average production of wheat in iran which is one of the countries with an arid climate is 2 5 t ha 1 in contrast regions with humid climate such as europe china and mexico have an average wheat production of 5 7 5 8 and 6 1 t ha 1 respectively also wheat production in afghanistan pakistan and ethiopia is 2 1 2 93 and 2 85 t ha 1 respectively usda 2022 the consumption of chemical fertilizers in the world varies considerably while its amount in iran is less than 100 kg ha 1 it is estimated to be 170 in european countries such as france and italy and 155 and 380 kg ha 1 in the asian countries of pakistan and china respectively worldbank 2019 a positive correlation was observed between wp and economic indices with urea fertilizer consumption it was found that wp was highest in treatments with a maximum amount of urea additionally previous studies have shown that nitrogen addition increases wp cossani and sadras 2018 li et al 2022b the wp indicator was considerably higher in the humid climate than that in arid climate the most significant difference was related to wpi in sc 250 compared with sp 220 the maximum wpi in arid climate was also 0 28 kg m 3 in arid climate regions of iran such as the center and east the wp of wheat has been reported 1 41 and 0 6 kg m 3 respectively shirmohamm and afshin 2020 vazifedoust et al 2008 compared to previous studies the arid climate is experiencing high evapotranspiration 4500 mm and low rainfall 55 mm resulting in higher water irrigation demand and reduced wpi conversely n fertilizer application in an arid climate leads to greater water extraction and increases the risk of drought stress herwaarden et al 1998 it has also been reported that limited water availability and n fertilizer application reduced wheat yields in australia sadras et al 2016 the main variable of economic productivity was the difference in wheat yield with urea fertilizer application plants cannot always absorb fertilizers completely so using more fertilizers reduces yield to cost ratios a study found that the application of nitrogen fertilizer up to 190 kg ha 1 for wheat cultivation increased revenue however the application of more fertilizer decreased the revenue pan et al 2020 although the application of more nitrogen in agricultural lands leads to an increase in production productivity this is not a linear relationship and there is an optimal economic application belete et al 2018 therefore by increasing the use of nitrogen from a certain level the economic efficiency decreases and the increase in yield does not respond to the additional cost of chemical fertilizers excess nitrogen losses also leads to significant direct economic losses especially when nitrogen fertilizer costs are high to farmers and to the environment gruber and galloway 2008 the average economic productivity in arid and humid climates was 6 3 and 7 6 kg 1 respectively it was reported that the economic productivity of wheat in the east and north of iran was 5 11 sahabi et al 2016 and 7 38 kg 1 respectively amoozad khalili et al 2020 our results showed that humid climate is more suitable for wheat production in iran than arid region we are aware of the importance of managing the timing rates and placement of urea fertilizer distribution however our study is limited owing to a paucity of such data thus broader interpretations should be made with caution additionally we acknowledge that different wheat cultivars may exhibit different response patterns to different levels of urea fertilization 5 limitations and uncertainties variability and uncertainty will exist in any assessment the sources of error and uncertainty of this study include the use of a limited number of questionnaires randomly from the study areas the use of a semi quantitative method to apply fertilizer stress in the estimation of the grain yield and the different management of agricultural inputs among farmers semi quantitative tools have low computational requirements compared to quantitative techniques mwiya 2003 however the tools contain more potential uncertainty compared to quantitative techniques even in situations where standard terminology is used uncertainty due to observation and interpretation still exists mwiya 2003 the collected data may also have uncertainty due to random errors in measurement or sampling methods or systemic biases in measurements to reduce this uncertainty in research results strategies such as increasing the number of the statistical population verifying the validity of the collected data under pilot condition and applying quantitative models in product estimation can be considered in studies 6 conclusions in this study the environmental and economic sustainability of wheat cultivation in arid and humid climates was evaluated based on the results 75 8 of the total environmental impacts were caused by off farm activities also global warming and the formation of fine particulates were the most important environmental impacts under different management of urea fertilizer a large portion of the environmental damage was caused by the consumption of urea fertilizer and diesel fuel nitrogen fertilizer application at maximum levels compared to the minimum levels improved production efficiency in arid 38 and humid 24 climates the increase in crop yield performance improved the productivity of resources per unit area and as a result reduced the emission of pollutants thus urea fertilizer consumption at minimum levels with lower crop yields was associated with the highest levels of human health damage however the environmental impacts of marine eutrophication and ozone layer depletion were the most sensitive to the increase in urea fertilizer although increasing urea fertilizer had adverse effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems it improved farmers income and water productivity in arid 34 and 37 and humid 24 and 25 climates additionally wheat cultivation in an arid climate requires more appropriate management strategies according to the results using more inputs to achieve high crop yield does not always lead to more environmental degradation therefore an appropriate strategy for reducing agricultural production s environmental impact is to increase the resource efficiency through higher crop yields per unit area for regions with different climates this integrated model can be used to estimate the consumption of agricultural inputs also changing the approach of managers in the macro planning of agricultural management from an economy oriented perspective to a comprehensive one relying on environmental issues is another positive aspect of using this model this approach is especially important in the regions of the world where there are subsidized distribution policies for chemical fertilizers and agricultural inputs the sustainability of agricultural production based on environmental issues leads to sustainable development and in the long term leads to food security considering social indicators along with technical and economic indicators can provide more efficient strategies for stainable development of the agricultural sector also to select appropriate levels of different inputs using the integrated model developed in this research mathematical models and hierarchical analysis can be used to weight the indicators declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

9174,increasing chemical inputs to improve food security has resulted in worrying environmental consequences recently significant efforts have been made to reduce the environmental impacts of the food supply chain the current study examined the effects of different levels of urea fertilizer on the technical economic and environmental aspects of wheat production in arid and humid climates a questionnaire was used to collect data on wheat cultivation in the 2019 and 2020 crop seasons the calibrated and validated aquacrop model was applied to simulate crop yield under different urea fertilizer levels of 80 160 and 220 kg ha 1 in arid climate and 100 180 and 250 kg ha 1 in humid climate economic productivity water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency indicators was used to assess the economic and technical sustainability of different cropping systems the environmental impacts was investigated by using the life cycle assessment lca approach involving the recipe 2016 method covering 18 midpoints and three endpoint indicators respectively the most important midpoint categories from foreground background analysis were global warming fine particulate matter formation and terrestrial acidification additionally 75 of the total environmental damage was related to the background system on average considering different fertilizer treatments wheat cultivation in the arid climate had a 9 higher environmental damage potential than the humid climate nitrogen played the most significant role in midpoint categories followed by diesel the most appropriate urea fertilizer level in the arid climate compared to the corresponding level in the humid climate increased human health ecosystem and resources by 14 3 12 5 and 3 2 respectively and decreased water and economic productivity by 375 and 8 respectively based on the results combining lca with technical and economic indicators provides an appropriate method for prioritizing the cultivation of different crops in each county keywords aquacrop environmental damage global warming life cycle assessment water productivity data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction due to the growth of the world s population and the demand for agricultural products modern agriculture has led to many negative effects on the planet s ecosystems therefore according to the goals of food security in 2050 the amount of food produced should double with environmentally sustainable solutions mujeeb kazi et al 2019 ramírez gonzález et al 2018 wheat plays an essential role in providing food security for the growing population it is expected that the wheat demand to increase by 60 by 2050 gómez et al 2021 indicating its production will rise from 757 million tons in 2019 fao 2019 to more than 900 million tons in 2050 rosegrant et al 2009 over the past few years most efforts have been devoted to increasing yield per unit area through increasing the use of fertilizers darzi naftchali and mokhtassi bidgoli 2022 if the current trend continues with the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides while ignoring sustainability aspects the cumulative environmental effects will result in a crisis in the future tigchelaar et al 2018 to achieve sustainability in food production it is necessary to change the current methods of food production due to existing inefficiencies ali et al 2016 tariq et al 2018 a review of various studies shows many concerns regarding the increase in the consumption of chemical fertilizers and their negative effects on the environment ai qasi et al 2021 eagle et al 2017 additionally the inefficient irrigation management decreases water productivity and aggravates the environmental effects of the use of chemical fertilizers zhu et al 2018 to compensate for the low water productivity indiscriminate use of groundwater fang et al 2010 leads to the leaching of more fertilizers phosphates and nitrates and more pollution of water resources ju et al 2004 hence agricultural sustainability depends on the balance between food security and environmental protection ipcc 2019 although the application of n fertilizer improves crop performance mosongo et al 2022 excessive amounts can lead to significant environmental damage nitrogen fertilizers account for 63 of all fertilizers consumed with more than half of them being consumed in asia fao 2010 nitrogen fertilizer consumption for wheat production globally averages 98 kg ha 1 west et al 2014 approximately 60 of the n fertilizer used in agricultural fields is out of reach of the plant roots due to evaporation leaching and remaining in the soil after harvesting azad et al 2020 west et al 2014 additionally excessive n losses result in significant economic losses for farmers and environmental damage gruber and galloway 2008 also in order to fully benefit from co2 in the future climate change additional nitrogen and other fertilizers are needed abbass et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to manage the levels of n fertilizer consumption for sustainable production anderson et al 2008a to compensate for the environmental effects caused by the consumption of this fertilizer solutions such as optimizing fertilizer consumption pishgar komleh et al 2020 cultivating organic crops meisterling et al 2009 using nitrogen fixing products and applying organic fertilizers yao et al 2017 are suggested additionally in europe the sustainability of agricultural systems is pursued by implementing the green deal strategy through integrated actions based on sustainable practices in terms of both environment and economy simoniello et al 2022 many efforts have been made to genetically modify cereals including wheat to evolve from annual cultivars to permanent cultivars perennial plants have less environmental impact than annual cultivars gómez and rodríguez 2022 management tools for nitrogen fertilizer have been developed on the basis of improving crop yields but the complex effects of n fertilizer application and its role in damaging the environment are often ignored therefore for a more rational evaluation of n fertilizer consumption a new attitude and integrated application of different indicators are required oecd 2001 different methods and indicators including life cycle assessment lca are used to assess the sustainability of cultivation systems taki et al 2018 however the lca analyzes every stage of product production although social and economic factors are not considered in the analysis of environmental effects morero et al 2015 this concept has been considered suitable for evaluating agriculture s environmental impacts by many researchers canaj et al 2020 taki et al 2018 zhixiang and xing 2020 previous studies have found that n fertilizer and diesel fuel are the most important factors affecting the environment brentrup et al 2004 shrestha et al 2020 taki et al 2018 in various reports different effects of these sources on environmental indicators have been stated such as terrestrial acidification and global warming brentrup et al 2004 the depletion of fossil resources and terrestrial acidification wang et al 2007 depletion of minerals and eutrophication hojjati et al 2019 freshwater ecotoxicity terrestrial acidification and eutrification pourmehdi and kheiralipour 2020 terrestrial acidification eutrophication and global warming and depletion of phosphate resources and eutrification taghinejad and vahedi 2021 during the wheat production period have been mentioned as the most vulnerable environmental indicators additionally the rate of fertilizer consumption can influence each environmental indicator previous research on nitrogen fertilizer management has focused on its direct effects and positive aspects while the related indirect environmental damage has been neglected additionally geographical location has a significant influence on environmental impacts canaj et al 2020 dias et al 2017 regional characterization of environmental impacts which leads to a more realistic and balanced picture of agricultural practices and their potential impacts on the environment has also been neglected in previous studies accordingly this study was designed i to assess technical economic and environmental aspects of wheat production ii to identify the main processes of environmental effects in the background and foreground systems the foreground system includes all direct emissions resulting from the consumption of input resources at the farm level and the background system includes the emission of pollutants resulting from the extraction and production of input resources iii to evaluate the effect of different levels of urea fertilizer on the environmental impacts water and economic productivity and iv to compare the impact of climate conditions on the environmental impacts water and economic productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in two regions of sari 36 56 n 53 05 e 42 m above sea level in the north of iran and sistan 31 03 n 61 49 e 483 m above sea level in the southeast of iran fig 1 according to dumarten s climate classification these regions have humid and arid climates respectively and are an indicative of these two climates of the country according to the 20 year statistics of dasht e naz meteorological station in sari the average annual precipitation of the region is 573 mm the average temperature is 16 4 c and the average annual evaporation is 1002 4 mm based on the 35 year statistics of the zabol meteorological station in sistan the average annual precipitation of this region is 55 mm the maximum temperature is 50 c the average relative humidity is 30 and the average annual evaporation is 4500 mm 2 2 cropping data a questionnaire was used to collect information on wheat production 2019 2020 growing seasons including the cultivated area crop yield inputs fertilizer electricity fossil fuel labor chemical pesticides agricultural machinery and water consumption and costs of different production operations information about wheat cultivation and consumption of agricultural inputs were collected by completing a questionnaire and the ministry of jihad agriculture to determine the sample size random sampling method was used as follows snedecor and cochran 1980 1 n n t 2 s 2 n d 2 t 2 s 2 where n refers to population size t is the confidence level s is the variance d is the optimal probability and n is the sample size based on the wheat cultivated area in sari 9790 ha and sistan 38 500 ha anon 2020 the sample size in each region was 192 and 273 ha respectively considering the average cropping area of each wheat farmer in the country 5 ha statistical center of iran 2015 the number of questionnaires in sari and sistan was selected as 38 and 55 respectively 2 3 aquacrop model aquacrop6 1 a plant growth simulation model developed by fao for simulating plant growth stages and yields raes et al 2009 was used to simulate wheat yield the model requires six input files including climate data plant data soil data management data irrigation information and initial soil water conditions the required climatic data include maximum and minimum daily temperature precipitation carbon dioxide co2 concentration in the atmosphere and potential evaporation and transpiration eto the climate data were prepared from the synoptic weather stations of dasht e naz and zabol also the data were used to estimate eto using the fao penman monteith method allan et al 1998 aquacrop also provides emission values for 1902 2099 which were used for existing conditions the soil types were silty clay and sandy loam in sari and sistan respectively the height values related to these soil texture values on saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat saturated volume moisture ɵsat field capacity fc and wilting point pwp were used for simulations additionally plant data which include two sets of fixed parameters and user specific data were used in this model the default values in the model were adopted for fixed parameters the user specific parameters include planting date planting density canopy cover cc max canopy cover ccx crown cover growth factor cgc crown cover reduction factor cdc depth of root development water productivity wp and harvest index hi nutrient cycles in the soil are not explicitly considered in aquacrop however soil fertility stress is determined using a semi quantitative assessment raes et al 2012 to simulate crop growth under fertilizer stress conditions in this method reductions of cc and wp should be calibrated based on crop type climate and soil conditions the relative biomass brel ccx and the decline canopy cover during the growing season which is qualitatively introduced to the model were entered into the model as input parameters for two treatments under the greatest fertilizer stress field stress and no stress reference field this method shows that fertilizer stress reduces evaporation and transpiration and the amount of crop yield the model uses coefficients including ksccx soil fertilizer stress coefficient for maximum canopy expansion ksexp f fertilizer stress coefficient for canopy expansion and kswp fertilizer stress coefficient for reducing water productivity in addition the model uses the fcdecline coefficient for the daily decline of canopy cover after reaching ccx in conditions without fertility stress fcdecline is zero and in conditions of 100 fertility stress this factor is assumed equal to 1 therefore this coefficient varies between 0 fcdecline 1 per day also the wp coefficient calculated by the model was recalibrated under fertility stress conditions cgc and ccx coefficients are also modified for soil fertility using ksexp f and ksccx coefficients ks coefficients are considered one and close to the minimum theoretical value 0 for non fertility and in 100 stress conditions respectively finally based on brel ccx and recalibrated values the model automatically determines each of the ks curves raes et al 2012 the fields in the study areas were under flood irrigation in sistan irrigation was done four times at a time interval of 35 days supplemental irrigation was practiced in sari in two times during flowering and grain filling stages the amount of irrigation water in certain field in the agricultural research centres were measured using parshall flume which were used in this research due to the model sensitivity on water input as the main factor limiting crop growth adeboye et al 2021 data from 2019 with higher rainfall or lower water stress were used for calibration parameters of the model are classified as conservative or non conservative adeboye et al 2021 unlike conservative parameters non conservative parameters are affected by management and environmental factors non conservative parameters such as planting date growth stage and plant density are derived from observations and measurements conservative parameters cgc cdc and wp are provided as default values in the model model default values are used when measurement of certain parameters is impossible during experimental studies the performance of the model is generally improved by adjusting conservative parameters in the given location sandhu and irmak 2019 the cgc and cdc parameters in the model were generated using observed wheat phenological stages using a trial and error approach fine tuning was performed until the model output grain yields matched the observation the calibration procedure was performed with the data of soil fertility stress a simulation of the crop response to soil fertility stress was performed after calibrating the model the soil fertility was also calibrated for nitrogen levels of maximum stress n0 medium stress and no fertility stress thus the treatment without fertility stress was considered a reference and the maximum fertility stress treatment was considered stress treatment in the model the input data in the calibration process are tabulated in table 1 an important step in model verification is validation which consists of comparing field measurements grain yields with model outputs iqbal et al 2014 validation was conducted using the crop parameters obtained from model calibration by using independent data sets of 2020 from treatments n0 n150 n250 from sari and n0 n100 n220 from sistan the reliability of the aquacrop model was evaluated based on mean square normalized error nrsme model efficiency ef compatibility index d and residual mass coefficient crm nash and sutcliffe 1970 soler et al 2007 2 n rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 1 2 100 x 3 n rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 1 2 100 x 4 ef i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 5 d 1

measured parameter nrmse is the difference between the simulated and observed data compared to the average of the observed data in this index values 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 are classified as excellent good fair and poor respectively the ef index indicates the degree of agreement between the observation and prediction charts with the 1 1 line its values also vary from 1 to negative infinity meanwhile an ef value of 1 corresponds to a perfect fit the d index has values from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates complete agreement between simulated and observed data and 0 indicates no agreement also positive and negative values of crm indicate underestimation and overestimation of product performance respectively moriasi et al 2007 2 4 management scenarios the calibrated and validated aquacrop was then applied to assess wheat yield under different fertilization scenarios the average rate fertilization in each region was determined using collected questionnaires and technical instructions from agricultural and natural resources research centers to analyze the response of crop yield to different levels of urea fertilizer three levels of fertilization were applied to the model based on the considered fertilizer levels the application of a stress level minimum fertilization and a consumption level higher than the average rate maximum fertilization were considered according to each area in this regard the minimum and maximum levels of urea fertilizer consumption were obtained using past local studies kamali and shahabiyan 2021 sepidehdam and ramroudi 2016 therfore three fertilizer levels were used for sari city 100 180 and 250 kg ha 1 sc 100 sc 180 sc 250 and 80 160 and 220 kg ha 1 sp 80 sp 160 sp 220 of urea fertilizer for sistan plain 2 5 economical and technical sustainability the economic and technical indicators were calculated based on the grain yield calculated using the aquacrop model in the considered fertilizer scenarios the economical sustainability of wheat production was assessed using gross profit per unit volume of water bpd net profit per unit volume of water nbpd and benefit to cost ratio bcr indices kijne et al 2003 7 bpd gm i p 8 nbpd nm i p 9 bcr gm tp where p is the amount of precipitation m3 ha 1 and i is the amount of irrigation m3 ha 1 gm and nm are gross and net profit from wheat production ha 1 y is grain yield kg ha 1 and tp is the total cost of production ha 1 also irrigation and rainwater productivity wpi p irrigation productivity wpi and evapotranspiration productivity wpet were analyzed as technical indices kijne et al 2003 10 wp i p y i p 11 wp i y i 12 wp et y et where et is evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 the nitrogen usage efficiency nue was also calculated based on dividing the grain yield by the amount of cumulative urea fertilizer applied kg kg 1 throughout the growing season lyu et al 2021 finally to investigate the difference of environmental impacts economic and water productivity we used multivariate analysis of variance significant expressions p 0 05 were analysed using the paired comparison test with the monte carlo test statistic statistical analyses were performed using the permanova routine in the primer v6 computer program clarke and gorley 2006 including the permanova extension package anderson et al 2008b 2 6 environmental sustainability a life cycle assessment lca was used to assess the environmental sustainability of wheat production systems this method includes collecting and evaluating the inputs outputs and potential environmental consequences of the final production of a product throughout its life cycle each lca study has four stages determining the goal and scope of the study life cycle audit lci impact assessment lcia and interpretation georgiopoulou and lyberatos 2018 2 6 1 goal functional units and system boundaries the goal definition is the first step of lca nabavi pelesaraei et al 2018 in this research work two study areas are considered for evaluating lca environmental damages including sari and sistan whose comparison was one of the main objectives an essential concept in lca is the functional unit which refers to a reference unit for inventory data in other words it is the unit by which the performance of a production system is quantified in accordance with iso 14040 iso 0 1404 2008 in this research the functional unit was considered one ton of grain wheat in fig 2 the system boundary is the farm gate 2 6 2 input analysis inventory lci all inputs and outputs related to wheat production including resource consumption energy consumption and pollution emissions were collected at this stage a total of two data sets are required for this step including foreground and background data nabavi pelesaraei et al 2017 the foreground includes all direct emissions resulting from the consumption of input resources for wheat production at the field level which leads to the entry of these pollutants into water soil and air also the background includes the emissions of pollutants caused by the production of inputs to the farm the specifications of various cultivation operations and input sources for wheat production are presented in tables 2 and 3 respectively irrigation water in sistan and sari is supplied through surface and groundwater resources respectively irrigation water quality in the study areas was classified by the wilcox index in c3s1 range homayon nejad et al 2015 it also classified chemical fertilizer emissions pesticide emissions and diesel consumption in agricultural machinery the emission of pollutants caused by diesel combustion were calculated using the u s lci database 2015 also the release of toxins into the air and soil the leaching of phosphate and nitrate dinitrogen monoxide n2o ammonia nh3 resulting from the use of chemical fertilizers the release of nitrogen oxide nox resulting from the use of nitrogen fertilizers into the air ipcc 2006 and carbon dioxide co2 caused by human activities in the air mousavi avval et al 2017 also heavy metals released into the soil due to the use of chemical fertilizers have been estimated based on previous studies durlinger et al 2015 mousavi avval et al 2017 the ecoinvent version 3 6 database was also used to calculate other pollutants the yield obtained was the basis for calculating the emissions of pollutants caused by the consumption of input resources to produce one ton of wheat 2 6 3 life cycle impact assessment lcia the lci results were quantitatively analyzed using simapro 9 2 software and the recipe 2016 1 1 methods huijbregts et al 2017 the recipe method addresses 18 environmental concerns at the midpoint level and then aggregates the endpoints into a set of three endpoint categories fig 3 at the midpoint level characteristic factors are located along the impact path but at the endpoint level characteristic factors are located at the end of the impact path in three areas of protection namely human health ecosystem quality and resource scarcity both approaches are complementary since midpoint characterization has a stronger relationship with environmental fluxes and relatively low uncertainty while endpoint characterization provides better insight into the ecological significance of environmental fluxes huijbregts et al 2017 2 6 4 interpretation finally the results of the environmental effects were reviewed and a logical interpretation was presented for each level of urea fertilizer the aquacrop model framework and life cycle assessment steps used for calculations are shown in fig 4 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the aquacrop model the performance of the model during calibration and validation is shown in table 4 the estimated grain yields varied from 2 37 to 4 63 t ha 1 in sari and from 1 74 to 3 14 t ha 1 in sistan indicating that the grain yield was significantly affected by soil fertility the values of nrsme ranged from 7 43 to 13 32 which are considered good for the model also values of d and ef indices varied in the range of 0 98 0 99 and 0 92 0 98 respectively the calibrated data set for 2019 showed acceptable performance between estimated and measured grain yields for both regions crm values indicate that the model tends to underestimate grain yield under maximum soil fertility stress the soil fertility stress had a negative impact on the accuracy of grain yield simulation accuracy based on these results the simulation in sari was more accurate than in sistan in the validation stage the values of ef 0 92 0 96 indicate perfect consistency between estimated and measured data nrmse values calculated for sari and sistan ranged from 8 43 to 11 52 and 9 63 14 62 at different n fertilizer levels respectively the performance of aquacrop decreased with increasing soil fertility stress so that the lowest accuracy was observed for n0 however the model simulated the grain yield more accurately in non stress treatments n250 and n220 nrmse 8 43 ef 0 96 d 0 99 in sari and nrmse 9 63 ef 0 95 d 0 99 in sisatan the results suggest that the grain yield of wheat can be predicted with good reliability using the aquacrop model 3 2 output analysis the emission rate of various pollutants are presented in table 5 for the production of on ton of wheat the highest amount of co2 emission was related to the sc 100 and sp 80 scenarios 104 5 and 142 4 kg respectively co2 emission in sistan was on average 31 higher than that in sari the highest amount of n2o emission in sc 250 and sp 220 was 0 46 and 0 59 kg respectively increasing the use of urea fertilizer in sc 250 compared to sc 100 led to a double increase in n2o emission the emission of n2o was 27 higher in sistan than in sari on average there was a direct relationship between the amount of urea consumption and nh3 emission thus the highest nh3 emission was related to sc 250 3 23 kg and sp 220 4 18 kg treatments the emission of nh3 increased by 0 13 and 0 19 kg for every 10 kg increase in urea fertilizer applied in sari and sistan the amount of nox emission in sistan was 29 higher than that in sari same as the pattern observed for the other greenhouse gases the highest emission of nox occurred for the minimum levels of urea sc 100 1 32 kg and sp 80 1 75 kg in both regions nox emission decreased with increasing urea application an increase in urea application increased in nitrate losses entering into so that the highest losses were observed in sc 250 3 54 kg and sp 220 4 57 kg according to the results every 10 kg of urea fertilizer applied increased nitrate leaching by 0 14 kg in sari and 0 20 kg in sistan the average amount of nitrate leachingin sistan was 28 higher than that in sari the nitrate leaching rate varied among treatments from 12 to 15 of applied nitrogen additionally the rate of urea application affected the release of heavy metals into the soil the highest contamination of heavy metals in the soil was observed for sc 250 and sp 220 the amount of heavy metal pollution in sistan was 25 higher than that in sari the lowest and highest concentrations of heavy metals were related to mercury and lead respectively the lead content of the soil was 87 of the total heavy metals added by chemical fertilizers 3 3 environmental indicators 3 3 1 human health the influence of various midpoint environmental indicators on human health is shown in fig 5 direct emissions from the farms were the most significant factor in sistan the lowest and highest amount of global warming were observed for sp 80 501 9 kg co2 eq and sp 220 567 2 kg co2 eq in terms of co2 eq the values for sc 100 and sc 250 were 47 and 26 less than the sp 220 respectively urea fertilizer contributed 14 to global warming in sp 80 while it contributed 26 to global warming in sp 220 due to an increase in fertilizer consumption similarly sc 100 and sc 250 contribute 15 and 25 to global warming respectively the amount of co2 eq in sistan and sari increased by an average of 2 57 and 1 80 kg per kilogram of urea fertilizer consumed generally sistan is affected by global warming 29 more than sari the urea fertilizer application directly correlated with ozone layer depletion the emissions from the farms played a significant role in ozone depletion the highest amount of degradation occurred for sc 250 0 004 kg cfc11 eq and sp 220 0 003 kg cfc11 eq sistan had a 34 higher ozone depletion potential than sari per kg of fertilizer consumed the increase in ozone concentration is also linked to other activities outside the farms in sistan and sari urea fertilizer contributed 33 and 30 respectively to the total ozone depletion overall the ozone formation potential in sistan was 41 higher than that in sari human health is also affected by the dispersion indicators of the fine particulate matter formation a large portion of this indicator can be attributed to farming activities the results showed that the changing trend of this index was decreasing and its highest values were observed at the minimum fertilizer application level thus sp 80 and sc 100 treatments showed the maximum dispersion of fine particles with 0 28 and 0 20 kg pm2 5 eq respectively the distribution of fine particulate matter formation in sistan was 24 higher than that in sari chemical fertilizers and electricity production also affected carcinogenic toxicity in sistan 72 of the carcinogenic toxicity was related to the production of the three fertilizers nitrogen phosphate and potash urea fertilizer contributed to 34 of the carcinogenic toxicity twice as much as other fertilizers in sari the contribution of urea fertilizer was 28 on average with an increase in fertilizer consumption in sari carcinogenic toxicity also showed an upward trend the maximum amount of urea contribution occurred in sp 220 0 098 kg of 1 4 dcb and sc 250 0 080 kg of 1 4 dcb water consumption indirectly affects human health most of the water consumed was used for wheat irrigation the weather in sistan caused more irrigation water for wheat production maximum water consumption was observed at the minimum fertilizer levels 3 3 2 ecosystem quality fig 6 illustrates how each input source contributes to the indicators of ecosystem quality terrestrial acidification was largely influenced by the activities outside the farms and the direct emission was effectively less than 4 the soil acidification potential was the highest in sp 160 1 18 kg so2 eq and sc 250 0 85 kg so2 eq due to the increased use of urea fertilizer terrestrial acidification was also increased in sistan the soil is exposed to terrestrial acidification with an average of 1 16 kg so2 eq 41 more than that in sari besides soil resources freshwater resources are also at risk of environmental degradation input sources in the outside activities are critical for creating the eutrophication of freshwater resources the main source of eutrophication in sistan was phosphate in the sp 80 treatment and urea fertilizer in the sp 160 and sp 220 however in sari urea fertilizer played the most important role in creating this indicator at the fertilizer levels in the fertilizer treatments the urea fertilizer participated in eutrophication by 38 on average the maximum amount of eutrophication in sp 220 and sc 250 were 0 077 and 0 053 kg p eq respectively urea fertilizer has a significant effect on terrestrial ecotoxicity however no differences were observed among the treatments a high correlation was found between ecotoxicity and the consumption of chemical fertilizers that caused soil toxicity in outside farm activities soil toxicity was more elevated in sistan than in sari by 42 the average amount of soil toxicity in sistan and sari was 318 and 224 kg of 1 4 dcb respectively land use change for agriculture is another factor that impacts land ecosystems the production of chemical fertilizers as an indirect emission was the main cause of change in land use change phosphorous and urea fertilizers had the greatest impact on land use among the input sources by increasing the levels of urea fertilizer and increasing the emission of pollutants the contribution of urea fertilizer was also increased the maximum land use was observed in sp 160 15 23 m2 yr crop eq and sc 250 9 55 m2 yr crop eq generally in sistan 67 more land was needed for wheat production than that in sari 3 3 3 resources the contribution of inputs to each impact subcategory of resources is shown in fig 7 the main contributor to the fossil resource scarcity is indirect emissions from outside farm activities at the minimum fertilizer consumption levels diesel fuel was the most important factor in the scarcity of fossil resources however with increasing the use of urea this fertilizer became the main factor contributing to the fossil resource scarcity electricity was also a major resource of the fossil resource scarcity in sari sp 160 and sc 250 had the greatest depletion of fossil resources 120 61 and 100 69 kg oil equivalent respectively sistan used 21 a more fossil fuel than sari the production of chemical fertilizers and agricultural machinery had a significant impact on the mineral resource scarcity phosphorous fertilizer contributes more than the other fertilizers to mineral resource scarcity the average contribution of phosphorous fertilizer was 50 the highest level of mineral resource scarcity was observed in sp 80 2 99 kg cu eq and sc 100 1 62 kg cu eq a decrease in the mineral resource scarcitywas observed with an increase in urea fertilizer levels because of the production of wheat in sistan 76 more mineral resources were evacuated compared to sari 3 4 final damage categories the final environmental effects of different fertilizer treatments on human health ecosystem quality and resources are categorized in table 6 based on human health the minimum urea fertilizer levels had the greatest environmental impact the amounts of sp 80 and sc 100 were 0 00020 and 0 00017 daly respectively for the damage category of human health increasing the use of fertilizers was accompanied by a decrease in the environmental effects of human health human health was affected in sistan by 18 more than that in sari the fine particulate matter formation in the environment caused approximately 70 of the human health damage fig 8 another effective factor on human health was global warming with a contribution of 20 compared to sari sistan had higher health risks due to the fine particles dispersed by the chemical fertilizers and diesel fuel sp 80 and sc 100 had the lowest values in terms of ecosystem quality in contrast sp 220 and sp 250 treatments were the most damaging treatments to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems global warming 37 acidification of soil resources 30 and land use change 15 were the main causes of ecosystem damage in sistan impacts of global warming on terrestrial ecosystems and soil acidification were 29 and 41 higher than that in sari by increasing the fertilizer levels from sc 100 to sc 250 and from sp 80 to sp 220 the role of global warming in the ecosystem increased by 17 and 13 respectively the resource costs were lower for sp 80 and sc 180 than for the other fertilizer levels sc 250 and sp 160 were also the most expensive fertilizer levels the average cost of resources used in sistan was 3 8 higher than in sari fossil resource scarcity contributed the most 99 to the creation of resource costs the fossil fuels and chemical fertilizers generally had negative environmental effects 3 5 technical and economic assessment the values of water productivity wp nitrogen use efficiency nue and economic productivity ep under different fertilizer levels are presented in table 7 the highest nue was observed in sc 100 34 6 kg kg 1 and sp 80 27 4 kg kg 1 as fertilizer consumption increased in sc 180 and sc 250 the nue decreased by 37 and 50 respectively compared to sc 100 for sp 160 and sp 220 these values decreased by 41 and 51 respectively compared to sp 80 generally the nue in sistan was 30 lower than that in sari in contrast more application of urea fertilizer improved economic and wp indicators the lowest wp indicators included wpip wpi and wpet were related to sp 80 0 20 0 20 and 0 14 kg m 3 and sc 100 0 52 1 69 and 0 84 kg m 3 increasing the application of urea fertilizer in sp 220 and sc 250 increased the wpip 30 and 23 wpi 40 and 25 and wpet 43 and 24 compared to sp 80 and sc 100 respectively on average wp in sistan was 43 lower in fertilizer treatments than in sari also the ep of sc 250 and sp 220 were higher than that of the other fertilizer treatments the bpd and nbpd in sc 250 were 0 15 and 0 14 m 3 respectively according to ep indices sp 220 was 51 more productive than sp 80 overall the increase of 140 and 150 kg ha 1 of urea fertilizer consumption in sistan and sari compared to the minimum levels increased the farmers income by 248 and 327 h 1 respectively according to permanova analysis there was a significant difference p 0 05 in the technical and economic indices in sari and sistan table 8 also the results of statistical analysis showed that there was a significant difference between urea fertilizer levels in terms of nue bpd and bcr indices p 0 05 while no significant difference was found between fertilizer levels in wp indices p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 aquacrop model the aquacrop model successfully estimated the grain yield in arid and humid regions there was a difference in the accuracy of grain yield estimation between the two regions the model showed higher accuracy in a humid climate sari than in an arid climate sistan some previous studies have shown that environmental conditions affect grain yield estimation vanuytrecht et al 2014 xing et al 2017 it was shown that in water stress conditions such that may happen under arid weather conditions the model estimated crop yield with a greater deviation from their actual amounts due to the sensitivity of aquacrop to water adeboye et al 2021 additionally the model could simulate grain yield under fertility stress van gaelen et al 2015 however these conditions decrease the simulation accuracy adeboye et al 2021 reported that the lowest modeling accuracy was observed in the highest soil fertility stress n0 adeboye et al 2021 also the simulated grain yield in both regions was higher than the actual yield other investigations reported an overestimation of the crop yield akumaga et al 2017 iqbal et al 2014 khoshravesh et al 2013 because the model was developed for ideal conditions which cannot be achieved in practice improper fertilization timing and environmental stress can affect grain yield akumaga et al 2017 the model predicted acceptable performance in two regions based on the evaluation indicators asseng et al 2013 recommended a maximum of 13 5 for allowing changes to crop model performance during the calibration stage asseng et al 2013 which is consistent with the results of this study furthermore the nrsme values obtained in this research were within the range of previous studies on wheat modeling iqbal et al 2014 mkhabela and bullock 2012 considering that agricultural models are recommended to have nrsme values greater than 0 7 nielsen et al 2010 the model was highly efficient in this regard as well additionally the ef rate confirmed the model s high efficiency in estimating crop yield the ef index was 0 92 for wheat yield simulation using aquacrop in china xing et al 2017 and in this study it was 0 94 on average 4 2 environmental impact according to our findings crop yield per unit area had a decisive impact on the release of pollutants into air soil and water therefore the lowest wheat yields were associated with the highest emissions compared with the minimum levels the amount of emissions from the farm for sp 220 and sc 250 decreased by 27 and 19 respectively a different trend of pollutant changes was observed compared to the consumption of urea fertilizer thus the consumption of urea fertilizer was positively correlated with the emission of n2o nh3 and no3 and negatively correlated with the emission of co2 and fine particulate formation emission of co2 in the air at the farm level is generally caused due to consumption of diesel fossil fuel in agricultural machinery mousavi awal et al 2017 ipcc 2006 due to the low grain yield at low levels of fertilizer application in each region the input efficiency also decreased in the same proportion and the highest amount of pollutant in this sector was related to the lowest amount of fertilizer also the emission of n2o nh3 and no3 has a direct relationship with the amount of urea fertilizer used brentrup et al 2004 ipcc 2006 therefore at the maximum levels of fertilizer with the increase in the use of nitrogen fertilizer the emission of these gases increased in the same proportion similar results similar have been reported in some previous studies eagle et al 2017 brentrup et al 2004 in sp 220 and sc 250 co2 emissions were reduced by 33 and 24 respectively compared with the minimum urea fertilizer levels according to our results sp 80 and sc 100 have co2 emissions of 142 4 and 104 5 kg respectively the decreasing trend of co2 emissions with the application of 80 and 160 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer has also been reported in a previous study kumar et al 2021 biswas et al 2010 reported that wheat production in australia released 107 kg of co2 into the atmosphere conversely in humid and arid climates every 10 kg of urea increased n2o emissions by 7 1 and 6 6 respectively similarly eagle et al 2017 reported that 10 kg of urea fertilizer increased n2o emissions by 7 the results indicated that urea application at maximum levels can increase n2o losses by 0 26 kg compared with minimum levels kumar et al 2021 determined that n fertilizer applied at 240 kg ha 1 produced 0 36 kg of n2o emission which was 0 08 kg more than the emission of 100 kg ha 1 n fertilizer additionally sp 220 and sc 250 increased nh3 and no3 losses by 100 compared to minimum urea fertilizer levels previous studies have reported increased losses of ammonia and nitrate with higher nitrogen consumption eagle et al 2017 hojjati et al 2019 pan et al 2020 brentrup et al 2004 observed a 92 increase in nh3 losses in the 100 kg h 1 n fertilizer compared to the control according to our results the trend of global warming changes has a positive relationship with the amount of urea fertilizer consumption thus sp 220 and sc 250 increased global warming by 13 and 17 compared to minimum levels higher global warming potential in the arid climate was mainly due to lower wheat yield than in the humid climate some reports have also cited nitrogen fertilizer as the main cause of global warming eagle et al 2017 holka and bieńkowski 2020 in a study the consumption of 50 kg ha 1 urea fertilizer led to 35 more global warming than the control treatment kumar et al 2021 also different studies have reported global warming rates for wheat of 385 biswas et al 2010 390 holka and bieńkowski 2020 and 450 kg co2 eq pishgar komleh et al 2020 global warming of 318 and 585 kg co2 eq was reported in the north and northwest of iran respectively fallahpour et al 2012 hojjati et al 2019 the pollution released into the air also affects the soil nh3 so2 and nox pollutants released from urea fertilizer and diesel fuel lead to terrestrial acidification gonzález garcía et al 2021 van zelm et al 2016 the terrestrial acidification response to fertilizer application in humid climates has followed an increasing pattern the maximum amount of terrestrial acidification potential was in sp 160 1 18 kg so2 eq and sc 250 0 85 kg so2 eq according to kumar et al 2021 nitrogen fertilizer applications of 160 180 kg ha 1 resulted in the highest acidification level with 1 95 so2 eq unlike kumar et al 2021 our study did not consider the transportation of input sources resulting in decreased terrestrial acidification in addition to changing the terrestrial acidification the pollutants caused terrestrial ecotoxicity this study found no particular relationship between terrestrial ecotoxicity and urea consumption however it has been reported that doubling nitrogen fertilizer during the wheat production increases terrestrial ecotoxicity by 50 charles et al 2006 ultimately these environmental effects result in land use changes and prevent the survival of other organisms and plants on land land use change has a direct relationship with urea fertilizer consumption thus the treatments with the maximum use of urea fertilizer had the highest amount of land use change in arid 14 9 m2a crop eq and humid 9 5 m2a crop eq climates our results were higher than the study by shrestha et al 2020 that obtained the amount of land use for wheat production in south dakota of 6 4 m2a crop eq this difference is related to the higher consumption of urea and potassium fertilizers in our research compared to the previous study terrestrial ecosystem degradation eventually leads to the pollution of water resources acid rain results when nh3 so2 nox and n2o gases are emitted into the atmosphere di and cameron 2002 deposition of these pollutants leads to acidification of agricultural soil and groundwater resources van zelm et al 2016 also part of the eutrophication of water resources is caused by the reduction of water infiltration into the soil due to the destruction of the soil structure and the creation of runoff this runoff washes plant nutrients from the soil and discharges them into rivers or marine systems huang et al 2017 the use of urea fertilizers contributes significantly to the polluting of fresh water and marine ecosystems on an average 13 2 of nitrogen used in our study entered water resources as nitrate the amount of nitrogen leaching from urea fertilizers contributed approximately 51 to freshwater eutrophication alternatively freshwater eutrophication is linked to phosphate fertilizers to an extent of 28 previous studies have reported that nitrogen fertilizer leaching rates of 3 54 depending on the method and type of fertilizer used charles et al 2006 huang et al 2017 also 30 of the eutrophication potential was attributed to phosphate fertilizers holka et al 2016 in addition to urea chemical pesticides were another factor that affected the environmental impacts the amount of pesticides used in wheat fields in the humid climate was 1 81 kg ha 1 as reported by holka et al 2016 2 3 kg ha 1 of chemical pesticides were used in wheat fields in poland also chemical pesticides have been used on wheat farms in the mediterranean climate at a rate of 2 3 kg ha 1 syp et al 2012 pesticides were used at lower levels in this study than in other studies chemical pesticides had the lowest impact on environmental indicators with an average of less than 4 4 3 technical and economic efficiency this analysis revealed that n fertilizer input significantly increased wheat yield and resource use efficiency compared to n0 sp 220 and sc 250 increased crop yield by 1 2 and 2 0 t ha 1 respectively the findings of this study were supported in a recent research liu et al 2020 overall the yield increase per kg applied urea fertilizer in humid climate was 40 higher than that in arid climate it was shown that n fertilizer has a greater effect on wheat yield in the humid climate because there is less water requirement more rainfall and favorable weather conditions for wheat growth li et al 2022a thus weather conditions can explain the difference in wheat yields nue could also be decreased by high levels of n fertilizer due to more significant losses rathore et al 2017 nitrogen fertilizer application and yield increase do not follow a linear relationship and after at an optimal point increasing fertilizer application decreases yield arduini et al 2006 furthermore only 40 of the n fertilizer in wheat production is absorbed and consumed nassiri and koocheki 2014 the highest nue was obtained in sc 100 at 34 67 kg kg 1 belete et al 2018 showed that the highest and lowest nue were 38 2 and 4 6 kg kg 1 for 120 and 360 kg fertilizer respectively belete et al 2018 several other factors can affect the nue including planting time fertilizer distribution weather condition soil type and crop type li et al 2022a the average production of wheat in iran which is one of the countries with an arid climate is 2 5 t ha 1 in contrast regions with humid climate such as europe china and mexico have an average wheat production of 5 7 5 8 and 6 1 t ha 1 respectively also wheat production in afghanistan pakistan and ethiopia is 2 1 2 93 and 2 85 t ha 1 respectively usda 2022 the consumption of chemical fertilizers in the world varies considerably while its amount in iran is less than 100 kg ha 1 it is estimated to be 170 in european countries such as france and italy and 155 and 380 kg ha 1 in the asian countries of pakistan and china respectively worldbank 2019 a positive correlation was observed between wp and economic indices with urea fertilizer consumption it was found that wp was highest in treatments with a maximum amount of urea additionally previous studies have shown that nitrogen addition increases wp cossani and sadras 2018 li et al 2022b the wp indicator was considerably higher in the humid climate than that in arid climate the most significant difference was related to wpi in sc 250 compared with sp 220 the maximum wpi in arid climate was also 0 28 kg m 3 in arid climate regions of iran such as the center and east the wp of wheat has been reported 1 41 and 0 6 kg m 3 respectively shirmohamm and afshin 2020 vazifedoust et al 2008 compared to previous studies the arid climate is experiencing high evapotranspiration 4500 mm and low rainfall 55 mm resulting in higher water irrigation demand and reduced wpi conversely n fertilizer application in an arid climate leads to greater water extraction and increases the risk of drought stress herwaarden et al 1998 it has also been reported that limited water availability and n fertilizer application reduced wheat yields in australia sadras et al 2016 the main variable of economic productivity was the difference in wheat yield with urea fertilizer application plants cannot always absorb fertilizers completely so using more fertilizers reduces yield to cost ratios a study found that the application of nitrogen fertilizer up to 190 kg ha 1 for wheat cultivation increased revenue however the application of more fertilizer decreased the revenue pan et al 2020 although the application of more nitrogen in agricultural lands leads to an increase in production productivity this is not a linear relationship and there is an optimal economic application belete et al 2018 therefore by increasing the use of nitrogen from a certain level the economic efficiency decreases and the increase in yield does not respond to the additional cost of chemical fertilizers excess nitrogen losses also leads to significant direct economic losses especially when nitrogen fertilizer costs are high to farmers and to the environment gruber and galloway 2008 the average economic productivity in arid and humid climates was 6 3 and 7 6 kg 1 respectively it was reported that the economic productivity of wheat in the east and north of iran was 5 11 sahabi et al 2016 and 7 38 kg 1 respectively amoozad khalili et al 2020 our results showed that humid climate is more suitable for wheat production in iran than arid region we are aware of the importance of managing the timing rates and placement of urea fertilizer distribution however our study is limited owing to a paucity of such data thus broader interpretations should be made with caution additionally we acknowledge that different wheat cultivars may exhibit different response patterns to different levels of urea fertilization 5 limitations and uncertainties variability and uncertainty will exist in any assessment the sources of error and uncertainty of this study include the use of a limited number of questionnaires randomly from the study areas the use of a semi quantitative method to apply fertilizer stress in the estimation of the grain yield and the different management of agricultural inputs among farmers semi quantitative tools have low computational requirements compared to quantitative techniques mwiya 2003 however the tools contain more potential uncertainty compared to quantitative techniques even in situations where standard terminology is used uncertainty due to observation and interpretation still exists mwiya 2003 the collected data may also have uncertainty due to random errors in measurement or sampling methods or systemic biases in measurements to reduce this uncertainty in research results strategies such as increasing the number of the statistical population verifying the validity of the collected data under pilot condition and applying quantitative models in product estimation can be considered in studies 6 conclusions in this study the environmental and economic sustainability of wheat cultivation in arid and humid climates was evaluated based on the results 75 8 of the total environmental impacts were caused by off farm activities also global warming and the formation of fine particulates were the most important environmental impacts under different management of urea fertilizer a large portion of the environmental damage was caused by the consumption of urea fertilizer and diesel fuel nitrogen fertilizer application at maximum levels compared to the minimum levels improved production efficiency in arid 38 and humid 24 climates the increase in crop yield performance improved the productivity of resources per unit area and as a result reduced the emission of pollutants thus urea fertilizer consumption at minimum levels with lower crop yields was associated with the highest levels of human health damage however the environmental impacts of marine eutrophication and ozone layer depletion were the most sensitive to the increase in urea fertilizer although increasing urea fertilizer had adverse effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems it improved farmers income and water productivity in arid 34 and 37 and humid 24 and 25 climates additionally wheat cultivation in an arid climate requires more appropriate management strategies according to the results using more inputs to achieve high crop yield does not always lead to more environmental degradation therefore an appropriate strategy for reducing agricultural production s environmental impact is to increase the resource efficiency through higher crop yields per unit area for regions with different climates this integrated model can be used to estimate the consumption of agricultural inputs also changing the approach of managers in the macro planning of agricultural management from an economy oriented perspective to a comprehensive one relying on environmental issues is another positive aspect of using this model this approach is especially important in the regions of the world where there are subsidized distribution policies for chemical fertilizers and agricultural inputs the sustainability of agricultural production based on environmental issues leads to sustainable development and in the long term leads to food security considering social indicators along with technical and economic indicators can provide more efficient strategies for stainable development of the agricultural sector also to select appropriate levels of different inputs using the integrated model developed in this
