while ph was significantly lower in n2 n3 and n4 than in n0 fig 3 and table 2 post fertilization apa 0 2 showed no significant differences among the treatments whereas significant differences were observed for apa0 2 3 0 apa 3 0 and apased thus apa0 2 3 0 and apa 3 0 were higher in n3 and n4 than in n0 and apased was higher in n4 than in n0 in stage i apa0 2 3 0 was significantly higher in n4

tp with the potential influencing factors in stage i tn correlated positively with apa0 2 3 0 and apased and negatively with do table 3 while tp correlated positively with apa 3 0 and apased and negatively with do and ph in stage ii both tn and tp showed significant positive correlations with chl a and apa 3 0 while apased only exhibited a significant positive correlation with tp in stage iii tn correlated positively with chl a and apased and negatively with apa 0 2 do and ph and tp correlated positively with chl a apa0 2 3 0 and apased and negatively with ph the cfi values in the p release models for the three stages were 0 92 0 98 and 1 00 respectively indicating that the results of the path models were acceptable fig 5 in stage i the path coefficients from tn to do apased and apa0 2 3 were significant while for tp the only significant path coefficient was that from do to tp this suggests that tn may affect p release indirectly only by decreasing do the effect the path coefficient of do on p release was 0 25 in stage ii by increasing apa 3 0 tn had an indirect effect of 0 50 on the p release in stage iii tn affected the p release indirectly by altering both apa 3 0 and apased the total effect being 0 58 overall the stage i ii and iii models accounted for 46 68 and 90 of the variations in tp respectively 4 discussion our 2 month experiment revealed no significant differences in tp between the lowest n loading treatments n1 n2 and the control though the concentrations tended to be higher by the end of the experiment in contrast in the two high n loading treatments n3 n4 tp concentrations were significantly higher than in the control during the experiment however the concentrations of tp generally decreased in all treatments this likely reflects the batch experimental conditions employed that favor settlement of suspended particles schindler 1998 however the among treatment differences in tp were mainly caused by the amount of n loading as indicated by the close positive relationship between tn and tp dgt p values in the low n loading treatments following fertilization were comparable to those in the beginning of the fertilization while a clear increase in dgt p was apparent in the high n loading treatments 10 mg n l 1 these results collectively support our hypothesis that high n loading can promote internal p release at high nh4 n the highest n concentrations are not often found under natural conditions but the trend was the same for lower n loadings indicating effects also at lower more natural loadings the increase in dgt p that we found in the high n loading treatments appears to contrast the observed consistently decreasing tp this decrease likely reflects the loss of particulate p in this batch experiment which more than offset the enhanced release of p from the sediment at high n loading the correlations and path analyses suggested that the key processes contributing to the increase in p release following enhanced n loading were reduced do in stage i and increased apa in stage ii and iii augmented p release under anoxic conditions has been widely reported in previous studies however the do threshold values for promoting p release vary for example in a large scale study nürnberg 1995 used 1 mg l 1 do as the threshold of anoxia potentially promoting fe p release from the sediment in the employed anoxic factor model likewise chapra and canale 1991 defined 1 5 mg l 1 do as the threshold of anoxia in their do model for shagawa lake varying do thresholds have also been found in small scale studies for example in a 40 day laboratory experiment conducted in glass tubes diameter 5 cm length 30 cm a significantly higher p release was found when do was 4 mg l 1 whereas no p release was observed at do 5 mg l 1 wang et al 2008b promotion of p release with do 4 mg l 1 was also suggested in another 40 day experiment conducted in glass tubes diameter 5 cm length 80 cm jiang et al 2008 in our mesocosm study a noticeably higher do threshold do concentration dropped from 9 2 to 6 6 mg o2 l 1 determined at medium water depth was recorded and it might have been even lower if measurements had been conducted near the sediment surface as in some of the other studies supporting this view a decreasing trend of do concentrations was found in the water column from top to bottom 12 4 mg o2 l 1 in the top 5 9 mg o2 l 1 in the middle and 2 8 mg o2 l 1 at the bottom in our pond experiment water depth 1 m surface area 800 m2 unpublished data the important role of apa in the p cycle has also been widely recognized zhou et al 2008 vitousek et al 2010 li et al 2016 for example a survey of 29 shallow lakes of different eutrophic status tp 0 01 1 49 mg l 1 chl a 7 94 180 27 μg l 1 zm 1 2 2 6 m zsd 0 2 1 1 m li et al 2016 found a significant positive correlation between organic matter rich in n and apa n 116 r 2 0 4 p 0 01 and argued that the n enrichment may increase apa and subsequently promote p release our results provide experimental evidence for this hypothesis in addition compared with previous studies the detailed apa classification results of our study further indicated that among all apa fractions free bacterial and algae apa apa of algae played a key role in promoting p release laboratory experiments have shown that the amount of p released from the sediment increased both under acidic and alkaline conditions while no or only a small amount of p was released under neutral conditions wu et al 2014 xu et al 2015 probably because both iron bound p and aluminum bound p have their lowest solubility and highest p retention at neutral ph values 6 8 cooke et al 2005 in our study ph ranged between 6 90 and 8 43 where no major effect on p release is expected while nh4 n loading reduced ph to some degree it did not lead to major acidification probably because of the strong buffering capacity of the experimental systems although we in our experimental set up tried to reduce as much as possible the gap between artificial and natural lake systems there was no mixing and in consequence possibly a stronger gradient in oxygen than in natural shallow lakes nevertheless our results are largely in agreement with field data showing that the n enrichment may increase apa and subsequently promote p release li et al 2016 in order to fully clarify the quantitative relationship between nh4 n loading and p release large scale field research is needed taking advantage of the improved in situ p monitoring technology in recent years zhang et al 2014 5 conclusions based on the results of our 2 month experiment we draw the following conclusions i high ammonium loading can promote sediment phosphorus release as judged from the observed changes in tp and dgt p among the treatments the strength of this promotion depends on the amount of loading ii stimulated alkaline phosphatase activity appeared as the dominant mechanism underlying the promotion effect of ammonium loading on sediment phosphorus release not least at the end of the experiment iii decreasing oxygen conditions were likely a contributing factor particularly in the beginning of the ammonium

positive percentages were found for n0 n1 and n2 47 70 while the values for n3 and n4 17 127 were all positive no data are available for stage iii due to failed retrieval of dgt probes post fertilization chl a values were significantly higher in n2 n3 and n4 than in n0 no difference among the treatments was detected in stage i in stage ii n3 and n4 were significantly higher than n0 while no difference was found among n1 n2 and n0 the patterns in stage iii were similar to those in stage ii fig 3 and table 2 for post fertilization do and ph no significant difference was observed between

while ph was significantly lower in n2 n3 and n4 than in n0 fig 3 and table 2 post fertilization apa 0 2 showed no significant differences among the treatments whereas significant differences were observed for apa0 2 3 0 apa 3 0 and apased thus apa0 2 3 0 and apa 3 0 were higher in n3 and n4 than in n0 and apased was higher in n4 than in n0 in stage i apa0 2 3 0 was significantly higher in n4

tp with the potential influencing factors in stage i tn correlated positively with apa0 2 3 0 and apased and negatively with do table 3 while tp correlated positively with apa 3 0 and apased and negatively with do and ph in stage ii both tn and tp showed significant positive correlations with chl a and apa 3 0 while apased only exhibited a significant positive correlation with tp in stage iii tn correlated positively with chl a and apased and negatively with apa 0 2 do and ph and tp correlated positively with chl a apa0 2 3 0 and apased and negatively with ph the cfi values in the p release models for the three stages were 0 92 0 98 and 1 00 respectively indicating that the results of the path models were acceptable fig 5 in stage i the path coefficients from tn to do apased and apa0 2 3 were significant while for tp the only significant path coefficient was that from do to tp this suggests that tn may affect p release indirectly only by decreasing do the effect the path coefficient of do on p release was 0 25 in stage ii by increasing apa 3 0 tn had an indirect effect of 0 50 on the p release in stage iii tn affected the p release indirectly by altering both apa 3 0 and apased the total effect being 0 58 overall the stage i ii and iii models accounted for 46 68 and 90 of the variations in tp respectively 4 discussion our 2 month experiment revealed no significant differences in tp between the lowest n loading treatments n1 n2 and the control though the concentrations tended to be higher by the end of the experiment in contrast in the two high n loading treatments n3 n4 tp concentrations were significantly higher than in the control during the experiment however the concentrations of tp generally decreased in all treatments this likely reflects the batch experimental conditions employed that favor settlement of suspended particles schindler 1998 however the among treatment differences in tp were mainly caused by the amount of n loading as indicated by the close positive relationship between tn and tp dgt p values in the low n loading treatments following fertilization were comparable to those in the beginning of the fertilization while a clear increase in dgt p was apparent in the high n loading treatments 10 mg n l 1 these results collectively support our hypothesis that high n loading can promote internal p release at high nh4 n the highest n concentrations are not often found under natural conditions but the trend was the same for lower n loadings indicating effects also at lower more natural loadings the increase in dgt p that we found in the high n loading treatments appears to contrast the observed consistently decreasing tp this decrease likely reflects the loss of particulate p in this batch experiment which more than offset the enhanced release of p from the sediment at high n loading the correlations and path analyses suggested that the key processes contributing to the increase in p release following enhanced n loading were reduced do in stage i and increased apa in stage ii and iii augmented p release under anoxic conditions has been widely reported in previous studies however the do threshold values for promoting p release vary for example in a large scale study nürnberg 1995 used 1 mg l 1 do as the threshold of anoxia potentially promoting fe p release from the sediment in the employed anoxic factor model likewise chapra and canale 1991 defined 1 5 mg l 1 do as the threshold of anoxia in their do model for shagawa lake varying do thresholds have also been found in small scale studies for example in a 40 day laboratory experiment conducted in glass tubes diameter 5 cm length 30 cm a significantly higher p release was found when do was 4 mg l 1 whereas no p release was observed at do 5 mg l 1 wang et al 2008b promotion of p release with do 4 mg l 1 was also suggested in another 40 day experiment conducted in glass tubes diameter 5 cm length 80 cm jiang et al 2008 in our mesocosm study a noticeably higher do threshold do concentration dropped from 9 2 to 6 6 mg o2 l 1 determined at medium water depth was recorded and it might have been even lower if measurements had been conducted near the sediment surface as in some of the other studies supporting this view a decreasing trend of do concentrations was found in the water column from top to bottom 12 4 mg o2 l 1 in the top 5 9 mg o2 l 1 in the middle and 2 8 mg o2 l 1 at the bottom in our pond experiment water depth 1 m surface area 800 m2 unpublished data the important role of apa in the p cycle has also been widely recognized zhou et al 2008 vitousek et al 2010 li et al 2016 for example a survey of 29 shallow lakes of different eutrophic status tp 0 01 1 49 mg l 1 chl a 7 94 180 27 μg l 1 zm 1 2 2 6 m zsd 0 2 1 1 m li et al 2016 found a significant positive correlation between organic matter rich in n and apa n 116 r 2 0 4 p 0 01 and argued that the n enrichment may increase apa and subsequently promote p release our results provide experimental evidence for this hypothesis in addition compared with previous studies the detailed apa classification results of our study further indicated that among all apa fractions free bacterial and algae apa apa of algae played a key role in promoting p release laboratory experiments have shown that the amount of p released from the sediment increased both under acidic and alkaline conditions while no or only a small amount of p was released under neutral conditions wu et al 2014 xu et al 2015 probably because both iron bound p and aluminum bound p have their lowest solubility and highest p retention at neutral ph values 6 8 cooke et al 2005 in our study ph ranged between 6 90 and 8 43 where no major effect on p release is expected while nh4 n loading reduced ph to some degree it did not lead to major acidification probably because of the strong buffering capacity of the experimental systems although we in our experimental set up tried to reduce as much as possible the gap between artificial and natural lake systems there was no mixing and in consequence possibly a stronger gradient in oxygen than in natural shallow lakes nevertheless our results are largely in agreement with field data showing that the n enrichment may increase apa and subsequently promote p release li et al 2016 in order to fully clarify the quantitative relationship between nh4 n loading and p release large scale field research is needed taking advantage of the improved in situ p monitoring technology in recent years zhang et al 2014 5 conclusions based on the results of our 2 month experiment we draw the following conclusions i high ammonium loading can promote sediment phosphorus release as judged from the observed changes in tp and dgt p among the treatments the strength of this promotion depends on the amount of loading ii stimulated alkaline phosphatase activity appeared as the dominant mechanism underlying the promotion effect of ammonium loading on sediment phosphorus release not least at the end of the experiment iii decreasing oxygen conditions were likely a contributing factor particularly in the beginning of the ammonium

19316,the objectives of this study were to specifically detect viable escherichia coli in environmental waters by targeting the ycjm gene in a propidium monoazide pma qpcr assay pma is a viability dye that can inhibit the amplification of dna from dead cells thus allowing for the detection and quantification of only viable cells the ycjm primers were used to target e coli that directly originated from the feces of warm blooded animals and avoid false positive detection caused by naturalized e coli that can exist in the environment in this study tap water and environmental waters were inoculated with e coli isolated from animal feces following cell collection samples were treated with pma followed by dna isolation and qpcr detection for pure cultures 5 μm pma with a 10 min light exposure was efficient at inhibiting the amplification of dna from 105 cfu ml dead e coli cells with a detection limit of 102 cfu 100 ml viable cells for tap and environmental waters collected in the winter a 10 μm pma was required and as low as 103 cfu 100 ml viable cells could be detected in the presence of 105 cfu 100 ml dead cells for water samples collected during the summer 102 cfu 10 ml viable cells could be detected in the presence of 104 cfu 10 ml dead cells after a 20 μm pma treatment no significant differences were found among the pma qpcr assay and two other standard culture based methods for detection of viable e coli in environmental water in conclusion with proper pretreatment of environmental water samples this pma qpcr assay that targets the ycjm gene could quantify viable e coli cells that directly come from the feces of warm blooded animals and therefore effectively and accurately indicate the quality of environmental water graphical abstract image 1 keywords e

water who 2017 various pathogens including cryptosporidium campylobacter giardia pathogenic escherichia coli shigella salmonella norovirus and rotavirus hrudey and hrudey 2007 can enter human bodies through the fecal oral route via contaminated water and cause illnesses or symptoms such as gastroenteritis dermatitis primary amebic meningoencephalitis and typhoid fever craun et al 2005 instead of directly testing a large variety of pathogens which is difficult expensive and time consuming the united states environmental protection agency epa rules involve the detection of fecal indicator bacteria fib to monitor fecal contamination in water because fib are commonly found in human and animal feces their presence may suggest the existence of pathogenic microorganisms and the possibility of health risks to humans epa 1986 as a member of fib e coli has been found to be significantly linked to gastrointestinal illnesses associated with swimming in recreational fresh water dufour 1984 for routine water quality monitoring only culture based methods for e coli are currently approved by the epa these methods necessitate long incubation times commonly about 24 h and have a high dependence on bacterial metabolism epa 2009 in contrast quantifying e coli by quantitative pcr qpcr technology only requires several hours additionally since qpcr directly detects specific genes of target microbes its accuracy and specificity are generally guaranteed frahm and obst 2003 however one limitation of qpcr is that it amplifies dna from both viable and dead cells thus overestimating the number of viable cells to achieve specific monitoring of viable e coli a viability dye viz propidium monoazide pma treatment can be combined with qpcr the principle behind the ability of pma to distinguish viable from dead cells is based on the integrity of bacterial cell membranes pma works by first penetrating the compromised membranes of dead cells under photolysis its azide groups covalently bind to cellular dna to form irreversible nitrogen carbon bonds since the bound dna is prevented from being amplified by a subsequent pcr step the dead cells are not detected fittipaldi et al 2012 on the other hand the qpcr signals emanating from viable cells including viable but non culturable vbnc cells which have intact cell membranes will not be significantly affected under certain pma concentration ranges dinu and bach 2013 it was commonly believed that e coli could only transiently remain viable after being released through fecal droppings from its primary habitat to the external environment walk et al 2007 thus when e coli cells are detected in water or food fecal contamination caused by humans or warm blood animals would be directly implicated however recently naturalized e coli have been found in natural environments which challenges current water monitoring programs around the world naturalized e coli can tolerate and maintain their populations for a prolonged time outside their hosts and have been found in soils tropical temperate and frozen temperate soils beach sands lake and river watersheds and aquatic periphyton communities byappanahalli et al 2012 thus detection of e coli in environmental waters may not accurately indicate fecal contamination and cannot truly reflect water quality walk et al 2007 recently a new set of primers targeting the putative glucosyltransferase gene ycjm of e coli was developed and found to be enteric specific and able to differentiate among naturalized e coli strains and e coli strains isolated from human and animal feces deng et al 2014 we believe that targeting the ycjm gene in a q pcr allows for more selective and accurate detection of e coli from only fecal sources therefore the objective of this research was to employ and apply a pma qpcr that targets the ycjm gene for estimating only viable non naturalized e coli in environmental waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains fecal e

cells each sample was prepared by spiking 100 ml peptone water with 1 ml of diluted viable e coli followed by thorough shaking to mix and filtration through a sterile 0 45 μm 47 mm white gridded filter membrane emd millipore corp billerica ma usa the membrane was then transferred into a 50 ml sterile centrifuge tube that contained 25 ml peptone water residues on the membrane were washed off by pipetting the peptone water on the membrane several times using a 1 ml pipette the membrane was removed above the liquid surface while still attached to the inner wall of the centrifuge tube and cells were collected by centrifugation at 8000 g for 25 min the pellet was re suspended in 1 ml peptone water and transferred into a 1 7 ml microcentrifuge tube counts of the collected cells were checked by the agar plating method and found to be similar to that of the original spiking concentration for pma staining 2 5 μl of pma working solution 2 mm were applied to make the final concentration of pma 5 μm dna isolation and qpcr steps were conducted as described earlier 2 8 application of pma qpcr to tap and environmental waters spiked with mixed viable and dead e coli cells all tested water samples were autoclaved before spiking to avoid the potential influence of viable cells that might originally exist in the samples based on the various levels of water turbidity different sample volumes pre treatment steps and pma concentrations were applied for tap and environmental waters collected in the winter months december to february 2015 a 100 ml sample volume was chosen and samples were processed following the steps described in the preceding section with an additional centrifugation step at 2000 g for 1 min to remove suspended particles before applying a 10 μm pma treatment for environmental waters collected in the summer months may to august 2015 10 ml samples were used and exposed to several pre treatment steps viz samples were mixed with 20 ml peptone water and centrifuged at 2000 g for 1 min after the centrifugation of supernatants again at 8000 g for 10 min pellets were re suspended in 1 ml peptone water and transferred to 1 7 ml microcentrifuge tubes followed by centrifugation at 2000 g for 1 5 min the supernatants were finally treated with 20 μm pma by adding 10 μl of 2 mm pma the following dna extraction and qpcr steps were conducted as mentioned previously 2 9 correlation of pma qpcr and epa method 1603 for detection of viable e coli cells in spiked tap lake and river waters water samples were spiked with viable e coli cells at various concentrations two equivalent water samples with the same volume and bacterial concentration were processed and e coli cells respectively detected by pma qpcr as described above and also by following the epa method 1603 culture based method 2 10 comparison among pma qpcr qpcr epa method 1603 and colilert for detection of viable e coli cells in spiked lake and river waters one milliliter of 103 cfu ml viable e coli cells was spiked into 10 ml water samples including water from lake of the ozarks missouri river and mississippi river all collected in july 2015 water samples of different types were prepared separately and found to have similar counts of e coli cells samples were processed followed by qpcr pma qpcr and epa method 1603 as described above for colilert detection results were obtained by using the colilert and 51 well quanti tray system idexx westbrook me usa according to the manufacturer s directions 2 11 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed using spss ibm armonk ny usa microsoft excel software microsoft corporation redmond washington usa and the minitab 16 software minitab inc state college pa usa all experiments were repeated twice means for duplicate log e coli aerobic plate counts were plotted against means for triplicate quantification cycle cq values obtained by qpcr or pma qpcr a significance level of 0 05 was used when comparing differences 3 results 3 1 specificity of ycjm primers the specificity of the ycjm primers for e coli and closely related shigella strains was analyzed by sybr green qpcr fecal e coli included e coli strains isolated from chicken c cattle ct duck d deer dr dog dg goat gt goose g human h pig p and raccoon r compared with the tuf and uida primer sets the ycjm primer set showed superior specificity for e coli strains amplifying dna from only e coli except for e coli d8 and not from shigella which is a closely related species table 2 the negative result of the ycjm primers for e coli d8 might be because this strain had transmitted itself from the environment to an animal s intestinal tract and was then isolated from animal feces 3 2 effect of light exposure time of pma treatment on qpcr assay light exposure is a critical factor for pma treatment of samples because it does not only activate the dye to crosslink with nucleic acids but it also inactivates any excess dye from forming hydroxyl amines as fig 1 shows a light exposure time of as long as 20 min did not inhibit the dna amplification of viable e coli cells on the other hand the cq values increased with the extension of the light exposure time from 1 min to 10 min for heat killed cells which illustrated the increasing inhibition of the qpcr amplification of dead cells by the pma treatment because the inhibition curve of log 5 cfu ml dead cells became constant with exposure times of 10 min and longer while viable cells were not affected fig 1 a light exposure of 10 min was selected in this study 3 3 influence of pma concentration on qpcr no increase in cq value for dead cells was yielded starting at a pma concentration of 5 μm fig 2 this indicated that a minimal concentration of 5 μm pma was needed to stain as many as 105 cfu ml dead cells on the other hand no significant increase in cq value was observed for 105 cfu ml viable cells treated with up to 20 μm pma the treatment of 50 μm pma however showed cytotoxic effects on viable cells as indicated by the increasing cq value fig 2 by combining the results above as shown in figs 1 and 2 the final pma concentration of 5 for pure cultures 10 or 20 μm for spiked water samples was used for subsequent experiments in this study based on the different turbidity levels of the water samples 3 4 detection range of pma qpcr no significant differences were found between the cq values of the pma treated and untreated groups and the detection ranges for pure viable e coli by both qpcr and pma qpcr were from 102 to 106 cfu 100 ml peptone water fig 3 these results demonstrated that a 5 μm pma treatment did not have a significantly negative effect on detection of viable e coli by qpcr whereby the detection limit of the pma qpcr could be as low as 102 cfu pure culture of viable e coli 100 ml fig 3 3 5 comparison of the pma qpcr results among spiked tap lake and river waters one milliliter of 105 cfu ml viable cells or a mixture of 1 ml dead 105 cfu ml and 1 ml viable 105 cfu ml cells was respectively spiked into 100 ml autoclaved water samples including tap water lake of the ozarks water collected in february 2015 and missouri river water collected in february 2015 fig 4 shows higher cq values of the pma treated dead viable e coli mixture group than those of the untreated mixture group but not significantly different from that of the treated viable cells group p 0 05 indicating that the pma treatment efficiently removed the false positive signals from dna of 105 cfu ml dead cells however unlike the other two types of water the cq value of the pma treated e coli cell mixture group for lake water was between the cq value of the treated viable cells alone group and that of the untreated cell mixture group fig 4 this indicated the bigger influence of dead cell dna on the detection of viable e coli in lake water spiked with the dead live cell mixture this inefficiency of the pma treatment might be because of the presence of higher levels of fine suspended solid particles in lake water that still remained in the sample which prevented full light penetration of pma during the photo activation step fittipaldi et al 2012 van frankenhuyzen et al 2013 thus a higher pma concentration and smaller sample volume which would be expected to contain less suspended solid particles were applied for further studies with more turbid water samples 3 6 application of the optimized pma qpcr to spiked tap and lake waters for tap water the cq value of the untreated dead and viable mixture group was significantly lower than those of the other two groups fig 5 a indicating that log 5 cfu 100 ml dead cells could cause false positive results if the pma treatment was not applied prior to qpcr on the other hand no significant differences p 0 05 in cq values were found between the dead and viable mixture group and the viable cells group when detected by the pma qpcr although the slopes of their standard curves were slightly different fig 5 however for lake of the ozarks water collected in winter february 2015 the pma treatment was not able to completely allow for the differentiation of viable from dead cells although the cq value of the dead and viable cell mixture group by pma qpcr was higher than that of the untreated mixture group by qpcr a slight overestimation of viable cell numbers in the mixture was observed when compared with the viable cells group detected by pma qpcr fig 5b for lake of the ozarks water collected in july 2015 which was very turbid due to rain and floods that summer a small sample volume of 10 ml several low speed centrifugation steps of sample pretreatment and a higher pma concentration of 20 μm were used brief low speed short time centrifugation steps as mentioned above were conducted in the pretreatment step to remove suspended particles in environmental water samples while not significantly removing bacterial cells these centrifugation conditions were optimized by a preliminary study data not shown as a result good consistency was found between the two pma treated groups fig 5c this meant that with the appropriate pretreatment the pma treatment efficiently inhibited all significant amplification of 104 cfu 10 ml dead e coli cells even in the presence of heavily suspended solids and other background microflora without significantly reducing its sensitivity this was shown by the detection limit for lake of the ozarks water collected in the summer which was 102 cfu 10 ml however since suspended solids have a similar physical behavior as that of bacterial cells in water some fine sized particles could still exist in the sample supernatant and can prevent full light penetration of the pma in the subsequent photo activation step therefore an adequate pre treatment of water samples is still critical before effective application of pma qpcr for regular quality monitoring of turbid environmental or waste water samples that contain various suspended materials among all three types of water samples tested the difference between the cq values of the viable and dead cell mixtures by qpcr and by pma qpcr decreased with increasing concentrations of viable cells fig 5 one possible explanation for this is that the more viable cells present in a sample the less impact dead cells would have on the increase in the total dna signal fittipaldi et al 2012 3 7 correlation between pma qpcr and epa method 1603 for detection of viable e coli in spiked tap lake and river waters to determine the correlation between the pma qpcr and epa method 1603 different types of equal volume water samples were spiked with various concentrations of viable e coli cells fig 6 bacterial counts were calculated from cq values that were indicated by pma pcr using regression equation from our standard curve for tap water fig 5a strong and significant correlations were found among all four types of water tested regardless of whether they were collected in the winter or summer as their r2s were all greater than 90 for all water types intercept parameters were very close to zero statistically thus only the slope values of each regression equation were used for comparing the bacterial counts detected by both pma qpcr and method 1603 since their slopes were all close to 1 no under or over estimation was observed by the pma pcr method in relation to the results of epa method 1603 3 8 comparison among pma qpcr qpcr epa method 1603 and colilert with quanti tray for detection of viable e coli in spiked lake and river waters one milliliter of 103 cfu ml viable e coli cells was respectively spiked into 10 ml autoclaved water samples collected from lake of the ozarks missouri river and mississippi river and analyzed by pma qpcr qpcr epa method 1603 and colilert combined with quanti tray lake of the ozarks missouri river and mississippi river water samples used in this section were all collected in july and had higher turbidity compared with the environmental waters collected in the winter in order to reduce the amount of suspended solid particles and to improve the performance of pma in the subsequent photo induced crosslinking step 10 ml water samples were used instead of 100 ml to remain consistent the 10 ml volume was applied for all four detection methods used in this section by autoclaving all microbial cells in each water sample were killed to eliminate the influence of viable cells that originally existed enumeration results by the four different methods among the environmental waters were compared as four different groups no interaction between water type and detection method was observed data not shown and the estimations of viable cells by qpcr without pma treatment among the three types of water samples were higher than those by the other three detection methods fig 7 the pma qpcr results on the other hand were not significantly different from the two culture based detection methods p 0 05 these results demonstrate that without pma treatment qpcr would overestimate the total amount of viable e coli since the dna from compromised cells and free dna fragments can also be amplified by the qpcr procedure wagner et al 2008 when only comparing between the pma qpcr and qpcr results among the three types of water the biggest difference was found for mississippi river water fig 7 which might be because it contained more free dna fragments or suspended solids that influenced the pcr assay than the two other water samples in this study qpcr showed an overestimation of viable e coli cells compared with pma qpcr and the culture based methods fig 7 in principle the estimation by pma qpcr could also be higher than those of culture based methods considering that vbnc cells that exist in environmental water would be detected by pma qpcr yokomachi and yaguchi 2012 however results from the pma qpcr were found not to be significantly different from those of the culture based methods p 0 05 fig 7 this could be because all the tested water samples were autoclaved before being spiked to ensure similar concentrations of viable e coli among all the samples 4 discussion current enumeration methods for e coli that are approved by the epa are all culture based methods that require overnight incubations in this study pma treatment combined with qpcr was tested on dead viable and a mixture of dead and viable e coli cells to provide a rapid estimation of only viable e coli cells in various types of water samples to target e coli various genes including uida uidr lacz tuf phoe cadc hns allan 16s rrna 23s rrna ahmed et al 2012 bej et al 1991 chetta and others 2012 frahm and obst 2003 foulds et al 2002 maheux et al 2009 have been used in other applications of pcr among these target genes the uida gene encoding the activity of β d glucuronidase was the most widely utilized and is also the standard target gene to confirm the presence of e coli epa 2009 however it was found that uida primers might lead to false negative results when detecting certain e coli isolates khan et al 2007 or false positive results or an overestimation since shigella can also be detected maheux et al 2009 in this study the ycjm primer pair targeting the putative glucosyltransferase gene ycjm was shown to be more accurate at monitoring fecal contamination of environmental samples since it did not amplify dna from shigella or from naturalized e coli strains that exist in the environment deng et al 2014 for pma treatment of e coli cells in environmental water samples several main factors were investigated in this research including light exposure time of pma pma concentration the type of matrix turbidity and the existence of dead cells a light exposure time of 10 min was chosen in this study because it did not increase the cq value of log 5 cfu ml dead cells when in a mixture with varying concentrations of viable e coli cells fig 1 in comparison the photolysis time of pma in previous studies usually ranges from 3 to 10 min gensberger et al 2014 li et al 2014 luo et al 2010 based on the bacterial species light source halogen or led distance of the sample from the light source sample turbidity and other factors fittipaldi et al 2012 when comparing the effects of different pma concentrations on e coli cells a concentration dependent cytotoxicity of pma on viable e coli was observed this was consistent with findings of previous research fittipaldi et al 2012 liu and mustapha 2014 considering that a typically high turbidity of environmental waters might affect the efficiency of pma treatment by blocking the light during the light exposure step most researchers applied relatively high pma amounts to treat water samples gensberger et al 2014 used 10 μm pma to treat e coli in drinking water and processed water samples and higher amounts of 50 μm yokomachi and yaguchi 2012 100 μm li et al 2014 and even 200 μm were used to treat wastewater sewage sludge and biosolids van frankenhuyzen et al 2013 in complex environmental samples many factors such as ph heavy metals humic acids and phenolic compounds as well as water turbidity might have adverse effects on pma pcr krometis et al 2013 mendes silva and domingues 2015 this might be the reason for the significant differences in cq values found among tap lake and river water samples in this study fig 4 the inefficiency of the pma treatment observed for lake of the ozarks water collected in winter fig 5b was most likely due to the turbidity of this water sample data not shown the number of nephelometric turbidity units ntu is one of the parameters to evaluate water turbidity levels and the value depends on the presence of suspended materials such as soil particles clay silt and sand algae plankton and microorganisms in the water sample an increase in ntu indicates that the environmental water sample contains high levels of suspended solids and becomes darker preventing light from penetrating and thus inhibiting the crosslinking of viability dyes li et al 2014 the ntu of the environmental waters used in this study as detected by a turbidity probe indicated that the mississippi river was the most turbid 120 ntu among the three water samples tested only quite clear water samples turbidities of less than 10 ntu did not prevent pma from reducing the signals from dead cells luo et al 2010 however bae and wuertz 2009 stated that after optimization steps pma qpcr could still function properly at relatively high solid concentrations tss 1000 mg l to reduce the inhibition of solids fittipaldi et al 2012 claimed that samples could be diluted to 1 2 ntu before the dye treatment however this might result in a low concentration of viable cells which may in turn lead to false negative results using a smaller sample volume is another alternative way to prevent the inhibition of solids on pma photo activation since the total amount of sediments is reduced for environmental water samples a small sample volume is commonly applied in a pma pcr assay such as 5 ml yokomachi and yaguchi 2012 10 ml varma et al 2009 and 15 ml li 2014 in fact culture based methods also use small volumes when testing turbid water samples to prevent sediments from blocking the filtration step epa 2009 the presence of dead cells can affect the efficiency of the pma treatment especially when viable cells are in much lower concentrations this means that when a high concentration of dead cells is present an overestimation of viable cell numbers might still occur by pma qpcr this phenomenon might be because a larger number of dead cells may have a higher capacity of taking up the dye hence causing less available dye molecules per cell to bind with the dna fittipaldi et al 2012 in this research following pma treatment up to log 5 cfu 100 ml dead cells did not mask the detection of log 3 log 6 cfu 100 ml viable cells when they were mixed together in tap water further log 4 cfu 10 ml dead cells did not mask the detection of log 2 log 5 cfu 10 ml viable cells in the lake of ozarks water collected in the summer these results are consistent with those of kantonale laboratorium 2009 in that the ratio between viable and dead cells of e coli should be greater than 1 and free dna could not be greater than 4 105 in copy numbers however a lower ratio of 0 1 fittipaldi et al 2012 and a higher ratio of 10 yokomachi and yaguchi 2012 have also been claimed by other researchers the pma qpcr assay in this study could detect as low as 102 cfu 100 ml viable e coli in peptone water fig 3 after pretreatment of water samples it could selectively detect 103 cfu 100 ml viable e coli cells in the presence of 105 cfu 100 ml dead cells for tap water and environmental water samples collected in winter and 102 cfu 10 ml viable cells in the presence of 104 cfu 10 ml dead cells for environmental water samples collected in summer without any enrichment steps fig 5 however a higher sensitivity of pma qpcr is still needed to fulfill epa regulations since the criterion for e coli is 126 cfu in 100 ml fresh recreational waters epa 1986 and 0 cfu 100 ml in drinking water epa tantawiwat et al 2005 detected e coli at concentrations of 100 101 cfu ml in water only after 6 h of enrichment therefore to increase the sensitivity of detection a pre enrichment step might be needed for the pma qpcr assay however this would make the enumeration of the original concentration of e coli impossible alternatively the volume of a water sample can be increased to compensate for the insufficient sensitivity of detection some researchers claimed that qpcr for quantitating e coli results in up to a 98 agreement with culture based methods for drinking water and environmental water frahm and obst 2003 noble et al 2010 however noble et al 2010 found that qpcr underestimated the total count of e coli in recreational water which might be caused by the loss of e coli cells during the processing steps or false positive results of standard colilert 18 tests most studies showed that qpcr could detect significantly higher numbers of e coli in water than can culture based methods ahmed et al 2012 khan et al 2007 truchado et al 2016 one explanation was that qpcr could detect dna from both viable and nonviable cells ahmed et al 2012 truchado et al 2016 in addition vbnc or free phase cells that commonly exist under multiple environmental stresses such as those caused by temperature and salinity could also be detected by qpcr noble and weisberg 2005 krometis et al 2013 moreover qpcr could successfully detect β glucuronidase negative e coli isolates while most epa approved culture based methods including method 1603 and colilert test depend on detecting the actual β d glucuronidase activity in e coli bej et al 1991 when detecting viable e coli cells our developed pma qpcr assay targeting the putative glucosyltransferase gene ycjm had strong correlation and similar estimation with current standard β d glucuronidase activity based culture methods viz epa method 1603 and colilert figs 6 and 7 more importantly when compared with qpcr epa 1603 and colilert methods pma qpcr may achieve a more precise indication of fresh fecal contamination since it can reduce dead cell signals and estimate the numbers of vbnc cells as viable cells in addition targeting the ycjm gene further improved the accuracy of the qpcr assay because more accurate differentiation of enteric e coli from naturalized strains of e coli can be realized even though the pretreatment steps of environmental water may require some processing time the total testing time is still several hours shorter than that of traditional culture based methods therefore this work demonstrated that a pma qpcr assay that targets the ycjm gene as developed in this research could be a rapid and accurate alternative to standard culture based methods for e coli based environmental water quality monitoring however more rigorous testings using actual water samples from diverse environmental settings need to be further conducted 5 conclusions current e coli enumeration methods that are approved by the epa are all culture based methods which are time consuming and labor intensive in this study pma treatment combined with qpcr was tested on dead viable and a mixture of dead and viable e coli cells to provide a comprehensive validation of the application of pma qpcr for detecting viable e coli in environmental water the ycjm primer set which could differentiate e coli strains that exist in the feces of warm blood animals from naturalized e coli strains detected most of the e coli strains isolated from animal feces but did not amplify dna from shigella strains after pretreatment of water samples the pma qpcr assay could selectively detect 103 cfu 100 ml viable e coli cells in the presence of 105 cfu 100 ml dead cells for environmental water samples collected in winter and 102 cfu 10 ml viable cells in the presence of 104 cfu 10 ml dead cells for environmental water samples collected in summer without any enrichment steps to achieve better suppression of dna amplification by pma treatment further studies should also focus on the pre treatment of water sample to remove suspended solids more efficiently while not causing a significant loss of bacterial cells in order to be consistent with standard culture based methods a larger sample volume such as 100 ml should be applied in further studies in addition a bigger amplicon size of the target gene might be considered when detecting viable e coli cells the developed pma qpcr assay targeting the putative glucosyltransferase gene ycjm had strong correlation and similar estimation with current standard β d glucuronidase activity based culture methods such as epa method 1603 and colilert this work demonstrated that a pma qpcr assay targeting the ycjm gene could be an alternative to standard

19316,the objectives of this study were to specifically detect viable escherichia coli in environmental waters by targeting the ycjm gene in a propidium monoazide pma qpcr assay pma is a viability dye that can inhibit the amplification of dna from dead cells thus allowing for the detection and quantification of only viable cells the ycjm primers were used to target e coli that directly originated from the feces of warm blooded animals and avoid false positive detection caused by naturalized e coli that can exist in the environment in this study tap water and environmental waters were inoculated with e coli isolated from animal feces following cell collection samples were treated with pma followed by dna isolation and qpcr detection for pure cultures 5 μm pma with a 10 min light exposure was efficient at inhibiting the amplification of dna from 105 cfu ml dead e coli cells with a detection limit of 102 cfu 100 ml viable cells for tap and environmental waters collected in the winter a 10 μm pma was required and as low as 103 cfu 100 ml viable cells could be detected in the presence of 105 cfu 100 ml dead cells for water samples collected during the summer 102 cfu 10 ml viable cells could be detected in the presence of 104 cfu 10 ml dead cells after a 20 μm pma treatment no significant differences were found among the pma qpcr assay and two other standard culture based methods for detection of viable e coli in environmental water in conclusion with proper pretreatment of environmental water samples this pma qpcr assay that targets the ycjm gene could quantify viable e coli cells that directly come from the feces of warm blooded animals and therefore effectively and accurately indicate the quality of environmental water graphical abstract image 1 keywords e coli pma qpcr environmental waters viable cells ycjm 1 introduction according to the world health organization who at least two billion people around the world use feces contaminated water as drinking water who 2017 various pathogens including cryptosporidium campylobacter giardia pathogenic escherichia coli shigella salmonella norovirus and rotavirus hrudey and hrudey 2007 can enter human bodies through the fecal oral route via contaminated water and cause illnesses or symptoms such as gastroenteritis dermatitis primary amebic meningoencephalitis and typhoid fever craun et al 2005 instead of directly testing a large variety of pathogens which is difficult expensive and time consuming the united states environmental protection agency epa rules involve the detection of fecal indicator bacteria fib to monitor fecal contamination in water because fib are commonly found in human and animal feces their presence may suggest the existence of pathogenic microorganisms and the possibility of health risks to humans epa 1986 as a member of fib e coli has been found to be significantly linked to gastrointestinal illnesses associated with swimming in recreational fresh water dufour 1984 for routine water quality monitoring only culture based methods for e coli are currently approved by the epa these methods necessitate long incubation times commonly about 24 h and have a high dependence on bacterial metabolism epa 2009 in contrast quantifying e coli by quantitative pcr qpcr technology only requires several hours additionally since qpcr directly detects specific genes of target microbes its accuracy and specificity are generally guaranteed frahm and obst 2003 however one limitation of qpcr is that it amplifies dna from both viable and dead cells thus overestimating the number of viable cells to achieve specific monitoring of viable e coli a viability dye viz propidium monoazide pma treatment can be combined with qpcr the principle behind the ability of pma to distinguish viable from dead cells is based on the integrity of bacterial cell membranes pma works by first penetrating the compromised membranes of dead cells under photolysis its azide groups covalently bind to cellular dna to form irreversible nitrogen carbon bonds since the bound dna is prevented from being amplified by a subsequent pcr step the dead cells are not detected fittipaldi et al 2012 on the other hand the qpcr signals emanating from viable cells including viable but non culturable vbnc cells which have intact cell membranes will not be significantly affected under certain pma concentration ranges dinu and bach 2013 it was commonly believed that e coli could only transiently remain viable after being released through fecal droppings from its primary habitat to the external environment walk et al 2007 thus when e coli cells are detected in water or food fecal contamination caused by humans or warm blood animals would be directly implicated however recently naturalized e coli have been found in natural environments which challenges current water monitoring programs around the world naturalized e coli can tolerate and maintain their populations for a prolonged time outside their hosts and have been found in soils tropical temperate and frozen temperate soils beach sands lake and river watersheds and aquatic periphyton communities byappanahalli et al 2012 thus detection of e coli in environmental waters may not accurately indicate fecal contamination and cannot truly reflect water quality walk et al 2007 recently a new set of primers targeting the putative glucosyltransferase gene ycjm of e coli was developed and found to be enteric specific and able to differentiate among naturalized e coli strains and e coli strains isolated from human and animal feces deng et al 2014 we believe that targeting the ycjm gene in a q pcr allows for more selective and accurate detection of e coli from only fecal sources therefore the objective of this research was to employ and apply a pma qpcr that targets the ycjm gene for estimating only viable non naturalized e coli in environmental waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains fecal e

cells each sample was prepared by spiking 100 ml peptone water with 1 ml of diluted viable e coli followed by thorough shaking to mix and filtration through a sterile 0 45 μm 47 mm white gridded filter membrane emd millipore corp billerica ma usa the membrane was then transferred into a 50 ml sterile centrifuge tube that contained 25 ml peptone water residues on the membrane were washed off by pipetting the peptone water on the membrane several times using a 1 ml pipette the membrane was removed above the liquid surface while still attached to the inner wall of the centrifuge tube and cells were collected by centrifugation at 8000 g for 25 min the pellet was re suspended in 1 ml peptone water and transferred into a 1 7 ml microcentrifuge tube counts of the collected cells were checked by the agar plating method and found to be similar to that of the original spiking concentration for pma staining 2 5 μl of pma working solution 2 mm were applied to make the final concentration of pma 5 μm dna isolation and qpcr steps were conducted as described earlier 2 8 application of pma qpcr to tap and environmental waters spiked with mixed viable and dead e coli cells all tested water samples were autoclaved before spiking to avoid the potential influence of viable cells that might originally exist in the samples based on the various levels of water turbidity different sample volumes pre treatment steps and pma concentrations were applied for tap and environmental waters collected in the winter months december to february 2015 a 100 ml sample volume was chosen and samples were processed following the steps described in the preceding section with an additional centrifugation step at 2000 g for 1 min to remove suspended particles before applying a 10 μm pma treatment for environmental waters collected in the summer months may to august 2015 10 ml samples were used and exposed to several pre treatment steps viz samples were mixed with 20 ml peptone water and centrifuged at 2000 g for 1 min after the centrifugation of supernatants again at 8000 g for 10 min pellets were re suspended in 1 ml peptone water and transferred to 1 7 ml microcentrifuge tubes followed by centrifugation at 2000 g for 1 5 min the supernatants were finally treated with 20 μm pma by adding 10 μl of 2 mm pma the following dna extraction and qpcr steps were conducted as mentioned previously 2 9 correlation of pma qpcr and epa method 1603 for detection of viable e coli cells in spiked tap lake and river waters water samples were spiked with viable e coli cells at various concentrations two equivalent water samples with the same volume and bacterial concentration were processed and e coli cells respectively detected by pma qpcr as described above and also by following the epa method 1603 culture based method 2 10 comparison among pma qpcr qpcr epa method 1603 and colilert for detection of viable e coli cells in spiked lake and river waters one milliliter of 103 cfu ml viable e coli cells was spiked into 10 ml water samples including water from lake of the ozarks missouri river and mississippi river all collected in july 2015 water samples of different types were prepared separately and found to have similar counts of e coli cells samples were processed followed by qpcr pma qpcr and epa method 1603 as described above for colilert detection results were obtained by using the colilert and 51 well quanti tray system idexx westbrook me usa according to the manufacturer s directions 2 11 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed using spss ibm armonk ny usa microsoft excel software microsoft corporation redmond washington usa and the minitab 16 software minitab inc state college pa usa all experiments were repeated twice means for duplicate log e coli aerobic plate counts were plotted against means for triplicate quantification cycle cq values obtained by qpcr or pma qpcr a significance level of 0 05 was used when comparing differences 3 results 3 1 specificity of ycjm primers the specificity of the ycjm primers for e coli and closely related shigella strains was analyzed by sybr green qpcr fecal e coli included e coli strains isolated from chicken c cattle ct duck d deer dr dog dg goat gt goose g human h pig p and raccoon r compared with the tuf and uida primer sets the ycjm primer set showed superior specificity for e coli strains amplifying dna from only e coli except for e coli d8 and not from shigella which is a closely related species table 2 the negative result of the ycjm primers for e coli d8 might be because this strain had transmitted itself from the environment to an animal s intestinal tract and was then isolated from animal feces 3 2 effect of light exposure time of pma treatment on qpcr assay light exposure is a critical factor for pma treatment of samples because it does not only activate the dye to crosslink with nucleic acids but it also inactivates any excess dye from forming hydroxyl amines as fig 1 shows a light exposure time of as long as 20 min did not inhibit the dna amplification of viable e coli cells on the other hand the cq values increased with the extension of the light exposure time from 1 min to 10 min for heat killed cells which illustrated the increasing inhibition of the qpcr amplification of dead cells by the pma treatment because the inhibition curve of log 5 cfu ml dead cells became constant with exposure times of 10 min and longer while viable cells were not affected fig 1 a light exposure of 10 min was selected in this study 3 3 influence of pma concentration on qpcr no increase in cq value for dead cells was yielded starting at a pma concentration of 5 μm fig 2 this indicated that a minimal concentration of 5 μm pma was needed to stain as many as 105 cfu ml dead cells on the other hand no significant increase in cq value was observed for 105 cfu ml viable cells treated with up to 20 μm pma the treatment of 50 μm pma however showed cytotoxic effects on viable cells as indicated by the increasing cq value fig 2 by combining the results above as shown in figs 1 and 2 the final pma concentration of 5 for pure cultures 10 or 20 μm for spiked water samples was used for subsequent experiments in this study based on the different turbidity levels of the water samples 3 4 detection range of pma qpcr no significant differences were found between the cq values of the pma treated and untreated groups and the detection ranges for pure viable e coli by both qpcr and pma qpcr were from 102 to 106 cfu 100 ml peptone water fig 3 these results demonstrated that a 5 μm pma treatment did not have a significantly negative effect on detection of viable e coli by qpcr whereby the detection limit of the pma qpcr could be as low as 102 cfu pure culture of viable e coli 100 ml fig 3 3 5 comparison of the pma qpcr results among spiked tap lake and river waters one milliliter of 105 cfu ml viable cells or a mixture of 1 ml dead 105 cfu ml and 1 ml viable 105 cfu ml cells was respectively spiked into 100 ml autoclaved water samples including tap water lake of the ozarks water collected in february 2015 and missouri river water collected in february 2015 fig 4 shows higher cq values of the pma treated dead viable e coli mixture group than those of the untreated mixture group but not significantly different from that of the treated viable cells group p 0 05 indicating that the pma treatment efficiently removed the false positive signals from dna of 105 cfu ml dead cells however unlike the other two types of water the cq value of the pma treated e coli cell mixture group for lake water was between the cq value of the treated viable cells alone group and that of the untreated cell mixture group fig 4 this indicated the bigger influence of dead cell dna on the detection of viable e coli in lake water spiked with the dead live cell mixture this inefficiency of the pma treatment might be because of the presence of higher levels of fine suspended solid particles in lake water that still remained in the sample which prevented full light penetration of pma during the photo activation step fittipaldi et al 2012 van frankenhuyzen et al 2013 thus a higher pma concentration and smaller sample volume which would be expected to contain less suspended solid particles were applied for further studies with more turbid water samples 3 6 application of the optimized pma qpcr to spiked tap and lake waters for tap water the cq value of the untreated dead and viable mixture group was significantly lower than those of the other two groups fig 5 a indicating that log 5 cfu 100 ml dead cells could cause false positive results if the pma treatment was not applied prior to qpcr on the other hand no significant differences p 0 05 in cq values were found between the dead and viable mixture group and the viable cells group when detected by the pma qpcr although the slopes of their standard curves were slightly different fig 5 however for lake of the ozarks water collected in winter february 2015 the pma treatment was not able to completely allow for the differentiation of viable from dead cells although the cq value of the dead and viable cell mixture group by pma qpcr was higher than that of the untreated mixture group by qpcr a slight overestimation of viable cell numbers in the mixture was observed when compared with the viable cells group detected by pma qpcr fig 5b for lake of the ozarks water collected in july 2015 which was very turbid due to rain and floods that summer a small sample volume of 10 ml several low speed centrifugation steps of sample pretreatment and a higher pma concentration of 20 μm were used brief low speed short time centrifugation steps as mentioned above were conducted in the pretreatment step to remove suspended particles in environmental water samples while not significantly removing bacterial cells these centrifugation conditions were optimized by a preliminary study data not shown as a result good consistency was found between the two pma treated groups fig 5c this meant that with the appropriate pretreatment the pma treatment efficiently inhibited all significant amplification of 104 cfu 10 ml dead e coli cells even in the presence of heavily suspended solids and other background microflora without significantly reducing its sensitivity this was shown by the detection limit for lake of the ozarks water collected in the summer which was 102 cfu 10 ml however since suspended solids have a similar physical behavior as that of bacterial cells in water some fine sized particles could still exist in the sample supernatant and can prevent full light penetration of the pma in the subsequent photo activation step therefore an adequate pre treatment of water samples is still critical before effective application of pma qpcr for regular quality monitoring of turbid environmental or waste water samples that contain various suspended materials among all three types of water samples tested the difference between the cq values of the viable and dead cell mixtures by qpcr and by pma qpcr decreased with increasing concentrations of viable cells fig 5 one possible explanation for this is that the more viable cells present in a sample the less impact dead cells would have on the increase in the total dna signal fittipaldi et al 2012 3 7 correlation between pma qpcr and epa method 1603 for detection of viable e coli in spiked tap lake and river waters to determine the correlation between the pma qpcr and epa method 1603 different types of equal volume water samples were spiked with various concentrations of viable e coli cells fig 6 bacterial counts were calculated from cq values that were indicated by pma pcr using regression equation from our standard curve for tap water fig 5a strong and significant correlations were found among all four types of water tested regardless of whether they were collected in the winter or summer as their r2s were all greater than 90 for all water types intercept parameters were very close to zero statistically thus only the slope values of each regression equation were used for comparing the bacterial counts detected by both pma qpcr and method 1603 since their slopes were all close to 1 no under or over estimation was observed by the pma pcr method in relation to the results of epa method 1603 3 8 comparison among pma qpcr qpcr epa method 1603 and colilert with quanti tray for detection of viable e coli in spiked lake and river waters one milliliter of 103 cfu ml viable e coli cells was respectively spiked into 10 ml autoclaved water samples collected from lake of the ozarks missouri river and mississippi river and analyzed by pma qpcr qpcr epa method 1603 and colilert combined with quanti tray lake of the ozarks missouri river and mississippi river water samples used in this section were all collected in july and had higher turbidity compared with the environmental waters collected in the winter in order to reduce the amount of suspended solid particles and to improve the performance of pma in the subsequent photo induced crosslinking step 10 ml water samples were used instead of 100 ml to remain consistent the 10 ml volume was applied for all four detection methods used in this section by autoclaving all microbial cells in each water sample were killed to eliminate the influence of viable cells that originally existed enumeration results by the four different methods among the environmental waters were compared as four different groups no interaction between water type and detection method was observed data not shown and the estimations of viable cells by qpcr without pma treatment among the three types of water samples were higher than those by the other three detection methods fig 7 the pma qpcr results on the other hand were not significantly different from the two culture based detection methods p 0 05 these results demonstrate that without pma treatment qpcr would overestimate the total amount of viable e coli since the dna from compromised cells and free dna fragments can also be amplified by the qpcr procedure wagner et al 2008 when only comparing between the pma qpcr and qpcr results among the three types of water the biggest difference was found for mississippi river water fig 7 which might be because it contained more free dna fragments or suspended solids that influenced the pcr assay than the two other water samples in this study qpcr showed an overestimation of viable e coli cells compared with pma qpcr and the culture based methods fig 7 in principle the estimation by pma qpcr could also be higher than those of culture based methods considering that vbnc cells that exist in environmental water would be detected by pma qpcr yokomachi and yaguchi 2012 however results from the pma qpcr were found not to be significantly different from those of the culture based methods p 0 05 fig 7 this could be because all the tested water samples were autoclaved before being spiked to ensure similar concentrations of viable e coli among all the samples 4 discussion current enumeration methods for e coli that are approved by the epa are all culture based methods that require overnight incubations in this study pma treatment combined with qpcr was tested on dead viable and a mixture of dead and viable e coli cells to provide a rapid estimation of only viable e coli cells in various types of water samples to target e coli various genes including uida uidr lacz tuf phoe cadc hns allan 16s rrna 23s rrna ahmed et al 2012 bej et al 1991 chetta and others 2012 frahm and obst 2003 foulds et al 2002 maheux et al 2009 have been used in other applications of pcr among these target genes the uida gene encoding the activity of β d glucuronidase was the most widely utilized and is also the standard target gene to confirm the presence of e coli epa 2009 however it was found that uida primers might lead to false negative results when detecting certain e coli isolates khan et al 2007 or false positive results or an overestimation since shigella can also be detected maheux et al 2009 in this study the ycjm primer pair targeting the putative glucosyltransferase gene ycjm was shown to be more accurate at monitoring fecal contamination of environmental samples since it did not amplify dna from shigella or from naturalized e coli strains that exist in the environment deng et al 2014 for pma treatment of e coli cells in environmental water samples several main factors were investigated in this research including light exposure time of pma pma concentration the type of matrix turbidity and the existence of dead cells a light exposure time of 10 min was chosen in this study because it did not increase the cq value of log 5 cfu ml dead cells when in a mixture with varying concentrations of viable e coli cells fig 1 in comparison the photolysis time of pma in previous studies usually ranges from 3 to 10 min gensberger et al 2014 li et al 2014 luo et al 2010 based on the bacterial species light source halogen or led distance of the sample from the light source sample turbidity and other factors fittipaldi et al 2012 when comparing the effects of different pma concentrations on e coli cells a concentration dependent cytotoxicity of pma on viable e coli was observed this was consistent with findings of previous research fittipaldi et al 2012 liu and mustapha 2014 considering that a typically high turbidity of environmental waters might affect the efficiency of pma treatment by blocking the light during the light exposure step most researchers applied relatively high pma amounts to treat water samples gensberger et al 2014 used 10 μm pma to treat e coli in drinking water and processed water samples and higher amounts of 50 μm yokomachi and yaguchi 2012 100 μm li et al 2014 and even 200 μm were used to treat wastewater sewage sludge and biosolids van frankenhuyzen et al 2013 in complex environmental samples many factors such as ph heavy metals humic acids and phenolic compounds as well as water turbidity might have adverse effects on pma pcr krometis et al 2013 mendes silva and domingues 2015 this might be the reason for the significant differences in cq values found among tap lake and river water samples in this study fig 4 the inefficiency of the pma treatment observed for lake of the ozarks water collected in winter fig 5b was most likely due to the turbidity of this water sample data not shown the number of nephelometric turbidity units ntu is one of the parameters to evaluate water turbidity levels and the value depends on the presence of suspended materials such as soil particles clay silt and sand algae plankton and microorganisms in the water sample an increase in ntu indicates that the environmental water sample contains high levels of suspended solids and becomes darker preventing light from penetrating and thus inhibiting the crosslinking of viability dyes li et al 2014 the ntu of the environmental waters used in this study as detected by a turbidity probe indicated that the mississippi river was the most turbid 120 ntu among the three water samples tested only quite clear water samples turbidities of less than 10 ntu did not prevent pma from reducing the signals from dead cells luo et al 2010 however bae and wuertz 2009 stated that after optimization steps pma qpcr could still function properly at relatively high solid concentrations tss 1000 mg l to reduce the inhibition of solids fittipaldi et al 2012 claimed that samples could be diluted to 1 2 ntu before the dye treatment however this might result in a low concentration of viable cells which may in turn lead to false negative results using a smaller sample volume is another alternative way to prevent the inhibition of solids on pma photo activation since the total amount of sediments is reduced for environmental water samples a small sample volume is commonly applied in a pma pcr assay such as 5 ml yokomachi and yaguchi 2012 10 ml varma et al 2009 and 15 ml li 2014 in fact culture based methods also use small volumes when testing turbid water samples to prevent sediments from blocking the filtration step epa 2009 the presence of dead cells can affect the efficiency of the pma treatment especially when viable cells are in much lower concentrations this means that when a high concentration of dead cells is present an overestimation of viable cell numbers might still occur by pma qpcr this phenomenon might be because a larger number of dead cells may have a higher capacity of taking up the dye hence causing less available dye molecules per cell to bind with the dna fittipaldi et al 2012 in this research following pma treatment up to log 5 cfu 100 ml dead cells did not mask the detection of log 3 log 6 cfu 100 ml viable cells when they were mixed together in tap water further log 4 cfu 10 ml dead cells did not mask the detection of log 2 log 5 cfu 10 ml viable cells in the lake of ozarks water collected in the summer these results are consistent with those of kantonale laboratorium 2009 in that the ratio between viable and dead cells of e coli should be greater than 1 and free dna could not be greater than 4 105 in copy numbers however a lower ratio of 0 1 fittipaldi et al 2012 and a higher ratio of 10 yokomachi and yaguchi 2012 have also been claimed by other researchers the pma qpcr assay in this study could detect as low as 102 cfu 100 ml viable e coli in peptone water fig 3 after pretreatment of water samples it could selectively detect 103 cfu 100 ml viable e coli cells in the presence of 105 cfu 100 ml dead cells for tap water and environmental water samples collected in winter and 102 cfu 10 ml viable cells in the presence of 104 cfu 10 ml dead cells for environmental water samples collected in summer without any enrichment steps fig 5 however a higher sensitivity of pma qpcr is still needed to fulfill epa regulations since the criterion for e coli is 126 cfu in 100 ml fresh recreational waters epa 1986 and 0 cfu 100 ml in drinking water epa tantawiwat et al 2005 detected e coli at concentrations of 100 101 cfu ml in water only after 6 h of enrichment therefore to increase the sensitivity of detection a pre enrichment step might be needed for the pma qpcr assay however this would make the enumeration of the original concentration of e coli impossible alternatively the volume of a water sample can be increased to compensate for the insufficient sensitivity of detection some researchers claimed that qpcr for quantitating e coli results in up to a 98 agreement with culture based methods for drinking water and environmental water frahm and obst 2003 noble et al 2010 however noble et al 2010 found that qpcr underestimated the total count of e coli in recreational water which might be caused by the loss of e coli cells during the processing steps or false positive results of standard colilert 18 tests most studies showed that qpcr could detect significantly higher numbers of e coli in water than can culture based methods ahmed et al 2012 khan et al 2007 truchado et al 2016 one explanation was that qpcr could detect dna from both viable and nonviable cells ahmed et al 2012 truchado et al 2016 in addition vbnc or free phase cells that commonly exist under multiple environmental stresses such as those caused by temperature and salinity could also be detected by qpcr noble and weisberg 2005 krometis et al 2013 moreover qpcr could successfully detect β glucuronidase negative e coli isolates while most epa approved culture based methods including method 1603 and colilert test depend on detecting the actual β d glucuronidase activity in e coli bej et al 1991 when detecting viable e coli cells our developed pma qpcr assay targeting the putative glucosyltransferase gene ycjm had strong correlation and similar estimation with current standard β d glucuronidase activity based culture methods viz epa method 1603 and colilert figs 6 and 7 more importantly when compared with qpcr epa 1603 and colilert methods pma qpcr may achieve a more precise indication of fresh fecal contamination since it can reduce dead cell signals and estimate the numbers of vbnc cells as viable cells in addition targeting the ycjm gene further improved the accuracy of the qpcr assay because more accurate differentiation of enteric e coli from naturalized strains of e coli can be realized even though the pretreatment steps of environmental water may require some processing time the total testing time is still several hours shorter than that of traditional culture based methods therefore this work demonstrated that a pma qpcr assay that targets the ycjm gene as developed in this research could be a rapid and accurate alternative to standard culture based methods for e coli based environmental water quality monitoring however more rigorous testings using actual water samples from diverse environmental settings need to be further conducted 5 conclusions current e coli enumeration methods that are approved by the epa are all culture based methods which are time consuming and labor intensive in this study pma treatment combined with qpcr was tested on dead viable and a mixture of dead and viable e coli cells to provide a comprehensive validation of the application of pma qpcr for detecting viable e coli in environmental water the ycjm primer set which could differentiate e coli strains that exist in the feces of warm blood animals from naturalized e coli strains detected most of the e coli strains isolated from animal feces but did not amplify dna from shigella strains after pretreatment of water samples the pma qpcr assay could selectively detect 103 cfu 100 ml viable e coli cells in the presence of 105 cfu 100 ml dead cells for environmental water samples collected in winter and 102 cfu 10 ml viable cells in the presence of 104 cfu 10 ml dead cells for environmental water samples collected in summer without any enrichment steps to achieve better suppression of dna amplification by pma treatment further studies should also focus on the pre treatment of water sample to remove suspended solids more efficiently while not causing a significant loss of bacterial cells in order to be consistent with standard culture based methods a larger sample volume such as 100 ml should be applied in further studies in addition a bigger amplicon size of the target gene might be considered when detecting viable e coli cells the developed pma qpcr assay targeting the putative glucosyltransferase gene ycjm had strong correlation and similar estimation with current standard β d glucuronidase activity based culture methods such as epa method 1603 and colilert this work demonstrated that a pma qpcr assay targeting the ycjm gene could be an alternative to standard

19317,groundwater gw is one of the most abundant water resources and around 1 5 billion people rely on gw as their main water supply manganese mn and iron fe are very common gw contaminants even though their presence is considered mainly as an organoleptic and operational nuisance water with elevated mn content may also lead to adverse health impacts amongst the most common treatment processes currently used to treat domestic gw supplies catalytic filtration may lead to mn leaching if improperly maintained while ion exchange consumes a considerable amount of salt and produces a brine waste which pollutes the environment thus it is proposed to design a simple yet robust treatment system which can be implemented in small remote communities or even domestic applications to this end the main objective of this investigation was to assess the potential application of novel outside in sulfonated polyethersulfone thin film composite hollow fiber nanofiltration hfnf membranes to remove dissolved mn fe and natural organic matter nom from domestic gw supplies of particular interest was the impact of gw matrix on performance of the hfnf membranes our experimental findings demonstrated that in absence of hardness and the cumulative throughput of 1 9 l m2 above 90 of mn fe and nom were retained by the examined hfnf membranes mwco 200 da regardless of their initial concentrations in the feed solution 250 1000 μ g l in contrast increasing the hardness level reduced the removal of mn and fe ions xps analysis revealed that the surface properties of the hfnf membranes were altered when the membranes were exposed to calcium and magnesium salts these observations were attributed to the propensity for ca and mg ions to bind to the sulfonic groups present on the surface of the hfnf membranes which subsequently weakens rejection by charge exclusion on the other hand in the absence of gw hardness charge exclusion was mainly responsible for rejection of dissolved mn and fe it was also found that gw hardness had no marked impact on the nom rejection as the later was mostly removed by size exclusion graphical abstract image 1 keywords hollow fiber nanofiltration groundwater treatment manganese iron and natural organic matter removal hardness impact charge and size exclusion effects 1 introduction groundwater gw accounts for 96 of the unfrozen fresh water supply and is the source of 20 40 of the worlds drinking water in north america approximately 27 of canadians and 44 of the united states population rely on gw as their main drinking water source domestic wells are the most common water source for individual dwellings located in remote areas high levels of dissolved manganese mn and iron fe often naturally co exist in gw as a result of weathering and leaching of metal bearing minerals and rocks civardi and tompeck 2015 historically high concentrations of mn and fe in drinking water were thought to mainly cause aesthetic and operational problems such as colored water reddish to brownish color metallic taste and odor elevated turbidity and staining of laundry and plumbing fixture civardi and tompeck 2015 for that reason health canada guidelines for canadian drinking water quality summary table 2017 and the us epa dietrich 2015 recommended aesthetic objective limits of 50 and 300 μ g l for mn and fe concentration in potable water accordingly nonetheless complaints are still common when the levels of mn and fe are below these thresholds civardi and tompeck 2015 in addition to the aforementioned issues there are increased concerns related to the health risk associated with the presence of mn in tap waters bouchard and co workers performed an extensive epidemiological study on the adverse impact of manganese exposure in drinking water and stated that even a fairly low mn level in finished water may result in neurological effects in children such as lower iq or lower neurobehavioral functions i e hyperactivity memory and attention bouchard et al 2011 oulhote et al 2014 dion et al 2018 as a result health canada proposed in 2016 maximum acceptable mn concentrations for aesthetic 20 μ g mn l and health 100 μ g mn l manganese in drinking water 2016 catalytic filtration or cationic ion exchange resins ix coupled with a reverse osmosis ro unit installed at the kitchen tap are the most common treatment strategies to remove mn fe from domestic wells vaarama and lehto 2003 however operation and maintenance complexity along with the risk of mn leaching from the media impair the applicability of catalytic filtration systems carriere et al 2011 even though implementation of the ix ro treatment process is simple and achieves high mn and fe removal high salt consumption and production of spent brine during the ix regeneration step as well as the removal of beneficial nutrients in the finished water due to the retention of all dissolved species by the point of use ro are disadvantages of this treatment option carriere et al 2011 barbeau et al 2011 nutrients in drinking water 2005 as an alternative application of point of entry nanofiltration nf membranes is a promising approach to simultaneously address several water quality issues such as trace metals al rashdi et al 2013 natural organic matter nom al amoudi 2010 and pathogens removal patterson et al 2012 most of the commercially available nf membranes are thin film composite tfc polyamide spiral wound modules with none or limited hydraulic cleaning capabilities urper et al 2017 van der bruggen et al 2008 hollow fiber nanofiltration hfnf membranes on the other hand offer a number of advantages over spiral wound modules as they 1 can stand more severe fouling 2 possess higher packing density and larger surface area per unit of member module which yields in a superior productivity and 3 can be implemented with a minimal pre treatment step ong and chung 2013 in this regard we are putting forth the hypothesis that implementation of hfnf membranes leads to efficient removal of dissolved mn fe and nom from gw the retention of nom from waters mainly surface waters via polyamide nf membranes is well documented al amoudi 2010 der bruggen et al 2008 hong and elimelech 1997 it is claimed that in the ph range of natural waters humic substances which are known as the major mass fraction of nom are negatively charged and as a result repelled by the negatively charged nf membranes al amoudi 2010 hong and elimelech 1997 however it has been stated that high ionic strength and presence of divalent cations can lead to a coiled and compacted configuration of nom in the feed solution and subsequently formation of a dense and thicker fouling layer on the surface of the nf membrane al amoudi 2010 despite the fact that a several studies reported successful practice of nf process for water softening and removal of inorganic compounds such as arsenic al amoudi 2010 van der bruggen et al 2008 hilal et al 2004 limited attention has been paid to the possibility of mn removal from drinking water resources by nf al rashdi et al 2013 munari and schafer 2010 molinari et al 2001 based on the outcomes of these studies application of nf for mn removal from water seemed to be a promising approach however the presented data on mn removal were case specific and cannot be easily extrapolated to other water sources moreover the impact of membrane specifications and water matrix on mn retention and its removal mechanisms were not clearly explained in addition no research effort has evaluated the possibility of simultaneous removal of dissolved mn fe and nom from gw supplies by means of tfc hfnf membranes therefore the main focus of this investigation is to assess the potential use of hfnf membranes to remove dissolved mn fe and nom from domestic gw supplies more specifically the objectives of this study are to i quantify the effect of the initial concentrations of dissolved mn fe and nom and co existence of these solutes on the hfnf performance and ii determine the impact of the gw matrix and particularly the significance of the gw hardness type mg vs ca and concentration on the overall efficiency of the hfnf process discriminating the key parameters responsible for effective removal of dissolved mn fe and nom from gw and identifying the mechanisms ruling their retentions will enable us to design a simple yet robust system to treat gw supplies for small communities and individual dwellings where financial and technical resources are limited 2 experimental 2 1 materials outside in sulfonated polyethersulfone spes thin film composite tfc hfnf membranes modules with approximately 4 times superior packing density than spiral wound nf were kindly provided by toyobo note that in an outside in module feed passes from outside of the fibers to the inside and the permeate exists from the hollow side of the fibers the hfnf membrane modules are chlorine resistant and backwashable in addition their outside in configuration minimizes plugging issues the specifications of the hfnf membranes and modules used are given in table 1 to prepare the model and synthetic gw

humic substances society st paul minneapolis usa were added to milli q water assays were also conducted using a natural groundwater collected from sainte marthe water utility quebec canada upon collection the natural gw was filtered by means of a vacuum filtration apparatus and a 0 45 μm hydrophilic polyethersulfone pes filter paper supor pes membrane disc filters pall us to remove suspended solids table 1 presents the specifications of sainte marthe gw resource the nom content of the natural gw was normalized to 1 mg c l by diluting it with milli q water after the vacuum filtration step the hardness alkalinity and sodium concentrations of the natural gw were then adjusted to their initial values by addition of appropriate amounts of m g s o 4 and c a s o 4 and n a c l stock solutions mn and fe concentrations of the natural gw was artificially elevated to 1 mg l by spiking pre determined volumes of m n s o 4 and f e s o 4 stock solutions to the feed tank in order to prevent the formation and precipitation of ferric hydroxide throughout the filtration experiments and stabilize the ph of the feed solution at 7 0 0 2 for both synthetic and natural gw solutions nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases were bubbled into the feed tank before spiking the stock solutions 2 2 experimental protocol 2 2 1 filtration experiments the filtration tests were carried out at a constant transmembrane pressure p 5 bars using a lab scale mini module of hfnf operated in cross flow filtration using a 0 5 l min feed flowrate corresponding to 0 14 m s cross flow velocity and the cumulative throughout of 1 9 l m2 to maintain the feed characteristics constant the concentrate and permeate streams were sent back to the feed tank fig 1 the feed temperature was fixed at 10 1 c by using a jacket coiled chiller it should be pointed out that this operational temperature was chosen based on the average gw temperature in southern quebec canada throughout each filtration assay temperature pressure and flow rate of the feed concentrate and permeate lines were recorded automatically every 20 s while samples were taken from each line every hour to quantify the concentrations of mn fe and nom the oxygen and ph levels of the feed were monitored continuously by means of a portable oxygen ph kit hach hq11d portable meter kit each filtration assay involved an hour of pre and post forward flush of milli q water and pure water flux pwf measurement at a constant transmembrane pressure of 5 bars all the filtration experiments were performed in triplicate 2 2 2 chemical cleaning after each filtration assay the permeate stream was closed and a four step sequential chemical cleaning i e naoh milli q water citric acid and milli q water was performed to wash remove any foulants that might remain in the system and restore the membranes specifications for the next filtration test it should be noted that the above mentioned cleaning cycle was performed even in the case that the initial pwf was achieved after the filtration experiment the ph of the naoh and citric acid were 12 and 2 respectively the duration of each step of the chemical cleaning cycle was 30 min and during this period the chemical cleaning agent was recirculating the operating temperature was 22 2 c 2 3 design of experiments two consecutive experimental phases were designed the first phase evaluated the performance of the hfnf for the retention of mn fe and nom and the investigation of the impact of the co existence of solutes on the process performance the second phase investigated the contribution of the gw matrix on the removal of mn fe and nom in this regard we first determined the removals of mn fe and nom for different hardness levels and type mg vs ca by varying the concentration of c a s o 4 or m g s o 4 of the synthetic gw solutions then we compared the rejection of different components in synthetic and natural gw and proposed the rejection mechanisms governing the retention of these species 2 4 analyses 2 4 1 membrane characterizations even though zeta potential and particularly streaming potential measurement has been extensively used to determine the surface charge of the nf membranes and the impact of the feed solution chemistry on the charged nf surface childress and elimelech 1996 teixeira et al 2005 yang et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge there is no commercially available cell to hold the hfnf membranes during the zeta potential measurement the external diameter of these membranes which can be considered as their thickness is larger than the flat sheet membranes and as a result they are not fitted inside a conventional flat membrane cell moreover flattening the fibers is a complicated procedure and might adversely impact the precision of the zeta potential results thus based on the above mentioned limitations no zeta potential measurement was done for the present work 2 4 1 1 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis the effect of the gw specifications and principally its hardness type and concentration role on the hfnf surface properties were studied by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps xps with a very high sensitivity provided us the elemental compositions and chemical bonds of the top 0 5 nm of the hfnf membrane surface to quantify any potential binding of ca and mg ions to the hfnf membrane surface via xps technique the virgin membranes were first rinsed and immersed in milli q water for 24 h then they were brought into direct contact with c a s o 4 or m g s o 4 solutions at three different concentrations i e 0 5 1 5 and 2 5 mm and ph 7 0 0 1 for one hour to remove the non binded ca2 and mg2 from the hfnf surface the membranes were rinsed off thoroughly with milli q water prior to the xps analysis the membranes were vacuum dried yang et al 2017 the operational conditions of the xps analysis are listed in appendix a 2 4 1 2 atomic force microscopy afm analysis an atomic force microscopy model e sweep spi4000 sii nt was employed to characterize the surface roughness of the virgin hfnf membrane an area of 2 μm 2 μm of the membrane was scanned via dfm mode q control in water it is worth mentioning that the surface roughness of the used hfnf membrane after filtration experiment was not determined due to the difficulty to remove the used hfnf membrane from the membrane module and the potential risk of distortion of the surface of the detached membrane 2 4 2 analytical methods total and dissolved mn fe ca and mg concentrations of the feed concentrate and permeate samples were measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes model icap 6000 thermo instruments inc the samples were preserved with 0 5 wt h n o 3 fisher optima high purity grade immediately after their collection prior to the measurement of each element a calibration curve was run and the concentration of a standard solution and a blank sample were determined for quality assurance after every 20 unknown samples it should be noted that in all the filtration experiments the differences between the total and dissolved 0 45 μm filterable mn fe ca and mg were negligible and therefore only total concentrations are reported in this work in the course of this study we quantified nom content as dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and measured the nom concentration of the feed permeate and concentrate using an on line toc analyser model sievers m 5310 c ge instruments usa 2 4 3 statistical analyses the experimental data were presented as means standard deviation and subjected to one way and multiple way statistical analyses of variance with the common level of significance set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of hfnf membranes on retention of mn fe and nom 3 1 1 feed with a single solute fig 2 demonstrates that the hfnf membranes can reject around 95 of dissolved mn and fe and retain up to 92 of nom from the model solution containing a single solute at ph 7 0 independent of their initial concentrations note that the reported data are independent of the specific volume and sampling time based on the statistical analysis increasing the concentrations of mn fe and nom from 250 to 1000 μg l had no significant impact on the rejection performance of the hfnf membranes p 0 39 the hfnf membranes permeability was slightly lower than that of the pwf but constant during the 4 h filtration assays trends not presented the concentrations of mn fe and nom in the feed water were constant data not shown throughout the filtration experiments indicating that no pronounced fouling or adsorption took place in addition the difference between the pre and post pwf values were not considerable 2 reflecting that no severe membrane fouling occurred during the filtration of the model solutions containing a single solute similar rejection values of mn and fe by the hfnf membranes can be explained by the fact that both of these divalent cations have a net charge of 2 and a similar hydrated radius epsztein et al 2018 volkov et al 1997 the rejection mechanisms by the hfnf membranes are further discussed in section 3 2 3 1 2 feed with multi solutes filtration of model solutions containing more than one species i e mixture of mineral salts or mineral salts with nom via hfnf membranes achieved high retentions of mn fe and nom 90 fig 3 co existence of m n s o 4 and f e s o 4 salts with nom in the feed solution did not affect the retention performance of the hfnf membranes significantly regardless of their initial concentrations p 0 34 similar to the filtration of the model solutions with a single solute the permeability was marginally lower than for the pwf and remained constant throughout the 4 h filtration test data not shown even though some researchers have reported that the combination of fe and nom could lead to the formation of fe nom complexes which would deposit on the membrane surface and subsequently cause membrane fouling and permeate flux decline hong and elimelech 1997 ahn et al 2008 liao et al 2007 the observed stable permeate flux and almost identical pre and post pwf values suggest that no fouled layer was built on the surface of the hfnf membranes such an observation can likely be related to the low initial concentration of nom in the feed solution and in turn the lower formation of nom complexes with fe in addition the smooth surface of the hfnf as can be seen in fig 4 may have limited the fouling of the membranes in general the surface roughness is considered as a tool to quantitatively predict the initial membrane fouling behaviour hilal et al 2004 vrijenhoek et al 2001 a number of studies boussu et al 200 638 vrijenhoek et al 2001 elimelech et al 1997 hilal et al 2005 boussu et al 200 638 have reported that the initial stage of fouling takes place in the valleys of rough membranes therefore membranes with smoother surfaces are expected offer better antifouling properties as presented in table 3 the mean roughness of the tested hfnf membranes is lower than polyamide nf270 and nf90 membranes 1 780 nm vs 4 380 and 27 852 nm which are used in many commercial applications hilal et al 2004 furthermore it can be presumed that if any of the fe nom complexes were formed the hydrodynamic conditions and most importantly the applied crossflow velocity was robust enough to wash away any deposit layer attached to the membrane surface bian et al 2000 3 1 3 impact of hardness type and concentration on hfnf membranes performance the following section describes the effectiveness of the hfnf membranes for the rejection of mn fe and nom from synthetic gw solutions in the presence of low moderate and high hardness levels primarily we studied the contribution of hardness type and concentration by filtering synthetic gw solution containing c a s o 4 or m g s o 4 at three different concentrations and then we compared the results with the filtration data of natural gw with a high hardness level i e 250 mg c a c o 3 l as illustrated in fig 5 a increasing the concentration of ca ions in the feed solution considerably lowered p 0 002 the rejection of mn and fe whereas the retention of nom remained unchanged p 0 34 similarly elevating the mg ion content of the feed solution impaired the performance of the hfnf membranes in rejecting mn and fe however the extent of this negative effect was lower than for ca ions fig 5 b p 0 003 similarly no significant reduction of nom removal was recorded when the mg ion concentration of the gw solutions varied from 0 5 mm to 2 5 mm p 0 41 fig 6 depicts the rejection of different compounds in synthetic and natural gw solutions it should be pointed out that the mn fe and nom concentrations were set to 1000 μg l for both solutions and the major ions in the synthetic gw had the same concentration to those in the natural gw the ph of both solutions was fixed at 7 0 0 2 the rejection of the monovalent cation i e na ions did not exceed more than 30 for both tested waters while above 40 of divalent cations mn fe ca and mg were retained since the concentration of ca ions in natural and synthetic gw solutions were almost three fold higher than mg ions see table 2 their influence was more significant and thereby the retention data of mn and fe were similar to the results presented in 5 a where the ca content was 2 5 mm similar to the above mentioned tested conditions more than 88 of nom was removed by the hfnf membranes when the synthetic or natural gw solutions were filtered it should be highlighted that measurements of pre and post pwf revealed that no severe fouling occurred during the crossflow filtration of the synthetic and natural gw and the presented results were independent of the specific volume and sampling time these observed reductions in fe mn removals in presence of high ca mg are linked with the change in the hfnf surface properties during the filtration of the synthetic gw solutions containing ca or mg ions binding of ca ions to the charged groups of the polyamide nf membranes surface has been reported in the literature childress and elimelech 1996 yang et al 2017 ahn et al 2008 in the current study ca and mg ions were most likely binded to the sulfonated charge groups of the hfnf membranes surface and altered the surface properties of the membranes the findings of xps analysis validated this hypothesis as exhibited in fig 7 compared to the virgin hfnf sample figs 7 a and fig 8 a the intensity of calcium detected signals increases for the membranes exposed to 0 5 1 5 and 2 5 mm c a s o 4 respectively fig 7 b d in a similar pattern the intensity of the mg detected signals was enhanced when the hfnf membranes were exposed to 0 5 1 5 and 2 5 mm m g s o 4 solutions fig 8 b d yang et al 2017 yang et al 2017 and do et al 2012 do et al 2012 also performed xps analysis to quantify the binding of ca ions to nf270 and nf90 membranes and demonstrated that formation of ca membrane complexes impacted the surface properties of the membranes and subsequently impaired their performance high removal of the suwannee river nom and nom in natural gw can be attributed to size exclusion due to their high molecular weights childress and elimelech 1996 ahn et al 2008 3 2 proposed rejection mechanisms the unique properties of nf membranes lie between the dense reverse osmosis ro membranes in which separation is mainly due to the solution diffusion mechanism and ultrafiltration uf membranes where transport across the membrane is governed by size exclusion i e sieving and in some cases charge effect compared to ro and uf nf provides the advantages of lower operating pressure and higher rejection respectively vaseghi et al 2015 generally both size and charge exclusion are the main separation mechanisms in nf membranes childress and elimelech 1996 tay et al 2002 ribau et al 2006 however complex interactions between feed solution specifications and properties of the nf membranes can impact the extent and significance of these mechanisms childress and elimelech 1996 tay et al 2002 ribau et al 2006 in this section we explain the underlying mechanisms involved in the retentions of mn fe and nom in absence and presence of hardness in the feed solution when model solutions containing mn and or fe salts were filtered the charged hfnf membranes were exposed to a salt solution and equilibrium took place between the membranes and solution due to the presence of fixed charged groups on the membrane surface the ionic concentration in the membranes was not equal to the of the salt solution the counter ion concentration was higher in the membranes than in the bulk phase whereas the co ion level was lower in the hfnf membranes this inequality of the ionic concentration led to a creation of potential difference i e donnan potential at the interface which impeded the passage of counter ions to the salt solution and co ions through the hfnf membranes teixeira et al 2005 schaep et al 1998 thus once the driving force i e pressure gradient was applied due to the impact of the donnan potential on repulsing co ions from the charged membrane surface and maintaining electroneutrality in the medium mainly water could pass through the membrane fig 9 a teixeira et al 2005 schaep et al 1998 retention of nom by the hfnf membranes can be attributed to both size and charge exclusion effects generally nom is negatively charged at the ph range of natural waters and exhibits high molecular weights 1000 3000 g mol and consequently would be rejected by the negatively charged nf including the tested hfnf membranes fig 9 b hong and elimelech 1997 despite the fact that for charged species such as mn and fe both size and charge play roles in their retention by the nf membranes childress and elimelech 2000 the presence of ca and mg ions in the feed solutions dramatically weakened the charge interaction impact as these ions i e ca and mg can bind to the ligand groups on the surface of the hfnf membranes alter the surface properties of the membranes and dominate the size exclusion effect accordingly from the drastic reduction in retention of mn and fe we can conclude that the tested hfnf membranes were not tight enough to sieve these ions teixeira et al 2005 yang et al 2017 on the other hand these membranes were tight enough to reject high molecular weights nom compounds fig 9 c and d in addition the more notable impact of ca ions can be due to a higher propensity of these ions to bind to the fixed charged i e sulfonic groups on the hfnf membranes surface in general the sulfonic groups tend to bind to ions with higher valency and smaller solvated hydrated volume and their preference for common cations is as follow helfferich 1995 b a 2 p b 2 s r 2 c a 2 n i 2 c d 2 c u 2 c o 2 z n 2 m g 2 a g c s k n h 4 n a h hence in this case ca ion has a smaller solvated hydrated volume than mg ion 108 a 3 vs 453 a 3 roduner 2014 and is more preferred by the sulfonic charged groups on the hfnf membranes surface similar behaviour was reported for polyamide nf membranes containing c o o fixed charged groups teixeira et al 2005 3 3 implications even though the application of the hfnf membranes in domestic gw treatment systems seemed to be an appealing pathway for effective removal of mn fe hardness nom and pathogens the presence of high level of hardness i e ca and or mg salts may decrease the performance of the process in the course of the current study this adverse impact was more marked when the amount of calcium salts was dominant in the gw matrix as ca ions possess higher tendency to form ca membrane complexes and diminished charge exclusion effect based on the filtration results we presumed that the applied hfnf membranes were not tight enough to sieve and retain mn and fe when their surface properties were affected by ca or mg ions implementation of hfnf membranes with a lower molecular weight cut off would enhance the size exclusion effect and subsequently increase the retention of mn and fe ions from hard gw supplies on the other hand since nf membranes are not selective in removal of ions and particularly divalent ions when tight hfnf membranes are used ca and mg ions would be retained by the membranes along with mn fe and nom for that reason the hfnf permeate is expected to be corrosive and should be remineralized therefore we conclude that the use of hfnf for the removal of fe mn in gws with elevated ca should be coupled with a polishing step such as a calcite contactor to adjust the hardness level of the soft permeate furthermore some researchers have reported that calcite media can partially adsorb mn and fe zachara et al 1991 mettler et al 2009 therefore integrating hfnf process with a calcite column seems to be a promising approach when a stand alone hfnf step cannot meet the regulations in terms of mn fe and hardness levels in finished water future work will evaluate the integration of the hfnf process with a calcite contactor 4 conclusion the present research assessed the performance of outside in sulfonated polyethersulfone thin film composite hfnf membranes for the removal of mn fe and nom from domestic gw supplies furthermore the main mechanisms ruling the rejection of these species in the absence and presence of hardness in gw matrix were systematically identified and studied the following conclusions were drawn from this investigation in the absence of hardness treating model solutions containing mn and or fe and or nom resulted in over 90 removal of these components regardless of their initial concentration in the feed solutions 250 1000 μg l specific volume and sampling time no marked membrane fouling due to the formation of nom complexes with ca and fe ions was detected for all the conditions investigated this observation can be attributed to i the low initial nom content in the feed solution and thus less extent of complex formation ii smooth surface of the tested hfnf membrane and iii effectiveness of hydrodynamic conditions and particularly cross flow velocity to control fouling and concentration polarization at the membrane surface for the model solutions containing mn and or fe rejection of these ions is based on charge exclusion mechanism co ions repulsion and counter ion retention due to the electroneutrality condition while both charge and size exclusion prevented the passage of nom through the membranes the presence of hardness in the form of ca and or mg salts decreased the removal of mn and fe while it had no significant impact on nom retention based on the results of the filtration experiments and xps data we deduced that binding of ca and or mg ions to the hfnf ligand groups weakened the charge exclusion effect and lowered the rejection of mn and fe ions since mg ions have a lower tendency to form complexes with the hfnf ligand groups its adverse impact on the charge exclusion mechanism is less significant compare to ca ions in these tested conditions sieving was the main rejection mechanism for nom retention by the hfnf membranes similar adverse impact of ca ions on the performance of the charged polyamide nf membranes has been reported in the literature teixeira et al 2005 acknowledgments this research was financially

19317,groundwater gw is one of the most abundant water resources and around 1 5 billion people rely on gw as their main water supply manganese mn and iron fe are very common gw contaminants even though their presence is considered mainly as an organoleptic and operational nuisance water with elevated mn content may also lead to adverse health impacts amongst the most common treatment processes currently used to treat domestic gw supplies catalytic filtration may lead to mn leaching if improperly maintained while ion exchange consumes a considerable amount of salt and produces a brine waste which pollutes the environment thus it is proposed to design a simple yet robust treatment system which can be implemented in small remote communities or even domestic applications to this end the main objective of this investigation was to assess the potential application of novel outside in sulfonated polyethersulfone thin film composite hollow fiber nanofiltration hfnf membranes to remove dissolved mn fe and natural organic matter nom from domestic gw supplies of particular interest was the impact of gw matrix on performance of the hfnf membranes our experimental findings demonstrated that in absence of hardness and the cumulative throughput of 1 9 l m2 above 90 of mn fe and nom were retained by the examined hfnf membranes mwco 200 da regardless of their initial concentrations in the feed solution 250 1000 μ g l in contrast increasing the hardness level reduced the removal of mn and fe ions xps analysis revealed that the surface properties of the hfnf membranes were altered when the membranes were exposed to calcium and magnesium salts these observations were attributed to the propensity for ca and mg ions to bind to the sulfonic groups present on the surface of the hfnf membranes which subsequently weakens rejection by charge exclusion on the other hand in the absence of gw hardness charge exclusion was mainly responsible for rejection of dissolved mn and fe it was also found that gw hardness had no marked impact on the nom rejection as the later was mostly removed by size exclusion graphical abstract image 1 keywords hollow fiber nanofiltration groundwater treatment manganese iron and natural organic matter removal hardness impact charge and size exclusion effects 1 introduction groundwater gw accounts for 96 of the unfrozen fresh water supply and is the source of 20 40 of the worlds drinking water in north america approximately 27 of canadians and 44 of the united states population rely on gw as their main drinking water source domestic wells are the most common water source for individual dwellings located in remote areas high levels of dissolved manganese mn and iron fe often naturally co exist in gw as a result of weathering and leaching of metal bearing minerals and rocks civardi and tompeck 2015 historically high concentrations of mn and fe in drinking water were thought to mainly cause aesthetic and operational problems such as colored water reddish to brownish color metallic taste and odor elevated turbidity and staining of laundry and plumbing fixture civardi and tompeck 2015 for that reason health canada guidelines for canadian drinking water quality summary table 2017 and the us epa dietrich 2015 recommended aesthetic objective limits of 50 and 300 μ g l for mn and fe concentration in potable water accordingly nonetheless complaints are still common when the levels of mn and fe are below these thresholds civardi and tompeck 2015 in addition to the aforementioned issues there are increased concerns related to the health risk associated with the presence of mn in tap waters bouchard and co workers performed an extensive epidemiological study on the adverse impact of manganese exposure in drinking water and stated that even a fairly low mn level in finished water may result in neurological effects in children such as lower iq or lower neurobehavioral functions i e hyperactivity memory and attention bouchard et al 2011 oulhote et al 2014 dion et al 2018 as a result health canada proposed in 2016 maximum acceptable mn concentrations for aesthetic 20 μ g mn l and health 100 μ g mn l manganese in drinking water 2016 catalytic filtration or cationic ion exchange resins ix coupled with a reverse osmosis ro unit installed at the kitchen tap are the most common treatment strategies to remove mn fe from domestic wells vaarama and lehto 2003 however operation and maintenance complexity along with the risk of mn leaching from the media impair the applicability of catalytic filtration systems carriere et al 2011 even though implementation of the ix ro treatment process is simple and achieves high mn and fe removal high salt consumption and production of spent brine during the ix regeneration step as well as the removal of beneficial nutrients in the finished water due to the retention of all dissolved species by the point of use ro are disadvantages of this treatment option carriere et al 2011 barbeau et al 2011 nutrients in drinking water 2005 as an alternative application of point of entry nanofiltration nf membranes is a promising approach to simultaneously address several water quality issues such as trace metals al rashdi et al 2013 natural organic matter nom al amoudi 2010 and pathogens removal patterson et al 2012 most of the commercially available nf membranes are thin film composite tfc polyamide spiral wound modules with none or limited hydraulic cleaning capabilities urper et al 2017 van der bruggen et al 2008 hollow fiber nanofiltration hfnf membranes on the other hand offer a number of advantages over spiral wound modules as they 1 can stand more severe fouling 2 possess higher packing density and larger surface area per unit of member module which yields in a superior productivity and 3 can be implemented with a minimal pre treatment step ong and chung 2013 in this regard we are putting forth the hypothesis that implementation of hfnf membranes leads to efficient removal of dissolved mn fe and nom from gw the retention of nom from waters mainly surface waters via polyamide nf membranes is well documented al amoudi 2010 der bruggen et al 2008 hong and elimelech 1997 it is claimed that in the ph range of natural waters humic substances which are known as the major mass fraction of nom are negatively charged and as a result repelled by the negatively charged nf membranes al amoudi 2010 hong and elimelech 1997 however it has been stated that high ionic strength and presence of divalent cations can lead to a coiled and compacted configuration of nom in the feed solution and subsequently formation of a dense and thicker fouling layer on the surface of the nf membrane al amoudi 2010 despite the fact that a several studies reported successful practice of nf process for water softening and removal of inorganic compounds such as arsenic al amoudi 2010 van der bruggen et al 2008 hilal et al 2004 limited attention has been paid to the possibility of mn removal from drinking water resources by nf al rashdi et al 2013 munari and schafer 2010 molinari et al 2001 based on the outcomes of these studies application of nf for mn removal from water seemed to be a promising approach however the presented data on mn removal were case specific and cannot be easily extrapolated to other water sources moreover the impact of membrane specifications and water matrix on mn retention and its removal mechanisms were not clearly explained in addition no research effort has evaluated the possibility of simultaneous removal of dissolved mn fe and nom from gw supplies by means of tfc hfnf membranes therefore the main focus of this investigation is to assess the potential use of hfnf membranes to remove dissolved mn fe and nom from domestic gw supplies more specifically the objectives of this study are to i quantify the effect of the initial concentrations of dissolved mn fe and nom and co existence of these solutes on the hfnf performance and ii determine the impact of the gw matrix and particularly the significance of the gw hardness type mg vs ca and concentration on the overall efficiency of the hfnf process discriminating the key parameters responsible for effective removal of dissolved mn fe and nom from gw and identifying the mechanisms ruling their retentions will enable us to design a simple yet robust system to treat gw supplies for small communities and individual dwellings where financial and technical resources are limited 2 experimental 2 1 materials outside in sulfonated polyethersulfone spes thin film composite tfc hfnf membranes modules with approximately 4 times superior packing density than spiral wound nf were kindly provided by toyobo note that in an outside in module feed passes from outside of the fibers to the inside and the permeate exists from the hollow side of the fibers the hfnf membrane modules are chlorine resistant and backwashable in addition their outside in configuration minimizes plugging issues the specifications of the hfnf membranes and modules used are given in table 1 to prepare the model and synthetic gw solutions adequate amounts of analytical grade m n s o 4 f e s o 4 c a s o 4 and m g s o 4 salts supplied by fisher scientific fair lawn nj usa and suwannee river nom purchased from the international humic substances society st paul minneapolis usa were added to milli q water assays were also conducted using a natural groundwater collected from sainte marthe water utility quebec canada upon collection the natural gw was filtered by means of a vacuum filtration apparatus and a 0 45 μm hydrophilic polyethersulfone pes filter paper supor pes membrane disc filters pall us to remove suspended solids table 1 presents the specifications of sainte marthe gw resource the nom content of the natural gw was normalized to 1 mg c l by diluting it with milli q water after the vacuum filtration step the hardness alkalinity and sodium concentrations of the natural gw were then adjusted to their initial values by addition of appropriate amounts of m g s o 4 and c a s o 4 and n a c l stock solutions mn and fe concentrations of the natural gw was artificially elevated to 1 mg l by spiking pre determined volumes of m n s o 4 and f e s o 4 stock solutions to the feed tank in order to prevent the formation and precipitation of ferric hydroxide throughout the filtration experiments and stabilize the ph of the feed solution at 7 0 0 2 for both synthetic and natural gw solutions nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases were bubbled into the feed tank before spiking the stock solutions 2 2 experimental protocol 2 2 1 filtration experiments the filtration tests were carried out at a constant transmembrane pressure p 5 bars using a lab scale mini module of hfnf operated in cross flow filtration using a 0 5 l min feed flowrate corresponding to 0 14 m s cross flow velocity and the cumulative throughout of 1 9 l m2 to maintain the feed characteristics constant the concentrate and permeate streams were sent back to the feed tank fig 1 the feed temperature was fixed at 10 1 c by using a jacket coiled chiller it should be pointed out that this operational temperature was chosen based on the average gw temperature in southern quebec canada throughout each filtration assay temperature pressure and flow rate of the feed concentrate and permeate lines were recorded automatically every 20 s while samples were taken from each line every hour to quantify the concentrations of mn fe and nom the oxygen and ph levels of the feed were monitored continuously by means of a portable oxygen ph kit hach hq11d portable meter kit each filtration assay involved an hour of pre and post forward flush of milli q water and pure water flux pwf measurement at a constant transmembrane pressure of 5 bars all the filtration experiments were performed in triplicate 2 2 2 chemical cleaning after each filtration assay the permeate stream was closed and a four step sequential chemical cleaning i e naoh milli q water citric acid and milli q water was performed to wash remove any foulants that might remain in the system and restore the membranes specifications for the next filtration test it should be noted that the above mentioned cleaning cycle was performed even in the case that the initial pwf was achieved after the filtration experiment the ph of the naoh and citric acid were 12 and 2 respectively the duration of each step of the chemical cleaning cycle was 30 min and during this period the chemical cleaning agent was recirculating the operating temperature was 22 2 c 2 3 design of experiments two consecutive experimental phases were designed the first phase evaluated the performance of the hfnf for the retention of mn fe and nom and the investigation of the impact of the co existence of solutes on the process performance the second phase investigated the contribution of the gw matrix on the removal of mn fe and nom in this regard we first determined the removals of mn fe and nom for different hardness levels and type mg vs ca by varying the concentration of c a s o 4 or m g s o 4 of the synthetic gw solutions then we compared the rejection of different components in synthetic and natural gw and proposed the rejection mechanisms governing the retention of these species 2 4 analyses 2 4 1 membrane characterizations even though zeta potential and particularly streaming potential measurement has been extensively used to determine the surface charge of the nf membranes and the impact of the feed solution chemistry on the charged nf surface childress and elimelech 1996 teixeira et al 2005 yang et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge there is no commercially available cell to hold the hfnf membranes during the zeta potential measurement the external diameter of these membranes which can be considered as their thickness is larger than the flat sheet membranes and as a result they are not fitted inside a conventional flat membrane cell moreover flattening the fibers is a complicated procedure and might adversely impact the precision of the zeta potential results thus based on the above mentioned limitations no zeta potential measurement was done for the present work 2 4 1 1 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis the effect of the gw specifications and principally its hardness type and concentration role on the hfnf surface properties were studied by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps xps with a very high sensitivity provided us the elemental compositions and chemical bonds of the top 0 5 nm of the hfnf membrane surface to quantify any potential binding of ca and mg ions to the hfnf membrane surface via xps technique the virgin membranes were first rinsed and immersed in milli q water for 24 h then they were brought into direct contact with c a s o 4 or m g s o 4 solutions at three different concentrations i e 0 5 1 5 and 2 5 mm and ph 7 0 0 1 for one hour to remove the non binded ca2 and mg2 from the hfnf surface the membranes were rinsed off thoroughly with milli q water prior to the xps analysis the membranes were vacuum dried yang et al 2017 the operational conditions of the xps analysis are listed in appendix a 2 4 1 2 atomic force microscopy afm analysis an atomic force microscopy model e sweep spi4000 sii nt was employed to characterize the surface roughness of the virgin hfnf membrane an area of 2 μm 2 μm of the membrane was scanned via dfm mode q control in water it is worth mentioning that the surface roughness of the used hfnf membrane after filtration experiment was not determined due to the difficulty to remove the used hfnf membrane from the membrane module and the potential risk of distortion of the surface of the detached membrane 2 4 2 analytical methods total and dissolved mn fe ca and mg concentrations of the feed concentrate and permeate samples were measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes model icap 6000 thermo instruments inc the samples were preserved with 0 5 wt h n o 3 fisher optima high purity grade immediately after their collection prior to the measurement of each element a calibration curve was run and the concentration of a standard solution and a blank sample were determined for quality assurance after every 20 unknown samples it should be noted that in all the filtration experiments the differences between the total and dissolved 0 45 μm filterable mn fe ca and mg were negligible and therefore only total concentrations are reported in this work in the course of this study we quantified nom content as dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and measured the nom concentration of the feed permeate and concentrate using an on line toc analyser model sievers m 5310 c ge instruments usa 2 4 3 statistical analyses the experimental data were presented as means standard deviation and subjected to one way and multiple way statistical analyses of variance with the common level of significance set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of hfnf membranes on retention of mn fe and nom 3 1 1 feed with a single solute fig 2 demonstrates that the hfnf membranes can reject around 95 of dissolved mn and fe and retain up to 92 of nom from the model solution containing a single solute at ph 7 0 independent of their initial concentrations note that the reported data are independent of the specific volume and sampling time based on the statistical analysis increasing the concentrations of mn fe and nom from 250 to 1000 μg l had no significant impact on the rejection performance of the hfnf membranes p 0 39 the hfnf membranes permeability was slightly lower than that of the pwf but constant during the 4 h filtration assays trends not presented the concentrations of mn fe and nom in the feed water were constant data not shown throughout the filtration experiments indicating that no pronounced fouling or adsorption took place in addition the difference between the pre and post pwf values were not considerable 2 reflecting that no severe membrane fouling occurred during the filtration of the model solutions containing a single solute similar rejection values of mn and fe by the hfnf membranes can be explained by the fact that both of these divalent cations have a net charge of 2 and a similar hydrated radius epsztein et al 2018 volkov et al 1997 the rejection mechanisms by the hfnf membranes are further discussed in section 3 2 3 1 2 feed with multi solutes filtration of model solutions containing more than one species i e mixture of mineral salts or mineral salts with nom via hfnf membranes achieved high retentions of mn fe and nom 90 fig 3 co existence of m n s o 4 and f e s o 4 salts with nom in the feed solution did not affect the retention performance of the hfnf membranes significantly regardless of their initial concentrations p 0 34 similar to the filtration of the model solutions with a single solute the permeability was marginally lower than for the pwf and remained constant throughout the 4 h filtration test data not shown even though some researchers have reported that the combination of fe and nom could lead to the formation of fe nom complexes which would deposit on the membrane surface and subsequently cause membrane fouling and permeate flux decline hong and elimelech 1997 ahn et al 2008 liao et al 2007 the observed stable permeate flux and almost identical pre and post pwf values suggest that no fouled layer was built on the surface of the hfnf membranes such an observation can likely be related to the low initial concentration of nom in the feed solution and in turn the lower formation of nom complexes with fe in addition the smooth surface of the hfnf as can be seen in fig 4 may have limited the fouling of the membranes in general the surface roughness is considered as a tool to quantitatively predict the initial membrane fouling behaviour hilal et al 2004 vrijenhoek et al 2001 a number of studies boussu et al 200 638 vrijenhoek et al 2001 elimelech et al 1997 hilal et al 2005 boussu et al 200 638 have reported that the initial stage of fouling takes place in the valleys of rough membranes therefore membranes with smoother surfaces are expected offer better antifouling properties as presented in table 3 the mean roughness of the tested hfnf membranes is lower than polyamide nf270 and nf90 membranes 1 780 nm vs 4 380 and 27 852 nm which are used in many commercial applications hilal et al 2004 furthermore it can be presumed that if any of the fe nom complexes were formed the hydrodynamic conditions and most importantly the applied crossflow velocity was robust enough to wash away any deposit layer attached to the membrane surface bian et al 2000 3 1 3 impact of hardness type and concentration on hfnf membranes performance the following section describes the effectiveness of the hfnf membranes for the rejection of mn fe and nom from synthetic gw solutions in the presence of low moderate and high hardness levels primarily we studied the contribution of hardness type and concentration by filtering synthetic gw solution containing c a s o 4 or m g s o 4 at three different concentrations and then we compared the results with the filtration data of natural gw with a high hardness level i e 250 mg c a c o 3 l as illustrated in fig 5 a increasing the concentration of ca ions in the feed solution considerably lowered p 0 002 the rejection of mn and fe whereas the retention of nom remained unchanged p 0 34 similarly elevating the mg ion content of the feed solution impaired the performance of the hfnf membranes in rejecting mn and fe however the extent of this negative effect was lower than for ca ions fig 5 b p 0 003 similarly no significant reduction of nom removal was recorded when the mg ion concentration of the gw solutions varied from 0 5 mm to 2 5 mm p 0 41 fig 6 depicts the rejection of different compounds in synthetic and natural gw solutions it should be pointed out that the mn fe and nom concentrations were set to 1000 μg l for both solutions and the major ions in the synthetic gw had the same concentration to those in the natural gw the ph of both solutions was fixed at 7 0 0 2 the rejection of the monovalent cation i e na ions did not exceed more than 30 for both tested waters while above 40 of divalent cations mn fe ca and mg were retained since the concentration of ca ions in natural and synthetic gw solutions were almost three fold higher than mg ions see table 2 their influence was more significant and thereby the retention data of mn and fe were similar to the results presented in 5 a where the ca content was 2 5 mm similar to the above mentioned tested conditions more than 88 of nom was removed by the hfnf membranes when the synthetic or natural gw solutions were filtered it should be highlighted that measurements of pre and post pwf revealed that no severe fouling occurred during the crossflow filtration of the synthetic and natural gw and the presented results were independent of the specific volume and sampling time these observed reductions in fe mn removals in presence of high ca mg are linked with the change in the hfnf surface properties during the filtration of the synthetic gw solutions containing ca or mg ions binding of ca ions to the charged groups of the polyamide nf membranes surface has been reported in the literature childress and elimelech 1996 yang et al 2017 ahn et al 2008 in the current study ca and mg ions were most likely binded to the sulfonated charge groups of the hfnf membranes surface and altered the surface properties of the membranes the findings of xps analysis validated this hypothesis as exhibited in fig 7 compared to the virgin hfnf sample figs 7 a and fig 8 a the intensity of calcium detected signals increases for the membranes exposed to 0 5 1 5 and 2 5 mm c a s o 4 respectively fig 7 b d in a similar pattern the intensity of the mg detected signals was enhanced when the hfnf membranes were exposed to 0 5 1 5 and 2 5 mm m g s o 4 solutions fig 8 b d yang et al 2017 yang et al 2017 and do et al 2012 do et al 2012 also performed xps analysis to quantify the binding of ca ions to nf270 and nf90 membranes and demonstrated that formation of ca membrane complexes impacted the surface properties of the membranes and subsequently impaired their performance high removal of the suwannee river nom and nom in natural gw can be attributed to size exclusion due to their high molecular weights childress and elimelech 1996 ahn et al 2008 3 2 proposed rejection mechanisms the unique properties of nf membranes lie between the dense reverse osmosis ro membranes in which separation is mainly due to the solution diffusion mechanism and ultrafiltration uf membranes where transport across the membrane is governed by size exclusion i e sieving and in some cases charge effect compared to ro and uf nf provides the advantages of lower operating pressure and higher rejection respectively vaseghi et al 2015 generally both size and charge exclusion are the main separation mechanisms in nf membranes childress and elimelech 1996 tay et al 2002 ribau et al 2006 however complex interactions between feed solution specifications and properties of the nf membranes can impact the extent and significance of these mechanisms childress and elimelech 1996 tay et al 2002 ribau et al 2006 in this section we explain the underlying mechanisms involved in the retentions of mn fe and nom in absence and presence of hardness in the feed solution when model solutions containing mn and or fe salts were filtered the charged hfnf membranes were exposed to a salt solution and equilibrium took place between the membranes and solution due to the presence of fixed charged groups on the membrane surface the ionic concentration in the membranes was not equal to the of the salt solution the counter ion concentration was higher in the membranes than in the bulk phase whereas the co ion level was lower in the hfnf membranes this inequality of the ionic concentration led to a creation of potential difference i e donnan potential at the interface which impeded the passage of counter ions to the salt solution and co ions through the hfnf membranes teixeira et al 2005 schaep et al 1998 thus once the driving force i e pressure gradient was applied due to the impact of the donnan potential on repulsing co ions from the charged membrane surface and maintaining electroneutrality in the medium mainly water could pass through the membrane fig 9 a teixeira et al 2005 schaep et al 1998 retention of nom by the hfnf membranes can be attributed to both size and charge exclusion effects generally nom is negatively charged at the ph range of natural waters and exhibits high molecular weights 1000 3000 g mol and consequently would be rejected by the negatively charged nf including the tested hfnf membranes fig 9 b hong and elimelech 1997 despite the fact that for charged species such as mn and fe both size and charge play roles in their retention by the nf membranes childress and elimelech 2000 the presence of ca and mg ions in the feed solutions dramatically weakened the charge interaction impact as these ions i e ca and mg can bind to the ligand groups on the surface of the hfnf membranes alter the surface properties of the membranes and dominate the size exclusion effect accordingly from the drastic reduction in retention of mn and fe we can conclude that the tested hfnf membranes were not tight enough to sieve these ions teixeira et al 2005 yang et al 2017 on the other hand these membranes were tight enough to reject high molecular weights nom compounds fig 9 c and d in addition the more notable impact of ca ions can be due to a higher propensity of these ions to bind to the fixed charged i e sulfonic groups on the hfnf membranes surface in general the sulfonic groups tend to bind to ions with higher valency and smaller solvated hydrated volume and their preference for common cations is as follow helfferich 1995 b a 2 p b 2 s r 2 c a 2 n i 2 c d 2 c u 2 c o 2 z n 2 m g 2 a g c s k n h 4 n a h hence in this case ca ion has a smaller solvated hydrated volume than mg ion 108 a 3 vs 453 a 3 roduner 2014 and is more preferred by the sulfonic charged groups on the hfnf membranes surface similar behaviour was reported for polyamide nf membranes containing c o o fixed charged groups teixeira et al 2005 3 3 implications even though the application of the hfnf membranes in domestic gw treatment systems seemed to be an appealing pathway for effective removal of mn fe hardness nom and pathogens the presence of high level of hardness i e ca and or mg salts may decrease the performance of the process in the course of the current study this adverse impact was more marked when the amount of calcium salts was dominant in the gw matrix as ca ions possess higher tendency to form ca membrane complexes and diminished charge exclusion effect based on the filtration results we presumed that the applied hfnf membranes were not tight enough to sieve and retain mn and fe when their surface properties were affected by ca or mg ions implementation of hfnf membranes with a lower molecular weight cut off would enhance the size exclusion effect and subsequently increase the retention of mn and fe ions from hard gw supplies on the other hand since nf membranes are not selective in removal of ions and particularly divalent ions when tight hfnf membranes are used ca and mg ions would be retained by the membranes along with mn fe and nom for that reason the hfnf permeate is expected to be corrosive and should be remineralized therefore we conclude that the use of hfnf for the removal of fe mn in gws with elevated ca should be coupled with a polishing step such as a calcite contactor to adjust the hardness level of the soft permeate furthermore some researchers have reported that calcite media can partially adsorb mn and fe zachara et al 1991 mettler et al 2009 therefore integrating hfnf process with a calcite column seems to be a promising approach when a stand alone hfnf step cannot meet the regulations in terms of mn fe and hardness levels in finished water future work will evaluate the integration of the hfnf process with a calcite contactor 4 conclusion the present research assessed the performance of outside in sulfonated polyethersulfone thin film composite hfnf membranes for the removal of mn fe and nom from domestic gw supplies furthermore the main mechanisms ruling the rejection of these species in the absence and presence of hardness in gw matrix were systematically identified and studied the following conclusions were drawn from this investigation in the absence of hardness treating model solutions containing mn and or fe and or nom resulted in over 90 removal of these components regardless of their initial concentration in the feed solutions 250 1000 μg l specific volume and sampling time no marked membrane fouling due to the formation of nom complexes with ca and fe ions was detected for all the conditions investigated this observation can be attributed to i the low initial nom content in the feed solution and thus less extent of complex formation ii smooth surface of the tested hfnf membrane and iii effectiveness of hydrodynamic conditions and particularly cross flow velocity to control fouling and concentration polarization at the membrane surface for the model solutions containing mn and or fe rejection of these ions is based on charge exclusion mechanism co ions repulsion and counter ion retention due to the electroneutrality condition while both charge and size exclusion prevented the passage of nom through the membranes the presence of hardness in the form of ca and or mg salts decreased the removal of mn and fe while it had no significant impact on nom retention based on the results of the filtration experiments and xps data we deduced that binding of ca and or mg ions to the hfnf ligand groups weakened the charge exclusion effect and lowered the rejection of mn and fe ions since mg ions have a lower tendency to form complexes with the hfnf ligand groups its adverse impact on the charge exclusion mechanism is less significant compare to ca ions in these tested conditions sieving was the main rejection mechanism for nom retention by the hfnf membranes similar adverse impact of ca ions on the performance of the charged polyamide nf membranes has been reported in the literature teixeira et al 2005 acknowledgments this research was financially

19318,low energy consumption and less fouling propensity of forward osmosis fo processes have been attractive as a promising water filtration technology the performance of this process is however significantly influenced by its operating conditions moreover these operating parameters have both favourable and adverse effects on its performance therefore it is very important to optimize its performance for efficient and economic operation this study aims to develop a software to analyze a full scale fo system for optimum performance a comprehensive theoretical framework was developed to estimate the performance of fo system analysis results were compared with the experimental results to validate the models about 5 deviation of simulation results and the experimental findings shows a very good agreement between them a novel optimization algorithm was then developed to estimate the minimum required draw solution ds inlet flowrate and the number of elements in a pressure vessel to attain the design objectives i e desired final ds concentration and recovery rate at a specific feed solution fs flowrate a detailed parametric study was also conducted to determine the optimum operating conditions for different objectives it showed that for a specific design objective higher recovery rate can be achieved by increasing the ds flowrate and number of elements in a pressure vessel in contrast lower final concentration can be obtained by lowering the ds flowrate and increasing the number of elements finally a matlab based software with graphical user interface was developed to make the analysis process easier and efficient graphical abstract image 1 keywords forward osmosis design parameters operating conditions optimization software development 1 introduction sustainability of water and energy resources is endangered by the growing fresh water demand due to the increasing global population and economic development wastewater reuse and seawater desalination are two major alternatives to overcome this crisis anderson et al 2013 currently reverse osmosis ro is the most widely used about 60 desalination and wastewater treatment technology it consumes about 3 4 kwh electrical energy to produce 1 m3 of fresh water as it operates a high pressure hydraulic pump to apply hydrostatic pressure thus it is considered as an energy intensive process ali et al 2016 in contrast forward osmosis fo is a promising membrane based separation technology that has the potential to offer viable solutions to the conventional energy intensive processes osmotic pressure difference generated by the concentration gradient between the highly concentrated draw solution ds and the relatively less concentrated feed solution fs is the only driving force required for this process cath et al 2006 field and wu 2018 in addition fo requires a minimal hydraulic pressure to overcome the fluid frictional resistance so the operating pressure is very low as a result the fouling problem in fo is not so severe and in most cases it is reversible lee et al 2010 less fouling propensity and the absence of a high pressure pump significantly reduce the energy consumption and maintenance cost as such significant research attention has been drawn to improve the performance of fo processes irrespective of the applications performance of a full scale fo plant is defined by its production capacity final ds concentration and fs recovery rate which are significantly influenced by various design variables and operating parameters an efficient system has higher recovery rate and lower final ds concentration for a specific production capacity moreover these parameters have both favourable and adverse effects on the process performance lee and kim 2018 phuntsho et al 2017 song et al 2018 hence it is required to optimize the design and operating conditions of a full scale system to design an efficient plant however most of the fo system analysis conducted so far are lab scale analysis but it is difficult to translate the findings of these studies for the design and optimization of a full scale system although a recent experimental study conducted by kim et al 2018 optimized the full scale system but this study is applicable for a specific application and for a narrow range of operating conditions therefore a full scale theoretical analysis is necessary to determine the optimum design and operating conditions that can be used for various applications and broader range of operating conditions only a few researches have been conducted to analyze the full scale fo system for example deshmukh et al 2015 analyzed the effects of membrane properties such as water permeability solute permeability and structural parameter on the overall performance considering the co current and counter current flow of solutions using module scale modelling in another study mondal et al found an analytical solution for sizing membrane area with co current and counter current flow configurations using the log mean concentration difference approach mondal et al 2017 banchik et al analytically investigated the performance of fo and afo assisted fo exchangers banchik et al 2016 in 2016 phuntsho et al conducted simulation of a full scale fertilizer drawn fo nf hybrid system to study the influences of process parameters phuntsho et al 2017 most of these studies did not consider the actual dimensions of the membrane module moreover these studies considered that the fs and ds flow along the length direction of the membrane only it means that the concentrations osmotic pressure and water flux also vary in length direction only this consideration is valid for a plate and frame module but this type of modules is not commonly used for real applications whereas a spiral wound module is widely used commercially attarde et al 2016 gu et al 2011 above all the flux behavior of the this module is different from the plate and frame module as the flow configuration is completely different where concentration and osmotic pressure vary in both length and width directions gu et al 2011 jeon et al 2018 hence the findings of these studies are mostly inapplicable for the real applications in general these studies optimize the operating conditions by maximizing the recovery rate only however it was found that the recovery rate and ds dilution factor are inversely related mondal et al 2017 phuntsho et al 2016 2017 therefore the optimum design variables and operating conditions should be selected considering both recovery rate and concentration requirement in addition to this the reliability of finding of a theoretical study is highly dependent on its agreement with the experimental studies but these studies did not validate their findings by comparing with the experimental results finally designing and optimizing a fo system are very challenging and time consuming however a user friendly software can make the design process easy and efficient by reducing the time to design estimating the performance before fabrication and comparing different configurations although there are several commercial software available for ro system analysis such as rosa toray track imsdesign etc but there is no system analysis software for the fo process therefore it is very important to develop a fo system analysis software this study is aimed to develop a matlab based fo system analysis software considering the actual dimensions and flow configurations of a commercial spiral wound module it employed the fluid mass balance equations coupled with the solution diffusion model to theoretically estimate the system performance analytically found performance was then compared with the experimental result to validate the models used for this study a novel overall performance index was developed for this software to optimize the design and operating conditions considering both recovery rate and concentration requirement finally a graphical user interface gui was developed to receive the operating conditions as inputs from the user and display the optimized parameters as outputs 2 full scale fo system description fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of a full scale fo plant it comprises four main components such as fs pump ds pump and membrane modules i e pressure vessel and membrane element feed and draw solutions of the plant are selected according to their concentrations availability cost and the final product of the system corzo et al 2017 as osmotic pressure is a function of their concentrations the concentration of ds must be higher than the concentration of the fs in addition since the spiral wound fo swfo element is the most widely adopted element for the commercial applications the present study considered only this type of element for analysis a commercial thin film composite tfc 8040 swfo element was used for this study which was fabricated by toray chemical inc the swfo elements are housed inside the pressure vessel as shown in fig 1 the feed and draw solutions are supplied to the pressure vessels through an inlet distribution manifold by fs and ds pumps respectively each single vessel has minimum four ports generally two end port connections are used for ds inlet and outlet whereas the remaining two side port connections are for fs inlet and outlet fs enters at one end of the vessel through the side port and flows along the length direction of the modules through the feed channels brine seals are used to prevent the fs from going around the elements rather than through it on the other hand ds enters through the end port of the vessel which is connected to the inlet side of the core tube of the first element as the core tube is blocked at centre and has holes on its body ds comes out through the holes and flows along the width direction over the membrane sheet as shown in fig 2 a and b in addition to this since the ds channels are divided by the central glue lines the solution takes a u shaped path of flow and returns to the outlet side of the core tube due to the water potential difference between the fs and ds resulted from the concentration difference pure water permeates from fs to ds across the membrane therefore ds concentration decreases and fs concentration increases according to their direction of flows fs concentrate and diluted ds outlet of the first element then enters the second element as fs and ds inlet respectively in the same way the solutions pass through the elements until the required fs recovery rate and final concentration of ds are not reached the number of elements per pressure vessel is decided according to the required recovery rate and product concentration finally the diluted ds or the product of fo system is delivered from the pressure vessel through the ds outlet distribution manifold on the other hand concentrated fs is disposed through the fs outlet distribution manifold the swfo element is fabricated by integrating membrane sheets feed spacers and permeate spacers with a core tube via adhesive to create separate flow channels for ds and fs as shown in fig 2 a the fs channel was formed by placing a feed spacer between two membranes sheets and gluing the sheets along their length and width in contrast the ds channel is formed by obstructing the core tube at the middle as well as gluing the sides and the centreline of the sheets as shown in fig 2 b 3 operating conditions and design parameters of fo system performance of a fo plant is defined in terms of production capacity recovery rate and final ds concentration kim et al 2018 mondal et al 2017 phuntsho et al 2017 generally production capacity of the system is measured as the volumetric production of diluted ds per day recovery rate is defined as the percentage ratio of water permeation rate to the inlet fs flowrate an efficient fo system exhibits low final ds concentration along with high production capacity and recovery rate at a certain fs flowrate however better performance can be achieved by varying the operating conditions and design parameters ds and fs inlet flowrates that are generally varied during operation for any applications are the two major operating conditions khayet et al 2016 kim et al 2018 xu et al 2010 the other two most significant parameters are ds and fs inlet concentrations the variations of flowrates also influence the concentrations and vice versa change in mass transfer coefficient due to the crossflow velocities defines the external concentration polarization that affects the concentration at solution membrane interface phuntsho et al 2014 wang et al 2016 apart from these operating conditions some design parameters such as membrane element type the number of elements in pressure vessels spacer thickness flow configurations etc also influence the performance field et al 2017 jung et al 2011 kim et al 2017 2018 increasing the number of elements causes increased water permeation but due to the osmotic dilution the average water flux reduces consequently the production cost of the system increases on the other hand the change of spacer thickness affects the solution velocity or external concentration polarization moreover the membrane surface area and direction of flow change which also affects the performance therefore to design an efficient system this study determined the optimum ds inlet flowrate and number of elements in a pressure vessel for a targeted recovery rate and final concentration using a specific type of element 4 theoretical analysis a complete theoretical framework was developed to determine the optimum operating conditions and design parameters of a fo system solution diffusion model was incorporated with the mass balance equations to develop the mathematical models of a full scale system numerical solution of these models can provide the local distributions of flux over the membrane surface which in turn can estimate the system performance 4 1 mathematical models the analytical framework begins with the calculation of thermodynamic properties of feed and draw solutions at different concentrations osmotic pressure of the solution was determined by using the modified van t hoff equation gu et al 2011 phuntsho et al 2014 xue et al 2016 considering the membrane characteristics and concentration of the solution the local water flux is expressed by shaffer et al 2015 tiraferri et al 2013 1 j w a π d b exp j w s d π f b exp j w k f 1 b j w exp j w k f exp j w s d here a and b are the pure water and the solute permeability coefficient respectively and these are considered as properties of membrane for a specific pair of fs and ds s is the structural parameter of the membrane d represents the diffusivity of the ds and k f is feed solution mass transfer coefficient π d b and π f b represent the osmotic pressure corresponding to the bulk concentration of ds and fs in the same way the reverse solute flux rsf is determined by equation 2 tiraferri et al 2013 2 j s b c d b exp j w s d c f b exp j w k f 1 b j w exp j w k f exp j w s d here c d b and c f b are the bulk concentration of ds and fs 4 2 numerical simulation total water permeation through a large membrane area cannot be calculated by applying the mathematical models for water flux and rsf considering the whole membrane surface is exposed to the same concentration and velocity during the operation because of water flux and rsf ds is diluted and fs is concentrated along the path of flow which eventually reduces the solution concentration gradient therefore the membrane area was discretised to sufficiently smaller areas l w as shown in fig 3 and the models were applied iteratively to the discrete areas considering the effects of water flux and rsf of one discrete area on the next according to the directions of the flow mass balance equations were combined with the models to determine the local velocities and concentrations it was assumed that the velocities and concentrations changed only in the dominant direction of the flow moreover since the channels heights are too small and filled up with spacer velocity and concentration boundary layers in the height direction were considered negligible employing the mass balance equation the change in fs flowrate in the direction of their flow was expressed and solved numerically by the finite difference method to determine the local feed flowrate on the membrane surface as follows 3 q f i 1 j q f i j j w i j j s i j l w where i and j are the indexes which represent the location of the discrete area j w i j and j s i j represent the volume of water and salt diffuses through the discrete area of the membrane considering the dominant direction of flow the ds flow path was divided into three sections as shown in fig 3 at section 1 ds flowed in the forward direction and in a cross current configuration with the fs flow path at section 2 ds and fs flow paths are co current finally at section 3 ds flowed in the reverse direction as compared to section 1 but the fs and ds flow path remain in cross current mode thus the ds flowrate for different sections is described as for section 1 4 q d i j 1 q d i j j w i j j s i j l w for section 2 5 q d i 1 j q d i j j w i j j s i j l w for section 3 6 q d i j 1 q d i j j w i j j s i j l w local velocity of the solutions can be estimated by equations 7 and 8 when the flowrate and the physical dimensions of the channel and spacer are known sim et al 2015 7 u f i

cylindrical filament on the other hand ds side spacers consist of a feed spacer like structure sandwiched between two very thin finely porous net type structures which work as permeate carrier since the permeate carriers are very thin as compared to the feed spacer the dimensions of draw side spacers were assumed similar to the feed side spacers for the calculation of channel voidage however the voidage can be estimated as da costa et al 1994 9 ε s p 1 π d f 2 2 l m h s p s i n θ where d f is the diameter of spacer filaments l m is the length of mesh and θ is the angle as shown in fig 4 the amounts of solute in solution flows over the discrete area l w are expressed as 10 q f s l t i 1 j q f i j c f i j j s i j l w for section 1 11 q d s l t i j 1 q d i j c f i j j s i j l w for section 2 12 q d s l t i 1 j q d i j c f i j j s i j l w for section 3 13 q d s l t i j 1 q d i j c f i j j s i j l w local bulk concentration of solutions at different locations of the membrane channel was determined by calculating the amount of solute available in the unit amount of solution within the discrete area as shown in equations 14 and 15 14 c f b i j q f s l t i j q f i j 15 c d b i j q d s l t i j q d i j since fs flows at right angle to the ds and the ds changes its direction of flow the local water flux and rsf vary in both direction moreover the other variables such as flowrate velocity and concentration are dependent on the water flux and rsf as a result although these are one dimensional finite difference models but all the variables are function of both the length and width of the membrane sheet therefore the total water permeation from a module is estimated by a double integration of local water flux which is a function of both length and width as follows 16 q w e l m e n s h e e t i 1 m j 1 n j w i j d l d w here n s h e e t is the number of membrane sheets available in one element m m l e n g t h l and n n w i d t h w represent the number of discrete areas in length and width direction average water flux of a membrane element is the ratio of total permeation to the membrane surface area of a module which is given by 17 j w a v g e q w e l m e a e l m where a e l m is the total membrane surface area the amount of diluted ds produced after any element is expressed by summing all the local ds flowrates at the outlet of membrane sheet where j 1 18 q d o u t e n s h e e t i 1 m p 2 q d i 1 here p is the number of discrete areas along the width direction of the central glue line of a membrane sheet therefore p was calculated as p width of glue line l similarly the concentrated fs outlet flowrate of the element is 19 q f o u t e n s h e e t j 1 n q f m j final ds concentration after any element is given by 20 c d o u t e n s h e e t i 1 m p 2 q d s l t i 1 q d o u t e outlet concentration of the fs from an element 21 c f o u t e n s h e e t j 1 n q f s l t m j q f o u t e finally the recovery rate after any element is expressed as the percentage ratio of total fresh water permeation to the fs inlet flowrate 22 r e q d o u t e q d i n q f i n 100 4 3 optimization of design and operating conditions this section introduces a novel optimization algorithm that can determine the optimum ds flowrate and the number of elements required to obtain a targeted final ds concentration and recovery rate at a certain fs flowrate for a specific fo application generally the optimum operating condition is found based on either the maximum recovery rate or minimum final ds concentration previous studies however showed that higher recovery rate can be obtained by applying higher ds inlet flowrate or concentration which results in a higher final ds concentration mondal et al 2017 phuntsho et al 2017 so the design or operating conditions which provide maximum recovery rate or minimum final concentration are not always the optimum conditions therefore a new performance parameter overall performance rating opr was proposed in this study which combined the recovery rate and final ds concentration with the number of membrane elements opr can be defined as the percentage of overall design target achieved per element it was formulated by the multiplication of recovery fraction and concentration fraction however the recovery fraction is defined as the ratio of actual recovery rate achieved to the desired recovery rate and is given by 23 r f d e r d e r d here r d e and r f d e are the obtained recovery rate and recovery fraction respectively at a certain ds flowrate and the number of elements whereas r d is the targeted recovery rate on the other hand the concentration fraction is a ratio of targeted final concentration to the actual final concentration which is given by 24 c f d e c d f c d d e where c d f is the desired final ds concentration c d d e and c f d e are the achieved final concentration and concentration fraction respectively in order to prevent the overdesign the maximum values of recovery fraction and concentration fraction were considered one which means if r d e r d then r f d e 1 on the other hand if c d d e c d f then c f d e 1 combining the recovery fraction the concentration fraction and the number of elements opr is expressed by 25 o p r d e r f d e c f d e n e 100 here o p r d e is the value of overall performance rating for a certain ds flowrate and number of elements whereas n e is the number of elements required to obtain the recovery fraction and concentration fraction the proposed optimization method was implemented by calculating opr for several sets of operating conditions and selecting the operating conditions which provide the maximum value of opr the main drawback of this method is that the opr value of one set of operating conditions where the recovery fraction is very high and the concentration fraction is very low is similar with the opr values of other sets of operating conditions where the recovery fractions are very low and the concentration fractions are very high as a result this method sometimes finds the optimum operating conditions when the recovery rate is very high but the final ds concentration is higher than the targeted value on the other hand it may also find the optimum operating conditions where the final concentration is very low but the recovery rate is lower than the targeted recovery rate which is unacceptable in order to overcome this limitation search domain of operating conditions was constrained instead of searching the optimum conditions within the whole range it only searches when both the actual recovery rate and the final concentration are in an acceptable proximity to the targeted recovery rate and concentration this constrain was applied by o p r d e 0 when r f d e 1 f l or c f d e 1 f l here fl represents the acceptable deviation from the target and is termed as flexibility of design the proposed optimization algorithm is described in fig 5 the optimization process was started with the configuration of the design targets such as the final concentration c d f and recovery rate r d as well as the flexibility of design f l then the recovery rate and fs flowrate q f i n were configured as one target here the fs and ds inlet concentration c f i n and c d i n were initialized these operating conditions generally remain unchanged for a specific application for example fs and ds inlet concentrations are about 0 02 m and 0 6 m respectively for seawater dilution using wastewater in addition to this minimum dilution δ c e required to add more elements in a pressure vessel was configured it means that if reduction in ds concentration due to the addition of an element in a pressure vessel is less than δ c e no more element is added finally the ds inlet flowrate was incremented from an initial value q d i to a final value q d f by increasing the flowrate a small amount δ q d at each iteration for every ds flowrate the number of elements per pressure vessel was increased and opr of the fo system was investigated and compared to determine the optimum ds flowrate and number of elements per pressure vessel the number of element e was initialized with 1 and then the inlet operating conditions for the first element were set for the simulation using the mathematical models presented the simulation results provided the fs and ds outlet flowrate q f o u t and q d o u t and concentration c f o u t and c d o u t recovery rate and osmotic dilution by the element was calculated dilution by the addition of this element was calculated by 26 δ c d d e c d i n d e c d o u t d e the outlet ds concentration and recovery rate were then compared with the targeted final concentration and recovery target if the target was not achieved i e either the outlet concentration was higher than the final concentration target or the recovery rate was less than the recovery target the recovery fraction and concentration fraction were calculated and checked whether these fractions were within the acceptable range if any of these fractions were out of the acceptable limit opr was set as 0 otherwise opr was calculated using equation 25 then the dilution by the addition of this element δ c d d e was compared with the minimum required dilution for adding more element δ c e if the dilution was higher than the required minimum dilution the second element was added and the outlet conditions of the first element were considered as the inlet conditions for the second element then the same processes were repeated due to the addition of another element the recovery rate increased and the final concentration decreased however if the concentration or recovery rate still did not reach the target the recovery and concentration fractions were calculated again otherwise if these were in the acceptable range opr was calculated and the dilution was compared if it was less than the minimum required dilution the current ds inlet flowrate was checked whether it was the last value of the ds flowrate range if the targets were reached opr was calculated and the ds flowrate was compared with the last value of the range if the current flowrate was less than the last flowrate of the range the highest opr for this flowrate o p r d was found the optimum number of elements for this flowrate n e d was the corresponding number of elements for the o p r d then the ds inlet flowrate was incremented and the same process was continued in contrast if the current ds flowrate was the last value of the range the o p r d values for all flowrates were compared and the maximum value o p r o was selected ds flowrate q d o and the number of elements n e o corresponding to the maximum opr o p r o were the optimum operating conditions and design parameters for the desired final concentration and recovery rate 5 results and discussion a design and optimization software for the fo process was developed to perform the steps of the fo system analysis using matlab programming to justify the findings of the software it was used to design the fo process and the results were compared with our previously published experimental results kim et al 2018 where the same operating conditions and design parameters were used parameters considered for the simulation are furnished in table s1 of supplementary information si it also investigated the effects of different parameters on the performance of fo system in terms of recovery rate and final ds concentration in this section we first discussed the developed graphical user interfaces gui of the software then the justification of the analysis results and parametric study for the optimization of fo system 5 1 gui of fo system analysis software in this study a matlab based software was developed for the analysis of fo system it consists of seven different tabs to perform the different steps of the fo system analysis fig 6 shows one of the seven tabs of the software other tabs of this software are shown in section 2 of si project info is the first tab of this software in this interface a user can provide the project and analyser related information then in the feed solution analysis tab it receives the user input values of initial concentration and solution type in terms of tds or individual component concentration it displays the calculated osmotic pressure corresponding to the inlet concentration similarly in the draw solution analysis tab it receives the inlet concentration and displays the osmotic pressure in the optimization tab it receives the design objectives element type and flow configuration as input and displays the optimum ds inlet flowrate and the number of elements per pressure vessel as output followed by that in the configuration tab the user can specify the plant capacity and pump efficiencies later in the simulation tab all the simulated results are presented graphically and listed the full scale design parameters for example it shows that an fo plant with 50 recovery rate fs and ds inlet flowrates of 40 lpm and 4 70 lpm which produces 100 000 m3 of diluted draw solution per day at 0 15 m final concentration requires total 11 516 membrane elements and 2879 pressure vessel however since economic analysis is not in the scope this study it does not describe the seventh tab of the software 5 2 validation of experimental and simulated results in order to validate the outcomes of the software the simulation results of this software were compared with the findings of our previous experimental study kim et al 2018 a commercial 8040 spiral wound thin film composite fo membrane element was used for pilot scale fo experiments sodium chloride 0 6 m concentration solution was used as ds which is similar to that of typical seawater the application of fo systems in this study was dilution of seawater using wastewater effluent of membrane bioreactor mbr wastewater has an osmotic pressure of around 0 99 bar therefore fs was prepared by using nacl only to have the same osmotic pressure i e 0 02 m nacl without the presence of other components the fs and ds outlet of the first element was used as the inlet of the second element and so on these experiments were conducted up to 4 elements the inlet and outlet flowrate and concentration of the modules were recorded using electromagnetic flowmeters and conductivity meters connected to a pc through a data acquisition system the inlet flowrates of fs and ds for the first element were 40 lpm and 4 7 lpm respectively the same membrane element properties and operating conditions as shown table s1 in si were considered for this study to compare the analytical findings with the experimental results fig 7 compares the analytically estimated solution inlet concentrations and flowrates for increasing number of elements in a pressure vessel with the experimentally measured flowrates and concentrations it can be seen from the figure that the analytical results from the system analysis software are in a very good agreement with the experimental results it shows that due to the permeation of fresh water from fs to ds the flowrate of ds increased whereas the fs flowrate decreased in contrast the permeation of water caused dilution of ds but increased the concentration of fs according to this study inlet ds flowrate increased from 4 7 lpm to 21 lpm for the fourth element in a pressure vessel with only 2 8 average deviation from the experimental results similarly the fs flowrate decreased from 40 lpm to 20 5 lpm for the same number of element average deviation from the experimental results was only 2 on the other hand ds concentration decreased from 0 6 m to 0 13 m and fs concentration increased from 0 02 m to 0 03 m the average difference of theoretical fs concentration with the experimental study was found to be 5 25 as compared to the other parameters simulated ds concentration showed higher deviation about 12 from the experimental study however the reason for this deviation was an experimental error in the measurement of inlet ds concentration for the third element because although the inlet concentrations for other elements matched with the experimental value satisfactorily only the inlet ds concentration of the third elements deviated unexpectedly fig 8 further demonstrates the average water flux from the elements the average water flux for the first element was 26 5 lmh which reduced to 12 lmh for the fourth element due to the reduction in concentration gradient along the solution flow path it can be seen from the figure that the experimental results displayed a similar decreasing trend although the water flux for the second and third element indicated a little higher value this difference in analytical and experimental results was because of the additional pressure applied unintentionally due to the operation of pumps as a result of this additional pressure slightly higher water flux was noticed for the experimental investigation as compared to this theoretical system analysis however the average deviation from the experimental results for water flux was 7 in addition to this for the same operating conditions with a design objective of 50 recovery rate and 0 15 m final ds concentration the optimum number of elements in the pressure vessel was calculated using the proposed algorithm in section 4 3 when the flexibility in design was 5 table 1 explains the optimization algorithm the recovery rate and final concentrations were simulated and listed in the table since the recovery rates for the first second and third element were 5 less than the desired recovery rate i e out of the opr search domain rf was set as zero on the other hand as the recovery rate for the fifth and sixth element was higher than the targeted recovery rate rf was set to its maximum value 1 similarly the value of cf was calculated and furnished in table 1 considering the recovery fraction concentration fraction and number of elements opr was calculated and listed in the table it can be seen that for the discussed operating conditions and design objectives the maximum opr 24 28 objective element was achieved when 4 elements were used in a pressure vessel in comparison the experimental study also shows that the optimum number of elements in a pressure vessel was 4 kim et al 2018 the above discussion shows that the findings of the developed fo system analysis software satisfied the experimental results with a very close tolerance of deviation which is about 5 in average thus the software can be employed to design and optimize the full scale fo system for different applications and operating conditions 5 3 parametric optimization fig 9 shows the optimum ds flowrate and the number of elements in a pressure vessel for different design objectives i e for different desired recovery rates at various fs flowrates and final ds concentrations it can be seen from the figure that the lower the final ds concentration the lower the optimum inlet ds flowrate to the system according to fig 9 a for 0 15 m final ds concentration and 60 recovery rate when the inlet fs flowrate increased from 35 lpm to 65 lpm the optimum ds inlet flowrate increased from 7 lpm to 12 2 lpm on the other hand if the required final concentration was 0 1 m for the same recovery rate and fs flowrate range the optimum ds flowrate was lower it varied from 1 25 lpm to 7 75 lpm as the higher inlet ds flowrate means that the greater amounts of solute were present in the solution it resisted the dilution of the solution therefore for a lower final concentration and the same inlet ds concentration low ds flowrate was used but at the less ds concentration the recovery rate reduced therefore for a same recovery rate when the final concentration was lower more elements were required fig 9 a also shows that for 0 15 m final concentration and 60 recovery rate at 35 lpm and 65 lpm fs flowrate 4 and 6 elements were required in a pressure vessel respectively whereas for the same design objectives the required number of elements were 5 and 9 when the final concentration were 0 1 m in addition to this at 60 recovery rate with 35 65 lpm inlet fs flowrate 0 05 m final ds concentration cannot be achieved similarly fig 9 b and c show the optimum operating conditions for 50 and 40 recovery rate these figures also show the similar trend of ds flowrate and the number of elements it can be seen from the figures that for the high final concentration 0 15 m although the overall trend of the optimum ds flowrate was increasing when the fs flowrate increased but for few other fs flowrates the ds flowrate decreased at a regular interval since more permeation was required for the same recovery rate at higher fs flowrate the proposed optimization algorithm increased the number of elements and varied the ds flowrate within a range to find the optimum flowrate consequently at a certain interval the optimum ds flowrate decreased a little bit when the number of element increased but increased again with the increase in fs flowrate however for the low final concentration the optimum ds flowrate varied within a small range therefore the reduction in the optimum ds flowrate was not observed for the 0 1 m and 0 05 m final concentrations finally average flowrate ratios i e the average values of all ratios of fs flowrate to the ds flowrate for each recovery rate and final concentration were calculated and compared in fig 10 it shows that for a same ds final concentration the average flow ratio decreased when the recovery rate increased in comparison for a same recovery rate the flow ratio decreased if the final concentration decreased it can be seen that average flow ratios for 40 50 and 60 recovery rate at 0 15 m final ds concentration were 9 7 and 5 respectively for the same recovery rates at 0 1 m concentration fs inlet flowrate was 14 10 and 8 times higher than the ds flowrate finally at 0 05 m final concentration for 40 and 50 recovery rate the average flow ratios were 27 and 22 since 60 recovery rate was not obtained at 0 05 m final concentration fig 10 does not show average flow ratio for this recovery rate and final concentration 6 conclusions the current work developed a software to analyze and optimize the performance of a full scale fo system it modelled and simulated the performance of the fo system for various operating conditions and design parameters a novel overall performance parameter was presented to estimate the performance of the system considering both the recovery rate and the final ds concentration this overall performance parameter was used to compare performance at various operating conditions operating conditions corresponding to the maximum value of this parameter were the optimum conditions accordingly the main findings of this analytical work are listed below i higher ds inlet flowrate was required to obtain the higher recovery rate for the same final ds concentration in contrast lower ds flowrate was required when the targeted final ds concentration was lower for the same recovery rate ii increasing the number of elements in a pressure vessel increased the recovery rate and reduced the final ds concentration but after a certain number increasing the element was not optimal iii full scale fo system design parameters by the proposed system analysis software for 100000 m3 of diluted ds production capacity per day at 0 15 m final concentration are as follows when the recovery rate is 50 fs and ds inlet flowrates are 40 lpm and 4 7

19318,low energy consumption and less fouling propensity of forward osmosis fo processes have been attractive as a promising water filtration technology the performance of this process is however significantly influenced by its operating conditions moreover these operating parameters have both favourable and adverse effects on its performance therefore it is very important to optimize its performance for efficient and economic operation this study aims to develop a software to analyze a full scale fo system for optimum performance a comprehensive theoretical framework was developed to estimate the performance of fo system analysis results were compared with the experimental results to validate the models about 5 deviation of simulation results and the experimental findings shows a very good agreement between them a novel optimization algorithm was then developed to estimate the minimum required draw solution ds inlet flowrate and the number of elements in a pressure vessel to attain the design objectives i e desired final ds concentration and recovery rate at a specific feed solution fs flowrate a detailed parametric study was also conducted to determine the optimum operating conditions for different objectives it showed that for a specific design objective higher recovery rate can be achieved by increasing the ds flowrate and number of elements in a pressure vessel in contrast lower final concentration can be obtained by lowering the ds flowrate and increasing the number of elements finally a matlab based software with graphical user interface was developed to make the analysis process easier and efficient graphical abstract image 1 keywords forward osmosis design parameters operating conditions optimization software development 1 introduction sustainability of water and energy resources is endangered by the growing fresh water demand due to the increasing global population and economic development wastewater reuse and seawater desalination are two major alternatives to overcome this crisis anderson et al 2013 currently reverse osmosis ro is the most widely used about 60 desalination and wastewater treatment technology it consumes about 3 4 kwh electrical energy to produce 1 m3 of fresh water as it operates a high pressure hydraulic pump to apply hydrostatic pressure thus it is considered as an energy intensive process ali et al 2016 in contrast forward osmosis fo is a promising membrane based separation technology that has the potential to offer viable solutions to the conventional energy intensive processes osmotic pressure difference generated by the concentration gradient between the highly concentrated draw solution ds and the relatively less concentrated feed solution fs is the only driving force required for this process cath et al 2006 field and wu 2018 in addition fo requires a minimal hydraulic pressure to overcome the fluid frictional resistance so the operating pressure is very low as a result the fouling problem in fo is not so severe and in most cases it is reversible lee et al 2010 less fouling propensity and the absence of a high pressure pump significantly reduce the energy consumption and maintenance cost as such significant research attention has been drawn to improve the performance of fo processes irrespective of the applications performance of a full scale fo plant is defined by its production capacity final ds concentration and fs recovery rate which are significantly influenced by various design variables and operating parameters an efficient system has higher recovery rate and lower final ds concentration for a specific production capacity moreover these parameters have both favourable and adverse effects on the process performance lee and kim 2018 phuntsho et al 2017 song et al 2018 hence it is required to optimize the design and operating conditions of a full scale system to design an efficient plant however most of the fo system analysis conducted so far are lab scale analysis but it is difficult to translate the findings of these studies for the design and optimization of a full scale system although a recent experimental study conducted by kim et al 2018 optimized the full scale system but this study is applicable for a specific application and for a narrow range of operating conditions therefore a full scale theoretical analysis is necessary to determine the optimum design and operating conditions that can be used for various applications and broader range of operating conditions only a few researches have been conducted to analyze the full scale fo system for example deshmukh et al 2015 analyzed the effects of membrane properties such as water permeability solute permeability and structural parameter on the overall performance considering the co current and counter current flow of solutions using module scale modelling in another study mondal et al found an analytical solution for sizing membrane area with co current and counter current flow configurations using the log mean concentration difference approach mondal et al 2017 banchik et al analytically investigated the performance of fo and afo assisted fo exchangers banchik et al 2016 in 2016 phuntsho et al conducted simulation of a full scale fertilizer drawn fo nf hybrid system to study the influences of process parameters phuntsho et al 2017 most of these studies did not consider the actual dimensions of the membrane module moreover these studies considered that the fs and ds flow along the length direction of the membrane only it means that the concentrations osmotic pressure and water flux also vary in length direction only this consideration is valid for a plate and frame module but this type of modules is not commonly used for real applications whereas a spiral wound module is widely used commercially attarde et al 2016 gu et al 2011 above all the flux behavior of the this module is different from the plate and frame module as the flow configuration is completely different where concentration and osmotic pressure vary in both length and width directions gu et al 2011 jeon et al 2018 hence the findings of these studies are mostly inapplicable for the real applications in general these studies optimize the operating conditions by maximizing the recovery rate only however it was found that the recovery rate and ds dilution factor are inversely related mondal et al 2017 phuntsho et al 2016 2017 therefore the optimum design variables and operating conditions should be selected considering both recovery rate and concentration requirement in addition to this the reliability of finding of a theoretical study is highly dependent on its agreement with the experimental studies but these studies did not validate their findings by comparing with the experimental results finally designing and optimizing a fo system are very challenging and time consuming however a user friendly software can make the design process easy and efficient by reducing the time to design estimating the performance before fabrication and comparing different configurations although there are several commercial software available for ro system analysis such as rosa toray track imsdesign etc but there is no system analysis software for the fo process therefore it is very important to develop a fo system analysis software this study is aimed to develop a matlab based fo system analysis software considering the actual dimensions and flow configurations of a commercial spiral wound module it employed the fluid mass balance equations coupled with the solution diffusion model to theoretically estimate the system performance analytically found performance was then compared with the experimental result to validate the models used for this study a novel overall performance index was developed for this software to optimize the design and operating conditions considering both recovery rate and concentration requirement finally a graphical user interface gui was developed to receive the operating conditions as inputs from the user and display the optimized parameters as outputs 2 full scale fo system description fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of a full scale fo plant it comprises four main components such as fs pump ds pump and membrane modules i e pressure vessel and membrane element feed and draw solutions of the plant are selected according to their concentrations availability cost and the final product of the system corzo et al 2017 as osmotic pressure is a function of their concentrations the concentration of ds must be higher than the concentration of the fs in addition since the spiral wound fo swfo element is the most widely adopted element for the commercial applications the present study considered only this type of element for analysis a commercial thin film composite tfc 8040 swfo element was used for this study which was fabricated by toray chemical inc the swfo elements are housed inside the pressure vessel as shown in fig 1 the feed and draw solutions are supplied to the pressure vessels through an inlet distribution manifold by fs and ds pumps respectively each single vessel has minimum four ports generally two end port connections are used for ds inlet and outlet whereas the remaining two side port connections are for fs inlet and outlet fs enters at one end of the vessel through the side port and flows along the length direction of the modules through the feed channels brine seals are used to prevent the fs from going around the elements rather than through it on the other hand ds enters through the end port of the vessel which is connected to the inlet side of the core tube of the first element as the core tube is blocked at centre and has holes on its body ds comes out through the holes and flows along the width direction over the membrane sheet as shown in fig 2 a and b in addition to this since the ds channels are divided by the central glue lines the solution takes a u shaped path of flow and returns to the outlet side of the core tube due to the water potential difference between the fs and ds resulted from the concentration difference pure water permeates from fs to ds across the membrane therefore ds concentration decreases and fs concentration increases according to their direction of flows fs concentrate and diluted ds outlet of the first element then enters the second element as fs and ds inlet respectively in the same way the solutions pass through the elements until the required fs recovery rate and final concentration of ds are not reached the number of elements per pressure vessel is decided according to the required recovery rate and product concentration finally the diluted ds or the product of fo system is delivered from the pressure vessel through the ds outlet distribution manifold on the other hand concentrated fs is disposed through the fs outlet distribution manifold the swfo element is fabricated by integrating membrane sheets feed spacers and permeate spacers with a core tube via adhesive to create separate flow channels for ds and fs as shown in fig 2 a the fs channel was formed by placing a feed spacer between two membranes sheets and gluing the sheets along their length and width in contrast the ds channel is formed by obstructing the core tube at the middle as well as gluing the sides and the centreline of the sheets as shown in fig 2 b 3 operating conditions and design parameters of fo system performance of a fo plant is defined in terms of production capacity recovery rate and final ds concentration kim et al 2018 mondal et al 2017 phuntsho et al 2017 generally production capacity of the system is measured as the volumetric production of diluted ds per day recovery rate is defined as the percentage ratio of water permeation rate to the inlet fs flowrate an efficient fo system exhibits low final ds concentration along with high production capacity and recovery rate at a certain fs flowrate however better performance can be achieved by varying the operating conditions and design parameters ds and fs inlet flowrates that are generally varied during operation for any applications are the two major operating conditions khayet et al 2016 kim et al 2018 xu et al 2010 the other two most significant parameters are ds and fs inlet concentrations the variations of flowrates also influence the concentrations and vice versa change in mass transfer coefficient due to the crossflow velocities defines the external concentration polarization that affects the concentration at solution membrane interface phuntsho et al 2014 wang et al 2016 apart from these operating conditions some design parameters such as membrane element type the number of elements in pressure vessels spacer thickness flow configurations etc also influence the performance field et al 2017 jung et al 2011 kim et al 2017 2018 increasing the number of elements causes increased water permeation but due to the osmotic dilution the average water flux reduces consequently the production cost of the system increases on the other hand the change of spacer thickness affects the solution velocity or external concentration polarization moreover the membrane surface area and direction of flow change which also affects the performance therefore to design an efficient system this study determined the optimum ds inlet flowrate and number of elements in a pressure vessel for a targeted recovery rate and final concentration using a specific type of element 4 theoretical analysis a complete theoretical framework was developed to determine the optimum operating conditions and design parameters of a fo system solution diffusion model was incorporated with the mass balance equations to develop the mathematical models of a full scale system numerical solution of these models can provide the local distributions of flux over the membrane surface which in turn can estimate the system performance 4 1 mathematical models the analytical framework begins with the calculation of thermodynamic properties of feed and draw solutions at different concentrations osmotic pressure of the solution was determined by using the modified van t hoff equation gu et al 2011 phuntsho et al 2014 xue et al 2016 considering the membrane characteristics and concentration of the solution the local water flux is expressed by shaffer et al 2015 tiraferri et al 2013 1 j w a π d b exp j w s d π f b exp j w k f 1 b j w exp j w k f exp j w s d here a and b are the pure water and the solute permeability coefficient respectively and these are considered as properties of membrane for a specific pair of fs and ds s is the structural parameter of the membrane d represents the diffusivity of the ds and k f is feed solution mass transfer coefficient π d b and π f b represent the osmotic pressure corresponding to the bulk concentration of ds and fs in the same way the reverse solute flux rsf is determined by equation 2 tiraferri et al 2013 2 j s b c d b exp j w s d c f b exp j w k f 1 b j w exp j w k f exp j w s d here c d b and c f b are the bulk concentration of ds and fs 4 2 numerical simulation total water permeation through a large membrane area cannot be calculated by applying the mathematical models for water flux and rsf considering the whole membrane surface is exposed to the same concentration and velocity during the operation because of water flux and rsf ds is diluted and fs is concentrated along the path of flow which eventually reduces the solution concentration gradient therefore the membrane area was discretised to sufficiently smaller areas l w as shown in fig 3 and the models were applied iteratively to the discrete areas considering the effects of water flux and rsf of one discrete area on the next according to the directions of the flow mass balance equations were combined with the models to determine the local velocities and concentrations it was assumed that the velocities and concentrations changed only in the dominant direction of the flow moreover since the channels heights are too small and filled up with spacer velocity and concentration boundary layers in the height direction were considered negligible employing the mass balance equation the change in fs flowrate in the direction of their flow was expressed and solved numerically by the finite difference method to determine the local feed flowrate on the membrane surface as follows 3 q f i 1 j q f i j j w i j j s i j l w where i and j are the indexes which represent the location of the discrete area j w i j and j s i j represent the volume of water and salt diffuses through the discrete area of the membrane considering the dominant direction of flow the ds flow path was divided into three sections as shown in fig 3 at section 1 ds flowed in the forward direction and in a cross current configuration with the fs flow path at section 2 ds and fs flow paths are co current finally at section 3 ds flowed in the reverse direction as compared to section 1 but the fs and ds flow path remain in cross current mode thus the ds flowrate for different sections is described as for section 1 4 q d i j 1 q d i j j w i j j s i j l w for section 2 5 q d i 1 j q d i j j w i j j s i j l w for section 3 6 q d i j 1 q d i j j w i j j s i j l w local velocity of the solutions can be estimated by equations 7 and 8 when the flowrate and the physical dimensions of the channel and spacer are known sim et al 2015 7 u f i

cylindrical filament on the other hand ds side spacers consist of a feed spacer like structure sandwiched between two very thin finely porous net type structures which work as permeate carrier since the permeate carriers are very thin as compared to the feed spacer the dimensions of draw side spacers were assumed similar to the feed side spacers for the calculation of channel voidage however the voidage can be estimated as da costa et al 1994 9 ε s p 1 π d f 2 2 l m h s p s i n θ where d f is the diameter of spacer filaments l m is the length of mesh and θ is the angle as shown in fig 4 the

determined by calculating the amount of solute available in the unit amount of solution within the discrete area as shown in equations 14 and 15 14 c f b i j q f s l t i j q f i j 15 c d b i j q d s l t i j q d i j since fs flows at right angle to the ds and the ds changes its direction of flow the local water flux and rsf vary in both direction moreover the other variables such as flowrate velocity and concentration are dependent on the water flux and rsf as a result although these are one dimensional finite difference models but all the variables are function of both the length and width of the membrane sheet therefore the total water permeation from a module is estimated by a double integration of local water flux which is a function of both length and width as follows 16 q w e l m e n s h e e t i 1 m j 1 n j w i j d l d w here n s h e e t is the number of membrane sheets available in one element m m l e n g t h l and n n w i d t h w represent the number of discrete areas in length and width direction average water flux of a membrane element is the ratio of total permeation to the membrane surface area of a module which is given by 17 j w a v g e q w e l m e a e l m where a e l m is the total membrane surface area the amount of diluted ds produced after any element is expressed by summing all the local ds flowrates at the outlet of membrane sheet where j 1 18 q d o u t e n s h e e t i 1 m p 2 q d i 1 here p is the number of discrete areas along the width direction of the central glue line of a membrane sheet therefore p was calculated as p width of glue line l similarly the concentrated fs outlet flowrate of the element is 19 q f o u t e n s h e e t j 1 n q f m j final ds concentration after any element is given by 20 c d o u t e n s h e e t i 1 m p 2 q d s l t i 1 q d o u t e outlet concentration of the fs from an element 21 c f o u t e n s h e e t j 1 n q f s l t m j q f o u t e finally the recovery rate after any element is expressed as the percentage ratio of total fresh water permeation to the fs inlet flowrate 22 r e q d o u t e q d i n q f i n 100 4 3 optimization of design and operating conditions this section introduces a novel optimization algorithm that can determine the optimum ds flowrate and the number of elements required to obtain a targeted final ds concentration and recovery rate at a certain fs flowrate for a specific fo application generally the optimum operating condition is found based on either the maximum recovery rate or minimum final ds concentration previous studies however showed that higher recovery rate can be obtained by applying higher ds inlet flowrate or concentration which results in a higher final ds concentration mondal et al 2017 phuntsho et al 2017 so the design or operating conditions which provide maximum recovery rate or minimum final concentration are not always the optimum conditions therefore a new performance parameter overall performance rating opr was proposed in this study which combined the recovery rate and final ds concentration with the number of membrane elements opr can be defined as the percentage of overall design target achieved per element it was formulated by the multiplication of recovery fraction and concentration fraction however the recovery fraction is defined as the ratio of actual recovery rate achieved to the desired recovery rate and is given by 23 r f d e r d e r d here r d e and r f d e are the obtained recovery rate and recovery fraction respectively at a certain ds flowrate and the number of elements whereas r d is the targeted recovery rate on the other hand the concentration fraction is a ratio of targeted final concentration to the actual final concentration which is given by 24 c f d e c d f c d d e where c d f is the desired final ds concentration c d d e and c f d e are the achieved final concentration and concentration fraction respectively in order to prevent the overdesign the maximum values of recovery fraction and concentration fraction were considered one which means if r d e r d then r f d e 1 on the other hand if c d d e c d f then c f d e 1 combining the recovery fraction the concentration fraction and the number of elements opr is expressed by 25 o p r d e r f d e c f d e n e 100 here o p r d e is the value of overall performance rating for a certain ds flowrate and number of elements whereas n e is the number of elements required to obtain the recovery fraction and concentration fraction the proposed optimization method was implemented by calculating opr for several sets of operating conditions and selecting the operating conditions which provide the maximum value of opr the main drawback of this method is that the opr value of one set of operating conditions where the recovery fraction is very high and the concentration fraction is very low is similar with the opr values of other sets of operating conditions where the recovery fractions are very low and the concentration fractions are very high as a result this method sometimes finds the optimum operating conditions when the recovery rate is very high but the final ds concentration is higher than the targeted value on the other hand it may also find the optimum operating conditions where the final concentration is very low but the recovery rate is lower than the targeted recovery rate which is unacceptable in order to overcome this limitation search domain of operating conditions was constrained instead of searching the optimum conditions within the whole range it only searches when both the actual recovery rate and the final concentration are in an acceptable proximity to the targeted recovery rate and concentration this constrain was applied by o p r d e 0 when r f d e 1 f l or c f d e 1 f l here fl represents the acceptable deviation from the target and is termed as flexibility of design the proposed optimization algorithm is described in fig 5 the optimization process was started with the configuration of the design targets such as the final concentration c d f and recovery rate r d as well as the flexibility of design f l then the recovery rate and fs flowrate q f i n were configured as one target here the fs and ds inlet concentration c f i n and c d i n were initialized these operating conditions generally remain unchanged for a specific application for example fs and ds inlet concentrations are about 0 02 m and 0 6 m respectively for seawater dilution using wastewater in addition to this minimum dilution δ c e required to add more elements in a pressure vessel was configured it means that if reduction in ds concentration due to the addition of an element in a pressure vessel is less than δ c e no more element is added finally the ds inlet flowrate was incremented from an initial value q d i to a final value q d f by increasing the flowrate a small amount δ q d at each iteration for every ds flowrate the number of elements per pressure vessel was increased and opr of the fo system was investigated and compared to determine the optimum ds flowrate and number of elements per pressure vessel the number of element e was initialized with 1 and then the inlet operating conditions for the first element were set for the simulation using the mathematical models presented the simulation results provided the fs and ds outlet flowrate q f o u t and q d o u t and concentration c f o u t and c d o u t recovery rate and osmotic dilution by the element was calculated dilution by the addition of this element was calculated by 26 δ c d d e c d i n d e c d o u t d e the outlet ds concentration and recovery rate were then compared with the targeted final concentration and recovery target if the target was not achieved i e either the outlet concentration was higher than the final concentration target or the recovery rate was less than the recovery target the recovery fraction and concentration fraction were calculated and checked whether these fractions were within the acceptable range if any of these fractions were out of the acceptable limit opr was set as 0 otherwise opr was calculated using equation 25 then the dilution by the addition of this element δ c d d e was compared with the minimum required dilution for adding more element δ c e if the dilution was higher than the required minimum dilution the second element was added and the outlet conditions of the first element were considered as the inlet conditions for the second element then the same processes were repeated due to the addition of another element the recovery rate increased and the final concentration decreased however if the concentration or recovery rate still did not reach the target the recovery and concentration fractions were calculated again otherwise if these were in the acceptable range opr was calculated and the dilution was compared if it was less than the minimum required dilution the current ds inlet flowrate was checked whether it was the last value of the ds flowrate range if the targets were reached opr was calculated and the ds flowrate was compared with the last value of the range if the current flowrate was less than the last flowrate of the range the highest opr for this flowrate o p r d was found the optimum number of elements for this flowrate n e d was the corresponding number of elements for the o p r d then the ds inlet flowrate was incremented and the same process was continued in contrast if the current ds flowrate was the last value of the range the o p r d values for all flowrates were compared and the maximum value o p r o was selected ds flowrate q d o and the number of elements n e o corresponding to the maximum opr o p r o were the optimum operating conditions and design parameters for the desired final concentration and recovery rate 5 results and discussion a design and optimization software for the fo process was developed to perform the steps of the fo system analysis using matlab programming to justify the findings of the software it was used to design the fo process and the results were compared with our previously published experimental results kim et al 2018 where the same operating conditions and design parameters were used parameters considered for the simulation are furnished in table s1 of supplementary information si it also investigated the effects of different parameters on the performance of fo system in terms of recovery rate and final ds concentration in this section we first discussed the developed graphical user interfaces gui of the software then the justification of the analysis results and parametric study for the optimization of fo system 5 1 gui of fo system analysis software in this study a matlab based software was developed for the analysis of fo system it consists of seven different tabs to perform the different steps of the fo system analysis fig 6 shows one of the seven tabs of the software other tabs of this software are shown in section 2 of si project info is the first tab of this software in this interface a user can provide the project and analyser related information then in the feed solution analysis tab it receives the user input values of initial concentration and solution type in terms of tds or individual component concentration it displays the calculated osmotic pressure corresponding to the inlet concentration similarly in the draw solution analysis tab it receives the inlet concentration and displays the osmotic pressure in the optimization tab it receives the design objectives element type and flow configuration as input and displays the optimum ds inlet flowrate and the number of elements per pressure vessel as output followed by that in the configuration tab the user can specify the plant capacity and pump efficiencies later in the simulation tab all the simulated results are presented graphically and listed the full scale design parameters for example it shows that an fo plant with 50 recovery rate fs and ds inlet flowrates of 40 lpm and 4 70 lpm which produces 100 000 m3 of diluted draw solution per day at 0 15 m final concentration requires total 11 516 membrane elements and 2879 pressure vessel however since economic analysis is not in the scope this study it does not describe the seventh tab of the software 5 2 validation of experimental and simulated results in order to validate the outcomes of the software the simulation results of this software were compared with the findings of our previous experimental study kim et al 2018 a commercial 8040 spiral wound thin film composite fo membrane element was used for pilot scale fo experiments sodium chloride 0 6 m concentration solution was used as ds which is similar to that of typical seawater the application of fo systems in this study was dilution of seawater using wastewater effluent of membrane bioreactor mbr wastewater has an osmotic pressure of around 0 99 bar therefore fs was prepared by using nacl only to have the same osmotic pressure i e 0 02 m nacl without the presence of other components the fs and ds outlet of the first element was used as the inlet of the second element and so on these experiments were conducted up to 4 elements the inlet and outlet flowrate and concentration of the modules were recorded using electromagnetic flowmeters and conductivity meters connected to a pc through a data acquisition system the inlet flowrates of fs and ds for the first element were 40 lpm and 4 7 lpm respectively the same membrane element properties and operating conditions as shown table s1 in si were considered for this study to compare the analytical findings with the experimental results fig 7 compares the analytically estimated solution inlet concentrations and flowrates for increasing number of elements in a pressure vessel with the experimentally measured flowrates and concentrations it can be seen from the figure that the analytical results from the system analysis software are in a very good agreement with the experimental results it shows that due to the permeation of fresh water from fs to ds the flowrate of ds increased whereas the fs flowrate decreased in contrast the permeation of water caused dilution of ds but increased the concentration of fs according to this study inlet ds flowrate increased from 4 7 lpm to 21 lpm for the fourth element in a pressure vessel with only 2 8 average deviation from the experimental results similarly the fs flowrate decreased from 40 lpm to 20 5 lpm for the same number of element average deviation from the experimental results was only 2 on the other hand ds concentration decreased from 0 6 m to 0 13 m and fs concentration increased from 0 02 m to 0 03 m the average difference of theoretical fs concentration with the experimental study was found to be 5 25 as compared to the other parameters simulated ds concentration showed higher deviation about 12 from the experimental study however the reason for this deviation was an experimental error in the measurement of inlet ds concentration for the third element because although the inlet concentrations for other elements matched with the experimental value satisfactorily only the inlet ds concentration of the third elements deviated unexpectedly fig 8 further demonstrates the average water flux from the elements the average water flux for the first element was 26 5 lmh which reduced to 12 lmh for the fourth element due to the reduction in concentration gradient along the solution flow path it can be seen from the figure that the experimental results displayed a similar decreasing trend although the water flux for the second and third element indicated a little higher value this difference in analytical and experimental results was because of the additional pressure applied unintentionally due to the operation of pumps as a result of this additional pressure slightly higher water flux was noticed for the experimental investigation as compared to this theoretical system analysis however the average deviation from the experimental results for water flux was 7 in addition to this for the same operating conditions with a design objective of 50 recovery rate and 0 15 m final ds concentration the optimum number of elements in the pressure vessel was calculated using the proposed algorithm in section 4 3 when the flexibility in design was 5 table 1 explains the optimization algorithm the recovery rate and final concentrations were simulated and listed in the table since the recovery rates for the first second and third element were 5 less than the desired recovery rate i e out of the opr search domain rf was set as zero on the other hand as the recovery rate for the fifth and sixth element was higher than the targeted recovery rate rf was set to its maximum value 1 similarly the value of cf was calculated and furnished in table 1 considering the recovery fraction concentration fraction and number of elements opr was calculated and listed in the table it can be seen that for the discussed operating conditions and design objectives the maximum opr 24 28 objective element was achieved when 4 elements were used in a pressure vessel in comparison the experimental study also shows that the optimum number of elements in a pressure vessel was 4 kim et al 2018 the above discussion shows that the findings of the developed fo system analysis software satisfied the experimental results with a very close tolerance of deviation which is about 5 in average thus the software can be employed to design and optimize the full scale fo system for different applications and operating conditions 5 3 parametric optimization fig 9 shows the optimum ds flowrate and the number of elements in a pressure vessel for different design objectives i e for different desired recovery rates at various fs flowrates and final ds concentrations it can be seen from the figure that the lower the final ds concentration the lower the optimum inlet ds flowrate to the system according to fig 9 a for 0 15 m final ds concentration and 60 recovery rate when the inlet fs flowrate increased from 35 lpm to 65 lpm the optimum ds inlet flowrate increased from 7 lpm to 12 2 lpm on the other hand if the required final concentration was 0 1 m for the same recovery rate and fs flowrate range the optimum ds flowrate was lower it varied from 1 25 lpm to 7 75 lpm as the higher inlet ds flowrate means that the greater amounts of solute were present in the solution it resisted the dilution of the solution therefore for a lower final concentration and the same inlet ds concentration low ds flowrate was used but at the less ds concentration the recovery rate reduced therefore for a same recovery rate when the final concentration was lower more elements were required fig 9 a also shows that for 0 15 m final concentration and 60 recovery rate at 35 lpm and 65 lpm fs flowrate 4 and 6 elements were required in a pressure vessel respectively whereas for the same design objectives the required number of elements were 5 and 9 when the final concentration were 0 1 m in addition to this at 60 recovery rate with 35 65 lpm inlet fs flowrate 0 05 m final ds concentration cannot be achieved similarly fig 9 b and c show the optimum operating conditions for 50 and 40 recovery rate these figures also show the similar trend of ds flowrate and the number of elements it can be seen from the figures that for the high final concentration 0 15 m although the overall trend of the optimum ds flowrate was increasing when the fs flowrate increased but for few other fs flowrates the ds flowrate decreased at a regular interval since more permeation was required for the same recovery rate at higher fs flowrate the proposed optimization algorithm increased the number of elements and varied the ds flowrate within a range to find the optimum flowrate consequently at a certain interval the optimum ds flowrate decreased a little bit when the number of element increased but increased again with the increase in fs flowrate however for the low final concentration the optimum ds flowrate varied within a small range therefore the reduction in the optimum ds flowrate was not observed for the 0 1 m and 0 05 m final concentrations finally average flowrate ratios i e the average values of all ratios of fs flowrate to the ds flowrate for each recovery rate and final concentration were calculated and compared in fig 10 it shows that for a same ds final concentration the average flow ratio decreased when the recovery rate increased in comparison for a same recovery rate the flow ratio decreased if the final concentration decreased it can be seen that average flow ratios for 40 50 and 60 recovery rate at 0 15 m final ds concentration were 9 7 and 5 respectively for the same recovery rates at 0 1 m concentration fs inlet flowrate was 14 10 and 8 times higher than the ds flowrate finally at 0 05 m final concentration for 40 and 50 recovery rate the average flow ratios were 27 and 22 since 60 recovery rate was not obtained at 0 05 m final concentration fig 10 does not show average flow ratio for this recovery rate and final concentration 6 conclusions the current work developed a software to analyze and optimize the performance of a full scale fo system it modelled and simulated the performance of the fo system for various operating conditions and design parameters a novel overall performance parameter was presented to estimate the performance of the system considering both the recovery rate and the final ds concentration this overall performance parameter was used to compare performance at various operating conditions operating conditions corresponding to the maximum value of this parameter were the optimum conditions accordingly the main findings of this analytical work are listed below i higher ds inlet flowrate was required to obtain the higher recovery rate for the same final ds concentration in contrast lower ds flowrate was required when the targeted final ds concentration was lower for the same recovery rate ii increasing the number of elements in a pressure vessel increased the recovery rate and reduced the final ds concentration but after a certain number increasing the element was not optimal iii full scale fo system design parameters by the proposed system analysis software for 100000 m3 of diluted ds production capacity per day at 0 15 m final concentration are as follows when the recovery rate is 50 fs and ds inlet flowrates are 40 lpm and 4 7

19319,in recent years a significant effort has been devoted into investigating the effects of chloride on the degradation kinetics of aromatic pollutants the impact of chloride on the decomposition of short chain carboxylic acid intermediates from aromatics degradation has often been overlooked in this study the roles of chloride in the oxidation of maleic acid ma in the fe ii peroxymonosulfate pms process was investigated degradation efficiency reaction intermediates adsorbable organic halogen aox accumulation and mineralization were examined the chloride ion cl was found to have an overall negative impact on ma degradation and mineralization in the fe ii pms system the presence of cl led to the formation of chlorinated by products and a high production of aox the mineralization of ma was decreased with increasing cl concentrations kinetic modeling demonstrated the impact of various radicals largely depended on the concentration of cl the significance of cl2 or cl2 for ma destruction was enhanced with increasing cl content and overwhelmed that of so4 when the cl concentration was over 5 mm in the absence of cl so4 was the primary radical responsible for ma oxidation a possible degradation pathway is proposed cis trans isomerization decarboxylation and halogenations processes these results may help to understand the full oxidation pathways of refractory aromatic

compounds such as various phenolic compounds polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and petroleum contaminants are the most important classes of pollutants in industrial wastewater over the past decades researchers have paid great attention to the degradation efficiency transformation pathways and the related mechanisms of these aromatic compounds rastogi et al 2009 anipsitakis et al 2006 the oxidative cleavage of the aromatic ring would lead to the formation of short chain carboxylic acids tanaka and reddy 2002 assabane et al 2000 which are responsible for the residual total organic carbon toc in solution after a long reaction time herrmann et al 1993 as the toxicity of these intermediates is generally low and most of them are biodegradable franch et al 2005 there has been a lack of importance placed on the fate of short chain carboxylic acids although they are frequently identified in the degradation of pollutants among the various kinds of carboxylic acids maleic acid ma is regarded as the main intermediate generated during the oxidation of aromatic compounds stylidi et al 2003 kayan et al 2010 lai et al 2013 lu et al 2006 li et al 1999a b stylidi et al 2003 found ma was one kind of intermediate produced during the degradation of acid orange 7 by tio2 based photocatalysis kayan et al 2010 confirmed that the gradual cleavage of the unstable intermediates of acid red 97 could lead to the generation of carboxylic acids including ma before conversion to co2 in both wet oxidation and electro fenton systems lai et al 2013 also reported that ma was produced during the oxidative degradation process of alizarin red s using electro fenton lu et al 2006 observed that ma was one of the major products when the benzene rings of 2 4 dichlorophenol were broken and could be eventually oxidized into co2 and h2o ma was also observed as an intermediate in the degradation of 4 chlorophenol li et al 1999a b and hydroxylated bicyclic aromatic compounds bouquet somrani et al 1996 in aops systems in addition to a wide number of non biodegradable organic compounds industrial wastewater also contains large amounts of chloride ions cl which may scavenge ho or so4 to produce less reactive chlorine species cl cl2 or react with pms to form cl2 hclo liao et al 2001 fang et al 2012 xu et al 2013 in our previous studies a dual impact of cl was found in the degradation of aromatic compounds by pms based aops systems wang et al 2011 2017a yuan et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 wang et al 2011 observed the degradation rates of ao7 decreased at cl 10 mm whereas a promoting effect was seen when the cl concentration was above 50 mm in the co ii pms system yuan et al 2012 found the dual effect of chloride accelerating then inhibitory in the photocatalytic oxidation of ao7 via a chlorine radical mediated mechanism moreover investigations on other aromatic compounds including 4 chloro 2 nitrophenol zhou et al 2015 and 4 chlorophenol wang et al 2017a b also indicated dual effects of cl on the activated pms system in the saline wastewater currently most investigations focused on the degradation efficiency and mechanism of non biodegradable compounds containing one or more aromatic rings few reports concern the impact of cl on the subsequent oxidation of degradation intermediates such as short chain carboxylic acids of aromatic compounds huang et al 2017 our recent study has demonstrated that chloride has an overall negative effect on the degradation of phthalic acid a common aromatic intermediate of polycyclic aromatic compounds differing from the dual effect of cl observed on degradation of its parent compound huang et al 2017 notably it is known that chloride ions would lead to the formation of the chlorinated by products which may be more toxic than the parent compounds rizzo et al 2009 in fact the degradation intermediates of aromatic organic compounds may influence the mineralization and toxicity of industrial wastewater vinodgopal et al 1998 işlk and sponza 2004 however few studies paid attention to the degradation kinetics of ma and the formation mechanism of chlorinated by products in the presence of cl by aops despite its importance in elucidating the detailed destruction pathway of aromatic pollutants moreover kinetics analysis until now has been insufficiently investigated due to the complicated reaction conditions involving various radicals and several unknown rate constants it is suggested that chloride could not only eliminate so4 to produce less reactive chlorine radicals cl cl2 and hocl through reactions eqs 4 7 but also directly reacts with pms via electron transfer which complicates the kinetics analysis and reaction mechanism therefore it is necessary to apply kinetic modeling to decipher the free radical

1996 an automatic adsorption system automatic preparation unit 2 jena germany was used for sample preparation the detection of aox ranged between 1 μg and 100 μg and described as the absolute content of cl total organic carbon determinations were performed with a multi n c 3100 toc analyzer jena germany 2 3 4 kinetic modeling kinetic modeling was performed using a chemical modeling software kintecus 6 51 http www kintecus com table s2 lists the radical reactions used as input for the program the formation and transformation of oh so4 chlorine radicals were simulated under certain conditions table s2 most reaction rate constants are cited from the previous literature guan et al 2011 grebel et al 2010 nfodzo and choi 2011 reactions of chlorate chlorite are not included in the present model because of their negligible formation at ph 3 0 jaksić et al 1969 the kintecus program combined with a numerical routine was performed to accurately simulate species profiles for the unknown or poorly defined parameters according to the method recommended by rose and waite 2002 the average normalized square of residuals between the original control model output and the perturbed model output was applied to evaluate sensitivity of the model to a particular reaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe ii pms ratio a pseudo first order kinetic model is used to express the degradation rates under different conditions and the expression is shown in eq 8 where c 0 is the initial ma concentration c represents the residual concentration of ma at time t min k is the degradation rate constant min 1 t is the reaction time 8 c c 0 e kt in this study experiments were conducted to determine the effects of the concentration of fe ii and pms on ma oxidation performance by changing the molar ratio of fe ii and pms while keeping the initial fe ii or pms concentration constant as shown in fig 1 the maximum rates of ma degradation were observed at 1 1 molar ratio the related degradation profiles of ma are shown in fig s1 in fig 1a the rate constant for ma degradation increased from 0 46 10 3 to 0 29 min 1 when the molar ratio of fe ii and pms decreased from 3 1 to 1 1 which is ascribed to more free radical formation driven by the higher concentration of pms watts and teel 2006 as the molar ratio of fe ii and pms was 1 2 and 1 3 the degradation rates of ma in the fe ii pms system were decreased to about 0 087 and 0 039 min 1 respectively the excess hso5 could act as a scavenger of so4 radicals in the solution and then produce the less reactive radical so5 eq 9 reducing the degradation rates of ma by the fe ii pms process wang et al 2017b a similar trend was also observed during the decomposition of bisphenol a in a uv pms system sharma et al 2015 however the rate constant of ma degradation in the fe ii pms system was 2 4 10 3 7 4 10 3 1 4 10 2 0 29 0 13 and 5 4 10 2 min 1 by decreasing the molar ratio from 3 1 to 1 3 with pms 0 0 2 mm in fig 1b respectively it is reported that pms could be easily activated by fe ii to form sulfate radicals via eq 2 while the excess concentration of fe ii may scavenge parts of sulfate radicals in the aqueous solution and decrease the degradation rates through eq 10 huang et al 2016 rastogi et al 2007 these results are consistent with previous studies nfodzo and choi 2011 observed that the presence of excessive fe ii and pms is adverse to triclosan oxidation by sulfate radicals neyens and baeyens 2003 also reported that the organic free radicals in the solution may be oxidized by excess fe ii or h2o2 in the classic fenton reaction therefore the optimum molar ratio of fe ii and pms would be 1 1 for ma degradation in the present work 9 hso5 so4 hso4 so5 10 fe ii so4 fe iii so4 2 k 10 3 0 108 m 1s 1 3 2 effect of chloride concentration it is well known that wastewater discharged from the dye industry often contains high concentration of nacl 50 80 g l 1 which is used for improving dye fixation and completion wang et al 2017b dong et al 2007 effects of cl on oxidative removal of ma were evaluated in fig 2 the nacl in the aqueous solution had an inhibitory effect on ma degradation process in the fe ii pms cl system the adverse effect of cl on ma degradation was significantly enhanced with increasing cl concentration for example at cl 300 mm rate constant k is about 33 5 times lower than that in the absence of chloride in our previous work a dual impact of chloride at different dosages was obtained on the dye decoloration wang et al 2011 yuan et al 2011 whereas an overall negative impact was observed on the degradation of their intermediate phthalic acid in saline wastewater treatment huang et al 2017 this can be attributed to the electron scavenging and or only weak electron donating substituent carboxyl group which can decrease the chlorine attack on specific sites on the aromatic ring by reducing chlorine reactivity 3 3 lc ms analysis to further evaluate the major reaction by products and the transformation mechanisms of ma in the chloride rich solution a lc ms analysis was performed the concentration of the substrate pms and fe ii was increased by five times to ensure that most intermediates were detectable by lc ms the identified intermediates information including the formula accurate mass spectrum and the tentatively proposed chemical structures is listed in table 1 notably the chlorinated intermediates are marked in red lc ms data show that 12 kinds of products were identified during ma degradation process with 100 mm cl involved such as acetic acid p1 franch et al 2002 2004 2005 herrmann et al 1999 acrylic acid p2 franch et al 2002 2005 oh et al 2004 2 hydroxypropanoic acid lactic acid p3 herrmann et al 1999 2 3 dihydroxybutanedioic acid tartaric acid p5 franch et al 2002 2004 herrmann et al 1999 oh et al 2004 it should be pointed out that six chlorinated by products were detected in the fe ii pms cl process such as z 1 4 4 trichlorobut 2 en 1 ol 3 4 dichloro 2 4 dihydroxybutanoic acid 4 4 dichlorobutane 1 1 2 3 tetraol 3 4 4 trichloro 2 hydroxybutanoic acid 3 4 4 trichlorobutane 1 1 2 triol and 2 3 4 4 tetrachlorobutane 1 1 diol we have not detected products such as malonic acid oxalic acid or formic acid during ma oxidation as reported previously franch et al 2002 2004 3 4 aox accumulation the lc ms analysis confirms that some chlorinated by products were formed during the ma degradation in the presence of chloride ion aox is an important measure for halogenated compounds and could quantify the total amounts of the chlorinated by products previous studies have focused on the impact of chloride on aox accumulation or decay for non biodegradable pollutants containing one or more aromatic rings in their chemical structure wang et al 2017a fang et al 2017 ramjaun et al 2011 few investigations paid attention to aox formation from a short chain organic acid fig 3 a shows the results of aox measurements under different conditions in the fe ii pms cl system the initial aox value at t 0 min represented the sole contribution from the substrates as depicted in fig 3a the aox values were dependent upon cl concentration and reaction time aox levels increased significantly in the ma degradation process as chloride content 0 300 mm and reaction time 0 90 min increased implying that the enhanced generation of chlorinated organic intermediates as the concentration of cl and reaction time were increased briefly as chloride concentration increased from 0 to 300 mm aox amounts in the solution after 90 min of treatment increased from 3 9 10 2 to 0 36 mg l as reported in our previous work aox formation with chloride ions mainly occurs via a sulfate chlorine radical attack on the carboxylic acid itself or its intermediates or direct chlorination by cl2 hclo to generate rcl type organohalogens huang et al 2017 yuan et al 2011 in addition the inhibited degradation rate in fig 2 and the enhanced aox levels fig 3a of ma imply that the chlorinated by products were supposed to originate from the chlorination of secondary byproducts of ma rather than ma itself hence it is reasonable to expect that oxidative degradation of the short chain organic acid leads to the generation of some chlorinated compounds in a saline environment 3 5 mineralization all the results obtained from lc ms and aox analysis indicate that chlorinated by products were yielded when cl was present in the fe ii pms system as shown in fig 3b the mineralization of ma was evaluated from analyzing the changes of toc with reaction time in the absence of chloride ion 88 0 of ma could be mineralized after 90 min of oxidation in the fe ii pms system the percentage of ma degradation was higher than that of its toc removal without adding chloride ion this result indicates that the oxidation intermediates may be more refractory than the parent compound ma oliviero et al 2001 mikulová et al 2007 however toc removal dramatically decreased to 59 8 with the addition of 5 mm chloride ion when cl concentration was up to 100 mm 33 7 mineralization of ma was obtained after 90 min of treatment in combination with the lc ms data it is evident that ma was converted to some chlorinated intermediates which are rather difficult to be mineralized with chloride ion in the fe ii pms system 3 6 kinetic modeling 3 6 1 effect of chloride concentration kintecus 6 51 is a chemical simulation program that can be easily operated within microsoft excel and has a built in function for fitting optimizing rate constants against experimental data in this work kintecus gives an acceptable fit to the experimental data for all the conditions tested a typical kinetic plot is shown in fig 4 to better understand the reaction pathways and the participation of various radicals in chain propagation reactions profiles of main radicals and their contributions during ma degradation were investigated as depicted in fig 5 levels of so4 decreased with chloride concentration varying from 0 to 300 mm consistent with the results by pseudo steady state assumption fang et al 2012 however the yield of oh was enhanced rapidly as the content of cl ranged from 0 to 5 mm while declined obviously with a further increase in chloride dosage in general the content of oh was much lower than so4 because so4 is regarded as the predominant free radical under acidic conditions liang et al 2007 yan et al 2011 the concentrations of cl2 and hocl increased with an increase in cl dosage the amount of cl increased within the range of 0 5 mm chloride whereas decreased when cl 5 mm this is due to the conversion of cl to cl2 or hocl through eqs 4 6 the concentration of hclo was found to decline with increasing cl content however cl2 increased gradually when chloride concentration ranged between 0 and 200 mm a slight decline of cl2 was observed with 300 mm chloride mainly due to the transformation from cl2 to cl2 under acidic conditions ph 3 0 hocl may be transformed to cl easily with a rate constant of 2 1 1010 m 1 s 1 therefore the concentration of hocl was fairly low 10 14 m 1 s 1 and the data are not shown it is worth noting that the concentration of cl2 in a chloride rich solution was higher than other species so4 oh cl hocl hclo and cl2 and became the predominant radical accounting for the oxidation of ma however interestingly the reactivity of cl2 was not sufficient to overwhelm the significance of so4 at initial cl 5 mm in fig 6 in the presence of low cl concentrations 5 mm the rate constant of reaction between so4 and ma was 6 0 109 m 1s 1 which was considerably higher than that between cl2 and ma 3 0 106 m 1s 1 a further addition of cl led to the formation of less reactive chlorine from so4 via eq 4 thus decreased the degradation efficiency of ma it should be emphasized that a direct involvement of cl radical in degrading ma should be minimal because cl radical may readily react with water and cl largely diminishing the steady state concentration of cl and yielding the milder oxidant cl2 radical in addition the various degradation rates of the substrate are not only related to the proportion of each oxidation radical but also to their reaction rate constant with the substrate the different reaction rates between the radicals and the substrate are listed in table s2 varying from 104 to 109 m 1s 1 hence the contributions of the main radicals to ma degradation were significantly different 3 6 2 sensitivity analysis it is assumed that sensitivity analysis could indicate the significance of each reaction in the model fig 7 shows the sensitivity of the each examined reaction no 1 16 subject to independently varied rate constant in the presence of 5 mm and 100 mm of chloride the consumption of so4 and formation of less reactive radicals via reaction 5 in fig 7 was the rate controlling step and had the most significant effect on ma degradation with 5 mm cl involved the significance of so4 for ma oxidation was also crucial at a low chloride dosage reaction 11 in fig 7 the formation of cl2 by the transformation of cl with high rate constant of 6 5 109 m 1s 1 could take place according to reaction 8 however the degradation of ma was obviously influenced by the oxidation of cl2 or cl in the presence of 100 mm cl reaction 12 and 13 in fig 7 the reaction between fe ii and pms with the rate constant of 3 4 104 m 1s 1 played a vital part in ma destruction reaction 1 in fig 7 the quenching reaction of so4 by fe ii or pms were found to be rather important in the process especially when 100 mm chloride was present therefore it is of great significance to select the optimum concentrations of fe ii and pms according to the nature and concentration of the substrate in the presence of 100 mm chloride the degradation of ma was strongly influenced by the reaction between the substrate and cl2 compared to hclo the formation and dissociation of hocl with cl involved the destruction of ma by hocl were also critical in the model according to fig 7 oh could react with cl2 or so4 in the presence of 100 mm cl with high rate constant of 1 0 109 m 1s 1 or 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 respectively the oxidation of ma was significantly impacted by the formation of cl2 and cl2 species reaction 12 and 16 in fig 7 particularly under high salinity conditions this may be attributed to the high reactivity and large amount of the oxidized species in the process consistent with the results in figs 5 and 6 on the contrary the destruction of ma was not sensitive enough by the reactions with cl hocl and hclo in the overall oxidation process reaction 13 15 in fig 7 mainly due to the lower rate constant and smaller proportion of these radicals in the solution the reactions with so4 prevailed under the low salinity conditions owing to the consumption of so4 and formation of less reactive radicals with an increase of cl content reaction 5 in fig 7 in addition the amount of oh in acidic solutions was rather low therefore the effect of oh on ma degradation was low via reaction 10 in fig 7 3 7 mechanism and pathways a reaction mechanism is proposed for the formation of chlorinated intermediates and accumulation of aox in the fe ii pms cl process in the presence of low dosages of cl 5 mm chloride can be oxidized to chlorine radicals by strongly oxidizing radicals via reaction 4 and 5 which could generate from pms catalyzed by fe ii huang et al 2017 fang et al 2012 kinetic rates of ma oxidation may be decelerated in the presence of the less reactive chlorine radicals e0 cl cl 2 41 v vs nhe e0 cl2 2cl 2 0 v vs nhe wang et al 2017a hepel and luo 2001 similar inhibitory effects of low levels of cl were observed during the oxidation of aromatic molecules 4 chloro 2 nitrophenol zhou et al 2015 4 chlorophenol wang et al 2017a and phthalic acid huang et al 2017 in pms based systems under chloride rich conditions the excess addition of cl significantly inhibited the degradation of unsaturated carboxylic acid ma two main mechanisms should be considered firstly pms could oxidize excess chloride ions to form chlorine species hclo cl2 in the presence of high levels of cl via eqs 12 and 13 yuan et al 2011 however hclo has high selectivity to organic compounds and the reactivity is usually apt to oxygenated moieties in particular carboxylic acid moiety is highly stable with chlorine in aqueous solution deborde and von gunten 2008 in our previous studies the carboxyl group of phthalic acid could also decrease the chlorine reactivity for attacking specific sites of the aromatic ring huang et al 2017 on the other hand reactions between hclo and unsaturated bonds in ma are generally slow or negligible deborde and von gunten 2008 a low reactivity of hclo towards sorbic acid with the conjugated double bond in its structure was observed by prütz 1998 whereas no chlorine reactivity with progesterone double bond was found by deborde et al 2004 12 cl hso5 so4 2 hocl 13 2cl hso5 h so4 2 cl2 h2o based on identification of degradation intermediates and formation of aox during fe ii pms cl process a schematic degradation pathway of ma is proposed in fig 8 once oxidation of ma occurs the cis trans isomerization process could lead to formation of fumaric acid prior to the decarboxylation process franch et al 2005 oh et al 2004 nozaki and authoranonymous 1941 maleic acid might be attacked by sulfate radicals to produce compound 4 through a decarboxylation reaction it has been previously proposed that the degradation of ma mainly occurs via pathway route 1 and 2 leading to 2 3 dihydroxysuccinic acid compound 5 and acrylic acid compound 2 respectively franch et al 2002 herrmann et al 1999 the formation of acetic acid compound 1 could take place through route 2 franch et al 2005 on the other hand decarboxylation of 2 3 dihydroxysuccinic acid compound 5 leads to the generation of compound 6 via route 1 notably halogenation can occur through chlorine attack on specific sites of intermediates producing gradually chlorinated species compound 7 8 10 11 12 in the presence of chloride ions obviously compound 9 4 4 dichlorobutane 1 1 2 3 tetraol is from the decarboxylation process of compound 10 finally 2 hydroxypropanoic acid compound 3 is supposed to be formed by the further oxidation of radicals according to the data from aox formation route 1 and 3 instead of the route 2 becomes the main pathway for the oxidation of compound 4 the formation of chlorinated by products inhibits the complete mineralization of organics because most chlorinated compounds are generally refractory keith and telliard 1979 moreover the formation of the non biodegradable chlorinated by products could lead to the increasing of aox levels in the fe ii pms cl system 4 conclusion the degradation kinetics and mechanism of ma a typical short chain carboxylic acid generated from oxidation of aromatic organic compounds were investigated in the fe ii pms cl process the results indicate that chloride ions 0 300 mm had an adverse impact on the degradation rates of ma due to the low chlorine reactivity towards carboxylic acid moieties and unsaturated bonds aox formation increased as chloride concentration increased the chlorinated by products formation and aox accumulation indicate that the oxidation of ma raises a potential environmental risk for saline wastewater treatment according to the kinetic modeling results cl2 was the predominant radicals at cl 5 mm while so4 was mainly responsible for the degradation of ma without the addition of chloride sensitivity analysis reveals the importance of the main reactions for ma oxidation a possible degradation pathway for ma in saline wastewater is proposed the present work suggests that the appreciable levels of chloride in wastewater may reduce the degradation rates of short chain carboxylic acid intermediates of aromatic compounds and even lead to the formation of more toxic chlorinated by products during aops treatment therefore it is urgent to develop an effective technology for the treatment of the secondary degradation by products of organic compounds it is also important to modify processes to minimize formation of toxic transformation products during wastewater treatment acknowledgments this work was

19319,in recent years a significant effort has been devoted into investigating the effects of chloride on the degradation kinetics of aromatic pollutants the impact of chloride on the decomposition of short chain carboxylic acid intermediates from aromatics degradation has often been overlooked in this study the roles of chloride in the oxidation of maleic acid ma in the fe ii peroxymonosulfate pms process was investigated degradation efficiency reaction intermediates adsorbable organic halogen aox accumulation and mineralization were examined the chloride ion cl was found to have an overall negative impact on ma degradation and mineralization in the fe ii pms system the presence of cl led to the formation of chlorinated by products and a high production of aox the mineralization of ma was decreased with increasing cl concentrations kinetic modeling demonstrated the impact of various radicals largely depended on the concentration of cl the significance of cl2 or cl2 for ma destruction was enhanced with increasing cl content and overwhelmed that of so4 when the cl concentration was over 5 mm in the absence of cl so4 was the primary radical responsible for ma oxidation a possible degradation pathway is proposed cis trans isomerization decarboxylation and halogenations processes these results may help to understand the full oxidation pathways of refractory aromatic compounds and the mechanism of chlorinated by products formation in industrial saline wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords chloride advanced oxidation processes chlorinated by

generated increasing interest in wastewater treatment owing to their ability to oxidize refractory contaminants by the hydroxyl radical oh andreozzi et al 1999 riga et al 2007 at present sulfate radical so4 based aops have shown great potential for applications in the treatment of industrial wastewater ling et al 2010 deng et al 2013 an efficient precursor of so4 is peroxymonosulfate pms

compounds such as various phenolic compounds polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and petroleum contaminants are the most important classes of pollutants in industrial wastewater over the past decades researchers have paid great attention to the degradation efficiency transformation pathways and the related mechanisms of these aromatic compounds rastogi et al 2009 anipsitakis et al 2006 the oxidative cleavage of the aromatic ring would lead to the formation of short chain carboxylic acids tanaka and reddy 2002 assabane et al 2000 which are responsible for the residual total organic carbon toc in solution after a long reaction time herrmann et al 1993 as the toxicity of these intermediates is generally low and most of them are biodegradable franch et al 2005 there has been a lack of importance placed on the fate of short chain carboxylic acids although they are frequently identified in the degradation of pollutants among the various kinds of carboxylic acids maleic acid ma is regarded as the main intermediate generated during the oxidation of aromatic compounds stylidi et al 2003 kayan et al 2010 lai et al 2013 lu et al 2006 li et al 1999a b stylidi et al 2003 found ma was one kind of intermediate produced during the degradation of acid orange 7 by tio2 based photocatalysis kayan et al 2010 confirmed that the gradual cleavage of the unstable intermediates of acid red 97 could lead to the generation of carboxylic acids including ma before conversion to co2 in both wet oxidation and electro fenton systems lai et al 2013 also reported that ma was produced during the oxidative degradation process of alizarin red s using electro fenton lu et al 2006 observed that ma was one of the major products when the benzene rings of 2 4 dichlorophenol were broken and could be eventually oxidized into co2 and h2o ma was also observed as an intermediate in the degradation of 4 chlorophenol li et al 1999a b and hydroxylated bicyclic aromatic compounds bouquet somrani et al 1996 in aops systems in addition to a wide number of non biodegradable organic compounds industrial wastewater also contains large amounts of chloride ions cl which may scavenge ho or so4 to produce less reactive chlorine species cl cl2 or react with pms to form cl2 hclo liao et al 2001 fang et al 2012 xu et al 2013 in our previous studies a dual impact of cl was found in the degradation of aromatic compounds by pms based aops systems wang et al 2011 2017a yuan et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 wang et al 2011 observed the degradation rates of ao7 decreased at cl 10 mm whereas a promoting effect was seen when the cl concentration was above 50 mm in the co ii pms system yuan et al 2012 found the dual effect of chloride accelerating then inhibitory in the photocatalytic oxidation of ao7 via a chlorine radical mediated mechanism moreover investigations on other aromatic compounds including 4 chloro 2 nitrophenol zhou et al 2015 and 4 chlorophenol wang et al 2017a b also indicated dual effects of cl on the activated pms system in the saline wastewater currently most investigations focused on the degradation efficiency and mechanism of non biodegradable compounds containing one or more aromatic rings few reports concern the impact of cl on the subsequent oxidation of degradation intermediates such as short chain carboxylic acids of aromatic compounds huang et al 2017 our recent study has demonstrated that chloride has an overall negative effect on the degradation of phthalic acid a common aromatic intermediate of polycyclic aromatic compounds differing from the dual effect of cl observed on degradation of its parent compound huang et al 2017 notably it is known that chloride ions would lead to the formation of the chlorinated by products which may be more toxic than the parent compounds rizzo et al 2009 in fact the degradation intermediates of aromatic organic compounds may influence the mineralization and toxicity of industrial wastewater vinodgopal et al 1998 işlk and sponza 2004 however few studies paid attention to the degradation kinetics of ma and the formation mechanism of chlorinated by products in the presence of cl by aops despite its importance in elucidating the detailed destruction pathway of aromatic pollutants moreover kinetics analysis until now has been insufficiently investigated due to the complicated reaction conditions involving various radicals and several unknown rate constants it is suggested that chloride could not only eliminate so4 to produce less reactive chlorine radicals cl cl2 and hocl through reactions eqs 4 7 but also directly reacts with pms via electron transfer which complicates the kinetics analysis and reaction mechanism therefore it is necessary to apply kinetic modeling to decipher the free radical chemistry in the fe ii pms system mcelroy 1990 huie et al 1991 grebel et al 2010 grebel et al 2010 kläning et al 1985b grebel et al 2010 so4 cl so4 2 cl k 4f 2 7 108 m 1s 1 4 k 4r 2 5 108 m 1s 1 cl cl

1996 an automatic adsorption system automatic preparation unit 2 jena germany was used for sample preparation the detection of aox ranged between 1 μg and 100 μg and described as the absolute content of cl total organic carbon determinations were performed with a multi n c 3100 toc analyzer jena germany 2 3 4 kinetic modeling kinetic modeling was performed using a chemical modeling software kintecus 6 51 http www kintecus com table s2 lists the radical reactions used as input for the program the formation and transformation of oh so4 chlorine radicals were simulated under certain conditions table s2 most reaction rate constants are cited from the previous literature guan et al 2011 grebel et al 2010 nfodzo and choi 2011 reactions of chlorate chlorite are not included in the present model because of their negligible formation at ph 3 0 jaksić et al 1969 the kintecus program combined with a numerical routine was performed to accurately simulate species profiles for the unknown or poorly defined parameters according to the method recommended by rose and waite 2002 the average normalized square of residuals between the original control model output and the perturbed model output was applied to evaluate sensitivity of the model to a particular reaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe ii pms ratio a pseudo first order kinetic model is used to express the degradation rates under different conditions and the expression is shown in eq 8 where c 0 is the initial ma concentration c represents the residual concentration of ma at time t min k is the degradation rate constant min 1 t is the reaction time 8 c c 0 e kt in this study experiments were conducted to determine the effects of the concentration of fe ii and pms on ma oxidation performance by changing the molar ratio of fe ii and pms while keeping the initial fe ii or pms concentration constant as shown in fig 1 the maximum rates of ma degradation were observed at 1 1 molar ratio the related degradation profiles of ma are shown in fig s1 in fig 1a the rate constant for ma degradation increased from 0 46 10 3 to 0 29 min 1 when the molar ratio of fe ii and pms decreased from 3 1 to 1 1 which is ascribed to more free radical formation driven by the higher concentration of pms watts and teel 2006 as the molar ratio of fe ii and pms was 1 2 and 1 3 the degradation rates of ma in the fe ii pms system were decreased to about 0 087 and 0 039 min 1 respectively the excess hso5 could act as a scavenger of so4 radicals in the solution and then produce the less reactive radical so5 eq 9 reducing the degradation rates of ma by the fe ii pms process wang et al 2017b a similar trend was also observed during the decomposition of bisphenol a in a uv pms system sharma et al 2015 however the rate constant of ma degradation in the fe ii pms system was 2 4 10 3 7 4 10 3 1 4 10 2 0 29 0 13 and 5 4 10 2 min 1 by decreasing the molar ratio from 3 1 to 1 3 with pms 0 0 2 mm in fig 1b respectively it is reported that pms could be easily activated by fe ii to form sulfate radicals via eq 2 while the excess concentration of fe ii may scavenge parts of sulfate radicals in the aqueous solution and decrease the degradation rates through eq 10 huang et al 2016 rastogi et al 2007 these results are consistent with previous studies nfodzo and choi 2011 observed that the presence of excessive fe ii and pms is adverse to triclosan oxidation by sulfate radicals neyens and baeyens 2003 also reported that the organic free radicals in the solution may be oxidized by excess fe ii or h2o2 in the classic fenton reaction therefore the optimum molar ratio of fe ii and pms would be 1 1 for ma degradation in the present work 9 hso5 so4 hso4 so5 10 fe ii so4 fe iii so4 2 k 10 3 0 108 m 1s 1 3 2 effect of chloride concentration it is well known that wastewater discharged from the dye industry often contains high concentration of nacl 50 80 g l 1 which is used for improving dye fixation and completion wang et al 2017b dong et al 2007 effects of cl on oxidative removal of ma were evaluated in fig 2 the nacl in the aqueous solution had an inhibitory effect on ma degradation process in the fe ii pms cl system the adverse effect of cl on ma degradation was significantly enhanced with increasing cl concentration for example at cl 300 mm rate constant k is about 33 5 times lower than that in the absence of chloride in our previous work a dual impact of chloride at different dosages was obtained on the dye decoloration wang et al 2011 yuan et al 2011 whereas an overall negative impact was observed on the degradation of their intermediate phthalic acid in saline wastewater treatment huang et al 2017 this can be attributed to the electron scavenging and or only weak electron donating substituent carboxyl group which can decrease the chlorine attack on specific sites on the aromatic ring by reducing chlorine reactivity 3 3 lc ms analysis to further evaluate the major reaction by products and the transformation mechanisms of ma in the chloride rich solution a lc ms analysis was performed the concentration of the substrate pms and fe ii was increased by five times to ensure that most intermediates were detectable by lc ms the identified intermediates information including the formula accurate mass spectrum and the tentatively proposed chemical structures is listed in table 1 notably the chlorinated intermediates are marked in red lc ms data show that 12 kinds of products were identified during ma degradation process with 100 mm cl involved such as acetic acid p1 franch et al 2002 2004 2005 herrmann et al 1999 acrylic acid p2 franch et al 2002 2005 oh et al 2004 2 hydroxypropanoic acid lactic acid p3 herrmann et al 1999 2 3 dihydroxybutanedioic acid tartaric acid p5 franch et al 2002 2004 herrmann et al 1999 oh et al 2004 it should be pointed out that six chlorinated by products were detected in the fe ii pms cl process such as z 1 4 4 trichlorobut 2 en 1 ol 3 4 dichloro 2 4 dihydroxybutanoic acid 4 4 dichlorobutane 1 1 2 3 tetraol 3 4 4 trichloro 2 hydroxybutanoic acid 3 4 4 trichlorobutane 1 1 2 triol and 2 3 4 4 tetrachlorobutane 1 1 diol we have not detected products such as malonic acid oxalic acid or formic acid during ma oxidation as reported previously franch et al 2002 2004 3 4 aox accumulation the lc ms analysis confirms that some chlorinated by products were formed during the ma degradation in the presence of chloride ion aox is an important measure for halogenated compounds and could quantify the total amounts of the chlorinated by products previous studies have focused on the impact of chloride on aox accumulation or decay for non biodegradable pollutants containing one or more aromatic rings in their chemical structure wang et al 2017a fang et al 2017 ramjaun et al 2011 few investigations paid attention to aox formation from a short chain organic acid fig 3 a shows the results of aox measurements under different conditions in the fe ii pms cl system the initial aox value at t 0 min represented the sole contribution from the substrates as depicted in fig 3a the aox values were dependent upon cl concentration and reaction time aox levels increased significantly in the ma degradation process as chloride content 0 300 mm and reaction time 0 90 min increased implying that the enhanced generation of chlorinated organic intermediates as the concentration of cl and reaction time were increased briefly as chloride concentration increased from 0 to 300 mm aox amounts in the solution after 90 min of treatment increased from 3 9 10 2 to 0 36 mg l as reported in our previous work aox formation with chloride ions mainly occurs via a sulfate chlorine radical attack on the carboxylic acid itself or its intermediates or direct chlorination by cl2 hclo to generate rcl type organohalogens huang et al 2017 yuan et al 2011 in addition the inhibited degradation rate in fig 2 and the enhanced aox levels fig 3a of ma imply that the chlorinated by products were supposed to originate from the chlorination of secondary byproducts of ma rather than ma itself hence it is reasonable to expect that oxidative degradation of the short chain organic acid leads to the generation of some chlorinated compounds in a saline environment 3 5 mineralization all the results obtained from lc ms and aox analysis indicate that chlorinated by products were yielded when cl was present in the fe ii pms system as shown in fig 3b the mineralization of ma was evaluated from analyzing the changes of toc with reaction time in the absence of chloride ion 88 0 of ma could be mineralized after 90 min of oxidation in the fe ii pms system the percentage of ma degradation was higher than that of its toc removal without adding chloride ion this result indicates that the oxidation intermediates may be more refractory than the parent compound ma oliviero et al 2001 mikulová et al 2007 however toc removal dramatically decreased to 59 8 with the addition of 5 mm chloride ion when cl concentration was up to 100 mm 33 7 mineralization of ma was obtained after 90 min of treatment in combination with the lc ms data it is evident that ma was converted to some chlorinated intermediates which are rather difficult to be mineralized with chloride ion in the fe ii pms system 3 6 kinetic modeling 3 6 1 effect of chloride concentration kintecus 6 51 is a chemical simulation program that can be easily operated within microsoft excel and has a built in function for fitting optimizing rate constants against experimental data in this work kintecus gives an acceptable fit to the experimental data for all the conditions tested a typical kinetic plot is shown in fig 4 to better understand the reaction pathways and the participation of various radicals in chain propagation reactions profiles of main radicals and their contributions during ma degradation were investigated as depicted in fig 5 levels of so4 decreased with chloride concentration varying from 0 to 300 mm consistent with the results by pseudo steady state assumption fang et al 2012 however the yield of oh was enhanced rapidly as the content of cl ranged from 0 to 5 mm while declined obviously with a further increase in chloride dosage in general the content of oh was much lower than so4 because so4 is regarded as the predominant free radical under acidic conditions liang et al 2007 yan et al 2011 the concentrations of cl2 and hocl increased with an increase in cl dosage the amount of cl increased within the range of 0 5 mm chloride whereas decreased when cl 5 mm this is due to the conversion of cl to cl2 or hocl through eqs 4 6 the concentration of hclo was found to decline with increasing cl content however cl2 increased gradually when chloride concentration ranged between 0 and 200 mm a slight decline of cl2 was observed with 300 mm chloride mainly due to the transformation from cl2 to cl2 under acidic conditions ph 3 0 hocl may be transformed to cl easily with a rate constant of 2 1 1010 m 1 s 1 therefore the concentration of hocl was fairly low 10 14 m 1 s 1 and the data are not shown it is worth noting that the concentration of cl2 in a chloride rich solution was higher than other species so4 oh cl hocl hclo and cl2 and became the predominant radical accounting for the oxidation of ma however interestingly the reactivity of cl2 was not sufficient to overwhelm the significance of so4 at initial cl 5 mm in fig 6 in the presence of low cl concentrations 5 mm the rate constant of reaction between so4 and ma was 6 0 109 m 1s 1 which was considerably higher than that between cl2 and ma 3 0 106 m 1s 1 a further addition of cl led to the formation of less reactive chlorine from so4 via eq 4 thus decreased the degradation efficiency of ma it should be emphasized that a direct involvement of cl radical in degrading ma should be minimal because cl radical may readily react with water and cl largely diminishing the steady state concentration of cl and yielding the milder oxidant cl2 radical in addition the various degradation rates of the substrate are not only related to the proportion of each oxidation radical but also to their reaction rate constant with the substrate the different reaction rates between the radicals and the substrate are listed in table s2 varying from 104 to 109 m 1s 1 hence the contributions of the main radicals to ma degradation were significantly different 3 6 2 sensitivity analysis it is assumed that sensitivity analysis could indicate the significance of each reaction in the model fig 7 shows the sensitivity of the each examined reaction no 1 16 subject to independently varied rate constant in the presence of 5 mm and 100 mm of chloride the consumption of so4 and formation of less reactive radicals via reaction 5 in fig 7 was the rate controlling step and had the most significant effect on ma degradation with 5 mm cl involved the significance of so4 for ma oxidation was also crucial at a low chloride dosage reaction 11 in fig 7 the formation of cl2 by the transformation of cl with high rate constant of 6 5 109 m 1s 1 could take place according to reaction 8 however the degradation of ma was obviously influenced by the oxidation of cl2 or cl in the presence of 100 mm cl reaction 12 and 13 in fig 7 the reaction between fe ii and pms with the rate constant of 3 4 104 m 1s 1 played a vital part in ma destruction reaction 1 in fig 7 the quenching reaction of so4 by fe ii or pms were found to be rather important in the process especially when 100 mm chloride was present therefore it is of great significance to select the optimum concentrations of fe ii and pms according to the nature and concentration of the substrate in the presence of 100 mm chloride the degradation of ma was strongly influenced by the reaction between the substrate and cl2 compared to hclo the formation and dissociation of hocl with cl involved the destruction of ma by hocl were also critical in the model according to fig 7 oh could react with cl2 or so4 in the presence of 100 mm cl with high rate constant of 1 0 109 m 1s 1 or 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 respectively the oxidation of ma was significantly impacted by the formation of cl2 and cl2 species reaction 12 and 16 in fig 7 particularly under high salinity conditions this may be attributed to the high reactivity and large amount of the oxidized species in the process consistent with the results in figs 5 and 6 on the contrary the destruction of ma was not sensitive enough by the reactions with cl hocl and hclo in the overall oxidation process reaction 13 15 in fig 7 mainly due to the lower rate constant and smaller proportion of these radicals in the solution the reactions with so4 prevailed under the low salinity conditions owing to the consumption of so4 and formation of less reactive radicals with an increase of cl content reaction 5 in fig 7 in addition the amount of oh in acidic solutions was rather low therefore the effect of oh on ma degradation was low via reaction 10 in fig 7 3 7 mechanism and pathways a reaction mechanism is proposed for the formation of chlorinated intermediates and accumulation of aox in the fe ii pms cl process in the presence of low dosages of cl 5 mm chloride can be oxidized to chlorine radicals by strongly oxidizing radicals via reaction 4 and 5 which could generate from pms catalyzed by fe ii huang et al 2017 fang et al 2012 kinetic rates of ma oxidation may be decelerated in the presence of the less reactive chlorine radicals e0 cl cl 2 41 v vs nhe e0 cl2 2cl 2 0 v vs nhe wang et al 2017a hepel and luo 2001 similar inhibitory effects of low levels of cl were observed during the oxidation of aromatic molecules 4 chloro 2 nitrophenol zhou et al 2015 4 chlorophenol wang et al 2017a and phthalic acid huang et al 2017 in pms based systems under chloride rich conditions the excess addition of cl significantly inhibited the degradation of unsaturated carboxylic acid ma two main mechanisms should be considered firstly pms could oxidize excess chloride ions to form chlorine species hclo cl2 in the presence of high levels of cl via eqs 12 and 13 yuan et al 2011 however hclo has high selectivity to organic compounds and the reactivity is usually apt to oxygenated moieties in particular carboxylic acid moiety is highly stable with chlorine in aqueous solution deborde and von gunten 2008 in our previous studies the carboxyl group of phthalic acid could also decrease the chlorine reactivity for attacking specific sites of the aromatic ring huang et al 2017 on the other hand reactions between hclo and unsaturated bonds in ma are generally slow or negligible deborde and von gunten 2008 a low reactivity of hclo towards sorbic acid with the conjugated double bond in its structure was observed by prütz 1998 whereas no chlorine reactivity with progesterone double bond was found by deborde et al 2004 12 cl hso5 so4 2 hocl 13 2cl hso5 h so4 2 cl2 h2o based on identification of degradation intermediates and formation of aox during fe ii pms cl process a schematic degradation pathway of ma is proposed in fig 8 once oxidation of ma occurs the cis trans isomerization process could lead to formation of fumaric acid prior to the decarboxylation process franch et al 2005 oh et al 2004 nozaki and authoranonymous 1941 maleic acid might be attacked by sulfate radicals to produce compound 4 through a decarboxylation reaction it has been previously proposed that the degradation of ma mainly occurs via pathway route 1 and 2 leading to 2 3 dihydroxysuccinic acid compound 5 and acrylic acid compound 2 respectively franch et al 2002 herrmann et al 1999 the formation of acetic acid compound 1 could take place through route 2 franch et al 2005 on the other hand decarboxylation of 2 3 dihydroxysuccinic acid compound 5 leads to the generation of compound 6 via route 1 notably halogenation can occur through chlorine attack on specific sites of intermediates producing gradually chlorinated species compound 7 8 10 11 12 in the presence of chloride ions obviously compound 9 4 4 dichlorobutane 1 1 2 3 tetraol is from the decarboxylation process of compound 10 finally 2 hydroxypropanoic acid compound 3 is supposed to be formed by the further oxidation of radicals according to the data from aox formation route 1 and 3 instead of the route 2 becomes the main pathway for the oxidation of compound 4 the formation of chlorinated by products inhibits the complete mineralization of organics because most chlorinated compounds are generally refractory keith and telliard 1979 moreover the formation of the non biodegradable chlorinated by products could lead to the increasing of aox levels in the fe ii pms cl system 4 conclusion the degradation kinetics and mechanism of ma a typical short chain carboxylic acid generated from oxidation of aromatic organic compounds were investigated in the fe ii pms cl process the results indicate that chloride ions 0 300 mm had an adverse impact on the degradation rates of ma due to the low chlorine reactivity towards carboxylic acid moieties and unsaturated bonds aox formation increased as chloride concentration increased the chlorinated by products formation and aox accumulation indicate that the oxidation of ma raises a potential environmental risk for saline wastewater treatment according to the kinetic modeling results cl2 was the predominant radicals at cl 5 mm while so4 was mainly responsible for the degradation of ma without the addition of chloride sensitivity analysis reveals the importance of the main reactions for ma oxidation a possible degradation pathway for ma in saline wastewater is proposed the present work suggests that the appreciable levels of chloride in wastewater may reduce the degradation rates of short chain carboxylic acid intermediates of aromatic compounds and even lead to the formation of more toxic chlorinated by products during aops treatment therefore it is urgent to develop an effective technology for the treatment of the secondary degradation by products of organic compounds it is also important to modify processes to minimize formation of toxic transformation products during wastewater treatment acknowledgments this work was
