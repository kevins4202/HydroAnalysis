8895,most studies of open canal automation concentrated on the control of single canal pool or cascaded multiple canal pools neglecting the hydraulic coupling effects between the main canal and lateral canals low transmission efficiency and poor equity of agriculture water delivery may be caused in the practical application of large scale irrigation networks considering the high computation and communication requirements for large scale operating systems a distributed model predictive control dmpc algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers admm is developed for the branching open canal irrigation systems bociss a simplified bocis example originating from test case 2 proposed by the american society of civil engineers is used for control tests moreover for control performance comparisons and evaluations centralized model predictive control cmpc is employed by modifying the state space of the integrator delay id model the results show that the control performance of the proposed dmpc converges to the global optimal solution of the cmpc under the normal scenario and the degradation is less than 0 35 the communication and coordination process of dmpc contributes to more powerful robustness and interference immunity than cmpc furthermore in case of sudden accidents occurring in some subsystems the proposed dmpc is more convenient and timely to execute fault isolation the improvements on water level oscillations and overshoots can reach 20 3 and 52 1 in the other subsystems which need normal water delivery respectively equipped with outstanding control characteristics the proposed admm based dmpc framework enables the water authorities of large scale bociss to promote surface water distribution in a practicable flexible and secure way showing great potential in developing intelligent irrigation districts keywords distributed control centralized control model predictive control irrigation canal network alternating direction method of multipliers data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction compared with backward manual operation methods canal automation technologies represent a more water saving and efficient alternative for the management of open canal systems ocss avargani et al 2022 lozano et al 2010 sadowska et al 2015 schuurmans et al 1995 wahlin and clemmens 2006 therefore the last decades have witnessed a continuous generation of contributions in this field but most concentrated on the control of single canal pool or cascaded multiple canal pools with no branches conde et al 2021 from a practical point of view the ocss are always based on a network of multilevel canals with a tree topology like the main secondary tertiary or even more branching canals in the hierarchy just as individual pools interact with each other in an in line cascaded canal system individual branches can interact with each other wahlin and clemmens 2006 an improper automatic control system may cause severe oscillations of water level or gate movements ultimately the surface water failed to be conveyed with high efficiency and equity from the water sources to the customers or farms along the multilevel canals with the development of canal automation the control of branching open canal networks gets more and more attention in the areas of inland waterways segovia et al 2019 hydro power valleys maestre et al 2015 polder systems aydin et al 2022 natural river network breckpot et al 2013 and others notwithstanding few studies consider the automatic control of branching open canal irrigation systems bociss elfawal mansour et al 2000 used a nonlinear black box model narx for the control of the canal de la bourne a real branching canal system in france that served for irrigation and electricity generation by modifying the integrator delay id model wahlin and clemmens 2006 developed two centralized controllers of the linear quadratic regulator lqr and model predictive control mpc respectively results showed that both were able to bring the water level back to the setpoints in a branching canal network tariq et al 2012 implemented a cyber physical system towards the decentralized control of real irrigation canal networks in pakistan by which a slow response speed and risky water level fluctuation resulted alvarez et al 2013 combined local controllers with distributed generalized predictive controllers for a y shaped irrigate canal but only the head gate of the branch not all check gates along the branch canal is controlled sutrisno et al 2012 and zhang et al 2015 proposed distributed model predictive controllers based on game theory and nash optimality respectively the former neglected the large delay of the flow and only tested a simple water level tracking scenario while the latter restricted the direction of information transferring only from downstream to upstream xu and schwanenberg 2017 applied nonlinear mpc with a diffusive wave model to a virtual drainage canal network and achieved a satisfactory outcome with a reasonable computation time though the global optimum was not guaranteed nowadays with population growth and the modernization of irrigation districts the size and complexity of the bociss have grown enormously for the control of large scale bociss mpc with distributed control architecture is regarded as a promising control scheme kordestani et al 2021 mpc is a control strategy that gets the highest attention for agriculture water management conde et al 2021 it is given the credit to the versatile abilities to consider constraints in optimization and the possibility of taking into account measurable disturbances overloop 2006 the most classical control architecture of mpc is the centralized architecture where systemwide measurements are gathered and a globally optimal solution is calculated however the huge size and wide geographic distribution of the large scale bociss would lead to expensive communication costs and unbearable computing burdens maestre and negenborn 2013 shi et al 2021 tang and daoutidis 2019 simultaneously the communication network induced issues and the potential concerns of privacy and security problems are also unavoidable obstructions to the practical applications of centralized mpc cmpc tang and daoutidis 2019 the decentralized control architecture is a good choice for its low communication and computational requirements but the neglect of the strong hydraulic interactions among individual pools and individual branches would lead to the phenomenon of disturbance amplification and poor control performance alvarez et al 2013 wahlin and clemmens 2006 in this case distributed mpc dmpc works toward combing the advantages of the above two control architectures though compared with the cmpc there is some performance loss due to the partial knowledge of the entire system kordestani et al 2021 tang and daoutidis 2019 tian 2015 specifically in the dmpc the large scale system is decomposed into several interconnected subsystems then a computing agent or local controller is associated with each subsystem and makes control decisions like the decentralized mpc the distinction between decentralized and distributed mpc lies in whether or not the information is exchanged actively between the adjacent agents to coordinate their decisions for a consensus even in the case of conflicting goals the modularization nature of dmpc contributes to its high scalability which is one of the critical characteristics for the flexible control of large scale bociss furthermore different subsystems can consider diverse control objects and constraints which distinguishes the dmpc from cmpc in this way in arid regions or water deficit scenarios the limited water can be delivered with various attitudes to different subsystems according to their water supply objects or crop species so that better social irrigation energy and economic benefits could be achieved more detailed comparisons between different control architectures can be found in the appendix over the last years there has been a growing interest in dmpc for the control of many large scale systems like smart grids shi et al 2021 waterborne vessels zheng et al 2018 water systems maestre et al 2021 traffic control li et al 2020 and others nevertheless no single generally accepted distributed algorithm has been proposed due to the complexities of various control objects maestre and negenborn 2013 it has been argued that the alternating direction method of multipliers admm is a particularly powerful distributed algorithm blending the strong decomposability of the dual ascent method with the excellent convergence property of the augmented lagrange multiplier method ghadimi et al 2015 li et al 2020 teixeira et al 2016 the most attractive feature of admm is that it is surprisingly guaranteed to converge for all positive values of the step size parameter bai et al 2021 this contrasts many popular distributed algorithms such as dual decomposition methods teixeira et al 2016 and gradient methods ghadimi et al 2015 where mistuning of the step size can render the iterations unstable compared with the distributed techniques based on game theory whose results correspond to a nash equilibrium the admm yields tighter approximations to the overall optimization lemos and pinto 2012 moreover it is recently investigated that the powerful admm performs outstandingly in dealing with the issues of reconfiguration control bai et al 2021 whereby the scalability and the plug and play functionality are demonstrated to the best of the authors knowledge the admm algorithm is rarely reported for canal automation studies to date so there are obvious difficulties in coding the complicated communication and coordination process of admm compared with the relatively mature centralized or decentralized control technologies the main contribution of this paper is innovatively providing a reliable and flexible control operating system for the bociss by admm based dmpc scheme this work makes it possible to convey the water automatically from the water source to the users or farms at the last level canal whereby higher efficiency and equity of water delivery can be guaranteed meanwhile the proposed control framework is also vital for the future of intelligent irrigation systems where the stored water in the water source and canal network can be delivered timely to the farmlands according to the real time prediction of irrigation water requirements avargani et al 2022 accordingly the present study is meaningful for precise irrigation and the sustainable development of agricultural water the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the design principles of the admm based dmpc controller the study case and test scenarios are also introduced section 3 analyses the simulation results followed by the discussion in section 4 finally some concluding remarks are drawn in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 model predictive control model predictive control mpc refers to a family of control methods that explicitly use a process model of the real system to obtain the control actions by minimizing an objective function overloop 2006 the process model is used to predict the evolution of the system for which the id model proposed by schuurmans et al 1995 for open canals is one of the most reported the canal is assumed to be divided into two parts i a normal depth section with a uniform flow and ii a backwater section with an inflow delay delay time of inflow τ in min and average storage area a s in m2 are two main model properties as shown in eq 1 1 d d t e t 1 a s q 1 t τ q 2 t d t where e t is the water level deviation at the downstream end of the canal pool m q 1 t τ is the inflow deviation to the backwater with delay time τ m3 s q 2 t is the downstream outflow deviation m3 s d t is the offtake flow deviation according to the irrigation schedule m3 s the deviation means the difference between the instantaneous value and the initial steady state value based on the process model in discrete time a state space is constructed to forecast the system dynamics over the prediction horizon see eq 2 x k 1 a x k b u u k b d d k 2 y k c x k where x k represents the system states at control step k a is the system matrix b u is the control input matrix b d is the known disturbance input matrix c is the output matrix u k is the input vector calculated by the controller i e the control commands for gates flow regulation d k is the disturbance vector i e the schedule of offtake flow changes y k is the output vector i e the water level deviation from setpoint at the downstream end of each canal pool then the objective function j see eq 3 can be minimized to obtain optimal control actions this optimization problem is subject to the constraints of water level limitations and flow capacities once the sequence of future control actions is determined only the first step is implemented then the system is updated and the prediction and optimization processes are repeated at the next control step 3 min u j i 1 p y k i k t qy k i k j 1 m u k j k t ru k j k where p and m represent the prediction horizon and control horizon respectively q and r are the weight matrixes for a trade off between minimizing the water level deviations and minimizing flow changes the bociss are complex systems with large time delays high hydraulic interactions intermittent demands disturbances and multiple inputs and outputs mpc is an outstanding control alternative for its versatility but only under suitable control architecture can achieve high regulation accuracy with implementability kordestani et al 2021 more details are shown in fig 1 and appendix in this paper cmpc and dmpc are compared for the control of the bociss 2 2 alternating direction method of multipliers admm was first proposed by gabay and mercier 1976 for solving elliptic and parabolic partial difference equations but it did not receive much attention until stephen et al 2011 made a review and proved that admm is well suited for solving large scale convex optimization problems in a distributed manner the designed distributed controller in this paper is based on the admm after system decomposition the dynamics of subsystem i are described by x i k 1 a i x i k b u i u i k b d i d i k 4 y i k c i x i k where i is the index of subsystems i υ υ is the set of all subsystems x i y i u i d i are the system state output vector input vector and disturbance vector of the subsystem i a i b u i b d i c i are the system matrix control input matrix known disturbance input matrix and output matrix of subsystem i the subsystem i is coupled to the neighboring subsystem j γ i with the constraint 5 e ij y i k n k e ji y j k n k n 1 p where γ i is the neighbors set connected to subsystem i e ij and e ji are coupled weight matrices indicating that the impacts of subsystem i on subsystem j are supposed to be equal to the impacts of subsystem j on subsystem i each agent only knows its own dynamics and cost function and the local quadratic programming problem is given 6 min u i j u i i 1 p y i k i k t q i y i k i k j 1 m u i k j k t r i u i k j k s t e i y i k n k z i k n k n 1 p where z i k n k e 1 i y 1 k n k e n ij i y n ij k n k consists of all the coupling information passed to subsystem i from all neighboring agents n ij is the number of subsystems coupled to subsystem i e i e i 1 e i n ij then the augmented lagrangian function based on eq 6 is presented 7 l j u i λ i t e i y i z i ρ 2 e i y i z i 2 2 where λ i is the dual variable ρ is the step size of the admm it is convenient to use scaled dual variable μ i λ i ρ which yields the iterations 8 u i k 1 arg min u i j u i ρ 2 e i y i z i k μ i k 2 2 9 z i k 1 arg min z i ρ 2 e i y i k 1 z i μ i k 2 2 10 μ i k 1 μ i k e i y i k 1 z i k 1 each agent is responsible for minimizing eq 7 to obtain its own control signal under current coupled information z i k by solving eq 8 in which k is the index of iteration times then z i k 1 and the scaled dual variable μ i k 1 in the next iteration are updated by eq 9 and eq 10 respectively afterward the updated e i y i k 1 is communicated to its neighbors and new coupled information is received from its neighbors this iterative process repeats until the following stopping criterion is reached 11 e i y i k 1 z i k δ where σ is the tolerance for consensus judgment set as 10 3 for a clearer introduction the decision making process of the distributed control algorithm is generalized as follows step 1 when the distributed controller module is called the measurements in each subsystem are transported to the corresponding computing agent step 2 based on the state space model of subsystem eq 4 the local quadratic programming problem eq 6 is solved with coupling information from neighboring agents step 3 neighboring agents communicate to judge the convergence criterion eq 11 step 4 coupling information is transferred between neighboring agents step 5 return to step 2 until the convergence and consensus above steps are done in parallel by each agent step 2 to step 4 are carried out by the admm see fig 2 one advantage of the basic admm algorithm is that there is only one algorithm parameter ρ and the method can be shown to converge for all positive values of ρ however ρ has a direct impact on the convergence speed of the algorithm the calculation method proposed by ghadimi et al 2015 for the optimal ρ is employed ultimately according to the categorization criteria maestre and negenborn 2013 a non cooperative and iterative distributed model predictive controller is designed with parallel computation and synchronous communication the non cooperative attitude means that each agent only considers its local interests rather than a global performance although some systemwide welfare may be sacrificed in this control attitude less algorithm complexity and better scalability are guaranteed bai et al 2021 2 3 study area in general the gentler the bed slope of the canal the stronger the coupling effects among individual pools and individual branches may be hence controllers are performed on the branched version of test canal 2 a typical test canal with a very gentle bed slope proposed by the american society of civil engineers asce clemmens et al 1998 see fig 3 because there are offtake changes both at the pool 5 and pool 6 in this test case it is assumed that there are two branches that occur at the downstream end of pool 5 and pool 6 respectively each branch contains two canal pools which have the same physical sizes as pool 7 and pool 8 more details about the branching canal network are presented in table 1 in which the properties of the id model for each canal pool are estimated by the parameter identification method zhong 2016 according to the engineering experience the farmers or ditch riders always manipulated the gravity based offtake gate according to the predefined gate opening flow curve and water schedule this operation implies the assumption that the water level at the downstream end of each canal pool is stable and this is why keeping the distant downstream water level at setpoint as much as possible is always the control objective wahlin and clemmens 2006 the availability of a real system for control tests is often unusual in order to perform more rigorous control tests one alternative could be modelling the system with the saint venant equations sves which are widely accepted as a fairly accurate representation of physical reality in the paper the canal control simulation platform sccs wang and guan 2011 installed on a 2 80 ghz intel xeon machine with 16 gb of ram running windows 10 is used on which the sves are resolved with the preissmann four point implicit difference scheme the sccs can simulate the hydraulic behavior of most irrigation canals under steady or unsteady flow conditions and has been applied and verified by previous studies liu et al 2013 zhong et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 including the heading gates of the two lateral canals all check gates are formulated by eq 12 yeh et al 1980 to calculate the flow rate of radial gates meanwhile all gravity offtakes are governed by the sluice free flow formula during the unsteady flow process see eq 13 li 2006 in addition the unsteady flow simulation is carried out with the computation time step d t 1 min 12 q c d eb 2 g h u h d q 2 a u 2 13 q μ eb 2 g h u μ 0 6 0 18 e h u where q is the gate discharge m3 s c d and μ are discharge coefficients g is the acceleration of gravity m s2 e is the gate opening m b is the gate width m h u and h d are the upstream and downstream water depth of the gate m a u is the cross sectional area of water upstream the gate m2 2 4 controllers design on demand operating method is used in this study which provides high flexibility for the irrigation requirements and is suitable for the concept of online canal automation control to design appropriate controllers for the bociss centralized and distributed control architectures are adopted respectively referring to wahlin and clemmens 2006 the cmpc controller is designed by modifying the state space model meaning that the offtake term is added or removed from the id model of individual canal pool according to the network system structure care must be taken to assure that the hydraulics of every subsystem is properly described once the system structure is changed the whole tedious modeling process needs to be redone in contrast the dmpc controller is much more flexible the entire system is decomposed into three subsystems the main canal the first lateral canal and the second lateral canal see fig 3 each subsystem is associated with a computing agent for local optimization agent 1 and agent 2 are coupled by the discharge of the head gate of the first lateral canal while agent 1 and agent 3 are coupled by the discharge of the head gate of the second lateral canal in other words the head gate discharge of the lateral canal is supposed to be the offtake flow of the corresponding main canal pool the basic controller configurations for the cmpc and dmpc controllers are the same the sampling period t s which is also the control time interval is set to 15 min in the objective function eq 3 or eq 6 the engineering tuning method of q and r proposed by zhong et al 2020 is adopted since the objection functions of mpc and lqr are similar moreover p and m are both set as 96 by trial and error meaning that the prediction horizon and control horizon both are 24 h long for removing the complex gate hydraulics for the control system a master slave control scheme is implemented the master control refers to the dmpc or cmpc in which every check gate is commanded to reach a new target flow every 15 min the slave control refers to the local flow controller manipulating the gate per 5 min to deliver the desired flow according to real time hydraulic state 2 5 test scenarios three test scenarios are set to compare the response capacities and control performance of cmpc and dmpc for the comprehensive evaluation of the designed controllers permanent flow exists in the main canal and the two lateral canals except for the accident scenario where the first lateral canal is closed for fault isolation 2 5 1 normal scenario referring to the test 2 1 proposed by asce the offtakes in pool 5 2 and pool 6 2 begin to draw more water from t 5 h to t 6 h linearly while each offtake in the main canal keeps the initial offtake flow i e 1 m3 s and the offtakes in pool 5 1 and pool 6 1 keep close overall process more details are displayed in table 2 this test scenario is used to compare the control effect and computational efficiency of both controllers 2 5 2 water deficient scenario with the same initial states of the normal scenario there is an offtake flow oscillation in pool 5 2 from t 5 h to t 9 h see fig 4 and other offtakes remain unchanged noteworthy is there is a constant limitation on the water source in other words the inflow of the main canal keeps 11 m3 s representing a water shortage scenario facing downstream water demand changes this test scenario is designed to analyze the impacts of the disturbance of one subsystem on the other subsystems the water scarcity may aggravate the water supply contradiction and highlight the superiority of the proposed dmpc controller 2 5 3 accident scenario with the same initial states of the normal scenario there is a sudden accident in the first lateral canal at t 5 h then all gates and offtakes in this branch canal need to be urgently closed for fault isolation including the heading gate i e the offtake gate of pool 5 however the main canal and the second lateral canal need to maintain normal operations and water delivery in this scenario for the dmpc due to its modularity it is quick and convenient to disconnect the communication link between the first lateral canal and the main canal highlighting the response capacities to deal with unconventional conditions but it is much more complicated for the cmpc to handle the accident for simplicity once the sudden accident occurs the fixed constraints are set for all the check gates in the first lateral canal to make them compulsory to close during the optimization rather than redesigning the state space model of the cmpc it is also necessary to revise the offtake schedules of the first lateral canal to consider the offtake closure 2 6 operational performance indicators several control performance indicators are employed in the study firstly a posteriori control cost j cost sadowska et al 2015 is used to generally appraise the off farm management see eq 14 the smaller j cost is the better the comprehensive control performance is 14 j cost k 1 n q e k 2 r u k 2 where n is the number of total simulation steps e k is the downstream water level deviation from setpoint m u k is the upstream flow change representing the gate movement m3 s then pa states the adequacy of water delivery molden and gates 1990 see eq 15 the bigger pa is the more adequately the water is supplied to irrigate crops 15 pa 1 n k 1 n 1 n offtake i 1 n offtake min 1 q d i k q r i k where n offtake is the number of offtakes in the canal pool q d i is the actual discharge delivered to the i th offtake m3 s q r i is water demand by the i th offtake m3 s in the results analysis of the water deficient and accident test scenarios cv t and h overshoot are used to describe the degree of water level oscillations and overshoots during the control simulation process see eqs 16 and 17 cv t is the temporal coefficient of variation of the water level deviation as the value of cv t approaches zero the water level control is becoming more smooth and more stable over time 16 cv t σ e k μ e k 17 h overshoot max e k where σ e k and μ e k are the standard deviation and mean value of the water level deviation e k k 1 n 3 results 3 1 normal scenario the control simulation results with two control architectures are shown in fig 5 comparing the control results of the same main canal by the cmpc with that by mpc b a centralized model predictive controller proposed by horváth et al 2015 it can be seen that the water level fluctuations are similar both controllers began to work before the demand changes and the water was stored in pool 5 and pool 6 in advance for future water demands showing the superiority of the mpc algorithm it is satisfying to see that both controllers can effectively control the branching canal system more specifically it is plotted in fig 5 a that dmpc is superior to cmpc in controlling the main canal except for pool 1 the cmpc shows more aggressive features resulting in greater water level deviation and oscillation in contrast the control results on the two lateral canals are the opposite and cmpc shows better control effects but on the whole the control performances of the entire system are similar see table 3 although the cmpc has better control results than the dmpc on j cost and pa because of the full knowledge of the bocis the degradation is less than 0 35 and can be negligible it means that the designed dmpc controller is comparable to the cmpc controller proposed by wahlin and clemmens 2006 in control performance 3 2 water deficient scenario the global communication and centralized optimization of cmpc contributes to better global control performance than dmpc in this control architecture the system states in all subsystems are closely linked any disturbance at any position is able to immediately affect all control structures to take actions but that is also why the influence of local disturbance or failure is hard to be limited in just one subsystem the control results of the main canal and the second lateral canal are presented in fig 6 it can be seen that the offtake disturbance in the first lateral canal has impacts on the other parts whether the controller is designed with centralized or distributed architecture however cmpc is much more aggressive meaning that the disturbance of one subsystem has greater impacts on the neighboring subsystems under this control scheme obvious water level oscillations occurred in pool 2 pool 6 and bigger water level deviations than the dmpc are observed nonetheless such influence could be weakened by the communication and coordination process of the distributed algorithms in this way the proposed dmpc controller shows powerful robustness interference immunity and fault tolerance the results of fig 7 a display that compared with cmpc the highest improvements on water level oscillations and overshoots by the dmpc can reach 36 4 and 28 1 for the adjacent subsystems respectively 3 3 accident scenario the accident responses of the controllers are provided in fig 8 the cmpc behaved more aggressively than the dmpc again obvious water level oscillations are observed in pool 2 pool 6 and bigger water level deviations resulted in pool 6 pool 8 as well as the second lateral canal fig 7 b displays that the dmpc helps the improvements in water level oscillations and overshoots up to 20 3 and 52 1 respectively it means that the designed dmpc controller is more outstanding in the face of sudden accidents not only being able to deal with the accidents more quickly and easily but also controlling the hydraulic response in adjacent subsystems more smoothly furthermore the computing efficiency of the cmpc may be relatively low though the automatic control under sudden accident scenarios is completed the first lateral canal has not been removed from the state space meaning that some computing resources still have to be allocated for this part during optimization if the scale of the isolated subsystem is large the unnecessary waste of computing resources would be considerable moreover the prediction results of this subsystem also have some impact on the other subsystems that need proper functioning 4 discussion the results of the normal scenario show that the designed admm based dmpc controller is comparable to the centralized controller in control performance nonetheless there is an unexpected result that the computational efficiency of the cmpc is much higher than the dmpc in this test scenario the cmpc solves the optimization problem at an average rate of 1 3 s per control cycle while the dmpc is 4 6 s it is interesting and worth pondering similar results were observed by tian 2015 and burk et al 2019 there are some possible explanations firstly the scale of the current test case and the number of agents are small although a systemwide optimization problem has been divided into three smaller problems which were solved with parallel computing technology the time cost required for the communication and coordination by the dmpc is relatively higher by contrast the global optimization of cmpc is more efficient as the system scale increases and more subsystems or agents are taken into account the computational requirements of the centralized solution would increase heavily but the computing efficiency of the dmpc stays approximately constant burk et al 2019 afterward during the numerical experiments the communication and coordination process is fully demonstrated in the distributed algorithm but the communication network induced issues that prevent the cmpc from functioning properly are hard to be considered such as the communication delay and packet loss in a large scale communication network then the admm algorithm is often slower than other distributed algorithms but an acceptable result can be obtained in fewer iterations 23 26 iterations in this study with medium convergence precision lastly the inconsistency of subsystem scale may lead to a decrease in computation efficiency but it is common in practice in every iteration the small optimization problems associated with the lateral canals have to wait for the results of the big one of the main canal the asynchronous admm algorithm may be a solution dunham et al 2020 fortunately benefiting from the big delay nature of open canals it is acceptable to implement more complex control algorithms even with moderate computing capabilities alvarez et al 2013 conde et al 2021 though dmpc takes 4 6 s to solve the optimization problem each control cycle nearly 3 5 times slower than cmpc it is still much less than the control interval of 15 min in other words the losses of control performance and computational speed caused by the designed dmpc controller could be ignored for bociss and the practical applications are promisingly feasible the dmpc still has greater potential advantages than the cmpc see the introduction and appendix the response ability in a sudden accident is also a compelling factor for the comprehensive controller evaluation and a fundamental guarantee of system security in this paper a simplified method is adopted for the cmpc to implement fault isolation a more common way is redesigning the controller for better control results the centralized state space and the id model structure of pool 5 are modified to remove the first lateral canal however this method is cumbersome requiring the presence of professional operators the fault isolation may not be completed timely so that the accident risk of the first lateral canal is further increased moreover the state space model needs to be modified again when the accident subsystem is put back into service in contrast it is quick and convenient for the dmpc to disconnect or reconnect the subsystem highlighting the motivation for distributed control study the inherent modularity nature of the distributed control architecture determines the scalability of the proposed dmpc framework if the system construction and scale need to be changed it is flexible to add or delete subsystems and communication connections therefore it is easily scalable to a large scale irrigation canal network with a complex tree topology though the proposed distributed controller is examined on a simplified example with only two lateral canals on the other hand the operation type of the canal network determines the required automation level that means the number of branches irrigated simultaneously the permanent flow in the main canal and the circulation of irrigation in some canals affect the controller design in fact the operation type changes over the lifecycle of the canal operation system as the actual condition changes it is a big challenge for canal automation design decentralized control e g the pi control is feasible for its high flexibility but may result in poor performance especially for large scale systems centralized control e g the cmpc gets the global optimal control performance whereas once the operation type changes the whole controller needs to be redesigned for these reasons the distributed control of the canal network has a strong practical significance and research value in this way the level of automation technology required for the canal network could be minimized and good control performance is guaranteed meaning that control costs may be significantly reduced in the future 5 conclusions the automatic control of branching open canal irrigation systems bociss is of great significance for precision irrigation and sustainable development of agricultural water for the first time in the study a distributed model predictive control dmpc algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers admm is innovatively proposed for the bociss it is compared with the centralized model predictive control cmpc developed by wahlin and clemmens 2006 on a simplified example both the cmpc and proposed dmpc were able to take actions before offtake changes and successfully bring the water level back on the one hand due to the full knowledge of the system the cmpc performs better than the dmpc but the degradation of the latter is less than 0 35 under the normal scenario showing that the proposed dmpc is comparable to the cmpc on the other hand the influence of the violent disturbance in one subsystem on the neighboring subsystem by cmpc is more aggressive than that by the proposed dmpc with the help of the communication and coordination process of dmpc the improvements in water level oscillations and overshoots in the adjacent system pools can reach 36 4 and 28 1 under the water deficient scenario respectively in the face of a sudden accident the proposed dmpc shows promising superiority in executing fault isolation over the cmpc benefiting from the outstanding modularization nature of distributed control architecture and the powerful scalability of the admm it is more convenient and timely for the dmpc to disconnect the accident subsystem the improvements on water level oscillations and overshoots can reach 20 3 and 52 1 in the other subsystems which need normal water delivery for mitigating crop yield reduction and increasing the irrigation benefits during times of water scarcity future research is required to consider the diversity of water supply objects and control objectives among different canal subsystems by the proposed distributed control framework acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china nos

personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix control architectures automatic controls can be organized in a variety of ways centralized control decentralized control and distributed control are common control architectures and the former two are applied more in the literatures centralized control architecture in theory cmpc can reach the globally optimal solution better than the other control architectures however mpc is a technique with strong computational and communication requirements that hinder its successful application to large scale ocis in a centralized way as the size and complexity of the system grow more system states are taken into account inevitably accordingly the size of the state space grows exponentially even though computational power has increased dramatically with the development of computer technologies the optimization problem may still not be solved fast enough for online control considering systems that spread over large geographical areas the communication network induced issues are also points of attention like time delay or packet loss of transmitted information competition of multiple communication nodes errors resulting from signal quantization available bandwidth and information security moreover sometimes different sections of the canal network are managed by different control entities who may not be timely to or willing to share information the above issues lead to expensive communication costs and maintenance difficulties decentralized control architecture in a decentralized control architecture only local information of the subsystem is used with no required communication among each local controller compared with cmpc the decentralized mpc has the lowest computational and communication requirements with strong interference immunity and scalability however there is always a significant loss in control performance for the ignorance of coupling effects among interconnected subsystems every local controller takes into account the influence of neighboring subsystems only by responding to the dynamic changes of the local subsystem with a time delay in fact the individual local controllers are always fighting each other even though they have no intention to do so as a consequence more hydraulic oscillations are generated and more energy than necessary is expended distributed control architecture the distributed control architecture is a combination of the above two control architecture compared with the cmpc dmpc has important advantages that justify its application firstly the computational requirements are much lower than cmpc because a complex problem is substituted by several smaller problems the need for communication shifts from global communication to information exchange between locally adjacent controllers in this way the communication network induced issues are much easier to solve and the coupling effects among different subsystems can also be given consideration benefiting from the inherent modularity of the dmpc the system maintenance and the possible expansions of the control system are simplified moreover the effect of a possible disturbance or failure on the overall system is weakened because of the coordination or negotiation process nevertheless because each agent does not have a global vision of the entire system the loss of control performance in comparison with the cmpc becomes the main drawback of the dmpc this loss depends on the degree of interaction between the neighboring subsystems and the coordination mechanisms between the agents consequently a reasonable trade off between control performance and the cost of communication and coordination is pursued to reach a cooperative solution 
8895,most studies of open canal automation concentrated on the control of single canal pool or cascaded multiple canal pools neglecting the hydraulic coupling effects between the main canal and lateral canals low transmission efficiency and poor equity of agriculture water delivery may be caused in the practical application of large scale irrigation networks considering the high computation and communication requirements for large scale operating systems a distributed model predictive control dmpc algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers admm is developed for the branching open canal irrigation systems bociss a simplified bocis example originating from test case 2 proposed by the american society of civil engineers is used for control tests moreover for control performance comparisons and evaluations centralized model predictive control cmpc is employed by modifying the state space of the integrator delay id model the results show that the control performance of the proposed dmpc converges to the global optimal solution of the cmpc under the normal scenario and the degradation is less than 0 35 the communication and coordination process of dmpc contributes to more powerful robustness and interference immunity than cmpc furthermore in case of sudden accidents occurring in some subsystems the proposed dmpc is more convenient and timely to execute fault isolation the improvements on water level oscillations and overshoots can reach 20 3 and 52 1 in the other subsystems which need normal water delivery respectively equipped with outstanding control characteristics the proposed admm based dmpc framework enables the water authorities of large scale bociss to promote surface water distribution in a practicable flexible and secure way showing great potential in developing intelligent irrigation districts keywords distributed control centralized control model predictive control irrigation canal network alternating direction method of multipliers data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction compared with backward manual operation methods canal automation technologies represent a more water saving and efficient alternative for the management of open canal systems ocss avargani et al 2022 lozano et al 2010 sadowska et al 2015 schuurmans et al 1995 wahlin and clemmens 2006 therefore the last decades have witnessed a continuous generation of contributions in this field but most concentrated on the control of single canal pool or cascaded multiple canal pools with no branches conde et al 2021 from a practical point of view the ocss are always based on a network of multilevel canals with a tree topology like the main secondary tertiary or even more branching canals in the hierarchy just as individual pools interact with each other in an in line cascaded canal system individual branches can interact with each other wahlin and clemmens 2006 an improper automatic control system may cause severe oscillations of water level or gate movements ultimately the surface water failed to be conveyed with high efficiency and equity from the water sources to the customers or farms along the multilevel canals with the development of canal automation the control of branching open canal networks gets more and more attention in the areas of inland waterways segovia et al 2019 hydro power valleys maestre et al 2015 polder systems aydin et al 2022 natural river network breckpot et al 2013 and others notwithstanding few studies consider the automatic control of branching open canal irrigation systems bociss elfawal mansour et al 2000 used a nonlinear black box model narx for the control of the canal de la bourne a real branching canal system in france that served for irrigation and electricity generation by modifying the integrator delay id model wahlin and clemmens 2006 developed two centralized controllers of the linear quadratic regulator lqr and model predictive control mpc respectively results showed that both were able to bring the water level back to the setpoints in a branching canal network tariq et al 2012 implemented a cyber physical system towards the decentralized control of real irrigation canal networks in pakistan by which a slow response speed and risky water level fluctuation resulted alvarez et al 2013 combined local controllers with distributed generalized predictive controllers for a y shaped irrigate canal but only the head gate of the branch not all check gates along the branch canal is controlled sutrisno et al 2012 and zhang et al 2015 proposed distributed model predictive controllers based on game theory and nash optimality respectively the former neglected the large delay of the flow and only tested a simple water level tracking scenario while the latter restricted the direction of information transferring only from downstream to upstream xu and schwanenberg 2017 applied nonlinear mpc with a diffusive wave model to a virtual drainage canal network and achieved a satisfactory outcome with a reasonable computation time though the global optimum was not guaranteed nowadays with population growth and the modernization of irrigation districts the size and complexity of the bociss have grown enormously for the control of large scale bociss mpc with distributed control architecture is regarded as a promising control scheme kordestani et al 2021 mpc is a control strategy that gets the highest attention for agriculture water management conde et al 2021 it is given the credit to the versatile abilities to consider constraints in optimization and the possibility of taking into account measurable disturbances overloop 2006 the most classical control architecture of mpc is the centralized architecture where systemwide measurements are gathered and a globally optimal solution is calculated however the huge size and wide geographic distribution of the large scale bociss would lead to expensive communication costs and unbearable computing burdens maestre and negenborn 2013 shi et al 2021 tang and daoutidis 2019 simultaneously the communication network induced issues and the potential concerns of privacy and security problems are also unavoidable obstructions to the practical applications of centralized mpc cmpc tang and daoutidis 2019 the decentralized control architecture is a good choice for its low communication and computational requirements but the neglect of the strong hydraulic interactions among individual pools and individual branches would lead to the phenomenon of disturbance amplification and poor control performance alvarez et al 2013 wahlin and clemmens 2006 in this case distributed mpc dmpc works toward combing the advantages of the above two control architectures though compared with the cmpc there is some performance loss due to the partial knowledge of the entire system kordestani et al 2021 tang and daoutidis 2019 tian 2015 specifically in the dmpc the large scale system is decomposed into several interconnected subsystems then a computing agent or local controller is associated with each subsystem and makes control decisions like the decentralized mpc the distinction between decentralized and distributed mpc lies in whether or not the information is exchanged actively between the adjacent agents to coordinate their decisions for a consensus even in the case of conflicting goals the modularization nature of dmpc contributes to its high scalability which is one of the critical characteristics for the flexible control of large scale bociss furthermore different subsystems can consider diverse control objects and constraints which distinguishes the dmpc from cmpc in this way in arid regions or water deficit scenarios the limited water can be delivered with various attitudes to different subsystems according to their water supply objects or crop species so that better social irrigation energy and economic benefits could be achieved more detailed comparisons between different control architectures can be found in the appendix over the last years there has been a growing interest in dmpc for the control of many large scale systems like smart grids shi et al 2021 waterborne vessels zheng et al 2018 water systems maestre et al 2021 traffic control li et al 2020 and others nevertheless no single generally accepted distributed algorithm has been proposed due to the complexities of various control objects maestre and negenborn 2013 it has been argued that the alternating direction method of multipliers admm is a particularly powerful distributed algorithm blending the strong decomposability of the dual ascent method with the excellent convergence property of the augmented lagrange multiplier method ghadimi et al 2015 li et al 2020 teixeira et al 2016 the most attractive feature of admm is that it is surprisingly guaranteed to converge for all positive values of the step size parameter bai et al 2021 this contrasts many popular distributed algorithms such as dual decomposition methods teixeira et al 2016 and gradient methods ghadimi et al 2015 where mistuning of the step size can render the iterations unstable compared with the distributed techniques based on game theory whose results correspond to a nash equilibrium the admm yields tighter approximations to the overall optimization lemos and pinto 2012 moreover it is recently investigated that the powerful admm performs outstandingly in dealing with the issues of reconfiguration control bai et al 2021 whereby the scalability and the plug and play functionality are demonstrated to the best of the authors knowledge the admm algorithm is rarely reported for canal automation studies to date so there are obvious difficulties in coding the complicated communication and coordination process of admm compared with the relatively mature centralized or decentralized control technologies the main contribution of this paper is innovatively providing a reliable and flexible control operating system for the bociss by admm based dmpc scheme this work makes it possible to convey the water automatically from the water source to the users or farms at the last level canal whereby higher efficiency and equity of water delivery can be guaranteed meanwhile the proposed control framework is also vital for the future of intelligent irrigation systems where the stored water in the water source and canal network can be delivered timely to the farmlands according to the real time prediction of irrigation water requirements avargani et al 2022 accordingly the present study is meaningful for precise irrigation and the sustainable development of agricultural water the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the design principles of the admm based dmpc controller the study case and test scenarios are also introduced section 3 analyses the simulation results followed by the discussion in section 4 finally some concluding remarks are drawn in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 model predictive control model predictive control mpc refers to a family of control methods that explicitly use a process model of the real system to obtain the control actions by minimizing an objective function overloop 2006 the process model is used to predict the evolution of the system for which the id model proposed by schuurmans et al 1995 for open canals is one of the most reported the canal is assumed to be divided into two parts i a normal depth section with a uniform flow and ii a backwater section with an inflow delay delay time of inflow τ in min and average storage area a s in m2 are two main model properties as shown in eq 1 1 d d t e t 1 a s q 1 t τ q 2 t d t where e t is the water level deviation at the downstream end of the canal pool m q 1 t τ is the inflow deviation to the backwater with delay time τ m3 s q 2 t is the downstream outflow deviation m3 s d t is the offtake flow deviation according to the irrigation schedule m3 s the deviation means the difference between the instantaneous value and the initial steady state value based on the process model in discrete time a state space is constructed to forecast the system dynamics over the prediction horizon see eq 2 x k 1 a x k b u u k b d d k 2 y k c x k where x k represents the system states at control step k a is the system matrix b u is the control input matrix b d is the known disturbance input matrix c is the output matrix u k is the input vector calculated by the controller i e the control commands for gates flow regulation d k is the disturbance vector i e the schedule of offtake flow changes y k is the output vector i e the water level deviation from setpoint at the downstream end of each canal pool then the objective function j see eq 3 can be minimized to obtain optimal control actions this optimization problem is subject to the constraints of water level limitations and flow capacities once the sequence of future control actions is determined only the first step is implemented then the system is updated and the prediction and optimization processes are repeated at the next control step 3 min u j i 1 p y k i k t qy k i k j 1 m u k j k t ru k j k where p and m represent the prediction horizon and control horizon respectively q and r are the weight matrixes for a trade off between minimizing the water level deviations and minimizing flow changes the bociss are complex systems with large time delays high hydraulic interactions intermittent demands disturbances and multiple inputs and outputs mpc is an outstanding control alternative for its versatility but only under suitable control architecture can achieve high regulation accuracy with implementability kordestani et al 2021 more details are shown in fig 1 and appendix in this paper cmpc and dmpc are compared for the control of the bociss 2 2 alternating direction method of multipliers admm was first proposed by gabay and mercier 1976 for solving elliptic and parabolic partial difference equations but it did not receive much attention until stephen et al 2011 made a review and proved that admm is well suited for solving large scale convex optimization problems in a distributed manner the designed distributed controller in this paper is based on the admm after system decomposition the dynamics of subsystem i are described by x i k 1 a i x i k b u i u i k b d i d i k 4 y i k c i x i k where i is the index of subsystems i υ υ is the set of all subsystems x i y i u i d i are the system state output vector input vector and disturbance vector of the subsystem i a i b u i b d i c i are the system matrix control input matrix known disturbance input matrix and output matrix of subsystem i the subsystem i is coupled to the neighboring subsystem j γ i with the constraint 5 e ij y i k n k e ji y j k n k n 1 p where γ i is the neighbors set connected to subsystem i e ij and e ji are coupled weight matrices indicating that the impacts of subsystem i on subsystem j are supposed to be equal to the impacts of subsystem j on subsystem i each agent only knows its own dynamics and cost function and the local quadratic programming problem is given 6 min u i j u i i 1 p y i k i k t q i y i k i k j 1 m u i k j k t r i u i k j k s t e i y i k n k z i k n k n 1 p where z i k n k e 1 i y 1 k n k e n ij i y n ij k n k consists of all the coupling information passed to subsystem i from all neighboring agents n ij is the number of subsystems coupled to subsystem i e i e i 1 e i n ij then the augmented lagrangian function based on eq 6 is presented 7 l j u i λ i t e i y i z i ρ 2 e i y i z i 2 2 where λ i is the dual variable ρ is the step size of the admm it is convenient to use scaled dual variable μ i λ i ρ which yields the iterations 8 u i k 1 arg min u i j u i ρ 2 e i y i z i k μ i k 2 2 9 z i k 1 arg min z i ρ 2 e i y i k 1 z i μ i k 2 2 10 μ i k 1 μ i k e i y i k 1 z i k 1 each agent is responsible for minimizing eq 7 to obtain its own control signal under current coupled information z i k by solving eq 8 in which k is the index of iteration times then z i k 1 and the scaled dual variable μ i k 1 in the next iteration are updated by eq 9 and eq 10 respectively afterward the updated e i y i k 1 is communicated to its neighbors and new coupled information is received from its neighbors this iterative process repeats until the following stopping criterion is reached 11 e i y i k 1 z i k δ where σ is the tolerance for consensus judgment set as 10 3 for a clearer introduction the decision making process of the distributed control algorithm is generalized as follows step 1 when the distributed controller module is called the measurements in each subsystem are transported to the corresponding computing agent step 2 based on the state space model of subsystem eq 4 the local quadratic programming problem eq 6 is solved with coupling information from neighboring agents step 3 neighboring agents communicate to judge the convergence criterion eq 11 step 4 coupling information is transferred between neighboring agents step 5 return to step 2 until the convergence and consensus above steps are done in parallel by each agent step 2 to step 4 are carried out by the admm see fig 2 one advantage of the basic admm algorithm is that there is only one algorithm parameter ρ and the method can be shown to converge for all positive values of ρ however ρ has a direct impact on the convergence speed of the algorithm the calculation method proposed by ghadimi et al 2015 for the optimal ρ is employed ultimately according to the categorization criteria maestre and negenborn 2013 a non cooperative and iterative distributed model predictive controller is designed with parallel computation and synchronous communication the non cooperative attitude means that each agent only considers its local interests rather than a global performance although some systemwide welfare may be sacrificed in this control attitude less algorithm complexity and better scalability are guaranteed bai et al 2021 2 3 study area in general the gentler the bed slope of the canal the stronger the coupling effects among individual pools and individual branches may be hence controllers are performed on the branched version of test canal 2 a typical test canal with a very gentle bed slope proposed by the american society of civil engineers asce clemmens et al 1998 see fig 3 because there are offtake changes both at the pool 5 and pool 6 in this test case it is assumed that there are two branches that occur at the downstream end of pool 5 and pool 6 respectively each branch contains two canal pools which have the same physical sizes as pool 7 and pool 8 more details about the branching canal network are presented in table 1 in which the properties of the id model for each canal pool are estimated by the parameter identification method zhong 2016 according to the engineering experience the farmers or ditch riders always manipulated the gravity based offtake gate according to the predefined gate opening flow curve and water schedule this operation implies the assumption that the water level at the downstream end of each canal pool is stable and this is why keeping the distant downstream water level at setpoint as much as possible is always the control objective wahlin and clemmens 2006 the availability of a real system for control tests is often unusual in order to perform more rigorous control tests one alternative could be modelling the system with the saint venant equations sves which are widely accepted as a fairly accurate representation of physical reality in the paper the canal control simulation platform sccs wang and guan 2011 installed on a 2 80 ghz intel xeon machine with 16 gb of ram running windows 10 is used on which the sves are resolved with the preissmann four point implicit difference scheme the sccs can simulate the hydraulic behavior of most irrigation canals under steady or unsteady flow conditions and has been applied and verified by previous studies liu et al 2013 zhong et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 including the heading gates of the two lateral canals all check gates are formulated by eq 12 yeh et al 1980 to calculate the flow rate of radial gates meanwhile all gravity offtakes are governed by the sluice free flow formula during the unsteady flow process see eq 13 li 2006 in addition the unsteady flow simulation is carried out with the computation time step d t 1 min 12 q c d eb 2 g h u h d q 2 a u 2 13 q μ eb 2 g h u μ 0 6 0 18 e h u where q is the gate discharge m3 s c d and μ are discharge coefficients g is the acceleration of gravity m s2 e is the gate opening m b is the gate width m h u and h d are the upstream and downstream water depth of the gate m a u is the cross sectional area of water upstream the gate m2 2 4 controllers design on demand operating method is used in this study which provides high flexibility for the irrigation requirements and is suitable for the concept of online canal automation control to design appropriate controllers for the bociss centralized and distributed control architectures are adopted respectively referring to wahlin and clemmens 2006 the cmpc controller is designed by modifying the state space model meaning that the offtake term is added or removed from the id model of individual canal pool according to the network system structure care must be taken to assure that the hydraulics of every subsystem is properly described once the system structure is changed the whole tedious modeling process needs to be redone in contrast the dmpc controller is much more flexible the entire system is decomposed into three subsystems the main canal the first lateral canal and the second lateral canal see fig 3 each subsystem is associated with a computing agent for local optimization agent 1 and agent 2 are coupled by the discharge of the head gate of the first lateral canal while agent 1 and agent 3 are coupled by the discharge of the head gate of the second lateral canal in other words the head gate discharge of the lateral canal is supposed to be the offtake flow of the corresponding main canal pool the basic controller configurations for the cmpc and dmpc controllers are the same the sampling period t s which is also the control time interval is set to 15 min in the objective function eq 3 or eq 6 the engineering tuning method of q and r proposed by zhong et al 2020 is adopted since the objection functions of mpc and lqr are similar moreover p and m are both set as 96 by trial and error meaning that the prediction horizon and control horizon both are 24 h long for removing the complex gate hydraulics for the control system a master slave control scheme is implemented the master control refers to the dmpc or cmpc in which every check gate is commanded to reach a new target flow every 15 min the slave control refers to the local flow controller manipulating the gate per 5 min to deliver the desired flow according to real time hydraulic state 2 5 test scenarios three test scenarios are set to compare the response capacities and control performance of cmpc and dmpc for the comprehensive evaluation of the designed controllers permanent flow exists in the main canal and the two lateral canals except for the accident scenario where the first lateral canal is closed for fault isolation 2 5 1 normal scenario referring to the test 2 1 proposed by asce the offtakes in pool 5 2 and pool 6 2 begin to draw more water from t 5 h to t 6 h linearly while each offtake in the main canal keeps the initial offtake flow i e 1 m3 s and the offtakes in pool 5 1 and pool 6 1 keep close overall process more details are displayed in table 2 this test scenario is used to compare the control effect and computational efficiency of both controllers 2 5 2 water deficient scenario with the same initial states of the normal scenario there is an offtake flow oscillation in pool 5 2 from t 5 h to t 9 h see fig 4 and other offtakes remain unchanged noteworthy is there is a constant limitation on the water source in other words the inflow of the main canal keeps 11 m3 s representing a water shortage scenario facing downstream water demand changes this test scenario is designed to analyze the impacts of the disturbance of one subsystem on the other subsystems the water scarcity may aggravate the water supply contradiction and highlight the superiority of the proposed dmpc controller 2 5 3 accident scenario with the same initial states of the normal scenario there is a sudden accident in the first lateral canal at t 5 h then all gates and offtakes in this branch canal need to be urgently closed for fault isolation including the heading gate i e the offtake gate of pool 5 however the main canal and the second lateral canal need to maintain normal operations and water delivery in this scenario for the dmpc due to its modularity it is quick and convenient to disconnect the communication link between the first lateral canal and the main canal highlighting the response capacities to deal with unconventional conditions but it is much more complicated for the cmpc to handle the accident for simplicity once the sudden accident occurs the fixed constraints are set for all the check gates in the first lateral canal to make them compulsory to close during the optimization rather than redesigning the state space model of the cmpc it is also necessary to revise the offtake schedules of the first lateral canal to consider the offtake closure 2 6 operational performance indicators several control performance indicators are employed in the study firstly a posteriori control cost j cost sadowska et al 2015 is used to generally appraise the off farm management see eq 14 the smaller j cost is the better the comprehensive control performance is 14 j cost k 1 n q e k 2 r u k 2 where n is the number of total simulation steps e k is the downstream water level deviation from setpoint m u k is the upstream flow change representing the gate movement m3 s then pa states the adequacy of water delivery molden and gates 1990 see eq 15 the bigger pa is the more adequately the water is supplied to irrigate crops 15 pa 1 n k 1 n 1 n offtake i 1 n offtake min 1 q d i k q r i k where n offtake is the number of offtakes in the canal pool q d i is the actual discharge delivered to the i th offtake m3 s q r i is water demand by the i th offtake m3 s in the results analysis of the water deficient and accident test scenarios cv t and h overshoot are used to describe the degree of water level oscillations and overshoots during the control simulation process see eqs 16 and 17 cv t is the temporal coefficient of variation of the water level deviation as the value of cv t approaches zero the water level control is becoming more smooth and more stable over time 16 cv t σ e k μ e k 17 h overshoot max e k where σ e k and μ e k are the standard deviation and mean value of the water level deviation e k k 1 n 3 results 3 1 normal scenario the control simulation results with two control architectures are shown in fig 5 comparing the control results of the same main canal by the cmpc with that by mpc b a centralized model predictive controller proposed by horváth et al 2015 it can be seen that the water level fluctuations are similar both controllers began to work before the demand changes and the water was stored in pool 5 and pool 6 in advance for future water demands showing the superiority of the mpc algorithm it is satisfying to see that both controllers can effectively control the branching canal system more specifically it is plotted in fig 5 a that dmpc is superior to cmpc in controlling the main canal except for pool 1 the cmpc shows more aggressive features resulting in greater water level deviation and oscillation in contrast the control results on the two lateral canals are the opposite and cmpc shows better control effects but on the whole the control performances of the entire system are similar see table 3 although the cmpc has better control results than the dmpc on j cost and pa because of the full knowledge of the bocis the degradation is less than 0 35 and can be negligible it means that the designed dmpc controller is comparable to the cmpc controller proposed by wahlin and clemmens 2006 in control performance 3 2 water deficient scenario the global communication and centralized optimization of cmpc contributes to better global control performance than dmpc in this control architecture the system states in all subsystems are closely linked any disturbance at any position is able to immediately affect all control structures to take actions but that is also why the influence of local disturbance or failure is hard to be limited in just one subsystem the control results of the main canal and the second lateral canal are presented in fig 6 it can be seen that the offtake disturbance in the first lateral canal has impacts on the other parts whether the controller is designed with centralized or distributed architecture however cmpc is much more aggressive meaning that the disturbance of one subsystem has greater impacts on the neighboring subsystems under this control scheme obvious water level oscillations occurred in pool 2 pool 6 and bigger water level deviations than the dmpc are observed nonetheless such influence could be weakened by the communication and coordination process of the distributed algorithms in this way the proposed dmpc controller shows powerful robustness interference immunity and fault tolerance the results of fig 7 a display that compared with cmpc the highest improvements on water level oscillations and overshoots by the dmpc can reach 36 4 and 28 1 for the adjacent subsystems respectively 3 3 accident scenario the accident responses of the controllers are provided in fig 8 the cmpc behaved more aggressively than the dmpc again obvious water level oscillations are observed in pool 2 pool 6 and bigger water level deviations resulted in pool 6 pool 8 as well as the second lateral canal fig 7 b displays that the dmpc helps the improvements in water level oscillations and overshoots up to 20 3 and 52 1 respectively it means that the designed dmpc controller is more outstanding in the face of sudden accidents not only being able to deal with the accidents more quickly and easily but also controlling the hydraulic response in adjacent subsystems more smoothly furthermore the computing efficiency of the cmpc may be relatively low though the automatic control under sudden accident scenarios is completed the first lateral canal has not been removed from the state space meaning that some computing resources still have to be allocated for this part during optimization if the scale of the isolated subsystem is large the unnecessary waste of computing resources would be considerable moreover the prediction results of this subsystem also have some impact on the other subsystems that need proper functioning 4 discussion the results of the normal scenario show that the designed admm based dmpc controller is comparable to the centralized controller in control performance nonetheless there is an unexpected result that the computational efficiency of the cmpc is much higher than the dmpc in this test scenario the cmpc solves the optimization problem at an average rate of 1 3 s per control cycle while the dmpc is 4 6 s it is interesting and worth pondering similar results were observed by tian 2015 and burk et al 2019 there are some possible explanations firstly the scale of the current test case and the number of agents are small although a systemwide optimization problem has been divided into three smaller problems which were solved with parallel computing technology the time cost required for the communication and coordination by the dmpc is relatively higher by contrast the global optimization of cmpc is more efficient as the system scale increases and more subsystems or agents are taken into account the computational requirements of the centralized solution would increase heavily but the computing efficiency of the dmpc stays approximately constant burk et al 2019 afterward during the numerical experiments the communication and coordination process is fully demonstrated in the distributed algorithm but the communication network induced issues that prevent the cmpc from functioning properly are hard to be considered such as the communication delay and packet loss in a large scale communication network then the admm algorithm is often slower than other distributed algorithms but an acceptable result can be obtained in fewer iterations 23 26 iterations in this study with medium convergence precision lastly the inconsistency of subsystem scale may lead to a decrease in computation efficiency but it is common in practice in every iteration the small optimization problems associated with the lateral canals have to wait for the results of the big one of the main canal the asynchronous admm algorithm may be a solution dunham et al 2020 fortunately benefiting from the big delay nature of open canals it is acceptable to implement more complex control algorithms even with moderate computing capabilities alvarez et al 2013 conde et al 2021 though dmpc takes 4 6 s to solve the optimization problem each control cycle nearly 3 5 times slower than cmpc it is still much less than the control interval of 15 min in other words the losses of control performance and computational speed caused by the designed dmpc controller could be ignored for bociss and the practical applications are promisingly feasible the dmpc still has greater potential advantages than the cmpc see the introduction and appendix the response ability in a sudden accident is also a compelling factor for the comprehensive controller evaluation and a fundamental guarantee of system security in this paper a simplified method is adopted for the cmpc to implement fault isolation a more common way is redesigning the controller for better control results the centralized state space and the id model structure of pool 5 are modified to remove the first lateral canal however this method is cumbersome requiring the presence of professional operators the fault isolation may not be completed timely so that the accident risk of the first lateral canal is further increased moreover the state space model needs to be modified again when the accident subsystem is put back into service in contrast it is quick and convenient for the dmpc to disconnect or reconnect the subsystem highlighting the motivation for distributed control study the inherent modularity nature of the distributed control architecture determines the scalability of the proposed dmpc framework if the system construction and scale need to be changed it is flexible to add or delete subsystems and communication connections therefore it is easily scalable to a large scale irrigation canal network with a complex tree topology though the proposed distributed controller is examined on a simplified example with only two lateral canals on the other hand the operation type of the canal network determines the required automation level that means the number of branches irrigated simultaneously the permanent flow in the main canal and the circulation of irrigation in some canals affect the controller design in fact the operation type changes over the lifecycle of the canal operation system as the actual condition changes it is a big challenge for canal automation design decentralized control e g the pi control is feasible for its high flexibility but may result in poor performance especially for large scale systems centralized control e g the cmpc gets the global optimal control performance whereas once the operation type changes the whole controller needs to be redesigned for these reasons the distributed control of the canal network has a strong practical significance and research value in this way the level of automation technology required for the canal network could be minimized and good control performance is guaranteed meaning that control costs may be significantly reduced in the future 5 conclusions the automatic control of branching open canal irrigation systems bociss is of great significance for precision irrigation and sustainable development of agricultural water for the first time in the study a distributed model predictive control dmpc algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers admm is innovatively proposed for the bociss it is compared with the centralized model predictive control cmpc developed by wahlin and clemmens 2006 on a simplified example both the cmpc and proposed dmpc were able to take actions before offtake changes and successfully bring the water level back on the one hand due to the full knowledge of the system the cmpc performs better than the dmpc but the degradation of the latter is less than 0 35 under the normal scenario showing that the proposed dmpc is comparable to the cmpc on the other hand the influence of the violent disturbance in one subsystem on the neighboring subsystem by cmpc is more aggressive than that by the proposed dmpc with the help of the communication and coordination process of dmpc the improvements in water level oscillations and overshoots in the adjacent system pools can reach 36 4 and 28 1 under the water deficient scenario respectively in the face of a sudden accident the proposed dmpc shows promising superiority in executing fault isolation over the cmpc benefiting from the outstanding modularization nature of distributed control architecture and the powerful scalability of the admm it is more convenient and timely for the dmpc to disconnect the accident subsystem the improvements on water level oscillations and overshoots can reach 20 3 and 52 1 in the other subsystems which need normal water delivery for mitigating crop yield reduction and increasing the irrigation benefits during times of water scarcity future research is required to consider the diversity of water supply objects and control

personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix control architectures automatic controls can be organized in a variety of ways centralized control decentralized control and distributed control are common control architectures and the former two are applied more in the literatures centralized control architecture in theory cmpc can reach the globally optimal solution better than the other control architectures however mpc is a technique with strong computational and communication requirements that hinder its successful application to large scale ocis in a centralized way as the size and complexity of the system grow more system states are taken into account inevitably accordingly the size of the state space grows exponentially even though computational power has increased dramatically with the development of computer technologies the optimization problem may still not be solved fast enough for online control considering systems that spread over large geographical areas the communication network induced issues are also points of attention like time delay or packet loss of transmitted information competition of multiple communication nodes errors resulting from signal quantization available bandwidth and information security moreover sometimes different sections of the canal network are managed by different control entities who may not be timely to or willing to share information the above issues lead to expensive communication costs and maintenance difficulties decentralized control architecture in a decentralized control architecture only local information of the subsystem is used with no required communication among each local controller compared with cmpc the decentralized mpc has the lowest computational and communication requirements with strong interference immunity and scalability however there is always a significant loss in control performance for the ignorance of coupling effects among interconnected subsystems every local controller takes into account the influence of neighboring subsystems only by responding to the dynamic changes of the local subsystem with a time delay in fact the individual local controllers are always fighting each other even though they have no intention to do so as a consequence more hydraulic oscillations are generated and more energy than necessary is expended distributed control architecture the distributed control architecture is a combination of the above two control architecture compared with the cmpc dmpc has important advantages that justify its application firstly the computational requirements are much lower than cmpc because a complex problem is substituted by several smaller problems the need for communication shifts from global communication to information exchange between locally adjacent controllers in this way the communication network induced issues are much easier to solve and the coupling effects among different subsystems can also be given consideration benefiting from the inherent modularity of the dmpc the system maintenance and the possible expansions of the control system are simplified moreover the effect of a possible disturbance or failure on the overall system is weakened because of the coordination or negotiation process nevertheless because each agent does not have a global vision of the entire system the loss of control performance in comparison with the cmpc becomes the main drawback of the dmpc this loss depends on the degree of interaction between the neighboring subsystems and the coordination mechanisms between the agents consequently a reasonable trade off between control performance and the cost of communication and coordination is pursued to reach a cooperative solution 
8896,excessive use of water resources in combination with climate change threaten to significantly reduce groundwater in arid and semiarid regions we studied the effects of climate change on the groundwater level for the important dehgolan aquifer in northwestern iran the water level in this aquifer has dropped by about 35 m during the last 30 years soft computing techniques were used together with climate projections in three methodological steps to estimate the groundwater level drop by 2045 firstly modflow was used to simulate groundwater flow and movement secondly simulation results support vector regression svr and least squares svr lssvr machine learning models were used to predict groundwater levels for the future 20 year period 2026 2045 the whale optimization algorithm woa was used to improve the prediction results by optimizing the svr parameters thirdly three climate models of cmip6 access cm2 bcc csm2 mr and cmcc esm2 were used to predict the changes in precipitation for the future period 2026 2045 using ssp 2 6 and ssp 8 5 scenarios the results showed that the modflow lssvr model predicted the groundwater level more accurately than modflow svr and modflow svr woa the calculation scenario containing previous month groundwater level monthly aquifer withdrawal and monthly precipitation had the highest performance in predicting groundwater level with root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse equal to 0 305 m 0 014 m and 0 998 respectively the results indicate that precipitation may decrease in the future period for the ssp 8 5 scenario about 6 compared to the reference period 1987 2005 this decrease along with the continuation of the current aquifer withdrawal will cause a drop of about 36 m during 28 years of the groundwater level 1 3 m per year the results reveal that the drop could be reduced to 12 m by adopting a 25 reduction in the current aquifer withdrawal the findings show the necessity of providing a suitable management approach to prevent future aquifer exhaustion due to the continuation of the current withdrawal situation in the region keywords aquifer climate change groundwater management machine learning groundwater level prediction data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction groundwater resources are essential supply for drinking industry and agriculture these resources also directly affect terrestrial ecosystems by supplying water access to vegetation gonzalez and arsanjani 2021 groundwater is an important link in the hydrological cycle that provides baseflow for surface water resources european commission 2021 it provides a large fraction of water needs especially in arid and semiarid regions moghaddam et al 2019 most aquifers in semiarid iran are in a precarious situation these aquifers have faced a sharp drop in groundwater levels gwl during the last few years kayhomayoon et al 2022 evaluated the volume of aquifers in iran and found that most of these suffer from rapid depletion and risk for ground subsidence milan et al 2023 found that 90 of iran s aquifers are in a poor condition in terms of groundwater footprint index and sustainability these include important aquifers such as qorveh dehgolan qazvin varamin hamadan and qom there are several factors involved in the rapidly decreasing gwls the most important are the excessive use of groundwater resources without regard to sustainability expansion of agriculture increase in population and decrease in precipitation in general groundwater quantity and quality are sensitive to various climatic and human influences that lead to decrease in groundwater volume land subsidence and saltwater intrusion nadiri et al 2019 bordbar et al 2020 to improve the understanding of the current situation and to develop improved management plans it is necessary to predict future aquifer conditions moghaddam et al 2021 today numerical modeling is considered an important tool for studying groundwater resources khadri and pande 2016 in general groundwater modeling involves a mathematical representation of a groundwater system solved by a computer program reilly and harbaugh 2004 in recent years the modflow model has become popular due to its simplicity modular program structure and packages for solving hydrogeological problems habel et al 2017 aghlmand and abbasi 2019 chakraborty et al 2019 apart from any model used for modeling accurate input data should be included in the model to obtain reliable modeling results baalousha 2009 however all observations include uncertainties and errors therefore the use of data driven models such as machine learning and their combination with numerical models can minimize the uncertainty and challenges in the prediction of gwl climate change has seriously affected the planet in different ways the industrialization of societies has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions causing global warming and its subsequent effects on the climate system dehghani et al 2022 empirical chen et al 2002 and statistical models such as arma arima and sarima mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 yan and ma 2016 are common in predicting the gwl however in recent years machine learning ml models have become popular among researchers due to their features such as high accuracy high convergence rate and the need for limited input data ml algorithms only require data processing and approximate relationships between model inputs and outputs through an iterative learning process solomatine and ostfeld 2008 although ml algorithms do not replace conceptual models they have been found to perform better in many cases mohanty et al 2013 making them useful for predicting future changes gonzalez and arsanjani 2021 for example dehghani et al 2022 predicted the gwl of the khorramabad plain using ml models considering the effects of climate change one of the supervised ml models that has been used in various studies is support vector regression svr unlike svr least square svr lssvr uses quadratic equations instead of linear programming therefore lssvr has higher computational accuracy than the classical svr both svr and lssvr models have been successfully used in various hydrological studies such as gwl prediction runoff prediction river longitudinal dispersion coefficient and evaporation goyal et al 2014 bharti et al 2017 sattari et al 2018 mirarabi et al 2019 arya azar et al 2021a 2021b kayhomayoon et al 2021 metaheuristic algorithms can be combined with individual algorithms such as artificial neural network ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and svr leading to higher prediction performance in solutions to hydrological problems mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 ghorbani et al 2018 tao et al 2022 samani et al 2022 introduced in 2016 the whale optimization algorithm woa is a swarm algorithm that can improve the results of

huajing 2017 aljarah et al 2018 mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 climate change indicates changes in precipitation patterns runoff and access to drinking and agricultural water endo et al 2012 climate change is a big threat to groundwater resources in the near future especially in arid and semiarid regions salem et al 2018 the increase in temperature and change in the precipitation pattern because of climate change will significantly affect access to groundwater shahid and hazarika 2010 taylor et al 2013 shahid et al 2017 salem et al 2018 groundwater resources are affected by climate change in two ways direct interaction with surface water resources such as rivers and lakes and indirect interaction through the recharge process sheikha bagemghaleh et al 2023 dehghani et al 2022 a decrease in gwl causes problems such as an increase in pumping costs and a decrease in the availability of water for drinking and agriculture therefore predicting the gwl under the influence of climate change is necessary for efficient management of groundwater resources since climate change affects groundwater directly and indirectly identifying and analyzing climate variables can greatly help in predicting serious threats to groundwater resources such as subsidence and drought chang and chang 2006 affandi and watanabe 2007 moreover since the relationships between climate variables and groundwater resources are complex and non linear using ml methods and their modern hybrid models is a suitable solution to solve such problems dehghani et al 2022 therefore examining climate change and management scenarios such as reducing withdrawal from aquifers and using numerical and ml models to simulate predict and implement scenarios are effective steps in managing aquifers that are in critical situations aquifers in arid and semiarid regions are more exposed to serious risks such as over exploitation and climate change therefore the objective of this study was to improve the understanding of groundwater dynamics for an important aquifer that is facing a crises condition in northwestern iran the flow situation for the aquifer was first simulated and then its status under four various scenarios was investigated a continuation of the existing withdrawal situation b 15 reduction in aquifer withdrawal c 25 reduction in aquifer withdrawal and d changes in recharge caused by precipitation based on the cmip6 emission scenarios the modflow gms numerical model was used for groundwater simulation for long term future forecasting ml models were used along with the simulation results since the data available for the study area were limited and accompanied by uncertainty therefore this study is a combined numerical and ml method investigation using simulation and prediction of groundwater conditions for this purpose the svr lssvr and hybrid svr woa models were used the combination of simulation ml models and evolutionary optimization algorithms in simulating and predicting the gwl and examining the effects of management scenarios are novel in this exercise the cmip6 climate change scenarios and two emission models were used to generate precipitation data therefore the effects of climate change were considered during the gwl modeling in the near and long term future period 2026 2045 using the ml models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with an area of 7236 km2 the qorveh dehgolan region is located in a mountainous area in northwestern iran fig 1 the dehgolan aquifer in this region has an area of 780 km2 about 30 of the study area are mountainous with steep slopes while the rest is a plain with a slope of less than 8 the minimum and maximum elevation of the area are 1495 and 3010 m amsl respectively the average annual precipitation and temperature are 363 mm and 11 c respectively according to the groundwater balance of the dehgolan alluvial aquifer the annual recharge and discharge rates are 254 and 268 million cubic m mcm respectively therefore there is a 14 mcm annual deficit in the volume of the aquifer which has resulted in a gwl drop of approximately 0 95 m per year during the latest decades the available information shows that the aquifer gwl has dropped significantly by about 35 m during the period from 1998 to 2017 fig 1c since 1998 the gwl started to drop causing a decline of nearly 35 m in about 20 years this is due to various reasons such excessive aquifer withdrawal due to the expansion of agriculture construction of unauthorized wells in the aquifer increase in population pressure and drought periods this reveals the urgent need for improved management predicting the future gwl throughout the aquifer is an initial and essential step to tailoring management solutions 2 2 methodology the study was conducted in three sequential steps as shown in fig 2 in the first step gwl was simulated using the modular finite difference flow modflow model and recharge groundwater withdrawal hydraulic conductivity and gwl drop were extracted from the simulation results the groundwater data of october 2010 were used for model steady state simulation in which hydraulic conductivity values were calibrated for a period of three years from october 2010 to september 2013 the unsteady state model was developed and the specific yield values were calibrated in the second step ml models were used to predict gwl gwl was predicted until 2045 according to the results of groundwater simulation and with the help of the svr lssvr and hybrid svr woa models for this various inputs such as gwl in the previous month monthly aquifer recharge and withdrawal were used scenarios of reducing groundwater withdrawal were investigated to check the condition of the gwl finally in the third step three climate scenarios from sixth ipcc climate change report were used to generate precipitation data for two emission scenarios of ssp 2 6 and ssp 8 5 for the future period 2026 2045 finally the changes in precipitation in the future period were predicted by the selected ml model in the second step to obtain the gwl under the influence of climate change 2 3 groundwater level simulation by modflow gms the first step of groundwater simulation was the creation of a conceptual model in which the basic information of the aquifer including area of the aquifer observation wells exploitation wells surface recharge to the aquifer rivers and hydraulic conductivity along with topography and bedrock of the aquifer were considered for this purpose topographic data and aquifer area were determined using dem of the region fig 3 the values of hydraulic conductivity were estimated by information about the aquifer thickness and the transmissivity coefficient and the t k b equation where k is hydraulic conductivity m day b is the aquifer saturation thickness m and t is the aquifer transformability m2 day initial hydraulic conductivity was estimated between 1 and 35 m day in various areas of the aquifer areas with coarse grained media have higher hydraulic conductivity fig 3 bedrock data are also one of the most basic information required for modeling these were estimated with the help of reports of pumping tests and wells along with the thickness of the aquifer in different areas fig 3 aquifer thickness varied from 60 to 263 m considering the cell size of 250 250 m about 17 of the monthly precipitation were considered for infiltration and aquifer recharge kayhomayoon et al 2022 moreover based on the primary use of wells return water was considered about 60 75 and 20 for drinking water industrial and agricultural use respectively kayhomayoon et al 2021 milan et al 2023 as shown in fig 3 a large part for aquifer discharge about 266 mcm occurs through exploitation wells the model was run in october 2010 for the steady state and october 2010 to september 2013 for the unsteady state with a monthly time step most exploitation wells are located in the aquifer s central section a large part of which is used for urban and agricultural purposes out of 56 observation wells in the aquifer 45 were used for calibration in the steady and unsteady states fig 3d currently the aquifer is in a critical state and managers have proposed various scenarios such as reducing withdrawal from the aquifer inter basin water transfer and artificial recharge however these scenarios have not yet been implemented thus investigating the effects of climate change can better determine the condition of the aquifer for management purposes 2 4 climate change the scenarios of the sixth report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc were used to evaluate the changes in precipitation and its impact on groundwater resources the cmip6 scenarios examine how climate change will occur with the help of the combination of representative concentration pathway rcp and shared socioeconomic pathway ssp scenarios future scenarios include different possible economic and social developments in addition to different climate statuses with a focus on radiative forcing ssps along with rcps have been used to analyze feedback between climate change and social and economic factors such as world population growth economic development and technological progress these two scenarios describe the situations in which mitigation adaptation and residual climate damage can be evaluated ssp scenarios include ssp1 sustainability ssp2 middle of the road ssp3 regional rivalry ssp4 inequality and ssp5 fossil fueled development riahi et al 2017 in this study climatic data required in the water resources system model such as precipitation were provided from the output of aogcm climate models under the rcp2 6 ssp1 and rcp8 5 ssp5 scenarios there are 28 models in the sixth report for producing precipitation data of which three models were used in this study finally the precipitation in the future period was obtained by averaging the output of the three models using the delta or change factor methods makes it possible to calculate the desired climate variable changes in future periods compared to the previous periods diaz nieto and wilby 2005 in this case the difference between the two variables is used for temperature while the percentage difference is used for precipitation hulme and jones 1994 1 p p future p base p base 100 where p is the changes in precipitation in the next period of each month respectively these values were calculated for the 2026 2045 period p future is the 20 year average precipitation simulated by atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms in the next period for each month p base is the 20 year average precipitation simulated by aogcm in the observation baseline period per month the climatic variables of the main cell for the baseline and future were extracted from the ipcc website then arcgis software was used to visualize the geographical coordinates of the study area by subtracting the long term monthly values of the base period from the corresponding values in the next period the change in climatic variables were obtained finally precipitation values were obtained by dividing the changes of future period values by the changes in base period values eq 1 the generated temperature and precipitation data under future scenarios were calculated using goodarzi et al 2015 2 p p base p where p base is the time series of monthly precipitation in the base period respectively p represents the time series of precipitation resulting from climate change in the future and under a downscaling climate change scenario respectively in this study the ssp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios were used to investigate the effect of climate change on the amount of groundwater level 2 5 groundwater level prediction by machine learning 2 5 1 svr proposed by vapnik 1993 svr is a supervised learning model that is used for regression problems based on a structured risk minimization scheme svr uses a kernel function to construct an optimal separating hyperplane which simultaneously maximizes the geometric margin and minimizes the upper bound of the generalization error according to cortes and vapnik 1995 3 d w t x b where w is the weight vector b is bias and d and x belong to the training sample j x i d i i 1 n with the introduction of an ε insensitive loss function the coefficients y and d are estimated by minimizing the risk function cortes and vapnik 1995 4 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n y i d i ε which is subjected to the constraints brought in eqs 5 8 for i 1 2 n 5 d i y i ε ζ i 6 y i d i ε ζ i 7 0 ζ i 8 0 ζ i where c is a constant that determines the trade off between the training error and the penalization term w 2 and y i is the estimator output ζ and ζ are two sets of nonnegative parameters to solve the optimization problem of eq 4 lagrange multipliers are introduced and the minimization formula can be expressed a kernel function is introduced to convert the problem to a nonlinear regression problem linear polynomial radial basis function rbf and sigmoid kernels have been introduced to use in the structure of svr the rbf kernel which is a widely used kernel was selected in this study during the svr modeling process 2 5 2 lssvr although svr has been widely used as a reliable technique in regression problems lssvr was introduced in 1999 to overcome some of the shortcomings of svr suykens and vandewalle 1999 it provides less computational complexity higher performance and lower runtime consider a training data set such as x k y k k 1 n whose input and output data includes x k r n and y k r respectively the nonlinear regression function in the initial weighting space is suykens and vandewalle 1999 9 y x w t φ x b where w and b represent the weight and bias of the regression function respectively t is the transpose symbol and φ x is the nonlinear mapping of inputs in the feature space with high dimensions the nonlinear regression can be solved by optimization equation suykens and vandewalle 1999 10 min j w e 1 2 w 2 w 1 2 γ k 1 n e k 2 considering the constraints we have 11 y k w t φ χ b e k k 1 2 n where γ is the regulation parameter of the error and e indicates the error the value of γ controls the approximation function and therefore increasing its value increases the error rates arya azar et al 2021a 2021b solving the equation using the lagrangian form of the main objective function gives 12 l w b e α j w e i 1 n α i w t φ χ b e k y k where α is the lagrangian coefficient according to the karush kuhn tucker optimization method the lssvr model can be written in the form 13 y χ k 1 n α k k χ χ k b where k χ χk is called the kernel function rbf kernel was used in this study as a conventional kernel function 14 k χ χ k exp χ χ k σ 2 2 2 5 3 whale optimization algorithm in practice determining the optimal values for parameters c and γ can remarkably increase the performance of svr in regression problems therefore woa as a reliable optimization method was used in this study to optimize these parameters for the svr models proposed by mirjalili and lewis 2016 woa is a nature inspired algorithm and operates based on the bubble net hunting strategy of humpback whales during hunting whales release air bubbles under the sea creating walls of rising air in the water the small fish herds inside the aerial wall fearful of being trapped move to the center of the bubble circle where they are hunted by the whale the whale can detect the position of the prey fig 4 however since the optimal point in the search space is not clear it assumes that the best current point is the adjacent prey after determining this point the search for other optimal points continues which can be expressed as mirjalili and lewis 2016 15 d c x t x t 16 x t 1 x t a d where t is the current iterator c and a are the coefficient vectors x is the best position vector so far and x is the position vector the vectors a and c are calculated as mirjalili and lewis 2016 17 a 2 a r a 18 c 2 r the vector a is a vector in both exploration and exploitation phases and is reduced from 2 to 0 per repetition the vector r is a random vector in the range between 0 and 1 2 6 performance evaluation criteria several error evaluation metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the modflow code and ml models based on the scenarios the dataset was randomly divided into two groups with 75 of data for model training and the rest for model validation root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mean absolute percentage error mape and mean absolute error mae were calculated arya azar et al 2021a 2021b 19 rmse i 1 n x o x p 2 n 20 nse 1 i 1 n x o x p 2 i 1 n x p x 2 21 mape 1 n i 1 n x o x p x o 22 mae i 1 n x p x o n where x o is the observed value x p is the predicted simulated value and n is the number of samples the lower rmse mape and mae values as well as higher nse indicate better model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 the results of groundwater level simulation the simulation of groundwater was performed and calibrated for steady and unsteady states the results of which are shown in fig 5 the figure shows the highest gwl in the central areas of the aquifer gwl varies from 1761 to 1967 m throughout the aquifer which indicates large variations in gwl for the aquifer and highly varying withdrawal fig 5a the rmse and mae values of 0 72 and 0 66 m respectively in the steady state show acceptable performance of the groundwater simulation similarly the values of 0 84 and 0 74 m in the unsteady transient state although indicating insignificant simulation error are within an acceptable range despite the presence of many observation wells fig 5b according to this figure the simulation error of all observed wells was less than 1 5 m showing that the simulated and actual values in each well were less than 1 5 m and most of them were less than 1 m since the simulation of groundwater in the unsteady state was performed for monthly values and according to the actual status of the aquifer it is necessary to calibrate and run the model every month fig 6 shows the results of the gwl simulation in some selected wells where the actual values are plotted next to the simulated values in each month the small difference between the observed and simulated values in the selected wells reveals that the groundwater simulation model was able to simulate the process of changes in the gwl at each step correctly in addition the results show that the gwl drop is higher in the central and southern areas of the aquifer than in the northern areas nonetheless it is clear that the study aquifer has experienced a severe decline in groundwater in the last few years which requires proper investigation and management in the near future about 150 data samples including aquifer withdrawal gwl gwl drop and aquifer recharge were extracted from the groundwater simulator to train the ml models thus gwl was first simulated using the three ml models and then validated for a longer period from 1987 to 2017 and finally predicted until 2045 3 2 the results of groundwater level prediction to reach a certain and constant value of the parameter of each algorithm it is necessary to run the algorithm several times with different values for the investigated parameters and the best results indicate the selection of the most appropriate values for each algorithm table 1 shows the values of the parameters used in the structure of all models the svr woa algorithm used 1500 iterations because there was no improvement in simulation after 1500 iterations the gaussian kernel in ls svm method has two parameters namely σ2 and γ the optimum value of which were obtained equal to 0 226 and 14 825 035 respectively to investigate the future situation of the aquifer under the influence of climate change it was necessary to predict the gwl in the future period since the simulated numerical model requires a lot of information about the future period of the aquifer and due to the limited amount of available information and the uncertainty in this range ml models were preferred to predict gwl values instead of the modflow model various variables including aquifer withdrawal gwl in the previous month aquifer recharge and gwl drop were used as inputs to the ml to predict the gwl the evaluation results of the simulations are shown in table 1 all three models performed well in predicting the gwl among the models lssvr had the highest prediction performance with rmse mae and nse of 0 305 m 0 014 m and 0 998 respectively for the test data the results of the optimized svr model svr woa compared to the results of the unoptimized model show that woa partially improved the prediction accuracy and there was no remarkable difference between the performances of both models after selecting lssvr as the best model in the prediction of gwl it was used to predict gwl for a 20 year validation period 1987 2017 the result of which showed acceptable accuracy of the model fig 7 as shown in the figure the error of each step was between 1 and 1 m the histogram result shows that the error follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of about 0 33 with this description the performance of the lssvr model in predicting the gwl can be considered appropriate fig 7 table 2 since the withdrawal from the aquifer has significant effects on changes in gwl three scenarios were defined based on the reduction of aquifer withdrawal to investigate the future status of gwl in the first scenario which is the continuation of the existing situation s0 gwl will reach 1765 m by 2045 experiencing a drop of about 36 m compared to its value in 2017 in the second scenario which is defined as a reduction of about 15 in groundwater withdrawal s1 the average drop throughout the aquifer would be about 10 m higher from 1764 m to 1774 m than the s0 scenario in case of a 25 reduction of the total aquifer withdrawal s2 gwl would reach 1777 m in 2045 which is about 12 m higher than the gwl in the s0 scenario although the results show that the reduction of aquifer withdrawal will lead to a partial improvement in the condition of the aquifer in the future proper and extensive decisions are required to improve the situation of the aquifer over long periods of time fig 8 3 3 the results of climate change three climate models were used to generate precipitation data for the future fig 9 shows a comparison of the basic observational precipitation data and the average of all three models access cm2 bcc csm2 mr and cmcc esm2 the rmse mape and nse values equal 10 4 mm 1 3 mm and 0 7 mm respectively indicate the acceptable accordance of the two data sets however in the first six months the average values of the models were lower than the values of the basic observational data while in the second six months of the year the amounts were higher than the observed values fig 10 shows the results of generating precipitation data under ssp 2 6 and ssp 8 5 scenarios after downscaling in general precipitation has decreased in both scenarios the greatest decrease in precipitation may be in march april and february the three summer months of july to september when the lowest amount of precipitation occurs precipitation may neither increase nor decrease in the future the results show that precipitation in the ssp 8 5 scenario may decrease more than that in the ssp 2 6 scenario in most months in the ssp 8 5 scenario precipitation may decrease by about 6 3 compared to the reference period 1987 2005 the results indicate a decrease in precipitation in the first six months of the year and a relative increase in the second six months of the year the amount of gwl due to precipitation was predicted by lssvr as the selected ml model fig 11 by applying changes in future precipitation gwl will experience slight changes about 0 75 1 35 m the greatest drop will occur in april may and march where the precipitation will experience the greatest decrease the results show that the changes in gwl are lower under the ssp 2 6 scenario as compared to the ssp 8 5 scenario in general however climate change will have a negligible effect on the drop of gwl 4 discussion the results of this study showed that the combination of numerical and ml models in simulating and predicting the gwl for areas where aquifer information is not available is a suitable alternative solution the results also showed acceptable performance of numerical and ml models along with existing evolutionary optimization algorithms in gwl prediction this confirms previous research such as kardan moghaddam et al 2021 and kayhomayoon et al 2021 the findings of the present study also demonstrate that modflow soft computing has a strong performance in modeling the aquifer status and evaluating the impact of climate change scenarios on the amount of aquifer inflows according to these results the groundwater resources of dehgolan are not sustainably exploited in an integrated system along with surface water resources the results showed that in the study area the gwl drop is affected mainly by the aquifer withdrawal indicating the critical status of the aquifer in the case of the continuation of the current trend of water withdrawal the results also showed that management scenarios such as a 15 and 25 reduction in aquifer groundwater withdrawal although effective in reducing groundwater loss cannot compensate for the loss of the aquifer in the short term for this purpose more fundamental measures should be taken such as the use of inter basin water transfer changing the cultivation patterns in the region and improving the irrigation systems in combination with water withdrawal reduction scenarios the results showed that climate change will have a minor contribution to the groundwater loss of the aquifer in the future compared to the aquifer withdrawal which confirms the research of sheikha bagemghaleh et al 2020 and soltani et al 2023 therefore according to the obtained results and the critical situation of the study aquifer managers and decision makers should seriously investigate the situation of the aquifer all efforts and expenses should be in the way of improving the condition of the aquifer if not severe problems such as land subsidence aquifer quality reduction and migration of villagers may occur followed by endangering the security of the food supply and the environment of the region 5 conclusions groundwater withdrawal is a familiar term for regions facing water stress in these areas examining the current state of groundwater and creating a vision of its future based on the changes in governing drivers can help managers to better management in this research an attempt was made to evaluate the condition of the dehgolan aquifer in the northwest of iran which has been experiencing a relatively severe decline for years using a combination of various models modflow was used to simulate the aquifer and the svr lssvr and svr woa models were used to predict the gwl under the scenarios of continuation of the existing situation reduction of aquifer withdrawal and the effect of climate change for the future period 2026 2045 although the results showed that the performance of combining numerical and ml models can lead to better simulation and prediction of gwl the lssvr modflow model provided the best results among the existing models a 36 m gwl drop was predicted by 2045 in the case of continuing the current trend of aquifer withdrawal which will cause a serious situation for the aquifer in addition climate change showed changes in precipitation in the future period a decrease in some months and an increase in others however climate change has less effects than the aquifer withdrawal on the aquifer status therefore for better management it is necessary to reduce the aquifer withdrawal by at least 25 to compensate for part of the groundwater loss in the long term period of at least 20 years the results showed that the ml models are suitable tools for expressing the current and future state of a system like an aquifer finally the use of management scenarios such as water transfer from other areas and conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources are among the solutions that can be considered as the perspective of this research to improve the situation of the study aquifer declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8896,excessive use of water resources in combination with climate change threaten to significantly reduce groundwater in arid and semiarid regions we studied the effects of climate change on the groundwater level for the important dehgolan aquifer in northwestern iran the water level in this aquifer has dropped by about 35 m during the last 30 years soft computing techniques were used together with climate projections in three methodological steps to estimate the groundwater level drop by 2045 firstly modflow was used to simulate groundwater flow and movement secondly simulation results support vector regression svr and least squares svr lssvr machine learning models were used to predict groundwater levels for the future 20 year period 2026 2045 the whale optimization algorithm woa was used to improve the prediction results by optimizing the svr parameters thirdly three climate models of cmip6 access cm2 bcc csm2 mr and cmcc esm2 were used to predict the changes in precipitation for the future period 2026 2045 using ssp 2 6 and ssp 8 5 scenarios the results showed that the modflow lssvr model predicted the groundwater level more accurately than modflow svr and modflow svr woa the calculation scenario containing previous month groundwater level monthly aquifer withdrawal and monthly precipitation had the highest performance in predicting groundwater level with root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse equal to 0 305 m 0 014 m and 0 998 respectively the results indicate that precipitation may decrease in the future period for the ssp 8 5 scenario about 6 compared to the reference period 1987 2005 this decrease along with the continuation of the current aquifer withdrawal will cause a drop of about 36 m during 28 years of the groundwater level 1 3 m per year the results reveal that the drop could be reduced to 12 m by adopting a 25 reduction in the current aquifer withdrawal the findings show the necessity of providing a suitable management approach to prevent future aquifer exhaustion due to the continuation of the current withdrawal situation in the region keywords aquifer

essential supply for drinking industry and agriculture these resources also directly affect terrestrial ecosystems by supplying water access to vegetation gonzalez and arsanjani 2021 groundwater is an important link in the hydrological cycle that provides baseflow for surface water resources european commission 2021 it provides a large fraction of water needs especially in arid and semiarid regions moghaddam et al 2019 most aquifers in semiarid iran are in a precarious situation these aquifers have faced a sharp drop in groundwater levels gwl during the last few years kayhomayoon et al 2022 evaluated the volume of aquifers in iran and found that most of these suffer from rapid depletion and risk for ground subsidence milan et al 2023 found that 90 of iran s aquifers are in a poor condition in terms of groundwater footprint index and sustainability these include important aquifers such as qorveh dehgolan qazvin varamin hamadan and qom there are several factors involved in the rapidly decreasing gwls the most important are the excessive use of groundwater resources without regard to sustainability expansion of agriculture increase in population and decrease in precipitation in general groundwater quantity and quality are sensitive to various climatic and human influences that lead to decrease in groundwater volume land subsidence and saltwater intrusion nadiri et al 2019 bordbar et al 2020 to improve the understanding of the current situation and to develop improved management plans it is necessary to predict future aquifer conditions moghaddam et al 2021 today numerical modeling is considered an important tool for studying groundwater resources khadri and pande 2016 in general groundwater modeling involves a mathematical representation of a groundwater system solved by a computer program reilly and harbaugh 2004 in recent years the modflow model has become popular due to its simplicity modular program structure and packages for solving hydrogeological problems habel et al 2017 aghlmand and abbasi 2019 chakraborty et al 2019 apart from any model used for modeling accurate input data should be included in the model to obtain reliable modeling results baalousha 2009 however all observations include uncertainties and errors therefore the use of data driven models such as machine learning and their combination with numerical models can minimize the uncertainty and challenges in the prediction of gwl climate change has seriously affected the planet in different ways the industrialization of societies has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions causing global warming and its subsequent effects on the climate system dehghani et al 2022 empirical chen et al 2002 and statistical models such as arma arima and sarima mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 yan and ma 2016 are common in predicting the gwl however in recent years machine learning ml models have become popular among researchers due to their features such as high accuracy high convergence rate and the need for limited input data ml algorithms only require data processing and approximate relationships between model inputs and outputs through an iterative learning process solomatine and ostfeld 2008 although ml algorithms do not replace conceptual models they have been found to perform better in many cases mohanty et al 2013 making them useful for predicting future changes gonzalez and arsanjani 2021 for example dehghani et al 2022 predicted the gwl of the khorramabad plain using ml models considering the effects of climate change one of the supervised ml models that has been used in various studies is support vector regression svr unlike svr least square svr lssvr uses quadratic equations instead of linear programming therefore lssvr has higher computational accuracy than the classical svr both svr and lssvr models have been successfully used in various hydrological studies such as gwl prediction runoff prediction river longitudinal dispersion coefficient and evaporation goyal et al 2014 bharti et al 2017 sattari et al 2018 mirarabi et al 2019 arya azar et al 2021a 2021b kayhomayoon et al 2021 metaheuristic algorithms can be combined with individual algorithms such as artificial neural network ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and svr leading to higher prediction performance in solutions to hydrological problems mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 ghorbani et al 2018 tao et al 2022 samani et al 2022 introduced in 2016 the whale optimization algorithm woa is a swarm algorithm that can improve the results of individual models this algorithm is inspired by the bubble net hunting method used by humpback whales the algorithm has successfully optimized the parameters of ann anfis and svr models sai and huajing 2017 aljarah et al 2018 mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 climate change indicates changes in precipitation patterns runoff and access to drinking and agricultural water endo et al 2012 climate change is a big threat to groundwater resources in the near future especially in arid and semiarid regions salem et al 2018 the increase in temperature and change in the precipitation pattern because of climate change will significantly affect access to groundwater shahid and hazarika 2010 taylor et al 2013 shahid et al 2017 salem et al 2018 groundwater resources are affected by climate change in two ways direct interaction with surface water resources such as rivers and lakes and indirect interaction through the recharge process sheikha bagemghaleh et al 2023 dehghani et al 2022 a decrease in gwl causes problems such as an increase in pumping costs and a decrease in the availability of water for drinking and agriculture therefore predicting the gwl under the influence of climate change is necessary for efficient management of groundwater resources since climate change affects groundwater directly and indirectly identifying and analyzing climate variables can greatly help in predicting serious threats to groundwater resources such as subsidence and drought chang and chang 2006 affandi and watanabe 2007 moreover since the relationships between climate variables and groundwater resources are complex and non linear using ml methods and their modern hybrid models is a suitable solution to solve such problems dehghani et al 2022 therefore examining climate change and management scenarios such as reducing withdrawal from aquifers and using numerical and ml models to simulate predict and implement scenarios are effective steps in managing aquifers that are in critical situations aquifers in arid and semiarid regions are more exposed to serious risks such as over exploitation and climate change therefore the objective of this study was to improve the understanding of groundwater dynamics for an important aquifer that is facing a crises condition in northwestern iran the flow situation for the aquifer was first simulated and then its status under four various scenarios was investigated a continuation of the existing withdrawal situation b 15 reduction in aquifer withdrawal c 25 reduction in aquifer withdrawal and d changes in recharge caused by precipitation based on the cmip6 emission scenarios the modflow gms numerical model was used for groundwater simulation for long term future forecasting ml models were used along with the simulation results since the data available for the study area were limited and accompanied by uncertainty therefore this study is a combined numerical and ml method investigation using simulation and prediction of groundwater conditions for this purpose the svr lssvr and hybrid svr woa models were used the combination of simulation ml models and evolutionary optimization algorithms in simulating and predicting the gwl and examining the effects of management scenarios are novel in this exercise the cmip6 climate change scenarios and two emission models were used to generate precipitation data therefore the effects of climate change were considered during the gwl modeling in the near and long term future period 2026 2045 using the ml models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with an area of 7236 km2 the qorveh dehgolan region is located in a mountainous area in northwestern iran fig 1 the dehgolan aquifer in this region has an area of 780 km2 about 30 of the study area are mountainous with steep slopes while the rest is a plain with a slope of less than 8 the minimum and maximum elevation of the area are 1495 and 3010 m amsl respectively the average annual precipitation and temperature are 363 mm and 11 c respectively according to the groundwater balance of the dehgolan alluvial aquifer the annual recharge and discharge rates are 254 and 268 million cubic m mcm respectively therefore there is a 14 mcm annual deficit in the volume of the aquifer which has resulted in a gwl drop of approximately 0 95 m per year during the latest decades the available information shows that the aquifer gwl has dropped significantly by about 35 m during the period from 1998 to 2017 fig 1c since 1998 the gwl started to drop causing a decline of nearly 35 m in about 20 years this is due to various reasons such excessive aquifer withdrawal due to the expansion of agriculture construction of unauthorized wells in the aquifer increase in population pressure and drought periods this reveals the urgent need for improved management predicting the future gwl throughout the aquifer is an initial and essential step to tailoring management solutions 2 2 methodology the study was conducted in three sequential steps as shown in fig 2 in the first step gwl was simulated using the modular finite difference flow modflow model and recharge groundwater withdrawal hydraulic conductivity and gwl drop were extracted from the simulation results the groundwater data of october 2010 were used for model steady state simulation in which hydraulic conductivity values were calibrated for a period of three years from october 2010 to september 2013 the unsteady state model was developed and the specific yield values were calibrated in the second step ml models were used to predict gwl gwl was predicted until 2045 according to the results of groundwater simulation and with the help of the svr lssvr and hybrid svr woa models for this various inputs such as gwl in the previous month monthly aquifer recharge and withdrawal were used scenarios of reducing groundwater withdrawal were investigated to check the condition of the gwl finally in the third step three climate scenarios from sixth ipcc climate change report were used to generate precipitation data for two emission scenarios of ssp 2 6 and ssp 8 5 for the future period 2026 2045 finally the changes in precipitation in the future period were predicted by the selected ml model in the second step to obtain the gwl under the influence of climate change 2 3 groundwater level simulation by modflow gms the first step of groundwater simulation was the creation of a conceptual model in which the basic information of the aquifer including area of the aquifer observation wells exploitation wells surface recharge to the aquifer rivers and hydraulic conductivity along with topography and bedrock of the aquifer were considered for this purpose topographic data and aquifer area were determined using dem of the region fig 3 the values of hydraulic conductivity were estimated by information about the aquifer thickness and the transmissivity coefficient and the t k b equation where k is hydraulic conductivity m day b is the aquifer saturation thickness m and t is the aquifer transformability m2 day initial hydraulic conductivity was estimated between 1 and 35 m day in various areas of the aquifer areas with coarse grained media have higher hydraulic conductivity fig 3 bedrock data are also one of the most basic information required for modeling these were estimated with the help of reports of pumping tests and wells along with the thickness of the aquifer in different areas fig 3 aquifer thickness varied from 60 to 263 m considering the cell size of 250 250 m about 17 of the monthly precipitation were considered for infiltration and aquifer recharge kayhomayoon et al 2022 moreover based on the primary use of wells return water was considered about 60 75 and 20 for drinking water industrial and agricultural use respectively kayhomayoon et al 2021 milan et al 2023 as shown in fig 3 a large part for aquifer discharge about 266 mcm occurs through exploitation wells the model was run in october 2010 for the steady state and october 2010 to september 2013 for the unsteady state with a monthly time step most exploitation wells are located in the aquifer s central section a large part of which is used for urban and agricultural purposes out of 56 observation wells in the aquifer 45 were used for calibration in the steady and unsteady states fig 3d currently the aquifer is in a critical state and managers have proposed various scenarios such as reducing withdrawal from the aquifer inter basin water transfer and artificial recharge however these scenarios have not yet been implemented thus investigating the effects of climate change can better determine the condition of the aquifer for management purposes 2 4 climate change the scenarios of the sixth report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc were used to evaluate the changes in precipitation and its impact on groundwater resources the cmip6 scenarios examine how climate change will occur with the help of the combination of representative concentration pathway rcp and shared socioeconomic pathway ssp scenarios future scenarios include different possible economic and social developments in addition to different climate statuses with a focus on radiative forcing ssps along with rcps have been used to analyze feedback between climate change and social and economic factors such as world population growth economic development and technological progress these two scenarios describe the situations in which mitigation adaptation and residual climate damage can be evaluated ssp scenarios include ssp1 sustainability ssp2 middle of the road ssp3 regional rivalry ssp4 inequality and ssp5 fossil fueled development riahi et al 2017 in this study climatic data required in the water resources system model such as precipitation were provided from the output of aogcm climate models under the rcp2 6 ssp1 and rcp8 5 ssp5 scenarios there are 28 models in the sixth report for producing precipitation data of which three models were used in this study finally the precipitation in the future period was obtained by averaging the output of the three models using the delta or change factor methods makes it possible to calculate the desired climate variable changes in future periods compared to the previous periods diaz nieto and wilby 2005 in this case the difference between the two variables is used for temperature while the percentage difference is used for precipitation hulme and jones 1994 1 p p future p base p base 100 where p is the changes in precipitation in the next period of each month respectively these values were calculated for the 2026 2045 period p future is the 20 year average precipitation simulated by atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms in the next period for each month p base is the 20 year average precipitation simulated by aogcm in the observation baseline period per month the climatic variables of the main cell for the baseline and future were extracted from the ipcc website then arcgis software was used to visualize the geographical coordinates of the study area by subtracting the long term monthly values of the base period from the corresponding values in the next period the change in climatic variables were obtained finally precipitation values were obtained by dividing the changes of future period values by the changes in base period values eq 1 the generated temperature and precipitation data under future scenarios were calculated using goodarzi et al 2015 2 p p base p where p base is the time series of monthly precipitation in the base period respectively p represents the time series of precipitation resulting from climate change in the future and under a downscaling climate change scenario respectively in this study the ssp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios were used to investigate the effect of climate change on the amount of groundwater level 2 5 groundwater level prediction by machine learning 2 5 1 svr proposed by vapnik 1993 svr is a supervised learning model that is used for regression problems based on a structured risk minimization scheme svr uses a kernel function to construct an optimal separating hyperplane which simultaneously maximizes the geometric margin and minimizes the upper bound of the generalization error according to cortes and vapnik 1995 3 d w t x b where w is the weight vector b is bias and d and x belong to the training sample j x i d i i 1 n with the introduction of an ε insensitive loss function the coefficients y and d are estimated by minimizing the risk function cortes and vapnik 1995 4 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n y i d i ε which is subjected to the constraints brought in eqs 5 8 for i 1 2 n 5 d i y i ε ζ i 6 y i d i ε ζ i 7 0 ζ i 8 0 ζ i where c is a constant that determines the trade off between the training error and the penalization term w 2 and y i is the estimator output ζ and ζ are two sets of nonnegative parameters to solve the optimization problem of eq 4 lagrange multipliers are introduced and the minimization formula can be expressed a kernel function is introduced to convert the problem to a nonlinear regression problem linear polynomial radial basis function rbf and sigmoid kernels have been introduced to use in the structure of svr the rbf kernel which is a widely used kernel was selected in this study during the svr modeling process 2 5 2 lssvr although svr has been widely used as a reliable technique in regression problems lssvr was introduced in 1999 to overcome some of the shortcomings of svr suykens and vandewalle 1999 it provides less computational complexity higher performance and lower runtime consider a training data set such as x k y k k 1 n whose input and output data includes x k r n and y k r respectively the nonlinear regression function in the initial weighting space is suykens and vandewalle 1999 9 y x w t φ x b where w and b represent the weight and bias of the regression function respectively t is the transpose symbol and φ x is the nonlinear mapping of inputs in the feature space with high dimensions the nonlinear regression can be solved by optimization equation suykens and vandewalle 1999 10 min j w e 1 2 w 2 w 1 2 γ k 1 n e k 2 considering the constraints we have 11 y k w t φ χ b e k k 1 2 n where γ is the regulation parameter of the error and e indicates the error the value of γ controls the approximation function and therefore increasing its value increases the error rates arya azar et al 2021a 2021b solving the equation using the lagrangian form of the main objective function gives 12 l w b e α j w e i 1 n α i w t φ χ b e k y k where α is the lagrangian coefficient according to the karush kuhn tucker optimization method the lssvr model can be written in the form 13 y χ k 1 n α k k χ χ k b where k χ χk is called the kernel function rbf kernel was used in this study as a conventional kernel function 14 k χ χ k exp χ χ k σ 2 2 2 5 3 whale optimization algorithm in practice determining the optimal values for parameters c and γ can remarkably increase the performance of svr in regression problems therefore woa as a reliable optimization method was used in this study to optimize these parameters for the svr models proposed by mirjalili and lewis 2016 woa is a nature inspired algorithm and operates based on the bubble net hunting strategy of humpback whales during hunting whales release air bubbles under the sea creating walls of rising air in the water the small fish herds inside the aerial wall fearful of being trapped move to the center of the bubble circle where they are hunted by the whale the whale can detect the position of the prey fig 4 however since the optimal point in the search space is not clear it assumes that the best current point is the adjacent prey after determining this point the search for other optimal points continues which can be expressed as mirjalili and lewis 2016 15 d c x t x t 16 x t 1 x t a d where t is the current iterator c and a are the coefficient vectors x is the best position vector so far and x is the position vector the vectors a and c are calculated as mirjalili and lewis 2016 17 a 2 a r a 18 c 2 r the vector a is a vector in both exploration and exploitation phases and is reduced from 2 to 0 per repetition the vector r is a random vector in the range between 0 and 1 2 6 performance evaluation criteria several error evaluation metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the modflow code and ml models based on the scenarios the dataset was randomly divided into two groups with 75 of data for model training and the rest for model validation root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mean absolute percentage error mape and mean absolute error mae were calculated arya azar et al 2021a 2021b 19 rmse i 1 n x o x p 2 n 20 nse 1 i 1 n x o x p 2 i 1 n x p x 2 21 mape 1 n i 1 n x o x p x o 22 mae i 1 n x p x o n where x o is the observed value x p is the predicted simulated value and n is the number of samples the lower rmse mape and mae values as well as higher nse indicate better model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 the results of groundwater level simulation the simulation of groundwater was performed and calibrated for steady and unsteady states the results of which are shown in fig 5 the figure shows the highest gwl in the central areas of the aquifer gwl varies from 1761 to 1967 m throughout the aquifer which indicates large variations in gwl for the aquifer and highly varying withdrawal fig 5a the rmse and mae values of 0 72 and 0 66 m respectively in the steady state show acceptable performance of the groundwater simulation similarly the values of 0 84 and 0 74 m in the unsteady transient state although indicating insignificant simulation error are within an acceptable range despite the presence of many observation wells fig 5b according to this figure the simulation error of all observed wells was less than 1 5 m showing that the simulated and actual values in each well were less than 1 5 m and most of them were less than 1 m since the simulation of groundwater in the unsteady state was performed for monthly values and according to the actual status of the aquifer it is necessary to calibrate and run the model every month fig 6 shows the results of the gwl simulation in some selected wells where the actual values are plotted next to the simulated values in each month the small difference between the observed and simulated values in the selected wells reveals that the groundwater simulation model was able to simulate the process of changes in the gwl at each step correctly in addition the results show that the gwl drop is higher in the central and southern areas of the aquifer than in the northern areas nonetheless it is clear that the study aquifer has experienced a severe decline in groundwater in the last few years which requires proper investigation and management in the near future about 150 data samples including aquifer withdrawal gwl gwl drop and aquifer recharge were extracted from the groundwater simulator to train the ml models thus gwl was first simulated using the three ml models and then validated for a longer period from 1987 to 2017 and finally predicted until 2045 3 2 the results of groundwater level prediction to reach a certain and constant value of the parameter of each algorithm it is necessary to run the algorithm several times with different values for the investigated parameters and the best results indicate the selection of the most appropriate values for each algorithm table 1 shows the values of the parameters used in the structure of all models the svr woa algorithm used 1500 iterations because there was no improvement in simulation after 1500 iterations the gaussian kernel in ls svm method has two parameters namely σ2 and γ the optimum value of which were obtained equal to 0 226 and 14 825 035 respectively to investigate the future situation of the aquifer under the influence of climate change it was necessary to predict the gwl in the future period since the simulated numerical model requires a lot of information about the future period of the aquifer and due to the limited amount of available information and the uncertainty in this range ml models were preferred to predict gwl values instead of the modflow model various variables including aquifer withdrawal gwl in the previous month aquifer recharge and gwl drop were used as inputs to the ml to predict the gwl the evaluation results of the simulations are shown in table 1 all three models performed well in predicting the gwl among the models lssvr had the highest prediction performance with rmse mae and nse of 0 305 m 0 014 m and 0 998 respectively for the test data the results of the optimized svr model svr woa compared to the results of the unoptimized model show that woa partially improved the prediction accuracy and there was no remarkable difference between the performances of both models after selecting lssvr as the best model in the prediction of gwl it was used to predict gwl for a 20 year validation period 1987 2017 the result of which showed acceptable accuracy of the model fig 7 as shown in the figure the error of each step was between 1 and 1 m the histogram result shows that the error follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of about 0 33 with this description the performance of the lssvr model in predicting the gwl can be considered appropriate fig 7 table 2 since the withdrawal from the aquifer has significant effects on changes in gwl three scenarios were defined based on the reduction of aquifer withdrawal to investigate the future status of gwl in the first scenario which is the continuation of the existing situation s0 gwl will reach 1765 m by 2045 experiencing a drop of about 36 m compared to its value in 2017 in the second scenario which is defined as a reduction of about 15 in groundwater withdrawal s1 the average drop throughout the aquifer would be about 10 m higher from 1764 m to 1774 m than the s0 scenario in case of a 25 reduction of the total aquifer withdrawal s2 gwl would reach 1777 m in 2045 which is about 12 m higher than the gwl in the s0 scenario although the results show that the reduction of aquifer withdrawal will lead to a partial improvement in the condition of the aquifer in the future proper and extensive decisions are required to improve the situation of the aquifer over long periods of time fig 8 3 3 the results of climate change three climate models were used to generate precipitation data for the future fig 9 shows a comparison of the basic observational precipitation data and the average of all three models access cm2 bcc csm2 mr and cmcc esm2 the rmse mape and nse values equal 10 4 mm 1 3 mm and 0 7 mm respectively indicate the acceptable accordance of the two data sets however in the first six months the average values of the models were lower than the values of the basic observational data while in the second six months of the year the amounts were higher than the observed values fig 10 shows the results of generating precipitation data under ssp 2 6 and ssp 8 5 scenarios after downscaling in general precipitation has decreased in both scenarios the greatest decrease in precipitation may be in march april and february the three summer months of july to september when the lowest amount of precipitation occurs precipitation may neither increase nor decrease in the future the results show that precipitation in the ssp 8 5 scenario may decrease more than that in the ssp 2 6 scenario in most months in the ssp 8 5 scenario precipitation may decrease by about 6 3 compared to the reference period 1987 2005 the results indicate a decrease in precipitation in the first six months of the year and a relative increase in the second six months of the year the amount of gwl due to precipitation was predicted by lssvr as the selected ml model fig 11 by applying changes in future precipitation gwl will experience slight changes about 0 75 1 35 m the greatest drop will occur in april may and march where the precipitation will experience the greatest decrease the results show that the changes in gwl are lower under the ssp 2 6 scenario as compared to the ssp 8 5 scenario in general however climate change will have a negligible effect on the drop of gwl 4 discussion the results of this study showed that the combination of numerical and ml models in simulating and predicting the gwl for areas where aquifer information is not available is a suitable alternative solution the results also showed acceptable performance of numerical and ml models along with existing evolutionary optimization algorithms in gwl prediction this confirms previous research such as kardan moghaddam et al 2021 and kayhomayoon et al 2021 the findings of the present study also demonstrate that modflow soft computing has a strong performance in modeling the aquifer status and evaluating the impact of climate change scenarios on the amount of aquifer inflows according to these results the groundwater resources of dehgolan are not sustainably exploited in an integrated system along with surface water resources the results showed that in the study area the gwl drop is affected mainly by the aquifer withdrawal indicating the critical status of the aquifer in the case of the continuation of the current trend of water withdrawal the results also showed that management scenarios such as a 15 and 25 reduction in aquifer groundwater withdrawal although effective in reducing groundwater loss cannot compensate for the loss of the aquifer in the short term for this purpose more fundamental measures should be taken such as the use of inter basin water transfer changing the cultivation patterns in the region and improving the irrigation systems in combination with water withdrawal reduction scenarios the results showed that climate change will have a minor contribution to the groundwater loss of the aquifer in the future compared to the aquifer withdrawal which confirms the research of sheikha bagemghaleh et al 2020 and soltani et al 2023 therefore according to the obtained results and the critical situation of the study aquifer managers and decision makers should seriously investigate the situation of the aquifer all efforts and expenses should be in the way of improving the condition of the aquifer if not severe problems such as land subsidence aquifer quality reduction and migration of villagers may occur followed by endangering the security of the food supply and the environment of the region 5 conclusions groundwater withdrawal is a familiar term for regions facing water stress in these areas examining the current state of groundwater and creating a vision of its future based on the changes in governing drivers can help managers to better management in this research an attempt was made to evaluate the condition of the dehgolan aquifer in the northwest of iran which has been experiencing a relatively severe decline for years using a combination of various models modflow was used to simulate the aquifer and the svr lssvr and svr woa models were used to predict the gwl under the scenarios of continuation of the existing situation reduction of aquifer withdrawal and the effect of climate change for the future period 2026 2045 although the results showed that the performance of combining numerical and ml models can lead to better simulation and prediction of gwl the lssvr modflow model provided the best results among the existing models a 36 m gwl drop was predicted by 2045 in the case of continuing the current trend of aquifer withdrawal which will cause a serious situation for the aquifer in addition climate change showed changes in precipitation in the future period a decrease in some months and an increase in others however climate change has less effects than the aquifer withdrawal on the aquifer status therefore for better management it is necessary to reduce the aquifer withdrawal by at least 25 to compensate for part of the groundwater loss in the long term period of at least 20 years the results showed that the ml models are suitable tools for expressing the current and future state of a system like an aquifer finally the use of management scenarios such as water transfer from other areas and conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources are among the solutions that can

benefit mar can potentially increase security of water in drought more economically than new dams can augment existing dams with higher efficiency storage less evaporation augment brackish groundwater desalination schemes and facilitate conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources in australia in 2023 there are currently 10 known operational mar schemes used to increase agricultural activity in varying stages of development providing a total capacity of 70 106 m3 year a review of these australian mar schemes identified several general principles which are more likely to lead to successful implementation including an ongoing demand for water for high value agriculture availability of water for recharge a suitable aquifer for storage with the capacity to store water for recovery and use a suitable location for the mar scheme typically in areas of low topographic relief and the organisational capability institutional arrangements and supportive policies to operate the scheme sustainably and economically if mar schemes are to be developed to support agricultural activity in australia site identification project design economic viability and community and regulator consultation within an investment prospectus will be required operational demonstration schemes in a variety of agricultural settings will encourage wider adoption supportive policy development is required to ensure sustainable and equitable ongoing operation of mar to support irrigated agriculture and for drought resilience graphical abstract ga1 keywords managed aquifer recharge water banking levelized cost data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction variability in water resource availability is a global challenge with broad reaching impacts algur et al 2021 extended drought affects food production and may result in severe economic loss and or even loss of life algur et al 2021 hoque et al 2021 managed aquifer recharge mar is a water resource management strategy that can improve water security and resilience to drought mar is the intentional recharge of water to aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefit nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009a it offers the benefits of providing storage in aquifers which are not subject to evaporative losses balancing seasonal supply and demand by storing water when it is abundant for use in dry periods and contributing to conjunctive use and management of stormwater and groundwater resources despite large areas with low or highly variable rainfall radcliffe and page 2020 agriculture is an important component of the australian economy with 55 of the nation s land contributing approximately aud 43 billion in value abares 2021 nonetheless productivity growth has been affected by climate variability abares 2021 hughes et al 2019 including significant periods of drought such as the millennium drought 2001 2010 and the recent period of prolonged rainfall deficiencies since 2017 http www bom gov au climate drought tabs drought despite the economic importance of agriculture the primary application of mar in australia during the millennium drought was to secure urban water supply and facilitate water recycling radcliffe et al 2017 in australia the history of mar development began in earnest in the 1960s with the development of queensland s lower burdekin scheme to support agriculture with a capacity of 45 106 m3 year charlesworth et al 2002 however compared to urban and mine water management applications mar capacity for agricultural water management in australia has seen relatively little development since that time instead interest in mar has been focused on urban or semi urban situations to either provide for urban water or to assist in reuse of treated wastewater greskowiak et al 2005 and urban stormwater naumann et al 2021 page et al 2010b growth in mar schemes to support agricultural activity in australia has been low iah mar 2018 despite its potential to improve water security during drought feasibility assessments ghd and agt 2011 hostetler 2007 vanderzalm et al 2018 have not translated into significant operational mar capacity while mar capacity in australia grew on average by 3 6 per year from 1965 2015 to 400 106 m3 year approximately 70 106 m3 year of this was for agricultural support dillon et al 2019a the impact of the recent drought on agricultural product hughes et al 2019 and the need to identify new water resources to support economic growth vanderzalm et al 2018 have renewed interest in the potential for mar for agriculture the aim of this study are to 1 document the use of mar within australia s agricultural sector 2 identify key characteristics that lead to viable mar schemes to support agricultural activity in australia identification of these principles to underpin new scheme development can potentially enhance the agricultural sector and increase drought resilience 2 methodology 2 1 managed aquifer recharge mar refers to a suite of methods that can be used to secure groundwater systems under stress and contribute to conjunctive water management dillon et al 2019b those identified as used in mar for agricultural activity are shown in fig 1 nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009a infiltration through permeable sediments can be used to recharge unconfined aquifers infiltration types of mar include in stream and off stream interventions such as recharge reservoir release from upstream dams for infiltration through the downstream streambed recharge weirs percolation tanks check dams which are dams built in ephemeral stream to detain water and enhance infiltration infiltration ponds basins trenches galleries where water is diverted to an offstream storage and subsequent infiltration and soil aquifer treatment which involves intermittent use of infiltration basins in wet and dry cycles to enhance water quality treatment processes injection bore methods can be used where infiltration is restricted by impermeable sediments injection types of mar include aquifer storage and recovery asr where the same bore is used for injection and recovery and aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr where separate bores are used for injection and recovery asr has been used effectively to store fresh water in aquifers with poor quality brackish groundwater whereas astr can be used to enhance water quality treatment within the aquifer in addition any source of available water can be stored via mar for subsequent use the australian guidelines for water recycling managed aquifer recharge mar guidelines provide a risk based framework for mar scheme development and operation nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009a to ensure health and environmental risks are adequately managed and deemed to be at an acceptably low level of risk 2 2 review of australian mar schemes supporting agriculture a literature review and scheme survey was performed of the status of mar for agriculture in australia and documents the existing available information to illustrate the range of scheme scale and type thirteen examples of mar for agriculture were identified table 1 additional detail provided in the supplementary material which include ten operational schemes with a combined capacity in the order of 70 106 m3 year two currently under feasibility assessment to support development and one trial undertaken in the 1970s one operational scheme was constructed for agricultural water supply in alice springs but has not yet recovered any of the recharged water mar scheme approximate locations recharge type and water source are shown in fig 2 seven operational schemes use infiltration techniques to recharge shallow alluvial aquifers or a palaeochannel feature within an alluvial basin four operational schemes use well injection techniques to recharge confined limestone aquifers end use includes irrigated agriculture horticulture viticulture seawater intrusion barriers and urban water supply including an urban nursery 3 discussion 3 1 quantification of water demand and intended uses a key factor in the development of future viable mar schemes to support the agricultural sector is an understanding of the potential demand for any recovered water the ongoing demand needs to be sufficient to warrant investment in any proposed mar scheme of the existing ten operational mar schemes for agricultural uses table 1 six schemes little para lockyer angas bremer kaurna park aldinga and bolivar have a combined capacity of 19 6 106 m3 year supply water to support high value horticultural production to put this capacity in context total licenced volumes are 0 6 8 9 and 6 5 106 m3 year for the first three listed licences for the other areas are reported across the entire adelaide and mt lofty ranges zone except for little para where recharge releases also serve to mitigate the impact of the dam on urban streamflow and aquifer recharge mar capacity represents 37 67 of licenced volumes and is highly valuable due to the timing of delivery to meet critical irrigation requirements mar that supports high value crops is more likely to be successful given the willingness to pay to cover operating and maintenance costs of the scheme this can be particularly important for ongoing sustainable operations where clogging is identified as a risk vanderzalm et al 2020a existing schemes suggest that high value horticulture producers can afford infiltration and well injection types of mar and use of alternative water sources examples of this include the use of well injection schemes for premium viticulture at aldinga and angus bremer schemes similarly of the existing mar schemes table 2 all are in regions that already predominately use groundwater for agricultural uses often in combination with surface water 64 for irrigation mar schemes in agricultural areas already utilising groundwater require lower initial investment as wells for recovery are already available furthermore maintenance of groundwater levels to improve the resilience of groundwater irrigation supply is an additional benefit of mar drought resilience of fodder crops is another driver for mar this is the case in remote areas such as the recharge weir scheme in minderoo western australia in these remote areas the logistics of transporting livestock to reliable water and food is challenging and expensive the mar scheme allows the farm to recover from drought more quickly by avoiding complete destocking of breeding livestock by irrigating rhodes grass new crops including cavalcade sorghum maize and oats are also set to be trialled in the future 3 2 quantification of the availability of recharge water the availability of water for recharge is a key determinant of the potential size of schemes for example a recent assessment of the potential for mar in the murray darling basin to increase drought resilience produced a first estimate of the order of 4000 106 m3 of additional aquifer storage potential in shallow aquifers close to rivers gonzalez et al 2020 however the availability of water for recharge was revealed to be a tight constraint than the estimated storage capacity of shallow aquifers in this fully allocated surface water system this constraint has also been observed for mar schemes internationally such as in the united states ulibarri et al 2021 mar must be considered across hydrologically connected systems and account for surface water and groundwater entitlements and allocations at the appropriate scales and integration into the local water management plans page et al 2022 sixty four percent of the operational mar schemes for agriculture utilise surface water to recharge using 60 106 m3 year alternative water sources urban stormwater recycled water industrial water should also be considered as a recharge source for future schemes however the cost may be prohibitive especially if the alternative water source is located at a far distance from the agricultural area currently only 36 of operational mar schemes for agriculture use alternative water sources representing 10 106 m3 year table 1 these schemes all require pre treatment prior to recharge to avoid operational issues such as clogging page et al 2014 treatment is also required to protect human health ayuso gabella et al 2011 and environmental risks such as nutrient exports vanderzalm et al 2020b note that water quality treatment prior to recharge significantly increases the cost of a scheme ross and hasnain 2018 clogging is generally caused by poor water quality and can be driven by physical biological and chemical mechanisms clogging occurs to some degree in all mar schemes and requires active management either pre treatment to improve water quality operational strategies such as basin scraping and well backflushing of the australian mar schemes 73 have reported clogging and reported some reduction in efficiency this also reflects the broader international experience where clogging and scheme maintenance have been identified as operational challenges for mar scheme sustainability alam et al 2021 3 3 characterisation of aquifers and confirmation of suitable storage volumes the presence of a suitable aquifer is critical for viable mar schemes the aquifer needs to have an adequate rate of recharge and enough storage capacity to meet demands for the intended uses of the recovered water the aquifer also needs to be capable of retaining the water where it can be recovered for mar schemes meant for agricultural uses alluvial aquifers are considered most suitable indeed fifty five percent of existing schemes in australia target alluvial aquifers and they represent 82 58 106 m3 year of total capacity table 1 alluvial aquifers generally support higher capacity mar schemes e g burdekin 45 106 m3 year callide valley 4 106 m3 year and lockyer valley 6 106 m3 year these infiltration based mar schemes all share similarities in being in areas of low topographic slope with high regolith thickness and available storage space in the aquifer in australia the minimum depth to water table for a mar scheme is 4 m for urban areas and 8 m for rural areas to avoid water logging and soil salinisation nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009b alluvial aquifers that are also located in existing agricultural areas that utilise groundwater irrigation are likely to have enough storage volume to support higher capacity mar schemes this is consistent with international experiences where analysis of 1127 mar schemes shows successful implementation predominantly in sites with sandy clay loam soil and with access to river water for recharge alam et al 2021 groundwater of low salinity and marginally brackish aquifers can be used to maximise the volume of recovered water that is fit for use after fresh recharge water mixes with native groundwater however mar schemes located in brackish aquifers are likely to have reduced recovery efficiencies due to mixing with brackish groundwater which may impact on the usable recovered water volumes below the target salinity suitable for irrigation miotlinski et al 2011 this was observed in the alice springs sat scheme where recharged recycled water mixes with native groundwater and becomes brackish and marginal quality to be used for horticultural irrigation nevertheless the alice springs sat scheme is on going and continues to support urban green space irrigation in the desert town and prevents wastewater discharge to the local environment while infiltration schemes targeting alluvial aquifers with low groundwater salinity are generally preferred for agricultural applications schemes can operate effectively in brackish aquifers as operational procedures can be established to optimise recovery efficiency gonzalez et al 2015 miotlinski et al 2014 the environmental value s of the target aquifer influence the requirements for protection of the aquifer itself this will in turn impact on the economics of the mar scheme for example a target aquifer used for drinking water supply will require that environmental value to be protected beyond the defined attenuation zone of the mar scheme nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009b the aldinga asr scheme supplementary data provides an example where recycled water asr is undertaken in an aquifer that is used for irrigation and a variety of non potable household uses vanderzalm et al 2020b however the proximity to domestic users constrains the boundary of the attenuation zone and subsequently the volume of recycled water that can be stored via mar understanding natural attenuation in the storage zone will allow for a larger attenuation zone and potentially increase future capacity of the scheme page et al 2010b 3 4 suitable location for mar scheme and treatment the location and type of mar scheme table 1 is a key factor in their viability for example the infiltration mar schemes such as alice springs soil aquifer treatment sat using secondary treated wastewater and burdekin using natural river water aquifer storage capacity is required to ensure the target volume of recharge can be achieved this is highly dependent on the rates of recharge that the infiltration schemes can achieve where treatment for recharge water is required e g wetlands ponds or basins are needed to detain enough water to allow for setting of turbidity e g kaurna park aquifer asr or a water treatment plant e g aldinga asr bolivar asr alice springs sat besides space needs to be available for any water treatment infrastructure the suitability of an aquifer recharge area to support mar for agricultural uses is highest for unconfined aquifers in groundwater recharge areas confined aquifers are also potentially suitable but typically result in higher cost schemes due to the need to inject rather than infiltrate water it is important that mar schemes are not located in groundwater discharge areas except for exclusively environmental benefits as it is highly likely they will impact on downstream groundwater dependant ecosystems of the existing mar schemes in table 1 it was assessed that none of them are in groundwater discharge areas 3 5 viable mar economics and policy to support irrigated agriculture mar scheme proponents require a knowledge of hydrogeology and water quality management for the successful design construction and operation of mar schemes this capability is particularly important during mar risk assessment and project development nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009b page et al 2010b also necessary for some mar schemes is expertise in water storage and treatment design hydrology monitoring and reporting long term sustainable mar scheme operation does require maintenance the reduction of recharge rates due to clogging remains one of the greatest challenges for sustainable mar operations dillon et al 2016 73 of the existing mar schemes that support agriculture have reported clogging issues as a key constraint in long term capacity and sustainable operations table 1 finally the economics of mar schemes is critical for them to be viable vanderzalm et al 2022 the unit cost of mar schemes employing infiltration techniques for recharge are generally considerably lower than those using well injection techniques ross and hasnain 2018 infiltration schemes typically have lower cost of construction and do not have high energy needs but soil and vadose zone studies are required over the infiltration area costs depend on infiltration rates which need to be established with pilot scale studies during mar project development nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009b well injection techniques typically require a higher quality of source water to manage clogging risks for schemes using surface water as the source of recharge treatment may be as simple as filtration to reduce suspended solids page et al 2014 compared effectiveness of different treatments to inhibit clogging of asr wells at menindee nsw and found that dissolved organic carbon was just as critical to remove as colloidal clays where recycled water is used in mar water quality treatment requirements increase to manage clogging and to address any health and environmental risks associated with use of recycled water all recycled water mar schemes that support agriculture are operated by urban utilities in australia who have the sufficient capability and capacity to manage the costs of engineered pre treatment levelised costs provide a useful measure comparing recharge options on varying scales on an equivalent basis comparison is made to annualised cost a metric used as a means of comparing different supply options where the unit cost of water is expressed on an equal per unit basis considering an appropriate discount rate an evaluation of 21 mar schemes internationally reported levelised costs of 0 29 m3 for infiltration schemes with surface water 0 67 m3 for injection bore schemes with surface water and 0 22 m3 for injection bore schemes with recycled water ross and hasnain 2018 the influence of water source on cost was also evident in a recent evaluation of international mar schemes ross 2021 where the volume weighted mean levelised cost of eleven schemes recharging natural water by infiltration or wells was 0 23 m3 and for six schemes recharging recycled water by infiltration or wells was considerably higher at 1 08 m3 a summary of published costs for mar schemes is presented in table 2 ross and hasnain 2018 and ross 2021 collected economic information in local currency converted capital costs to 2016 values using a gdp deflator and then converted to 2016usd for this study 2016usd was converted to 2016aud using an average exchange rate of 1 35 and then converted to 2023aud using an average inflation rate of 1 07 webster 2020 by comparison costs of surface water augmentation dams and reservoirs are reported to range from 0 04 to 47 per m3 with a median of 1 4 m3 petheram and mcmahon 2019 although the authors noted that dam construction costs were systematically underestimated compared to surface water augmentation mar offers the advantage of incremental scheme development which can reduce the initial capital and allow investment to be staged to meet expected incomes of agricultural schemes and allow for better estimation of construction costs comparative costs of seawater desalination are reported to range from 0 70 to 33 per m3 wsaa 2020 however it was noted that costs generally range from around 2 to 6 per m3 though several desalination schemes rapidly developed in response to water scarcity in drought were greater than 10 per m3 mar schemes to support agriculture are more economically attractive to high value crop producers such as horticulture production evans et al 2017 evans et al 2017 report that fodder cropping has an annualised benefit of 0 11 m3 whereas mango asian vegetables and melons range between 2 and 10 m3 clearly the intended benefit and crop type is a key consideration in the viability of mar for agriculture for all mar schemes a supportive policy framework is required australia has a long history of state based water legislation and management however in the last 20 years state and territory authorities have invested in water planning with approaches varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and even between regions within jurisdictions given the widely varying scale and nature of both water policy and mar implementation across australia it is not surprising that regulatory oversight of mar schemes is also at varying degrees of development page et al 2022 a common issue for mar schemes internationally concerns water access rights and allocations page et al 2022 ulibarri et al 2021 yet in many jurisdictions in australia the legislation and policies do not guarantee that the mar proponent will have preferential rights to recover the recharged water volume page et al 2022 a potential suitable policy framework for mar has been previously described by ward and dillon 2012 whilst there is a lack of clear recognition of mar in some state policies and legislation there are in general requirements for assessing surface water entitlements and allocations recharge of water to aquifers transfer of water rights and extraction of groundwater a more consistent framework would help to ensure the linkages between recharge and recovery are adequately managed lack of crediting of recharged water volumes may impede mar development until changes are made in individual states and territories page et al 2022 at a basin scale proponents of mar schemes that have a grasp of the value of water and make agricultural decisions based on projected water availability will likely find it commercially attractive to invest in mar then this benefit could potentially be fully appropriated by a small minority in an agricultural area however as water and the storage space in aquifers are common pool resources it is incumbent on state water resource agencies to not only maximise the economic and environmental benefits of mar but also the social benefits by ensuring that mar benefits as wide a community as possible this would uphold principles of equity transparency and fairness of access to critical resources in the presence of water trading arrangements and making use of either the river the aquifer or existing irrigation networks to disperse recovered water it is possible to broaden the beneficiaries beyond those who may be propitiously located hence policies need to be transparent which gives accountable mar operations that demonstrably increase benefits broadly while not disadvantaging other water users nor the environment there would also need to be a means by which such beneficiaries could contribute to mar establishment and operating costs including monitoring and reporting 4 conclusions in australia the history of mar scheme development to support agriculture began in the 1960s there are presently only ten mar schemes in australia for agricultural uses in varying stages of development providing a total capacity of 70 106 m3 year this review of the existing mar schemes for agricultural purposes across australia has facilitated the development of several general principles which are more likely to lead to successful schemes in the future these include presence of high value agriculture mar in agricultural areas that support high value crops are more likely to be economically viable adequate water for recharge the availability of water for recharge may be the tightest constraint for a mar scheme especially in fully allocated surface water systems suitable aquifer for recharge and storage the presence of a suitable aquifer with an adequate rate of recharge enough storage capacity to meet demand and the capability of retaining the stored water for recovery and use is critical for viable mar schemes organisational capability institutional arrangements economics and supportive policy mar scheme proponents require access to capabilities in hydrogeology and water quality management for the successful design construction and operation of mar schemes long term mar scheme operation requires ongoing maintenance particularly to manage clogging understanding and assessing the economics of mar during the development of schemes is critical to ensuring their viability and a supportive policy framework is required to enable effective mar schemes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

benefit mar can potentially increase security of water in drought more economically than new dams can augment existing dams with higher efficiency storage less evaporation augment brackish groundwater desalination schemes and facilitate conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources in australia in 2023 there are currently 10 known operational mar schemes used to increase agricultural activity in varying stages of development providing a total capacity of 70 106 m3 year a review of these australian mar schemes identified several general principles which are more likely to lead to successful implementation including an ongoing demand for water for high value agriculture availability of water for recharge a suitable aquifer for storage with the capacity to store water for recovery and use a suitable location for the mar scheme typically in areas of low topographic relief and the organisational capability institutional arrangements and supportive policies to operate the scheme sustainably and economically if mar schemes are to be developed to support agricultural activity in australia site identification project design economic viability and community and regulator consultation within an investment prospectus will be required operational demonstration schemes in a variety of agricultural settings will encourage wider adoption supportive policy development is required to ensure sustainable and equitable ongoing operation of mar to support irrigated agriculture and for drought resilience graphical abstract ga1 keywords managed aquifer recharge water banking levelized cost data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction variability in water resource availability is a global challenge with broad reaching impacts algur et al 2021 extended drought affects food production and may result in severe economic loss and or even loss of life algur et al 2021 hoque et al 2021 managed aquifer recharge mar is a water resource management strategy that can improve water security and resilience to drought mar is the intentional recharge of water to aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefit nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009a it offers the benefits of providing storage in aquifers which are not subject to evaporative losses balancing seasonal supply and demand by storing water when it is abundant for use in dry periods and contributing to conjunctive use and management of stormwater and groundwater resources despite large areas with low or highly variable rainfall radcliffe and page 2020 agriculture is an important component of the australian economy with 55 of the nation s land contributing approximately aud 43 billion in value abares 2021 nonetheless productivity growth has been affected by climate variability abares 2021 hughes et al 2019 including significant periods of drought such as the millennium drought 2001 2010 and the recent period of prolonged rainfall deficiencies since 2017 http www bom gov au climate drought tabs drought despite the economic importance of agriculture the primary application of mar in australia during the millennium drought was to secure urban water supply and facilitate water recycling radcliffe et al 2017 in australia the history of mar development began in earnest in the 1960s with the development of queensland s lower burdekin scheme to support agriculture with a capacity of 45 106 m3 year charlesworth et al 2002 however compared to urban and mine water management applications mar capacity for agricultural water management in australia has seen relatively little development since that time instead interest in mar has been focused on urban or semi urban situations to either provide for urban water or to assist in reuse of treated wastewater greskowiak et al 2005 and urban stormwater naumann et al 2021 page et al 2010b growth in mar schemes to support agricultural activity in australia has been low iah mar 2018 despite its potential to improve water security during drought feasibility assessments ghd and agt 2011 hostetler 2007 vanderzalm et al 2018 have not translated into significant operational mar capacity while mar capacity in australia grew on average by 3 6 per year from 1965 2015 to 400 106 m3 year approximately 70 106 m3 year of this was for agricultural support dillon et al 2019a the impact of the recent drought on agricultural product hughes et al 2019 and the need to identify new water resources to support economic growth vanderzalm et al 2018 have renewed interest in the potential for mar for agriculture the aim of this study are to 1 document the use of mar within australia s agricultural sector 2 identify key characteristics that lead to viable mar schemes to support agricultural activity in australia identification of these principles to underpin new scheme development can potentially enhance the agricultural sector and increase drought resilience 2 methodology 2 1 managed aquifer recharge mar refers to a suite of methods that can be used to secure groundwater systems under stress and contribute to conjunctive water management dillon et al 2019b those identified as used in mar for agricultural activity are shown in fig 1 nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009a infiltration through permeable sediments can be used to recharge unconfined aquifers infiltration types of mar include in stream and off stream interventions such as recharge reservoir release from upstream dams for infiltration through the downstream streambed recharge weirs percolation tanks check dams which are dams built in ephemeral stream to detain water and enhance infiltration infiltration ponds basins trenches galleries where water is diverted to an offstream storage and subsequent infiltration and soil aquifer treatment which involves intermittent use of infiltration basins in wet and dry cycles to enhance water quality treatment processes injection bore methods can be used where infiltration is restricted by impermeable sediments injection types of mar include aquifer storage and recovery asr where the same bore is used for injection and recovery and aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr where separate bores are used for injection and recovery asr has been used effectively to store fresh water in aquifers with poor quality brackish groundwater whereas astr can be used to enhance water quality treatment within the aquifer in addition any source of available water can be stored via mar for subsequent use the australian guidelines for water recycling managed aquifer recharge mar guidelines provide a risk based framework for mar scheme development and operation nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009a to ensure health and environmental risks are adequately managed and deemed to be at an acceptably low level of risk 2 2 review of australian mar schemes supporting agriculture a literature review and scheme survey was performed of the status of mar for agriculture in australia and documents the existing available information to illustrate the range of scheme scale and type thirteen examples of mar for agriculture were identified table 1 additional detail provided in the supplementary material which include ten operational schemes with a combined capacity in the order of 70 106 m3 year two currently under feasibility assessment to support development and one trial undertaken in the 1970s one operational scheme was constructed for agricultural water supply in alice springs but has not yet recovered any of the recharged water mar scheme approximate locations recharge type and water source are shown in fig 2 seven operational schemes use infiltration techniques to recharge shallow alluvial aquifers or a palaeochannel feature within an alluvial basin four operational schemes use well injection techniques to recharge confined limestone aquifers end use includes irrigated agriculture horticulture viticulture seawater intrusion barriers and urban water supply including an urban nursery 3 discussion 3 1 quantification of water demand and intended uses a key factor in the development of future viable mar schemes to support the agricultural sector is an understanding of the potential demand for any recovered water the ongoing demand needs to be sufficient to warrant investment in any proposed mar scheme of the existing ten operational mar schemes for agricultural uses table 1 six schemes little para lockyer angas bremer kaurna park aldinga and bolivar have a combined capacity of 19 6 106 m3 year supply water to support high value horticultural production to put this capacity in context total licenced volumes are 0 6 8 9 and 6 5 106 m3 year for the first three listed licences for the other areas are reported across the entire adelaide and mt lofty ranges zone except for little para where recharge releases also serve to mitigate the impact of the dam on urban streamflow and aquifer recharge mar capacity represents 37 67 of licenced volumes and is highly valuable due to the timing of delivery to meet critical irrigation requirements mar that supports high value crops is more likely to be successful given the willingness to pay to cover operating and maintenance costs of the scheme this can be particularly important for ongoing sustainable operations where clogging is identified as a risk vanderzalm et al 2020a existing schemes suggest that high value horticulture producers can afford infiltration and well injection types of mar and use of alternative water sources examples of this include the use of well injection schemes for premium viticulture at aldinga and angus bremer schemes similarly of the existing mar schemes table 2 all are in regions that already predominately use groundwater for agricultural uses often in combination with surface water 64 for irrigation mar schemes in agricultural areas already utilising groundwater require lower initial investment as wells for recovery are already available furthermore maintenance of groundwater levels to improve the resilience of groundwater irrigation supply is an additional benefit of mar drought resilience of fodder crops is another driver for mar this is the case in remote areas such as the recharge weir scheme in minderoo western australia in these remote areas the logistics of transporting livestock to reliable water and food is challenging and expensive the mar scheme allows the farm to recover from drought more quickly by avoiding complete destocking of breeding livestock by irrigating rhodes grass new crops including cavalcade sorghum maize and oats are also set to be trialled in the future 3 2 quantification of the availability of recharge water the availability of water for recharge is a key determinant of the potential size of schemes for example a recent assessment of the potential for mar in the murray darling basin to increase drought resilience produced a first estimate of the order of 4000 106 m3 of additional aquifer storage potential in shallow aquifers close to rivers gonzalez et al 2020 however the availability of water for recharge was revealed to be a tight constraint than the estimated storage capacity of shallow aquifers in this fully allocated surface water system this constraint has also been observed for mar schemes internationally such as in the united states ulibarri et al 2021 mar must be considered across hydrologically connected systems and account for surface water and groundwater entitlements and allocations at the appropriate scales and integration into the local water management plans page et al 2022 sixty four percent of the operational mar schemes for agriculture utilise surface water to recharge using 60 106 m3 year alternative water sources urban stormwater recycled water industrial water should also be considered as a recharge source for future schemes however the cost may be prohibitive especially if the alternative water source is located at a far distance from the agricultural area currently only 36 of operational mar schemes for agriculture use alternative water sources representing 10 106 m3 year table 1 these schemes all require pre treatment prior to recharge to avoid operational issues such as clogging page et al 2014 treatment is also required to protect human health ayuso gabella et al 2011 and environmental risks such as nutrient exports vanderzalm et al 2020b note that water quality treatment prior to recharge significantly increases the cost of a scheme ross and hasnain 2018 clogging is generally caused by poor water quality and can be driven by physical biological and chemical mechanisms clogging occurs to some degree in all mar schemes and requires active management either pre treatment to improve water quality operational strategies such as basin scraping and well backflushing of the australian mar schemes 73 have reported clogging and reported some reduction in efficiency this also reflects the broader international experience where clogging and scheme maintenance have been identified as operational challenges for mar scheme sustainability alam et al 2021 3 3 characterisation of aquifers and confirmation of suitable storage volumes the presence of a suitable aquifer is critical for viable mar schemes the aquifer needs to have an adequate rate of recharge and enough storage capacity to meet demands for the intended uses of the recovered water the aquifer also needs to be capable of retaining the water where it can be recovered for mar schemes meant for agricultural uses alluvial aquifers are considered most suitable indeed fifty five percent of existing schemes in australia target alluvial aquifers and they represent 82 58 106 m3 year of total capacity table 1 alluvial aquifers generally support higher capacity mar schemes e g burdekin 45 106 m3 year callide valley 4 106 m3 year and lockyer valley 6 106 m3 year these infiltration based mar schemes all share similarities in being in areas of low topographic slope with high regolith thickness and available storage space in the aquifer in australia the minimum depth to water table for a mar scheme is 4 m for urban areas and 8 m for rural areas to avoid water logging and soil salinisation nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009b alluvial aquifers that are also located in existing agricultural areas that utilise groundwater irrigation are likely to have enough storage volume to support higher capacity mar schemes this is consistent with international experiences where analysis of 1127 mar schemes shows successful implementation predominantly in sites with sandy clay loam soil and with access to river water for recharge alam et al 2021 groundwater of low salinity and marginally brackish aquifers can be used to maximise the volume of recovered water that is fit for use after fresh recharge water mixes with native groundwater however mar schemes located in brackish aquifers are likely to have reduced recovery efficiencies due to mixing with brackish groundwater which may impact on the usable recovered water volumes below the target salinity suitable for irrigation miotlinski et al 2011 this was observed in the alice springs sat scheme where recharged recycled water mixes with native groundwater and becomes brackish and marginal quality to be used for horticultural irrigation nevertheless the alice springs sat scheme is on going and continues to support urban green space irrigation in the desert town and prevents wastewater discharge to the local environment while infiltration schemes targeting alluvial aquifers with low groundwater salinity are generally preferred for agricultural applications schemes can operate effectively in brackish aquifers as operational procedures can be established to optimise recovery efficiency gonzalez et al 2015 miotlinski et al 2014 the environmental value s of the target aquifer influence the requirements for protection of the aquifer itself this will in turn impact on the economics of the mar scheme for example a target aquifer used for drinking water supply will require that environmental value to be protected beyond the defined attenuation zone of the mar scheme nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009b the aldinga asr scheme supplementary data provides an example where recycled water asr is undertaken in an aquifer that is used for irrigation and a variety of non potable household uses vanderzalm et al 2020b however the proximity to domestic users constrains the boundary of the attenuation zone and subsequently the volume of recycled water that can be stored via mar understanding natural attenuation in the storage zone will allow for a larger attenuation zone and potentially increase future capacity of the scheme page et al 2010b 3 4 suitable location for mar scheme and treatment the location and type of mar scheme table 1 is a key factor in their viability for example the infiltration mar schemes such as alice springs soil aquifer treatment sat using secondary treated wastewater and burdekin using natural river water aquifer storage capacity is required to ensure the target volume of recharge can be achieved this is highly dependent on the rates of recharge that the infiltration schemes can achieve where treatment for recharge water is required e g wetlands ponds or basins are needed to detain enough water to allow for setting of turbidity e g kaurna park aquifer asr or a water treatment plant e g aldinga asr bolivar asr alice springs sat besides space needs to be available for any water treatment infrastructure the suitability of an aquifer recharge area to support mar for agricultural uses is highest for unconfined aquifers in groundwater recharge areas confined aquifers are also potentially suitable but typically result in higher cost schemes due to the need to inject rather than infiltrate water it is important that mar schemes are not located in groundwater discharge areas except for exclusively environmental benefits as it is highly likely they will impact on downstream groundwater dependant ecosystems of the existing mar schemes in table 1 it was assessed that none of them are in groundwater discharge areas 3 5 viable mar economics and policy to support irrigated agriculture mar scheme proponents require a knowledge of hydrogeology and water quality management for the successful design construction and operation of mar schemes this capability is particularly important during mar risk assessment and project development nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009b page et al 2010b also necessary for some mar schemes is expertise in water storage and treatment design hydrology monitoring and reporting long term sustainable mar scheme operation does require maintenance the reduction of recharge rates due to clogging remains one of the greatest challenges for sustainable mar operations dillon et al 2016 73 of the existing mar schemes that support agriculture have reported clogging issues as a key constraint in long term capacity and sustainable operations table 1 finally the economics of mar schemes is critical for them to be viable vanderzalm et al 2022 the unit cost of mar schemes employing infiltration techniques for recharge are generally considerably lower than those using well injection techniques ross and hasnain 2018 infiltration schemes typically have lower cost of construction and do not have high energy needs but soil and vadose zone studies are required over the infiltration area costs depend on infiltration rates which need to be established with pilot scale studies during mar project development nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009b well injection techniques typically require a higher quality of source water to manage clogging risks for schemes using surface water as the source of recharge treatment may be as simple as filtration to reduce suspended solids page et al 2014 compared effectiveness of different treatments to inhibit clogging of asr wells at menindee nsw and found that dissolved organic carbon was just as critical to remove as colloidal clays where recycled water is used in mar water quality treatment requirements increase to manage clogging and to address any health and environmental risks associated with use of recycled water all recycled water mar schemes that support agriculture are operated by urban utilities in australia who have the sufficient capability and capacity to manage the costs of engineered pre treatment levelised costs provide a useful measure comparing recharge options on varying scales on an equivalent basis comparison is made to annualised cost a metric used as a means of comparing different supply options where the unit cost of water is expressed on an equal per unit basis considering an appropriate discount rate an evaluation of 21 mar schemes internationally reported levelised costs of 0 29 m3 for infiltration schemes with surface water 0 67 m3 for injection bore schemes with surface water and 0 22 m3 for injection bore schemes with recycled water ross and hasnain 2018 the influence of water source on cost was also evident in a recent evaluation of international mar schemes ross 2021 where the volume weighted mean levelised cost of eleven schemes recharging natural water by infiltration or wells was 0 23 m3 and for six schemes recharging recycled water by infiltration or wells was considerably higher at 1 08 m3 a summary of published costs for mar schemes is presented in table 2 ross and hasnain 2018 and ross 2021 collected economic information in local currency converted capital costs to 2016 values using a gdp deflator and then converted to 2016usd for this study 2016usd was converted to 2016aud using an average exchange rate of 1 35 and then converted to 2023aud using an average inflation rate of 1 07 webster 2020 by comparison costs of surface water augmentation dams and reservoirs are reported to range from 0 04 to 47 per m3 with a median of 1 4 m3 petheram and mcmahon 2019 although the authors noted that dam construction costs were systematically underestimated compared to surface water augmentation mar offers the advantage of incremental scheme development which can reduce the initial capital and allow investment to be staged to meet expected incomes of agricultural schemes and allow for better estimation of construction costs comparative costs of seawater desalination are reported to range from 0 70 to 33 per m3 wsaa 2020 however it was noted that costs generally range from around 2 to 6 per m3 though several desalination schemes rapidly developed in response to water scarcity in drought were greater than 10 per m3 mar schemes to support agriculture are more economically attractive to high value crop producers such as horticulture production evans et al 2017 evans et al 2017 report that fodder cropping has an annualised benefit of 0 11 m3 whereas mango asian vegetables and melons range between 2 and 10 m3 clearly the intended benefit and crop type is a key consideration in the viability of mar for agriculture for all mar schemes a supportive policy framework is required australia has a long history of state based water legislation and management however in the last 20 years state and territory authorities have invested in water planning with approaches varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and even between regions within jurisdictions given the widely varying scale and nature of both water policy and mar implementation across australia it is not surprising that regulatory oversight of mar schemes is also at varying degrees of development page et al 2022 a common issue for mar schemes internationally concerns water access rights and allocations page et al 2022 ulibarri et al 2021 yet in many jurisdictions in australia the legislation and policies do not guarantee that the mar proponent will have preferential rights to recover the recharged water volume page et al 2022 a potential suitable policy framework for mar has been previously described by ward and dillon 2012 whilst there is a lack of clear recognition of mar in some state policies and legislation there are in general requirements for assessing surface water entitlements and allocations recharge of water to aquifers transfer of water rights and extraction of groundwater a more consistent framework would help to ensure the linkages between recharge and recovery are adequately managed lack of crediting of recharged water volumes may impede mar development until changes are made in individual states and territories page et al 2022 at a basin scale proponents of mar schemes that have a grasp of the value of water and make agricultural decisions based on projected water availability will likely find it commercially attractive to invest in mar then this benefit could potentially be fully appropriated by a small minority in an agricultural area however as water and the storage space in aquifers are common pool resources it is incumbent on state water resource agencies to not only maximise the economic and environmental benefits of mar but also the social benefits by ensuring that mar benefits as wide a community as possible this would uphold principles of equity transparency and fairness of access to critical resources in the presence of water trading arrangements and making use of either the river the aquifer or existing irrigation networks to disperse recovered water it is possible to broaden the beneficiaries beyond those who may be propitiously located hence policies need to be transparent which gives accountable mar operations that demonstrably increase benefits broadly while not disadvantaging other water users nor the environment there would also need to be a means by which such beneficiaries could contribute to mar establishment and operating costs including monitoring and reporting 4 conclusions in australia the history of mar scheme development to support agriculture began in the 1960s there are presently only ten mar schemes in australia for agricultural uses in varying stages of development providing a total capacity of 70 106 m3 year this review of the existing mar schemes for agricultural purposes across australia has facilitated the development of several general principles which are more likely to lead to successful schemes in the future these include presence of high value agriculture mar in agricultural areas that support high value crops are more likely to be economically viable adequate water for recharge the availability of water for recharge may be the tightest constraint for a mar scheme especially in fully allocated surface water systems suitable aquifer for recharge and storage the presence of a suitable aquifer with an adequate rate of recharge enough storage capacity to meet demand and the capability of retaining the stored water for recovery and use is critical for viable mar schemes organisational capability institutional arrangements economics and supportive policy mar scheme proponents require access to capabilities in hydrogeology and water quality management for the successful design construction and operation of mar schemes long term mar scheme operation requires ongoing maintenance particularly to manage clogging understanding and assessing the economics of mar during the development of schemes is critical to ensuring their viability and a supportive policy framework is required to enable effective mar schemes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8898,rising co2 concentration in the atmosphere may modulate the response of plants to water and nitrogen and the existing research is not sufficient to support the fine management of water and nitrogen under co2 rise to determine the optimal water and nitrogen strategy for melon production under co2 enrichment in the future we conducted an experiment with 12 treatments over three growing seasons the effects of water nitrogen coupling on the yield quality and water nitrogen use efficiency of oriental melon cucumis melo l qianyu no 6 under co2 enrichment were investigated and evaluated comprehensively the treatments included two co2 concentrations c1 400 ppm and c2 800 ppm three irrigation levels i1 80 evaporation ep i2 100 ep and i3 120 ep two nitrogen levels n1 s 184 77 kg ha 1 f 147 21 kg ha 1 and n2 s 369 54 kg ha 1 f 294 42 kg ha 1 the result showed that the yield increased with increasing levels of irrigation and nitrogen and enriched co2 significantly increased the yield by 10 3 22 9 n2 showed a significant promoting effect on the ratio of marketable fruit in the two spring seasons enriched co2 significantly increased free amino acid of i1 c2 coupled with i1 significantly reduced nitrate content by 30 9 14 9 in 2020 f and 2021 s respectively the interaction of c i was significant in irrigation water use efficiency iwue and nitrogen use efficiency nue in particular c2 coupled with i2 increased iwue by 40 5 18 7 and nue by 43 9 13 9 in the two spring seasons respectively ten indicators from three categories of yield quality and efficiency were used to establish the evaluation system of melon and were comprehensively evaluated based on fuzzy borda model combined three single models based on the combined evaluation model intermediate irrigation combined with higher nitrogen input was best for melon production under co2 enrichment this finding suggested that melon sustainable production should control irrigation and adequately increase nitrogen fertilizer to trade off fruit quality and efficiency for the expected future higher co2 concentrations graphical abstract ga1 keywords water and nitrogen coupling melon fruit yield quality co2 enrichment combined evaluation model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays the concentration of carbon dioxide co2 in the atmosphere reached at 420 ppm and would reach 800 1000 ppm at the end of the 21st century because of the continued increase in co2 emission ipcc 2013 although elevated co2 concentrations have a negative impact on the natural environment they can be beneficial to agricultural production co2 is an important carbon source for the plant photosynthetic process and growth especially for greenhouse production co2 supplementation is often required to maintain crop growth elevated co2 could significantly increase the melon yield by increasing photosynthesis activities and dry matter accumulation mavrogianopoulos et al 1999 under increasing co2 concentration conditions n and irrigation schemes appeared different regulatory effects on plant growth low n coupling elevated co2 led to nutrient deficiency because of reduction in the xylem size which affected the growth performance and nutritional value of tomatoes whereas increasing n fertilization could modulate this deficiency and promote plant photosynthesis status halpern et al 2019 lenka et al 2020 elevated co2 combined with moderate n fertilization was the best for promoting cucumber fruit quality dong et al 2018b under elevated co2 conditions n supply could be a key contributing factor to wheat grain yield liu et al 2019 elevated co2 could alleviate the reduction of growth performance in grapevine under water deficit kizildeniz et al 2015 and significantly improve the growth and photosynthetic performance of sweet peppers tomatoes and melons under water stress or salinity status del amor et al 2010 mavrogianopoulos et al 1999 yan et al 2021 as well as tomato fruit quality yang et al 2020 also increasing co2 concentration could improve the water use efficiency of cocoa under water deficit to meet future climate change conditions hebbar et al 2019 and the same results were also reported in potatoes and watermelons hong et al 2021 yi et al 2019 melon cucumis melo l is among the most important horticultural plants in china and rapid technological development has been achieved in melon production in recent years its yield ranks the first in the world with the higher growth rate than that of the planting area as a plant that has an intensive need for water yield and quality of melon would be inhibited by lack of water during the production season therefore the use of water resources with high efficiency is important for melon production water nitrogen coupling has a significant effect on melon production higher yield and better quality were obtained at irrigation dose of approximately 90 etc and when the n levels were reduced to 90 kg ha 1 in combination with more frequent irrigation in melon cultivation cabello et al 2009 sensoy et al 2007 applying 120 etc at the blooming fruiting stage and 150 etc at fruit expansion stage could have a positive effect on melon sugar content and reduce nitrate content accumulation ren et al 2021 adequate water and n input could significantly increase yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency in vegetable production he et al 2021a yang et al 2017 however co2 enrichment could lead to a decrease in nitrogen absorption affecting the nitrogen nutrition condition of plants and causing yield losses cohen et al 2019 adequate nitrogen nutrition was essential for maintaining the yield under co2 enrichment li et al 2018 these studies provide an effective theoretical basis for the management of water and nitrogen under elevated co2 conditions but systematic research on the interaction of elevated co2 water and nitrogen as well as the crop effects is still lacking therefore experiments involving water nitrogen coupled with different co2 concentrations are needed to determine a suitable irrigation nitrogen scheme that can support melon production for further to satisfactory agricultural practice under future climatic conditions different water and nitrogen conditions have different effects on the growth of melon even the same conditions have different effects on yield and fruit quality indicators li et al 2021 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2011 therefore a scientific comprehensive evaluation based on reasonable consideration of multiple types of indicators is the key to obtaining the final optimization scheme many scholars have established multi index analysis models using comprehensive evaluation methods fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fuzzy ahp principal component analysis pca technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and gray relation analysis gra have been applied to multi objective optimization such as water fertilizer regimes and ecological assessment however different single evaluation methods are limited in their comprehensive judgment of objective facts due to different mechanisms and angles of observation of information resulting in inconsistent results of different evaluation methods li et al 2021 fuzzy borda is a combination evaluation method that considers the evaluation score of each single method this could increase the superiority and rationality of evaluation results hao chen 2010 zhu et al 2022 this strategy can overcome the bias of the results from single type indicator and single evaluation method and can support the decision system of melon production at different co2 concentrations in northwestern china the aims of this research were as follows 1 to investigate the effects water nitrogen coupling under co2 enrichment on yield quality and water nitrogen use efficiency indicators of melon 2 to construct a comprehensive evaluation system for melon production and explore the performance of all treatments based on the fuzzy borda evaluation model and 3 to analyze the regulatory effect of water nitrogen coupling at different co2 concentrations based on the comprehensive evaluation and determine the optimal water and nitrogen schedule under co2 enrichment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites and plant materials the experiment was

the air temperature and relative humidity were controlled to ideal range fig 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment manipulated three factors co2 concentration irrigation and nitrogen application a randomized split plot design was adopted co2 concentration co2 was the main plot irrigation water amount irrigation was the subplot and nitrogen application nitrogen was the re subplot a total of 12 treatments were conducted in two greenhouses for three consecutive crop seasons in 2020 and 2021 as follows two co2 concentrations of c1 400 ppm and c2 800 ppm three irrigation levels of i1 80

automatic gas supplement system for each greenhouse the sensor monitored the co2 concentration in real time and the single chip microcomputer controlled the solenoid valve of the co2 cylinder according to the actual co2 concentration to keep it at the experimental design level the irrigation volume was calculated according to the penman monteith formula recommended by fao 56 pereira et al 2015 the simplified formula used to calculate the amount of irrigation was as follows 1 i a ep kcp where i is the amount of irrigation a is the surface area of the pot ep is measured by the cumulative evaporation of ф20cm standard evaporating pan and kcp is the evaporation pan coefficient 1 05 at flowering stage fruit setting stage and the middle stage of the fruiting 0 75 at the final stage of the fruiting allen et al 1998 terceiro neto et al 2021 the amount of nitrogen applied was determined based on the needed amount of nitrogen for a melon plant during its lifetime minus the amount of nitrogen present in the substrate and nutrient solution n1 amount was calculated by target yield method wang et al 2008 the main calculation formula of the target yield method in this experiment is as follows 2 ty 1 n y where ty refers to the target yield kg ha 1 n is the rate of increase facility vegetable crops are usually 30 and y is the average yield in the previous 3 years kg ha 1 3 u ty nt where u is the nutrients required for planned yield kg and nt is the nitrogen content needed to form 1000 kg of melon usually 2 5 kg 4 n u ns c r where n is the nitrogen fertilizer content required for the target yield kg ha 1 ns is the nitrogen content of the test substrate kg ha 1 c is the effective nutrient content of the nitrogen fertilizer the nitrogen fertilizer in this experiment is nh4no3 and its nutrient content is 33 34 and r is the nitrogen use efficiency the utilization efficiency of nh4no3 is 65 twelve pots were planted for each treatment with three replicates and one melon plant was planted per pot with a minimum spacing of 50 cm between pots to ensure that the melon plants get sufficient nutrition during the whole growth period the same amount of nutrient solution was applied to each treatment table 1 shows the specific irrigation and nitrogen amounts in the three growing seasons 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 fruit yield one fruit was left per plant fan et al 2019 ren et

described by xiao et al 2012 2 4 3 calculation of combined evaluation score of fuzzy borda model the pre compatibility test was performed on the ranking results obtained by the three single evaluation methods that is the kendall w consistency tests zhu et al 2022 the goodness of membership of each evaluation method score was calculated as follows 9 μ ij u ij min u ij max u ij min u ij 0 9 0 1 where u ij is the score for ith treatment of jth evaluation method and μ ij is the membership degree for the ith treatment evaluated by jth evaluation method as good next fuzzy frequency w hi was defined as

nitrogen application significantly decreased tssc by 17 5 8 2 and 14 3 in the three seasons respectively among all treatments t3 c1 i2 n1 achieved the highest tssc in 2020 s and ranked second in 2020 f and in 2021 s following t6 c1 i3 n2 and t5 c1 i3 n1 respectively fig 4 for nutrition quality indicators enriched co2 had significant improving effects on all four indicators of soluble protein sp free amino acid faa vitamin c vc and nitrate content nc in the three growing seasons table 3 especially enriched co2 significantly increased faa of i1 by 17 0 17 9 and 14 9 in the three seasons and significantly increased sp of n1 by 16 8 in 2020 f irrigation had a significant effect on all nutrition indicators except sp and faa of 2021 s i1 achieved the highest sp values in 2020 f whereas i2 and i3 achieved better vc table 3 the effects of irrigation on faa were inconsistent and the best faas were obtained with i2 in 2020 s and i1 in 2020 f respectively nitrogen significantly affected faa in the two spring seasons with 36 4 11 6 higher in n1 than that in n2 the lowest nc was observed with i3 in 2020 s and 2021 s while i2 in 2020 s respectively table 3 the interactions of c i and i n were significant for vc and nc in particular c2 coupled with i2 significantly improved vc by 31 1 22 6 in 2020 s 2021 s respectively and c2 coupled with i1 significantly reduced nc by 30 9 14 9 in 2020 f and 2021 s respectively the interaction of c n was only significant for faa and c2 coupled with n1 performed better in both spring growing seasons sp and vc were affected by c i n interaction table 3 fig 5 the largest sp and vc were achieved in t12 and t10 c2 i3 n2 and c2 i2 n2 in both spring growing seasons whereas t7 and t11 c2 i1 n1 and c2 i3 n1 achieved the largest faa in 2020 s 2021 s respectively in 2020 f the largest sp and faa were observed in t8 c2 i1 n2 t11 c2 i3 n1 achieved the largest vc meanwhile the lowest nc was observed in t9 c2 i2 n1 of 2020 s while t7 c2 i1 n1 in the other two study seasons fig 5 3 3 the effect of water nitrogen coupling on melon irrigation water and nitrogen use efficiency under co2 enrichment iwue and nue were significantly affected by the three single experimental factors table 4 enriched co2 significantly increased irrigation water use efficiency iwue and nitrogen use efficiency nue especially in 2020 s these were significantly higher by 21 7 and 22 2 at c2 respectively iwue under i2 and i3 was significantly higher than when i1 was implemented and there was no significant deference between i2 and i3 in 2020 s and 2020 f table 4 with increasing irrigation amount nue increased and was best at i3 when n2 was applied iwue increased whereas nue decreased the interaction of c i was significant in iwue and nue in particular c2coupled with i2 significantly increased iwue by 40 5 18 7 and nue by 43 9 13 9 in the two spring seasons respectively among all treatments t10 c2 i2 n2 achieved the largest iwue in all growing seasons whereas t9 t5 and t11 resulted in the best nue in the three study seasons respectively table 4 and fig 6 3 4 comprehensive evaluation of melon production based on fuzzy borda considering the yield quality and efficiency a comprehensive evaluation system for melons with 10 indicators was constructed based on the ahp method the subjective weights of criterion layer were 0 4676 in yield 0 3388 in quality and 0 1986 in water and nitrogen use table 5 for the indicator layer the indicator with the largest subjective weight was yield 0 3507 and sp exhibited the lowest subjective weight of 0 0373 for the objective weights faa achieved the highest value of 0 2218 in 2020 s and nue showed the highest in 2020 f and 2021 s respectively the lowest objective weights were observed in rmf sp and faa in the three study seasons respectively based on the game theory yield achieved the highest combined weight of 0 2549 0 336 and 0 2942 in the three growing seasons nc sp and faa obtained the lowest combined weights in 2020 s 2020 f and 2021 s respectively for the evaluation system comprising yield quality and efficiency the comprehensive scores and ranking based on the three single evaluation model of fuzzy ahp topsis and gra are illustrated in table 6 in 2020 s t10 was the best treatment according to fuzzy ahp and topsis whereas t12 obtained the highest score based on gra in 2020 f the best performances in fuzzy ahp topsis and gra were achieved in t9 t6 and t10 respectively in 2021 s the best performances in the three single evaluation methods were all achieved in t10 of the ambient co2 concentrations t5 led to the best performance in the three single evaluation methods in both spring study seasons whereas t6 had the highest score in 2020 f the evaluation results of different methods were inconsistent therefore fuzzy borda model was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the treatments based on the three single evaluation results and t10 was the best across the study seasons whereas t1 and t2 were the bottom two of all the three growing seasons tables s2 and 6 4 discussion 4 1 effects of water nitrogen coupling on the yield performance of melon under enriched co2 concentrations enriched co2 significantly increased melon yield which was consistent with the results obtained for several horticultural crops such as cherry tomato watermelon cucumber and melon dong et al 2018b karim et al 2020 mavrogianopoulos et al 1999 enriched co2 significantly increased the rmf of melon and the same result was also found in strawberries hidaka et al 2022 in the three growing seasons the effect of irrigation on rmf was different in spring growing seasons adequate increase in irrigation promoted rmf due to the readjustment in hydraulic conductivity and growth activity of roots very fine roots and root hairs under high irrigation amount sharma et al 2018 co2 enrichment coupled with i3 produced the lowest rmf in 2020 f because high irrigation with warm temperature could induce root diseases during fruit expanding stage in autumn fig 1 and finally affected the formation of marketable fruit gruda 2005 pivonia et al 2004 the interaction of c i was significant on yield the highest yield was obtained under enriched co2 with high irrigation but enriched co2 had the most significant boost on yield at medium irrigation co2 enrichment modulated water requirement for yield formation of melon in different growing seasons low irrigation decreased melon yield which may be due to water deficit affecting ps ii system and nutrient metabolism ultimately restricting plant development wakchaure et al 2023a this is likely due to the fact that co2 enrichment could modulate the leaf transpiration rate and improve water use efficiency thereby protecting against the adverse effect of reducing irrigation van der kooi et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 c n was insignificant for melon yield in both spring seasons which was inconsistent with the former study about the response of plant functional traits to nitrogen enrichment under climate change guo et al 2022 firstly it may be due to the different sensitivity of herbaceous plant like melon and the crop plant such as wheat or rice to increasing nitrogen inputs next n and co2 enrichment would produce antagonistic reaction under higher temperature conditions which may impact the positive performance of increasing n input in the spring experiment t 28 guo et al 2022 therefore global warming may influence the positive effect of co2 enrichment in the future which deserves more attention and consideration 4 2 effects of water nitrogen coupling on the quality performance of melon under enriched co2 concentrations tssc was negatively affected by high co2 which was inconsistent with the study on watermelon hong et al 2021 leaf photosynthetic activity could increase under co2 enrichment but the main photosynthesis product in leaf was starch tssc was not increased in fruit possibly due to the fact that starch was not degraded into soluble sugars and transported into the fruit xia et al 2013 also this may be related to the dilution effect high irrigation in co2 enrichment could produce more total non structural carbohydrates starch fructan sucrose etc marcheafave et al 2020 the increasing fruit dry biomass amount could dilute the growing amount of quality contents lahoz et al 2016 enriched co2 significantly improved tss under low irrigation conditions in 2020 f which may be due to the fact that co2 enrichment and reducing irrigation could modulate aba and then adjust the bio activities of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes thereby increasing tss content of fruit ruan et al 2010 yang et al 2020 with the increase of irrigation tss decreased in spring growing seasons which may be due to over irrigation leading to the depletion of soluble carbohydrate by altering the balance between carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis wakchaure et al 2023b decreasing nitrogen application rate could lead to better tss and this finding was the same as that of hong et al 2021 adequate nitrogen application is important to promote the increase in quality indicators but over input of nitrogen fertilizer could impact water transport from root to leaf and assimilate the net photosynthesis products to contribute to fruit quality enriched co2 significantly increased sp faa and vc of nutrition quality which was consistent with the results of studies on cherry tomato watermelon and cucumber dong et al 2018a hong et al 2021 karim et al 2020 co2 enrichment could promote rubisco enzyme activities and increase net photosynthetic rate it could modulate the photosynthesis energy assimilation to chemical energy to improve the important quality indicators li et al 2008 similarly the nc of melon fruit was decreasing by co2 enrichment which was also reported in previous studies on cucumber dong et al 2018b this finding might be due to the increased nitrate reductase activity under enriched co2 fonseca et al 1997 co2 enrichment significantly decreased nc of i1 and increased faa and sp of i1 in 2020 f which illustrated that enriched co2 had a positive effect on quality improvement of low irrigation in autumn growing season by converting inorganic nitrogen compounds to organic nitrogen compounds fig 5 the nitrate content was affected by irrigation which illustrated that low irrigation could promote no3 accumulation in fruit this finding may stem from the fact that deficit irrigation could accelerate nitrate status n accumulation in the upper soil layer and result in excessive absorption of nitrogen in plants kirnak et al 2005 meanwhile adequately increasing irrigation amount could improve vc as reported by wang et al 2017 because reasonable irrigation water supplement could result in good photosynthetic status for plant energy which in turn affects synthetic quality contents such as vc ren et al 2021 therefore low irrigation was not good for all quality indicators high n input could not achieve better quality performance in melon enriched co2 promoted the increase of sp and faa under low n application in 2020 f which indicated that co2 enrichment could boost the positive effect of adequate nitrogen fertilization possibly enriched co2 could alleviate the effect of low nitrogen on chloroplast development for improving the photosynthesis of leaf and quality of fruit dong et al 2018b therefore controlling n fertilizer application in reasonable scope coupling is important for balancing yield increase and maintaining fruit quality our study demonstrates co2 enrichment could partly improve the nutrition quality of melon which was different from the results of quality downregulation of plant under higher co2 dong et al 2022 zaghdoud et al 2016 firstly some study had not focused on improving the nitrogen nutrition status of crops with co2 enrichment while n demand was higher under co2 enrichment environment dong et al 2020 fig 5 next enriched co2 could affect crop energy distribution and ultimately affect processes such as dry matter distribution li et al 2020a li et al 2020b shin et al 2022 found that the efficiency of co2 enrichment on sweet pepper gradually decreased due to the restricted leaf area expansion caused by excessive photosynthate partition to fruits therefore the adequate control of melon fruit number of one plant in the experiment may partly increase the quality of melon finally co2 enrichment could promotes metabolic processes by increasing disease resistance thus improving quality hao et al 2020 above all would further support the conclusion that enriched co2 improves the quality of melons 4 3 effects of water nitrogen coupling on the water and nitrogen use efficiency of melon at enriched co2 concentrations enriched co2 significantly increased iwue as reported in wei et al 2018b and this was attribute to two reasons co2 enrichment could promote the increase of photosynthetic activity and produce more starch to contribute to fruit yield kizildeniz et al 2015 then the leaf instantaneous water use efficiency was decreased by the triggering of stomatal closure which could transport the aba signal to the root system to modulate the whole plant s water utilization zheng et al 2020 meanwhile nue was increased by enriched co2 but this result was inconsistent with the result that co2 had insignificant effect on the nue of cherry tomato wei et al 2018b possibly melon had different nitrogen use characteristics nitrogen fertilizer form may affect nue performance at different co2 concentrations zaghdoud et al 2016 nue increased with increasing irrigation which was consistent with the results of a former study cheng et al 2021 in this study c i interaction increased the iwue and nue enriched co2 reduced plant water use demand to maintain yield and resulted in the increase of iwue under low irrigation conditions kimball 2016 in spring growing seasons the highest iwue was achieved in intermediate irrigation amount which was consistent with the former report wakchaure et al 2023a additionally i n interaction had a significant effect on nue in 2020 s and 2020 f thus improving water conditions can promote the absorption and use of nitrogen fertilizer by plants 4 4 effects of different comprehensive evaluation methods on the evaluation results of melon for achieving the best performances in terms of melon yield quality and water nitrogen utilization the best water nitrogen schedule was inconsistent meanwhile in different growing seasons melon plants had different responses to the irrigation and nitrogen strategies the results confirmed the need for establishing an index that could comprehensively reflect melon fruit yield quality and water nitrogen use efficiency fuzzy ahp topsis and gra are effective methods for comprehensive evaluation he et al 2021b wang et al 2015 wang et al 2021b however the results obtained by using the different methods were inconsistent as reflected in our study s findings fuzzy borda combined method was used to evaluate the comprehensive performance of melon production this model could integrate the ranking and score values of the results of each single evaluation method which could make the results more objective by overcome the shortcoming of inconsistent conclusions of an independent evaluation model zhu et al 2022 based on fuzzy borda model the best treatment was t10 c2 i2 n2 in all growing seasons which was inconsistent with optimal results of reducing irrigation amount and increasing nitrogen application under elevated co2 in tomato research wang et al 2015 wei et al 2018a this may due to the fact that the previous study mainly considered comprehensive quality while in our study yield quality and water and nitrogen use efficiency indicators were weighted comprehensively in ambient co2 the best comprehensive treatments in the three growing seasons all occurred under i3 input t5 and t6 which was the same as the previous study on the effect of irrigation and nitrogen schemes for watermelon production hong et al 2022 enriched co2 could improve water use efficiency and reduced irrigation amount can achieve the best melon performance by improving photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation this was the same in the three growing seasons t10 this result indicated that co2 enrichment could improve the consistency of melon comprehensive performance across seasons however the climatic condition and cultivation patterns will affect the application amounts of water and nitrogen in actual production and further physiological evidence is still needed to demonstrate the synergistic effect of high co2 concentration with apparent water and nitrogen input amount in melon 5 conclusions enriched co2 significantly increased the ratio of marketable fruit rmf of low irrigation by 35 5 in 2020 s enriched co2 improved the quality indicator of low irrigation especially for free amino acid faa and total soluble solids tss in 2020 f co2 enrichment significantly increased soluble protein sp of low nitrogen by 16 8 in 2020 f co2 enrichment coupled with low and intermediate irrigation significantly reduced nitrate content nc c2 coupled with i2 improved vitamin c vc in both spring growing seasons enriched co2 improved irrigation water use efficiency iwue and nitrogen use efficiency nue under low nitrogen in 2020 s respectively a comprehensive evaluation model of melon was established based on 10 indicators from three categories of yield quality and water nitrogen use based on fuzzy borda model intermediate irrigation coupling with higher nitrogen was the best treatment of enriched co2 which could comprehensively promote melon yield quality and water nitrogen utilization under co2 enrichment in summary this result could provide the agronomic irrigation and nitrogen schedule to achieve sustainable melon production for the future climate which involves elevated co2 concentration

8898,rising co2 concentration in the atmosphere may modulate the response of plants to water and nitrogen and the existing research is not sufficient to support the fine management of water and nitrogen under co2 rise to determine the optimal water and nitrogen strategy for melon production under co2 enrichment in the future we conducted an experiment with 12 treatments over three growing seasons the effects of water nitrogen coupling on the yield quality and water nitrogen use efficiency of oriental melon cucumis melo l qianyu no 6 under co2 enrichment were investigated and evaluated comprehensively the treatments included two co2 concentrations c1 400 ppm and c2 800 ppm three irrigation levels i1 80 evaporation ep i2 100 ep and i3 120 ep two nitrogen levels n1 s 184 77 kg ha 1 f 147 21 kg ha 1 and n2 s 369 54 kg ha 1 f 294 42 kg ha 1 the result showed that the yield increased with increasing levels of irrigation and nitrogen and enriched co2 significantly increased the yield by 10 3 22 9 n2 showed a significant promoting effect on the ratio of marketable fruit in the two spring seasons enriched co2 significantly increased free amino acid of i1 c2 coupled with i1 significantly reduced nitrate content by 30 9 14 9 in 2020 f and 2021 s respectively the interaction of c i was significant in irrigation water use efficiency iwue and nitrogen use efficiency nue in particular c2 coupled with i2 increased iwue by 40 5 18 7 and nue by 43 9 13 9 in the two spring seasons respectively ten indicators from three categories of yield quality and efficiency were used to establish the evaluation system of melon and were comprehensively evaluated based on fuzzy borda model combined three single models based on the combined evaluation model intermediate irrigation combined with higher nitrogen input was best for melon production under co2 enrichment this finding suggested that melon sustainable production should control irrigation and adequately increase nitrogen fertilizer to trade off fruit quality and efficiency for the expected future higher co2 concentrations graphical abstract ga1 keywords water and nitrogen coupling melon fruit yield quality co2 enrichment combined evaluation model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays the concentration of carbon dioxide co2 in the atmosphere reached at 420 ppm and would reach 800 1000 ppm at the end of the 21st century because of the continued increase in co2 emission ipcc 2013 although elevated co2 concentrations have a negative impact on the natural environment they can be beneficial to agricultural production co2 is an important carbon source for the plant photosynthetic process and growth especially for greenhouse production co2 supplementation is often required to maintain crop growth elevated co2 could significantly increase the melon yield by increasing photosynthesis activities and dry matter accumulation mavrogianopoulos et al 1999 under increasing co2 concentration conditions n and irrigation schemes appeared different regulatory effects on plant growth low n coupling elevated co2 led to nutrient deficiency because of reduction in the xylem size which affected the growth performance and nutritional value of tomatoes whereas increasing n fertilization could modulate this deficiency and promote plant photosynthesis status halpern et al 2019 lenka et al 2020 elevated co2 combined with moderate n fertilization was the best for promoting cucumber fruit quality dong et al 2018b under elevated co2 conditions n supply could be a key contributing factor to wheat grain yield liu et al 2019 elevated co2 could alleviate the reduction of growth performance in grapevine under water deficit kizildeniz et al 2015 and significantly improve the growth and photosynthetic performance of sweet peppers tomatoes and melons under water stress or salinity status del amor et al 2010 mavrogianopoulos et al 1999 yan et al 2021 as well as tomato fruit quality yang et al 2020 also increasing co2 concentration could improve the water use efficiency of cocoa under water deficit to meet future climate change conditions hebbar et al 2019 and the same results were also reported in potatoes and watermelons hong et al 2021 yi et al 2019 melon cucumis melo l is among the most important horticultural plants in china and rapid technological development has been achieved in melon production in recent years its yield ranks the first in the world with the higher growth rate than that of the planting area as a plant that has an intensive need for water yield and quality of melon would be inhibited by lack of water during the production season therefore the use of water resources with high efficiency is important for melon production water nitrogen coupling has a significant effect on melon production higher yield and better quality were obtained at irrigation dose of approximately 90 etc and when the n levels were reduced to 90 kg ha 1 in combination with more frequent irrigation in melon cultivation cabello et al 2009 sensoy et al 2007 applying 120 etc at the blooming fruiting stage and 150 etc at fruit expansion stage could have a positive effect on melon sugar content and reduce nitrate content accumulation ren et al 2021 adequate water and n input could significantly increase yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency in vegetable production he et al 2021a yang et al 2017 however co2 enrichment could lead to a decrease in nitrogen absorption affecting the nitrogen nutrition condition of plants and causing yield losses cohen et al 2019 adequate nitrogen nutrition was essential for maintaining the yield under co2 enrichment li et al 2018 these studies provide an effective theoretical basis for the management of water and nitrogen under elevated co2 conditions but systematic research on the interaction of elevated co2 water and nitrogen as well as the crop effects is still lacking therefore experiments involving water nitrogen coupled with different co2 concentrations are needed to determine a suitable irrigation nitrogen scheme that can support melon production for further to satisfactory agricultural practice under future climatic conditions different water and nitrogen conditions have different effects on the growth of melon even the same conditions have different effects on yield and fruit quality indicators li et al 2021 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2011 therefore a scientific comprehensive evaluation based on reasonable consideration of multiple types of indicators is the key to obtaining the final optimization scheme many scholars have established multi index analysis models using comprehensive evaluation methods fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fuzzy ahp principal component analysis pca technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and gray relation analysis gra have been applied to multi objective optimization such as water fertilizer regimes and ecological assessment however different single evaluation methods are limited in their comprehensive judgment of objective facts due to different mechanisms and angles of observation of information resulting in inconsistent results of different evaluation methods li et al 2021 fuzzy borda is a combination evaluation method that considers the evaluation score of each single method this could increase the superiority and rationality of evaluation results hao chen 2010 zhu et al 2022 this strategy can overcome the bias of the results from single type indicator and single evaluation method and can support the decision system of melon production at different co2 concentrations in northwestern china the aims of this research were as follows 1 to investigate the effects water nitrogen coupling under co2 enrichment on yield quality and water nitrogen use efficiency indicators of melon 2 to construct a comprehensive evaluation system for melon production and explore the performance of all treatments based on the fuzzy borda evaluation model and 3 to analyze the regulatory effect of water nitrogen coupling at different co2 concentrations based on the comprehensive evaluation and determine the optimal water and nitrogen schedule under co2 enrichment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites and plant materials the experiment was conducted in two small span greenhouses in yangling shaanxi province china 34 16 n 108 02 e altitude 450 m over three growing seasons 2020 s 27 march to 10 july in 2020 2020 f 1 august to 15 october

the air temperature and relative humidity were controlled to ideal range fig 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment manipulated three factors co2 concentration irrigation and nitrogen application a randomized split plot design was adopted co2 concentration co2 was the main plot irrigation water amount irrigation was the subplot and nitrogen application nitrogen was the re subplot a total of 12 treatments were conducted in two greenhouses for three consecutive crop seasons in 2020 and 2021 as follows two co2 concentrations of c1 400 ppm and c2 800 ppm three irrigation levels of i1 80

automatic gas supplement system for each greenhouse the sensor monitored the co2 concentration in real time and the single chip microcomputer controlled the solenoid valve of the co2 cylinder according to the actual co2 concentration to keep it at the experimental design level the irrigation volume was calculated according to the penman monteith formula recommended by fao 56 pereira et al 2015 the simplified formula used to calculate the amount of irrigation was as follows 1 i a ep kcp where i is the amount of irrigation a is the surface area of the pot ep is measured by the cumulative evaporation of ф20cm standard evaporating pan and kcp is the evaporation pan coefficient 1 05 at flowering stage fruit setting stage and the middle stage of the fruiting 0 75 at the final stage of the fruiting allen et al 1998 terceiro neto et al 2021 the amount of nitrogen applied was determined based on the needed amount of nitrogen for a melon plant during its lifetime minus the amount of nitrogen present in the substrate and nutrient solution n1 amount was calculated by target yield method wang et al 2008 the main calculation formula of the target yield method in this experiment is as follows 2 ty 1 n y where ty refers to the target yield kg ha 1 n is the rate of increase facility vegetable crops are usually 30 and y is the average yield in the previous 3 years kg ha 1 3 u ty nt where u is the nutrients required for planned yield kg and nt is the nitrogen content needed to form 1000 kg of melon usually 2 5 kg 4 n u ns c r where n is the nitrogen fertilizer content required for the target yield kg ha 1 ns is the nitrogen content of the test substrate kg ha 1 c is the effective nutrient content of the nitrogen fertilizer the nitrogen fertilizer in this experiment is nh4no3 and its nutrient content is 33 34 and r is the nitrogen use efficiency the utilization efficiency of nh4no3 is 65 twelve pots were planted for each treatment with three replicates and one melon plant was planted per pot with a minimum spacing of 50 cm between pots to ensure that the melon plants get sufficient nutrition during the whole growth period the same amount of nutrient solution was applied to each treatment table 1 shows the specific irrigation and nitrogen amounts in the three growing seasons 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 fruit yield one fruit was left per plant fan et al 2019 ren et al 2021 and the ripened fruits were picked on the 100th day spring and 70th day fall after transplanting yield was calculated as the weight of all melons for each treatment and was converted to the yield per hectare a marketable fruit weighed more than 0 5 kg without cracks or visual defects cabello et al 2009 the ratio of marketable fruits rmf was determined by the percentage of marketable fruits out of the total number of fruits 2 3 2 fruit quality quality indicators included total soluble solids tss total soluble sugar content tssc soluble protein sp free amnio acid faa vitamin c vc

shortcomings of inconsistent results from the different single evaluation models and make the evaluation results more scientific and accurate fuzzy borda model is proceeded through the following five

assigned a weight the subjective weights were determined by analytic hierarchy process ahp the specific calculation procedure of ahp was provided by han et al 2020 and then the memberships for evaluation index and evaluation value were calculated the evaluation criteria of each index were determined according to the existing research results and the specific situation of this study this study included 10 evaluation indicators and the evaluation level set is set to 8 e e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 where the five performance levels were excellent good medium poor and worse table s1 the memberships of the indicators according to the formula and calculation procedure from the reference wang et al 2021a 2 4 2 2 topsis evaluation model the subjective weights were determined by analytic hierarchy process ahp and the procedure was same as that in the fuzzy ahp method the entropy method was used to determine the objective weight of each factor he et al 2021b and the combined weights were obtained based on game theory the calculation procedures of combined weight and weighted euclidean distances can refer to the reference hong et al 2022 2 4 2 3 gra evaluation model gra methodology was developed on the basis of the gray system which refers to all the treatments in this study all treatments are considered as the factors in this system the procedure of gra has been described by xiao et al 2012 2 4 3 calculation of combined evaluation score of fuzzy borda model the pre compatibility test was performed on the ranking results obtained by the three single evaluation methods that is the kendall w consistency tests zhu et al 2022 the goodness of membership of each evaluation method score was calculated as follows 9 μ ij u ij min u ij max u ij min u ij 0 9 0 1 where

t8 ranked second in tss of 2020 s and performed best in 2020 f and 2021 s for tssc enriched co2 made it significantly lower from different irrigation levels i2 showed a boosting effect increasing nitrogen application significantly decreased tssc by 17 5 8 2 and 14 3 in the three seasons respectively among all treatments t3 c1 i2 n1 achieved the highest tssc in 2020 s and ranked second in 2020 f and in 2021 s following t6 c1 i3 n2 and t5 c1 i3 n1 respectively fig 4 for nutrition quality indicators enriched co2 had significant improving effects on all four indicators of soluble protein sp free amino acid faa vitamin c vc and nitrate content nc in the three growing seasons table 3 especially enriched co2 significantly increased faa of i1 by 17 0 17 9 and 14 9 in the three seasons and significantly increased sp of n1 by 16 8 in 2020 f irrigation had a significant effect on all nutrition indicators except sp and faa of 2021 s i1 achieved the highest sp values in 2020 f whereas i2

t9 t5 and t11 resulted in the best nue in the three study seasons respectively table 4 and fig 6 3 4 comprehensive evaluation of melon production based on fuzzy borda considering the yield quality and efficiency a comprehensive evaluation system for melons with 10 indicators was constructed based on the ahp method the subjective weights of criterion layer were 0 4676 in yield 0 3388 in quality and 0 1986 in water and nitrogen use table 5 for the indicator layer the indicator with the largest subjective weight was yield 0 3507 and sp exhibited the lowest subjective weight of 0 0373 for the objective weights faa achieved the highest value of 0 2218 in 2020 s and nue showed the highest in 2020 f and 2021 s respectively the lowest objective weights were observed in rmf sp and faa in the three study seasons respectively based on the game theory yield achieved the highest combined weight of 0 2549 0 336 and 0 2942 in the three growing seasons nc sp and faa obtained the lowest combined weights in 2020 s 2020 f and 2021 s respectively for the evaluation system comprising yield quality and efficiency the comprehensive scores and ranking based on the three single evaluation model of fuzzy ahp topsis and gra are illustrated in table 6 in 2020 s t10 was the best treatment according to fuzzy ahp and topsis whereas t12 obtained the highest score based on gra in 2020 f the best performances in fuzzy ahp topsis and gra were achieved in t9 t6 and t10 respectively in 2021 s the best performances in the three single evaluation methods were all achieved in t10 of the ambient co2 concentrations t5 led to the best performance in the three single evaluation methods in both spring study seasons whereas t6 had the highest score in 2020 f the evaluation results of different methods were inconsistent therefore fuzzy borda model was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the treatments based on the three single evaluation results and t10 was the best across the study seasons whereas t1 and t2 were the bottom two of all the three growing seasons tables s2 and 6 4 discussion 4 1 effects of water nitrogen coupling on the yield performance of melon under enriched co2 concentrations enriched co2 significantly increased melon yield which was consistent with the results obtained for several horticultural crops such as cherry tomato watermelon cucumber and melon dong et al 2018b karim et al 2020 mavrogianopoulos et al 1999 enriched co2 significantly increased the rmf of melon and the same result was also found in strawberries hidaka et al 2022 in the three growing seasons the effect of irrigation on rmf was different in spring growing seasons adequate increase in irrigation promoted rmf due to the readjustment in hydraulic conductivity and growth activity of roots very fine roots and root hairs under high irrigation amount sharma et al 2018 co2 enrichment coupled with i3 produced the lowest rmf in 2020 f because high irrigation with warm temperature could induce root diseases during fruit expanding stage in autumn fig 1 and finally affected the formation of marketable fruit gruda 2005 pivonia et al 2004 the interaction of c i was significant on yield the highest yield was obtained under enriched co2 with high irrigation but enriched co2 had the most significant boost on yield at medium irrigation co2 enrichment modulated water requirement for yield formation of melon in different growing seasons low irrigation decreased melon yield which may be due to water deficit affecting ps ii system and nutrient metabolism ultimately restricting plant development wakchaure et al 2023a this is likely due to the fact that co2 enrichment could modulate the leaf transpiration rate and improve water use efficiency thereby protecting against the adverse effect of reducing irrigation van der kooi et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 c n was insignificant for melon yield in both spring seasons which was inconsistent with the former study about the response of plant functional traits to nitrogen enrichment under climate change guo et al 2022 firstly it may be due to the different sensitivity of herbaceous plant like melon and the crop plant such as wheat or rice to increasing nitrogen inputs next n and co2 enrichment would produce antagonistic reaction under higher temperature conditions which may impact the positive performance of increasing n input in the spring experiment t 28 guo et al 2022 therefore global warming may influence the positive effect of co2 enrichment in the future which deserves more attention and consideration 4 2 effects of water nitrogen coupling on the quality performance of melon under enriched co2 concentrations tssc was negatively affected by high co2 which was inconsistent with the study on watermelon hong et al 2021 leaf photosynthetic activity could increase under co2 enrichment but the main photosynthesis product in leaf was starch tssc was not increased in fruit possibly due to the fact that starch was not degraded into soluble sugars and transported into the fruit xia et al 2013 also this may be related to the dilution effect high irrigation in co2 enrichment could produce more total non structural carbohydrates starch fructan sucrose etc marcheafave et al 2020 the increasing fruit dry biomass amount could dilute the growing amount of quality contents lahoz et al 2016 enriched co2 significantly improved tss under low irrigation conditions in 2020 f which may be due to the fact that co2 enrichment and reducing irrigation could modulate aba and then adjust the bio activities of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes thereby increasing tss content of fruit ruan et al 2010 yang et al 2020 with the increase of irrigation tss decreased in spring growing seasons which may be due to over irrigation leading to the depletion of soluble carbohydrate by altering the balance between carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis wakchaure et al 2023b decreasing nitrogen application rate could lead to better tss and this finding was the same as that of hong et al 2021 adequate nitrogen application is important to promote the increase in quality indicators but over input of nitrogen fertilizer could impact water transport from root to leaf and assimilate the net photosynthesis products to contribute to fruit quality enriched co2 significantly increased sp faa and vc of nutrition quality which was consistent with the results of studies on cherry tomato watermelon and cucumber dong et al 2018a hong et al 2021 karim et al 2020 co2 enrichment could promote rubisco enzyme activities and increase net photosynthetic rate it could modulate the photosynthesis energy assimilation to chemical energy to improve the important quality indicators li et al 2008 similarly the nc of melon fruit was decreasing by co2 enrichment which was also reported in previous studies on cucumber dong et al 2018b this finding might be due to the increased nitrate reductase activity under enriched co2 fonseca et al 1997 co2 enrichment significantly decreased nc of i1 and increased faa and sp of i1 in 2020 f which illustrated that enriched co2 had a positive effect on quality improvement of low irrigation in autumn growing season by converting inorganic nitrogen compounds to organic nitrogen compounds fig 5 the nitrate content was affected by irrigation which illustrated that low irrigation could promote no3 accumulation in fruit this finding may stem from the fact that deficit irrigation could accelerate nitrate status n accumulation in the upper soil layer and result in excessive absorption of nitrogen in plants kirnak et al 2005 meanwhile adequately increasing irrigation amount could improve vc as reported by wang et al 2017 because reasonable irrigation water supplement could result in good photosynthetic status for plant energy which in turn affects synthetic quality contents such as vc ren et al 2021 therefore low irrigation was not good for all quality indicators high n input could not achieve better quality performance in melon enriched co2 promoted the increase of sp and faa under low n application in 2020 f which indicated that co2 enrichment could boost the positive effect of adequate nitrogen fertilization possibly enriched co2 could alleviate the effect of low nitrogen on chloroplast development for improving the photosynthesis of leaf and quality of fruit dong et al 2018b therefore controlling n fertilizer application in reasonable scope coupling is important for balancing yield increase and maintaining fruit quality our study demonstrates co2 enrichment could partly improve the nutrition quality of melon which was different from the results of quality downregulation of plant under higher co2 dong et al 2022 zaghdoud et al 2016 firstly some study had not focused on improving the nitrogen nutrition status of crops with co2 enrichment while n demand was higher under co2 enrichment environment dong et al 2020 fig 5 next enriched co2 could affect crop energy distribution and ultimately affect processes such as dry matter distribution li et al 2020a li et al 2020b shin et al 2022 found that the efficiency of co2 enrichment on sweet pepper gradually decreased due to the restricted leaf area expansion caused by excessive photosynthate partition to fruits therefore the adequate control of melon fruit number of one plant in the experiment may partly increase the quality of melon finally co2 enrichment could promotes metabolic processes by increasing disease resistance thus improving quality hao et al 2020 above all would further support the conclusion that enriched co2 improves the quality of melons 4 3 effects of water nitrogen coupling on the water and nitrogen use efficiency of melon at enriched co2 concentrations enriched co2 significantly increased iwue as reported in wei et al 2018b and this was attribute to two reasons co2 enrichment could promote the increase of photosynthetic activity and produce more starch to contribute to fruit yield kizildeniz et al 2015 then the leaf instantaneous water use efficiency was decreased by the triggering of stomatal closure which could transport the aba signal to the root system to modulate the whole plant s water utilization zheng et al 2020 meanwhile nue was increased by enriched co2 but this result was inconsistent with the result that co2 had insignificant effect on the nue of cherry tomato wei et al 2018b possibly melon had different nitrogen use characteristics nitrogen fertilizer form may affect nue performance at different co2 concentrations zaghdoud et al 2016 nue increased with increasing irrigation which was consistent with the results of a former study cheng et al 2021 in this study c i interaction increased the iwue and nue enriched co2 reduced plant water use demand to maintain yield and resulted in the increase of iwue under low irrigation conditions kimball 2016 in spring growing seasons the highest iwue was achieved in intermediate irrigation amount which was consistent with the former report wakchaure et al 2023a additionally i n interaction had a significant effect on nue in 2020 s and 2020 f thus improving water conditions can promote the absorption and use of nitrogen fertilizer by plants 4 4 effects of different comprehensive evaluation methods on the evaluation results of melon for achieving the best performances in terms of melon yield quality and water nitrogen utilization the best water nitrogen schedule was inconsistent meanwhile in different growing seasons melon plants had different responses to the irrigation and nitrogen strategies the results confirmed the need for establishing an index that could comprehensively reflect melon fruit yield quality and water nitrogen use efficiency fuzzy ahp topsis and gra are effective methods for comprehensive evaluation he et al 2021b wang et al 2015 wang et al 2021b however the results obtained by using the different methods were inconsistent as reflected in our study s findings fuzzy borda combined method was used to evaluate the comprehensive performance of melon production this model could integrate the ranking and score values of the results of each single evaluation method which could make the results more objective by overcome the shortcoming of inconsistent conclusions of an independent evaluation model zhu et al 2022 based on fuzzy borda model the best treatment was t10 c2 i2 n2 in all growing seasons which was inconsistent with optimal results of reducing irrigation amount and increasing nitrogen application under elevated co2 in tomato research wang et al 2015 wei et al 2018a this may due to the fact that the previous study mainly considered comprehensive quality while in our study yield quality and water and nitrogen use efficiency indicators were weighted comprehensively in ambient co2 the best comprehensive treatments in the three growing seasons all occurred under i3 input t5 and t6 which was the same as the previous study on the effect of irrigation and nitrogen schemes for watermelon production hong et al 2022 enriched co2 could improve water use efficiency and reduced irrigation amount can achieve the best melon performance by improving photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation this was the same in the three growing seasons t10 this result indicated that co2 enrichment could improve the consistency of melon comprehensive performance across seasons however the climatic condition and cultivation patterns will affect the application amounts of water and nitrogen in actual production and further physiological evidence is still needed to demonstrate the synergistic effect of high co2 concentration with apparent water and nitrogen input amount in melon 5 conclusions enriched co2 significantly increased the ratio of marketable fruit rmf of low irrigation by 35 5 in 2020 s enriched co2 improved the quality indicator of low irrigation especially for free amino acid faa and total soluble solids tss in 2020 f co2 enrichment significantly increased soluble protein sp of low nitrogen by 16 8 in 2020 f co2 enrichment coupled with low and intermediate irrigation significantly reduced nitrate content nc c2 coupled with i2 improved vitamin c vc in both spring growing seasons enriched co2 improved irrigation water use efficiency iwue and nitrogen use efficiency nue under low nitrogen in 2020 s respectively a comprehensive evaluation model of melon was established based on 10 indicators from three categories of yield quality and water nitrogen use based on fuzzy borda model intermediate irrigation coupling with higher nitrogen was the best treatment of enriched co2 which could comprehensively promote melon yield quality and water nitrogen utilization under co2 enrichment in summary this result could provide the agronomic irrigation and nitrogen schedule to achieve sustainable melon production for the future climate which involves elevated co2 concentration

8899,climate change and large scale paddy field expansion have altered the balance of water supply demand in the sanjiang plain a substantial commercial grain base in the high latitude region of china however the matching pattern of water supply demand throughout the growing period during the rapid expansion processes of paddy fields remains unknown hence this study aimed to analyze the spatial temporal variation characteristics of effective precipitation p em crop water demand et c supply demand matching degree md and irrigation water demand ir for different growing periods of paddy fields in the sanjiang plain using high resolution meteorological and multi period rice distribution data sets the results showed that the area of paddy fields increased by 446 20 064 km2 from 1990 to 2020 and almost completely covered the lowland of the sanjiang plain in 2020 et c showed a slightly increasing trend initially and decreased afterward while p em and md marginally increased at first and considerably increased subsequently during 1990 1995 and 2000 2020 respectively md has largely increased since 2000 in the jiansanjiang area and the lower reaches of the songhua river where the largest paddy field expansion was experienced however the regional ir increased rapidly after 2000 which was associated with the expansion of paddy fields and further exceeded the carrying capacity of regional water resources the efficiency of water resource utilization should be urgently improved and integrated water resource planning and management should be implemented considering precipitation surface water regional water resources and transit water resources and groundwater to promote the sustainable development of regional agriculture keywords rice growth period spatiotemporal dynamics water supply demand matching water resource management sanjiang plain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction paddy fields are at the forefront of global food security providing food for more than 3 billion people worldwide fao and march 2019 van nguyen and ferrero 2006 however this food security for paddy fields comes at the cost of a large amount of irrigation water which accounts for more than 65 of agricultural irrigation water consumption globally li et al 2016 therefore the balance between the supply and demand of water resources in paddy fields is largely related to food security however the consumption of water resources by paddy fields has increased due to the changes in precipitation patterns and increase in higher temperatures fischer et al 2007 gou et al 2020 wang et al 2014 further large scale expansion of paddy fields with higher grain yield has become a common measure to cope with the food crisis brought on by population growth in some regions qi et al 2022 xin et al 2020 however the limited water resources cannot meet the increasing water consumption of paddy fields leading to the imbalance of regional water supply demand and aggravating the regional water shortage fitton et al 2019 kuang et al 2022 improving agricultural water use efficiency is the key to alleviating agricultural water shortage and analyzing the changing characteristics of crop supply demand balance can provide a solid support for improving agricultural water use efficiency therefore it is necessary to understand the dynamic changes in paddy field supply demand balance during paddy field expansion to realize the sustainable utilization of regional water resources and ensure food security the balance between the water supply demand for paddy fields and its response to climate change has constantly increased in the last decades irrigation water requirement refers to the amount of irrigation water needed to achieve optimal crop growth and yield and is an essential indicator of irrigation water resources management döll and siebert 2002 effective precipitation p em is part of the precipitation available to crops it is an important part of maintaining the balance of supply demand for regional agricultural water resources dang et al 2022 based on irrigation water requirement and effective rainfall recent studies mainly focused on three aspects 1 spatiotemporal patterns of historical irrigation water requirement and effective rainfall jia et al 2019 shen et al 2013 wriedt et al 2009 2 impact of climate change on crop irrigation water requirements rodríguez díaz et al 2007 zhou et al 2017 and 3 relationship between regional integrated water resources available water resources and agricultural production akoko et al 2020 de silva et al 2007 masia et al 2018 these studies provided important support for regional agricultural water resources management and agricultural water security research on regional water supply demand balance is extremely important for sustainable water resources management because regional water resources are often affected by many factors such as climate change and changes in local land use patterns fu et al 2022 investigated the changes in water supply and demand for meltwater irrigated farmland at the edge of the taklimakan desert based on multiple remote sensing and surface observation data sets and also assessed the contribution of improved irrigation efficiency to farmland expansion yousaf et al 2021 used remote sensing to present the temporal variations in crop water deficiency in bari doab pakistan liu et al 2022 analyzed the spatiotemporal variations in meteorological factors and crop irrigation water requirements based on the long term meteorological datasets of set in the yellow river basin luo et al 2022 analyzed the variation in rice irrigation water requirements under different planting structures in six representative rice growing regions in southern china shen et al 2013 explored the balance of water and soil resources in the north china plain by establishing a gini coefficient babu et al 2015 used the cropwat model to estimate the irrigation water requirement of the bapatla region in andhra pradesh india these studies mainly focused on irrigation water requirement on the point scale observation but ignored the dynamic evolution of regional crop acreage size and its spatial distribution pattern in particular evaluating the md of water supply demand based on the actual distribution of crops is essential when carrying out regional water resources allocation and regulation further most studies only calculated crop irrigation water requirement from the whole crop growing period ignoring the spatiotemporal differences in crop water requirement in different growing periods china is a water intensive agricultural nation that consumes more than 70 of its water supplies for agriculture more than 90 of the water consumed for agriculture in china is used for irrigation zhu et al 2013 this phenomenon is more prominent in the sanjiang plain an important commodity grain base in china s high latitude region large scale agricultural structural adjustment has been carried out in the sanjiang plain since the 1990 s due to frequent droughts and floods and rising grain prices further projects such as planting rice to against water logging and transformation of medium and low yield land to high yield farmland have been promoted wang et al 2006 xia et al 2018 consequently a large number of dryland fields have been converted into paddy fields providing security for china s grain supply luo et al 2020a 2020b wang et al 2015a 2015b zhang et al 2004 however the water use efficiency in sanjiang plain is not high at present the large scale expansion of paddy fields has resulted in a substantial increase in agricultural water consumption this has aggravated regional water resources shortage and given rise to issues such as excessive groundwater exploitation water environment destruction and soil fertility decline in the region therefore realizing efficient utilization of agricultural water resources and improving the sustainable management of water resources have become the research focus of modern agriculture in this region improving the efficiency of agricultural water use is essential to realize the sustainable utilization of regional water resources and analyzing the change in crop water supply demand is the premise and foundation of implementing integrated water resource management therefore the sanjiang plain was chosen in this study to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of water supply demand under the condition of large scale expansion of paddy fields specifically we aimed to 1 clarify the spatiotemporal variations in water supply demand for rice associated with precipitation and water requirement change from 1990 to 2020 and 2 discuss the measures and suggestions for the comprehensive regulation of water resources from the perspective of sustainable agriculture development 2 study area the sanjiang plain located in northeast china is a low plain formed by the alluvial soil of heilongjiang songhua and wusuli rivers fig 1 the study area was between 45 01 48 27 n and 130 13 135 05 e with a total area of 108 900 km2 the area is high in the southwest and low in the northeast and southeast it is characterized by vast alluvial low plains and terraces formed by rivers and extensive swamps and swampy meadows on floodplains the plain area accounts for 52 8 of the total area of the sanjiang plain which is the main area of human social activities the area has a temperate humid and semi humid continental monsoon climate with an average temperature of less than 18 c in january an average temperature of 21 22 c in july and an annual precipitation of 500 650 mm wang et al 2015a 2015b 2006 the precipitation distribution is uneven during the year mainly concentrated from june to september in the last 60 years the land use pattern in sanjiang plain has changed dramatically mainly in terms of the increase in the cultivated land area especially since the 1990 s the large scale implementation of the planting rice to against water logging project has led to a continuous expansion of paddy field planting in this area especially in the northeast jiansanjiang area wang et al 2015a 2015b 2006 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sets the high resolution 1 km precipitation data and potential evapotranspiration data spanning 1901 2021 used in this study were downloaded from the national tibetan plateau scientific data center peng et al 2019 the datasets were based on the global 0 5 climatic research unit climate data set released by the uk s national centre for atmospheric science at the university of east anglia and the global high resolution climate data set released by worldclim and was generated in china by the delta spatial downscaling method moreover the meteorological variables from 496 stations were used for verification and the verification results were credible the evapotranspiration data were calculated using the hargreaves formula peng et al 2017 based on the temperature minimum temperature and maximum temperature data in china such data sets have been widely used for driving biogeochemical models yu et al 2022 and carbon emission models zhang et al 2022 and investigating water risks of agricultural development li et al 2021 jia et al 2022 we used land cover maps provided by the resource and environmental science data centre chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the land cover maps of 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 with a spatial resolution of 1 km were selected to plot the spatial distribution of paddy fields 3 2 methods this study focused on the spatiotemporal analysis of paddy fields and water resource matching patterns in sanjiang plain we first obtained the distribution maps of paddy fields in 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 and then analyzed their spatiotemporal variation characteristics further the effective rainfall and its spatiotemporal variation were calculated on the grid scale during each and whole growth period of paddy fields using the high resolution temperature and precipitation data finally the crop water requirement the matching degree md of water supply demand and the irrigation water requirement of paddy fields during each and whole growth period were calculated based on the grid map of rice distribution and the spatiotemporal variation characteristics were analyzed 3 2 1 calculation of effective rainfall based on previous studies the water supply of cultivated land was categorized into effective precipitation green water and irrigation water blue water from the perspective of generalized agricultural water resources we then incorporated effective precipitation and irrigation water into the analysis of water balance for the cultivated land in the natural state farmland water circulates in the continuous body of crop soil atmosphere through precipitation infiltration evaporation transpiration and other forms the process of farmland water balance can be expressed using the following formula 1 p t s t 1 e t s t s t q s t q u p q u c t η where p t mm is the precipitation in the balance period t et s t mm is the actual evapotranspiration of surface crops in the balance period t that is water demand mm s t 1 mm and s t mm are the soil water contents at the beginning and end of the period respectively mm q s t mm is the surface runoff formed by rainfall in the balance period t q up mm is the deep percolation in the balance period t q uc mm is the capillary rise in the balance period t and η mm is the calculation error within the balance period t since most of the soil types in the paddy planting area of the sanjiang plain are white pulp soil swamp soil and black soil with saturated or relatively saturated soil moisture jia et al 2022 li et al 2021 the soil moisture difference s t s t 1 q up q uc and η values are extremely small therefore s t s t 1 q up q uc and η in eq 1 are negligible and can be transformed into 2 p t q s t e t s t it was deduced from the aforementioned formula that the water demand of paddy fields in the natural state mainly came from natural precipitation minus surface runoff loss that is natural effective precipitation p em the p em was calculated by referring to the method of united states department of agriculture service centre allen 1998 and the formula was as follows 3 p e m p m 125 0 2 p m 125 p m 250 125 0 1 p m p m 250 where p em mm is the monthly effective rainfall and p m is the monthly rainfall mm 3 2 2 calculation of crop water requirements the actual evapotranspiration of rice during different growth periods namely crop water demand et c was determined using the potential evapotranspiration and crop coefficient of rice during different growth periods the calculation formula was as follows allen 1998 4 e t c k c e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient that converted potential crop evapotranspiration into actual evapotranspiration et c is crop water requirement and et 0 mm is the reference evapotranspiration of crops based on the existing research and comprehensive consideration of various crop coefficients provided by the food and agriculture organization fao the rice growth period is categorized into four periods early growth period seedling tillering period from april to june middle growth period jointing heading period from july to august and late growth period milking maturing period in september the crop coefficient during early middle and late growth periods was 1 20 1 22 and 1 07 respectively based on the penman monteith formula recommended by the fao dingre and gorantiwar 2020 pereira et al 2015 ventura et al 1999 this method was used by the international irrigation and drainage commission the food and agriculture organization of the united nations and the american society of civil engineers as the standard procedures for calculating evapotranspiration evapotranspiration was calculated using cropwat 8 0 software of the fao 5 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where δ kpa 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve r n mj m 2 d 1 is the crop surface net radiation g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 γ kpa is the psychrometric constant t is mean temperature u 2 m s is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height e s kpa is the saturation vapor pressure and e a kpa is the actual vapor pressure 3 2 3 calculation of the md of water supply demand for paddy fields the md of water supply demand of paddy fields can reflect whether the amount of available water resources in a region can meet the water requirements for crop growth and development we calculated md in the sanjiang plain that is the ratio of the effective water supply to the water demand of paddy fields zhang et al 2019 using the following formula 6 m d t s t d t where s t mm is the effective supply of water resources in the study period t that is the p em and d t mm is the water demand of paddy crops in the balance period t that is et c under normal conditions md t is usually between 0 and 1 the larger the md t the better the matching degree of water supply demand in this growing period that is the less water deficit of crops if md t 1 the p em can meet the water demand of crops liu et al 2018 developed a new index to quantify md according to the theory of blue water and green water following liu et al 2018 the md in the sanjiang plain area was categorized into five levels by using the natural breaks method i extremely poor matching 0 mdt 0 4 ⅱ poor matching 0 4 mdt 0 6 iii good matching 0 6 mdt 0 8 iv better matching 0 8 mdt 1 and v excellent matching mdt 1 3 2 4 calculation of ir for paddy fields generally ir can be considered as the difference between et c and p em based on et c and p em calculated on the grid scale the ir of rice iwr during a growth period on a single grid scale can be calculated as follows liu et al 2022 7 i w r t e t c p e m where iwr t represents the ir of a single grid during a crop growth period t mm and et c and p em are water demand and p em within a crop growth period t in a single grid however iwr can only represent the water demand of a single grid crop which is challenging to represent the water demand of all paddy fields in a study area therefore based on the historical multi period paddy field distribution map 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 the following formula was used to calculate the ir of the sanjiang plain 8 i r i 1 n s i i w r i where ir is the total irrigation water demand of the sanjiang plain i is the grid number of paddy fields in a calculation year i 1 2 n s i represents the area of paddy fields m2 in each year calculated based on the raster number of the paddy field distribution map and iwr i represents the irrigation water requirement mm for the entire growth period of a single raster paddy field 4 results 4 1 expansion of paddy fields figs 2 and 3 show the spatial distribution area change and growth rate of paddy fields in sanjiang plain from 1990 to 2020 in the 1990 s the paddy fields had a total area of 5231 km2 and were sparely distributed in the hinterland of naoli river and located along the songhua river and the north lakeside of xingkai lake from 1990 2020 the paddy field expanded significantly and the newly increased paddy field area reached 20 064 km2 with an increased rate of 446 fig 3 these newly added paddy fields were mainly distributed in the hinterland of naoli river and along the bank of the songhua river however during 1990 1995 the paddy field area decreased to 491 km2 mainly in the central region the paddy field expanded rapidly during 1995 2000 with an increasing area of 5360 km2 a growth rate of 101 04 such additional paddy fields were partially due to the expansion of the original site and mostly contributed to the new paddy field reclamation subsequently the paddy field growth rate slowed down significantly from 2000 to 2005 and the growth rate was only 7 21 the growth rate of the paddy field area gradually increased by 26 09 30 13 and 37 84 for the periods 2005 2010 2010 2015 and 2015 2020 respectively in 2020 the paddy field coverage reached 23 75 of the sanjiang plain area and almost completely covered the north low plain and muling river xingkai lake plain 4 2 changes in p em fig 4 shows the changes in p em during each growth period of paddy fields from 1990 to 2020 p em showed a decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend during all growth periods and reached a minimum value in 2000 further except for the late growth period the p em in the early middle and whole growth periods all reached the maximum value of the study period moreover p em showed significant variability in the late growth period compared with other growth periods fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of p em for each growth period and the whole growth period of paddy fields in the sanjiang plain in 1990 2000 2010 and 2015 we chose these 4 years because of obvious differences in the spatial distribution of paddy fields in these four periods so that we could better analyze the differences in p em associated with paddy field change in terms of interannual variations p em generally showed a decreasing and then an increasing trend the range of p em during the whole growth period in 1990 was 396 82 570 92 mm p em decreased in 2000 compared with 1990 ranging from 385 72 to 545 06 mm in 2010 p em continued to decline to 359 80 514 12 mm in 2020 p em increased sharply ranging from 472 12 to 595 02 mm further significant differences were found in p em of rice during different growth periods during the early growth period in 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 p em was 135 44 218 91 114 22 185 92 136 29 209 00 and 199 24 270 18 mm respectively during the middle growth period the p em during the four periods was 181 81 273 32 201 64 264 03 189 06 267 49 and 178 60 228 11 mm respectively indicating a decreasing trend p em during the middle growth period was less than that during the early growth period in 2020 p em during the late growth period was the least and the p em during the four periods was 54 81 106 63 39 70 121 11 9 36 51 23 and 79 30 129 17 mm respectively showing a strong variability 4 3 changes in et c fig 4 shows the changes in et c during each growth period of paddy fields from 1990 to 2020 the changing trends of et c for different growth periods were variable during the early and late periods of rice growth et c increased from 1990 to 1995 and then decreased from 1995 to 2000 during 2000 2020 et c continuously decreased and reached a minimum value in 2020 however during the middle and whole crop growth periods et c showed an increasing and then decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend specifically the range of et c variations in 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 during the whole crop growth period was 743 78 859 84 765 18 891 64 735 21 859 33 and 721 85 862 65 mm respectively fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of et c during each growth period of paddy fields in the sanjiang plain in 1990 2000 2000 and 2020 in terms of spatial distribution the higher et c in 1990 was mainly distributed in the naoli river basin during the early growth period in 2000 2010 and 2020 the spatial distribution of et c was similar specifically the lower et c was distributed in the jiansanjiang area and the middle and lower reaches of the naoli river basin whereas the higher et c was distributed in the areas along the songhua river and the northeast of the plain the distribution of et c in 1990 2000 and 2010 during the late growth period was similar to that during the middle growth period however in 2020 the et c in the lower reaches of the songhua river was relatively low compared with that during the middle growth period with an overall trend of low in the north and high in the south the spatial distribution of et c during the late growth period did not change much in general showing a decreasing trend from southwest to northeast however et c was lower in most areas during the late crop growth period 5 changes in the md of water supply demand for paddy fields in terms of spatial distribution fig 7 the lowest value of the matching coefficient of water supply demand was 0 41 and the highest value was 0 55 in 1990 during the early growth period further the md was relatively low in the hinterland of the naoli river and relatively high in the upper reaches of the muling river in 2000 the md ranged from 0 27 to 0 44 showing a gradual increase from west to east in 2010 the md ranged from 0 40 to 0 56 with a clear increasing trend from west to east the areas with higher md were mainly located around xingkai lake and the jiansanjiang river in 2020 the md further increased ranging from 0 48 to 0 68 it decreased around xingkai lake but increased along the reaches of the songhua river in 2020 compared with that in 2010 during the middle growth period md largely increased compared with that during the early growth period with md ranging from 0 67 to 0 99 0 57 0 82 0 57 1 02 and 0 86 1 16 in 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 respectively the most pronounced areas were located in the northeast in the jiansanjiang region and along the upper reaches of the songhua river for the early later growth period the spatial variability of md increased largely with the values varying in the ranges of 0 70 1 39 0 39 0 87 0 30 0 92 and 0 81 1 39 in 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 respectively in 1990 the areas with a high md were distributed in the northern region in 2000 the md showed a clear trend of a gradual decrease from south to north in 2010 the area with high md was relatively small and concentrated in the northeast corner the best matching areas in 2020 were concentrated along the upper reaches of the songhua river the spatial distribution of md during the whole period of crop growth was roughly equivalent to that during the middle growth period however the matching coefficients generally increased for the whole region fig 8 shows the proportion of paddy fields with different md for different growth periods in 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 in the sanjiang plain the md was poor in 1990 during the early growth period in 2000 the md dropped sharply and was at an extremely low level in 96 1 of paddy fields area in 2010 the md rebounded to a poor level in 2020 the md continuously improved with 34 0 of paddy fields at the poor level and 66 0 at the good level the md was better during the middle growth period than during the early growth period in 1990 62 1 of paddy fields had a good md and 37 9 had an excellent md in 2000 the md decreased and 98 5 of paddy fields were at a good level in 2010 the md increased to some extent 48 7 of paddy fields were at a good level and 50 7 had a better md in 2020 the md further increased and the proportion of the region with excellent and better levels reached 45 0 and 55 0 respectively during the late growth period the distribution of md in the aforementioned 4 years was quite different in 1990 the proportion of paddy fields with good relatively good and excellent md was 18 2 67 8 and 12 7 respectively in 2000 the paddy fields with average and good matching levels accounted for 71 4 and 20 7 respectively in 2020 the md significantly improved with good and excellent area rates of 40 7 and 59 3 respectively during the whole growth period 93 8 of the paddy fields had a good md in 1990 in 2000 the md largely decreased and 99 7 of paddy fields dropped to the poor matching level in 2010 the md rebounded and the matching degree of paddy fields accounted for 45 5 and 54 5 respectively by 2020 the md significantly improved during the whole growth period and the area rates with good and better matching degrees accounted for 42 8 and 57 2 respectively 5 1 changes in crop ir ir showed an overall increasing trend during the early growth period and increased substantially in 2000 and 2020 fig 4 during the middle growth period ir increased substantially from 2000 to 2015 reaching a maximum in 2020 2 69 billion m³ followed by a sharp drop to 0 22 billion m³ in 2020 during the late growth period ir decreased to negative values during 1990 1995 then increased to 740 million m³ during 2000 2010 and reached a maximum in 2010 940 million m³ however ir dropped sharply during 2015 2020 and was at the same level in 2020 as in 1995 during the whole growth period the ir declined slightly during 1990 1995 then surged to 7 62 billion m³ in 2000 and fluctuated around 7 billion m³ thereafter 6 discussion 6 1 spatiotemporal variation of water supply demand patterns under the background of global warming the md in the sanjiang plain generally increased however the water shortage in the sanjiang plain considerably increased due to the massive expansion of paddy fields fig 4 water shortage was most serious during the early rice growth period besides a substantial alleviation of water shortage in 2020 the overall ir during the middle rice growth period showed an increasing trend it is suggested that more attention should be paid to the water shortage during the early and middle rice growth periods the water pumping schemes should be prepared in advance to provide supplementary irrigation to meet the water demand of paddy fields moreover the water use efficiency is low in the sanjiang plain which is mainly based on flooding irrigation an effective way to reduce irrigation water stress is to adjust crop planting patterns based on the changes in predicted precipitation cao and wei 2020 liu et al 2022 luo et al 2022 for example rain fed crops that consume less water can be considered in dry years also a monopoly furrow rainwater harvesting system can be used which not only improves rainwater utilization but also benefits crop growth for precipitation during non crop growth periods and beyond crop needs chen et al 2022 we found that the md differed among growing seasons and varied across different regions fig 7 and fig 8 such a spatiotemporal variation of md mainly attribute to climate change ding et al 2020 döll and siebert 2002 and land use transformation li et al 2023 zou et al 2018 for climatic factors changes in precipitation temperature and et 0 among growing seasons largely determine how much water paddy can be fed and to what degree the md can be reached ding et al 2020 ye et al 2015 previous studies found that precipitation had the greatest direct effect on the farmland irrigation water requirement across different regions in the northeast china liu et al 2022 dang et al 2022 in addition et c showed an increasing and then a decreasing trend in the sanjiang plain however we further found that the p em showed a decreasing and then an increasing trend during each growth period in the study area the increase in p em and the decrease in et c led to an increase in md in the crop growing area indicating a decrease in ir per unit area of paddy fields however the total ir showed a significant upward trend due to the large expansion of paddy fields in the sanjiang plain area the total ir increased most considerably particularly during 1995 2000 therefore not only the md but also the change in regional crop cultivation area should be considered while carrying out the actual agricultural water security risk evaluation it should be noted that evaporation is one of the important factors affecting the change of water supply demand balance in paddy fields liu et al 2022 our results show that et c increased initially and decreased afterward during each growth period this seems to be inconsistent with the previous finding which indicated that potential evapotranspiration in china is decreasing year by year xie and wang 2020 however changes in potential evapotranspiration is affected by many factors including wind speed solar radiation temperature and land cover for the sanjiang plain the large scale expansion of irrigated farmland after 1990 result in significant decrease in temperature han and yang 2013 solar radiation and wind speed han et al 2012 yin et al 2010 showed that the evapotranspiration in northeast china showed an upward trend from 1990 to 2000 and a downward trend after 2000 which supports the results of this study the precipitation during the crop growing season directly affects the iwr of crop the majority of scholars agreed that precipitation in the northeast china will increase in the future feng et al 2011 gu et al 2017 liu et al 2018 which seems to alleviate the pressure on irrigation water for rice in the region however due to the seasonal behavior of crop growth it is difficult to determine whether there will be a positive effect on md at all rice growth stages due to the influence of et c there is spatial uncertainty in determining md changes solely based on precipitation 6 2 implication of regional water resource management for sustainable development of paddy filed we found that the overall trend of total ir in the region increased with the expansion of paddy fields as mentioned above the sanjiang plain has undergone a large scale adjustment of planting structure that is the conversion of dry land to paddy fields although such a switch could largely reduce the negative impact of climate change induced extreme weather events on agricultural production luo et al 2020a 2020b it comes at the cost of large water consumption fig 9 in 1990 the vast majority 93 8 of regional water supply needs were well matched and the ir of all paddy fields in the sanjiang plain was only 2 73 billion m³ during the entire rice growing periods this suggests that the amount of water available at the time was basically enough to sustain the rice fields however under the influence of socio economic and policy driven factors such as increasing farmers income and maintaining national food security zou et al 2018 wang et al 2011 the paddy fields area in the sanjiang plain continually expanded and the overall ir increased substantially although the increase in rainfall brought by climate change leads to an increase in available water in recent years the regional total ir still far exceeds the actual agricultural water requirement in 2020 the actual change in the paddy field area outdistanced the maximum paddy field area that could be supported by existing water resources in the face of frequent and intense droughts these excess paddy areas require even more water resources for this reason the sanjiang plain exploits large amounts of groundwater and river water resources and relies on external water transfers to make up for the shortfall in water resources this over appropriation of surface and groundwater has affected the security of other ecosystems wang et al 2015a 2015b 2006 for example the continued exploitation of groundwater has caused a decline in regional groundwater levels and the formation of localized leakages li et al 2022 the overutilization of river water resources has caused a decrease in a downstream runoff threatening downstream wetland ecological security wang et al 2015a 2015b xu et al 2023 this urgently requires improving the efficiency of water resources utilization in the paddy fields while carrying out integrated water resources allocation and regulation considering precipitation surface water regional water resources and transit water resources and groundwater 6 3 innovation uncertainties and prospects reliable assessment on the dynamic balance of agricultural water supply demand of is a significant challenge because of the considerable variation in spatial distribution of cropping patterns and contemporaneous climates in which crop is grown the effect of climate and technological changes on the rice to address this challenge the high resolution meteorological data and multi period of rice distribution datasets with 1 km resolution were used to precisely investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of water supply demand under the condition of large scale expansion of paddy fields the new research framework can clearly answer the matching degree pattern of water supply demand at different growth periods in the actual distribution of crops in a region and directly guide the practice of water resource allocation although valuable results were found in this study there are a few points that require further attention many studies have investigated the water requirements of rice with respect to climate change and showed that global warming affects various aspects in addition to crop water requirements including suitable cropping areas and the growing season length of rice ding et al 2020 2020 li et al 2023 for example the length of the growing season has been extended by 17 9 days per year and the double rice cropping area has shifted northward by 300 km from 1961 to 2009 in the southern rice growing area of china song et al 2009 further to achieve sustainable paddy field development it is important to estimate the changes in water resources under the condition of future climate change and project the appropriate distribution of paddy field and its development potential han et al 2021 li et al 2023 therefore it is necessary to incorporate crop information e g rice varieties cropping system types and sowing dates spatial patterns of potential suitable cropping areas changes in water resource and future climate change scenarios e g different radiative forcing pathways or global warming levels and thus to provide strong support for the actual adjustment of agricultural planting structure 7 conclusions it is closely related to the distribution and management of regional agricultural water resources that the spatiotemporal dynamics of water supply demand patterns under paddy large scale expansion quantifying the variation of meteorological factors and rice md is of great significance to cope with ongoing climate change and regional water shortage the p em and et c were calculated using daily high resolution meteorological data and rice distribution map in this study based on this investigated the md of water supply demand for paddy fields after that the ir on the grid and regional scales was calculated to determine how much water was needed to meet the water demand during the growth periods of paddy fields the results indicated that the paddy field expanded extensively under the influence of socio economic and policy driven factors p em et c and ir in the sanjiang plain varied across different growth periods most of the abundant rainfall was concentrated in the middle rice growth period and mainly distributed in the northern sanjiang plain the increase in p em and the decrease in et c led to an improvement in the water supply demand patterns in the rice planting area however with the expansion of paddy fields the overall ir of paddy fields increased considerably and far exceeded the agricultural available water resources in the sanjiang plain from 2000 2020 the irrigation water needed to be maintained at around 7 billion m³ to make up for the shortage of water resources in regional paddy fields the large scale of paddy field expansion resulted in the increase of water demand which caused the imbalance between supply and demand in the sanjiang plain aggravating the crisis of agricultural water resources and the unsustainability of regional development therefore the efficiency of water resource utilization should be urgently improved and integrated water resource planning and management should be implemented considering multi water resources to promote the sustainable development of regional agriculture declaration of competing

8899,climate change and large scale paddy field expansion have altered the balance of water supply demand in the sanjiang plain a substantial commercial grain base in the high latitude region of china however the matching pattern of water supply demand throughout the growing period during the rapid expansion processes of paddy fields remains unknown hence this study aimed to analyze the spatial temporal variation characteristics of effective precipitation p em crop water demand et c supply demand matching degree md and irrigation water demand ir for different growing periods of paddy fields in the sanjiang plain using high resolution meteorological and multi period rice distribution data sets the results showed that the area of paddy fields increased by 446 20 064 km2 from 1990 to 2020 and almost completely covered the lowland of the sanjiang plain in 2020 et c showed a slightly increasing trend initially and decreased afterward while p em and md marginally increased at first and considerably increased subsequently during 1990 1995 and 2000 2020 respectively md has largely increased since 2000 in the jiansanjiang area and the lower reaches of the songhua river where the largest paddy field expansion was experienced however the regional ir increased rapidly after 2000 which was associated with the expansion of paddy fields and further exceeded the carrying capacity of regional water resources the efficiency of water resource utilization should be urgently improved and integrated water resource planning and management should be implemented considering precipitation surface water regional water resources and transit water resources and groundwater to promote the sustainable development of regional agriculture keywords rice growth period spatiotemporal dynamics water supply demand matching water resource management sanjiang plain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction paddy fields are at the forefront of global food security providing food for more than 3 billion people worldwide fao and march 2019 van nguyen and ferrero 2006 however this food security for paddy fields comes at the cost of a large amount of irrigation water which accounts for more than 65 of agricultural irrigation water consumption globally li et al 2016 therefore the balance between the supply and demand of water resources in paddy fields is largely related to food security however the consumption of water resources by paddy fields has increased due to the changes in precipitation patterns and increase in higher temperatures fischer et al 2007 gou et al 2020 wang et al 2014 further large scale expansion of paddy fields with higher grain yield has become a common measure to cope with the food crisis brought on by population growth in some regions qi et al 2022 xin et al 2020 however the limited water resources cannot meet the increasing water consumption of paddy fields leading to the imbalance of regional water supply demand and aggravating the regional water shortage fitton et al 2019 kuang et al 2022 improving agricultural water use efficiency is the key to alleviating agricultural water shortage and analyzing the changing characteristics of crop supply demand balance can provide a solid support for improving agricultural water use efficiency therefore it is necessary to understand the dynamic changes in paddy field supply demand balance during paddy field expansion to realize the sustainable utilization of regional water resources and ensure food security the balance between the water supply demand for paddy fields and its response to climate change has constantly increased in the last decades irrigation water requirement refers to the amount of irrigation water needed to achieve optimal crop growth and yield and is an essential indicator of irrigation water resources management döll and siebert 2002 effective precipitation p em is part of the precipitation available to crops it is an important part of maintaining the balance of supply demand for regional agricultural water resources dang et al 2022 based on irrigation water requirement and effective rainfall recent studies mainly focused on three aspects 1 spatiotemporal patterns of historical irrigation water requirement and effective rainfall jia et al 2019 shen et al 2013 wriedt et al 2009 2 impact of climate change on crop irrigation water requirements rodríguez díaz et al 2007 zhou et al 2017 and 3 relationship between regional integrated water resources available water resources and agricultural production akoko et al 2020 de silva et al 2007 masia et al 2018 these studies provided important support for regional agricultural water resources management and agricultural water security research on regional water supply demand balance is extremely important for sustainable water resources management because regional water resources are often affected by many factors such as climate change and changes in local land use patterns fu et al 2022 investigated the changes in water supply and demand for meltwater irrigated farmland at the edge of the taklimakan desert based on multiple remote sensing and surface observation data sets and also assessed the contribution of improved irrigation efficiency to farmland expansion yousaf et al 2021 used remote sensing to present the temporal variations in crop water deficiency in bari doab pakistan liu et al 2022 analyzed the spatiotemporal variations in meteorological factors and crop irrigation water requirements based on the long term meteorological datasets of set in the yellow river basin luo et al 2022 analyzed the variation in rice irrigation water requirements under different planting structures in six representative rice growing regions in southern china shen et al 2013 explored the balance of water and soil resources in the north china plain by establishing a gini coefficient babu et al 2015 used the cropwat model to estimate the irrigation water requirement of the bapatla region in andhra pradesh india these studies mainly focused on irrigation water requirement on the point scale observation but ignored the dynamic evolution of regional crop acreage size and its spatial distribution pattern in particular evaluating the md of water supply demand based on the actual distribution of crops is essential when carrying out regional water resources allocation and regulation further most studies only calculated crop irrigation water requirement from the whole crop growing period ignoring the spatiotemporal differences in crop water requirement in different growing periods china is a water intensive agricultural nation that consumes more than 70 of its water supplies for agriculture more than 90 of the water consumed for agriculture in china is used for irrigation zhu et al 2013 this phenomenon is more prominent in the sanjiang plain an important commodity grain base in china s high latitude region large scale agricultural structural adjustment has been carried out in the sanjiang plain since the 1990 s due to frequent droughts and floods and rising grain prices further projects such as planting rice to against water logging and transformation of medium and low yield land to high yield farmland have been promoted wang et al 2006 xia et al 2018 consequently a large number of dryland fields have been converted into paddy fields providing security for china s grain supply luo et al 2020a 2020b wang et al 2015a 2015b zhang et al 2004 however the water use efficiency in sanjiang plain is not high at present the large scale expansion of paddy fields has resulted in a substantial increase in agricultural water consumption this has aggravated regional water resources shortage and given rise to issues such as excessive groundwater exploitation water environment destruction and soil fertility decline in the region therefore realizing efficient utilization of agricultural water resources and improving the sustainable management of water resources have become the research focus of modern agriculture in this region improving the efficiency of agricultural water use is essential to realize the sustainable utilization of regional water resources and analyzing the change in crop water supply demand is the premise and foundation of implementing integrated water resource management therefore the sanjiang plain was chosen in this study to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of water supply demand under the condition of large scale expansion of paddy fields specifically we aimed to 1 clarify the spatiotemporal variations in water supply demand for rice associated with precipitation and water requirement change from 1990 to 2020 and 2 discuss the measures and suggestions for the comprehensive regulation of water resources from the perspective of sustainable agriculture development 2 study area the sanjiang plain located in northeast china is a low plain formed by the alluvial soil of heilongjiang songhua and wusuli rivers fig 1 the study area was between 45 01 48 27 n and 130 13 135 05 e with a total area of 108 900 km2 the area is high in the southwest and low in the northeast and southeast it is characterized by vast alluvial low plains and terraces formed by rivers and extensive swamps and swampy meadows on floodplains the plain area accounts for 52 8 of the total area of the sanjiang plain which is the main area of human social activities the area has a temperate humid and semi humid continental monsoon climate with an average temperature of less than 18 c in january an average temperature of 21 22 c in july and an annual precipitation of 500 650 mm wang et al 2015a 2015b 2006 the precipitation distribution is uneven during the year mainly concentrated from june to september in the last 60 years the land use pattern in sanjiang plain has changed dramatically mainly in terms of the increase in the cultivated land area especially since the 1990 s the large scale implementation of the planting rice to against water logging project has led to a continuous expansion of paddy field planting in this area especially in the northeast jiansanjiang area wang et al 2015a 2015b 2006 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sets the high resolution 1 km precipitation data and potential evapotranspiration data spanning 1901 2021 used in this study were downloaded from the national tibetan plateau scientific data center peng et al 2019 the datasets were based on the global 0 5 climatic research unit climate data set released by the uk s national centre for atmospheric science at the university of east anglia and the global high resolution climate data set released by worldclim and was generated in china by the delta spatial downscaling method moreover the meteorological variables from 496 stations were used for verification and the verification results were credible the evapotranspiration data were calculated using the hargreaves formula peng et al 2017 based on the temperature minimum temperature and maximum temperature data in china such data sets have been widely used for driving biogeochemical models yu et al 2022 and carbon emission models zhang et al 2022 and investigating water risks of agricultural development li et al 2021 jia et al 2022 we used land cover maps provided by the resource and environmental science data centre chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the land cover maps of 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 with a spatial resolution of 1 km were selected to plot the spatial distribution of paddy fields 3 2 methods this study focused on the spatiotemporal analysis of paddy fields and water resource matching patterns in sanjiang plain we first obtained the distribution maps of paddy fields in 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 and then analyzed their spatiotemporal variation characteristics further the effective rainfall and its spatiotemporal variation were calculated on the grid scale during each and whole growth period of paddy fields using the high resolution temperature and precipitation data finally the crop water requirement the matching degree md of water supply demand and the irrigation water requirement of paddy fields during each and whole growth period were calculated based on the grid map of rice distribution and the spatiotemporal variation characteristics were analyzed 3 2 1 calculation of effective rainfall based on previous studies the water supply of cultivated land was categorized into effective precipitation green water and irrigation water blue water from the perspective of generalized agricultural water resources we then incorporated effective precipitation and irrigation water into the analysis of water balance for the cultivated land in the natural state farmland water circulates in the continuous body of crop soil atmosphere through precipitation infiltration evaporation transpiration and other forms the process of farmland water balance can be expressed using the following formula 1 p t s t 1 e t s t s t q s t q u p q u c t η where p t mm is the precipitation in the balance period t et s t mm is the actual evapotranspiration of surface crops in the balance period t that is water demand mm s t 1 mm and s t mm are the soil water contents at the beginning and end of the period respectively mm q s t mm is the surface runoff formed by rainfall in the balance period t q up mm is the deep percolation in the balance period t q uc mm is the capillary rise in the balance period t and η mm is the calculation error within the balance period t since most of the soil types in the paddy planting area of the sanjiang plain are white pulp soil swamp soil and black soil with saturated or relatively saturated soil moisture jia et al 2022 li et al 2021 the soil moisture difference s t s t 1 q up q uc and η values are extremely small therefore s t s t 1 q up q uc and η in eq 1 are negligible and can be transformed into 2 p t q s t e t s t it was deduced from the aforementioned formula that the water demand of paddy fields in the natural state mainly came from natural precipitation minus surface runoff loss that is natural effective precipitation p em the p em was calculated by referring to the method of united states department of agriculture service centre allen 1998 and the formula was as follows 3 p e m p m 125 0 2 p m 125 p m 250 125 0 1 p m p m 250 where p em mm is the monthly effective rainfall and p m is the monthly rainfall mm 3 2 2 calculation of crop water requirements the actual evapotranspiration of rice during different growth periods namely crop water demand et c was determined using the potential evapotranspiration and crop coefficient of rice during different growth periods the calculation formula was as follows allen 1998 4 e t c k c e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient that converted potential crop evapotranspiration into actual evapotranspiration et c is crop water requirement and et 0 mm is the reference evapotranspiration of crops based on the existing research and comprehensive consideration of various crop coefficients provided by the food and agriculture organization fao the rice growth period is categorized into four periods early growth period seedling tillering period from april to june middle growth period jointing heading period from july to august and late growth period milking maturing period in september the crop coefficient during early middle and late growth periods was 1 20 1 22 and 1 07 respectively based on the penman monteith formula recommended by the fao dingre and gorantiwar 2020 pereira et al 2015 ventura et al 1999 this method was used by the international irrigation and drainage commission the food and agriculture organization of the united nations and the american society of civil engineers as the standard procedures for calculating evapotranspiration evapotranspiration was calculated using cropwat 8 0 software of the fao 5 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where δ kpa 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve r n mj m 2 d 1 is the crop surface net radiation g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 γ kpa is the psychrometric constant t is mean temperature u 2 m s is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height e s kpa is the saturation vapor pressure and e a kpa is the actual vapor pressure 3 2 3 calculation of the md of water supply demand for paddy fields the md of water supply demand of paddy fields can reflect whether the amount of available water resources in a region can meet the water requirements for crop growth and development we calculated md in the sanjiang plain that is the ratio of the effective water supply to the water demand of paddy fields zhang et al 2019 using the following formula 6 m d t s t d t where s t mm is the effective supply of water resources in the study period t that is the p em and d t mm is the water demand of paddy crops in the balance period t that is et c under normal conditions md t is usually between 0 and 1 the larger the md t the better the matching degree of water supply demand in this growing period that is the less water deficit of crops if md t 1 the p em can meet the water demand of crops liu et al 2018 developed a new index to quantify md according to the theory of blue water and green water following liu et al 2018 the md in the sanjiang plain area was categorized into five levels by using the natural breaks method i extremely poor matching 0 mdt 0 4 ⅱ poor matching 0 4 mdt 0 6 iii good matching 0 6 mdt 0 8 iv better matching 0 8 mdt 1 and v excellent matching mdt 1 3 2 4 calculation of ir for paddy fields generally ir can be considered as the difference between et c and p em based on et c and p em calculated on the grid scale the ir of rice iwr during a growth period on a single grid scale can be calculated as follows liu et al 2022 7 i w r t e t c p e m where iwr t represents the ir of a single grid during a crop growth period t mm and et c and p em are water demand and p em within a crop growth period t in a single grid however iwr can only represent the water demand of a single grid crop which is challenging to represent the water demand of all paddy fields in a study area therefore based on the historical multi period paddy field distribution map 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 the following formula was used to calculate the ir of the sanjiang plain 8 i r i 1 n s i i w r i where ir is the total irrigation water demand of the sanjiang plain i is the grid number of paddy fields in a calculation year i 1 2 n s i represents the area of paddy fields m2 in each year calculated based on the raster number of the paddy field distribution map and iwr i represents the irrigation water requirement mm for the entire growth period of a single raster paddy field 4 results 4 1 expansion of paddy fields figs 2 and 3 show the spatial distribution area change and growth rate of paddy fields in sanjiang plain from 1990 to 2020 in the 1990 s the paddy fields had a total area of 5231 km2 and were sparely distributed in the hinterland of naoli river and located along the songhua river and the north lakeside of xingkai lake from 1990 2020 the paddy field expanded significantly and the newly increased paddy field area reached 20 064 km2 with an increased rate of 446 fig 3 these newly added paddy fields were mainly distributed in the hinterland of naoli river and along the bank of the songhua river however during 1990 1995 the paddy field area decreased to 491 km2 mainly in the central region the paddy field expanded rapidly during 1995 2000 with an increasing area of 5360 km2 a growth rate of 101 04 such additional paddy fields were partially due to the expansion of the original site and mostly contributed to the new paddy field reclamation subsequently the paddy field growth rate slowed down significantly from 2000 to 2005 and the growth rate was only 7 21 the growth rate of the paddy field area gradually increased by 26 09 30 13 and 37 84 for the periods 2005 2010 2010 2015 and 2015 2020 respectively in 2020 the paddy field coverage reached 23 75 of the sanjiang plain area and almost completely covered the north low plain and muling river xingkai lake plain 4 2 changes in p em fig 4 shows the changes in p em during each growth period of paddy fields from 1990 to 2020 p em showed a decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend during all growth periods and reached a minimum value in 2000 further except for the late growth period the p em in the early middle and whole growth periods all reached the maximum value of the study period moreover p em showed significant variability in the late growth period compared with other growth periods fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of p em for each growth period and the whole growth period of paddy fields in the sanjiang plain in 1990 2000 2010 and 2015 we chose these 4 years because of obvious differences in the spatial distribution of paddy fields in these four periods so that we could better analyze the differences in p em associated with paddy field change in terms of interannual variations p em generally showed a decreasing and then an increasing trend the range of p em during the whole growth period in 1990 was 396 82 570 92 mm p em decreased in 2000 compared with 1990 ranging from 385 72 to 545 06 mm in 2010 p em continued to decline to 359 80 514 12 mm in 2020 p em increased sharply ranging from 472 12 to 595 02 mm further significant differences were found in p em of rice during different growth periods during the early growth period in 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 p em was 135 44 218 91 114 22 185 92 136 29 209 00 and 199 24 270 18 mm respectively during the middle growth period the p em during the four periods was 181 81 273 32 201 64 264 03 189 06 267 49 and 178 60 228 11 mm respectively indicating a decreasing trend p em during the middle growth period was less than that during the early growth period in 2020 p em during the late growth period was the least and the p em during the four periods was 54 81 106 63 39 70 121 11 9 36 51 23 and 79 30 129 17 mm respectively showing a strong variability 4 3 changes in et c fig 4 shows the changes in et c during each growth period of paddy fields from 1990 to 2020 the changing trends of et c for different growth periods were variable during the early and late periods of rice growth et c increased from 1990 to 1995 and then decreased from 1995 to 2000 during 2000 2020 et c continuously decreased and reached a minimum value in 2020 however during the middle and whole crop growth periods et c showed an increasing and then decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend specifically the range of et c variations in 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 during the whole crop growth period was 743 78 859 84 765 18 891 64 735 21 859 33 and 721 85 862 65 mm respectively fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of et c during each growth period of paddy fields in the sanjiang plain in 1990 2000 2000 and 2020 in terms of spatial distribution the higher et c in 1990 was mainly distributed in the naoli river basin during the early growth period in 2000 2010 and 2020 the spatial distribution of et c was similar specifically the lower et c was distributed in the jiansanjiang area and the middle and lower reaches of the naoli river basin whereas the higher et c was distributed in the areas along the songhua river and the northeast of the plain the distribution of et c in 1990 2000 and 2010 during the late growth period was similar to that during the middle growth period however in 2020 the et c in the lower reaches of the songhua river was relatively low compared with that during the middle growth period with an overall trend of low in the north and high in the south the spatial distribution of et c during the late growth period did not change much in general showing a decreasing trend from southwest to northeast however et c was lower in most areas during the late crop growth period 5 changes in the md of water supply demand for paddy fields in terms of spatial distribution fig 7 the lowest value of the matching coefficient of water supply demand was 0 41 and the highest value was 0 55 in 1990 during the early growth period further the md was relatively low in the hinterland of the naoli river and relatively high in the upper reaches of the muling river in 2000 the md ranged from 0 27 to 0 44 showing a gradual increase from west to east in 2010 the md ranged from 0 40 to 0 56 with a clear increasing trend from west to east the areas with higher md were mainly located around xingkai lake and the jiansanjiang river in 2020 the md further increased ranging from 0 48 to 0 68 it decreased around xingkai lake but increased along the reaches of the songhua river in 2020 compared with that in 2010 during the middle growth period md largely increased compared with that during the early growth period with md ranging from 0 67 to 0 99 0 57 0 82 0 57 1 02 and 0 86 1 16 in 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 respectively the most pronounced areas were located in the northeast in the jiansanjiang region and along the upper reaches of the songhua river for the early later growth period the spatial variability of md increased largely with the values varying in the ranges of 0 70 1 39 0 39 0 87 0 30 0 92 and 0 81 1 39 in 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 respectively in 1990 the areas with a high md were distributed in the northern region in 2000 the md showed a clear trend of a gradual decrease from south to north in 2010 the area with high md was relatively small and concentrated in the northeast corner the best matching areas in 2020 were concentrated along the upper reaches of the songhua river the spatial distribution of md during the whole period of crop growth was roughly equivalent to that during the middle growth period however the matching coefficients generally increased for the whole region fig 8 shows the proportion of paddy fields with different md for different growth periods in 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 in the sanjiang plain the md was poor in 1990 during the early growth period in 2000 the md dropped sharply and was at an extremely low level in 96 1 of paddy fields area in 2010 the md rebounded to a poor level in 2020 the md continuously improved with 34 0 of paddy fields at the poor level and 66 0 at the good level the md was better during the middle growth period than during the early growth period in 1990 62 1 of paddy fields had a good md and 37 9 had an excellent md in 2000 the md decreased and 98 5 of paddy fields were at a good level in 2010 the md increased to some extent 48 7 of paddy fields were at a good level and 50 7 had a better md in 2020 the md further increased and the proportion of the region with excellent and better levels reached 45 0 and 55 0 respectively during the late growth period the distribution of md in the aforementioned 4 years was quite different in 1990 the proportion of paddy fields with good relatively good and excellent md was 18 2 67 8 and 12 7 respectively in 2000 the paddy fields with average and good matching levels accounted for 71 4 and 20 7 respectively in 2020 the md significantly improved with good and excellent area rates of 40 7 and 59 3 respectively during the whole growth period 93 8 of the paddy fields had a good md in 1990 in 2000 the md largely decreased and 99 7 of paddy fields dropped to the poor matching level in 2010 the md rebounded and the matching degree of paddy fields accounted for 45 5 and 54 5 respectively by 2020 the md significantly improved during the whole growth period and the area rates with good and better matching degrees accounted for 42 8 and 57 2 respectively 5 1 changes in crop ir ir showed an overall increasing trend during the early growth period and increased substantially in 2000 and 2020 fig 4 during the middle growth period ir increased substantially from 2000 to 2015 reaching a maximum in 2020 2 69 billion m³ followed by a sharp drop to 0 22 billion m³ in 2020 during the late growth period ir decreased to negative values during 1990 1995 then increased to 740 million m³ during 2000 2010 and reached a maximum in 2010 940 million m³ however ir dropped sharply during 2015 2020 and was at the same level in 2020 as in 1995 during the whole growth period the ir declined slightly during 1990 1995 then surged to 7 62 billion m³ in 2000 and fluctuated around 7 billion m³ thereafter 6 discussion 6 1 spatiotemporal variation of water supply demand patterns under the background of global warming the md in the sanjiang plain generally increased however the water shortage in the sanjiang plain considerably increased due to the massive expansion of paddy fields fig 4 water shortage was most serious during the early rice growth period besides a substantial alleviation of water shortage in 2020 the overall ir during the middle rice growth period showed an increasing trend it is suggested that more attention should be paid to the water shortage during the early and middle rice growth periods the water pumping schemes should be prepared in advance to provide supplementary irrigation to meet the water demand of paddy fields moreover the water use efficiency is low in the sanjiang plain which is mainly based on flooding irrigation an effective way to reduce irrigation water stress is to adjust crop planting patterns based on the changes in predicted precipitation cao and wei 2020 liu et al 2022 luo et al 2022 for example rain fed crops that consume less water can be considered in dry years also a monopoly furrow rainwater harvesting system can be used which not only improves rainwater utilization but also benefits crop growth for precipitation during non crop growth periods and beyond crop needs chen et al 2022 we found that the md differed among growing seasons and varied across different regions fig 7 and fig 8 such a spatiotemporal variation of md mainly attribute to climate change ding et al 2020 döll and siebert 2002 and land use transformation li et al 2023 zou et al 2018 for climatic factors changes in precipitation temperature and et 0 among growing seasons largely determine how much water paddy can be fed and to what degree the md can be reached ding et al 2020 ye et al 2015 previous studies found that precipitation had the greatest direct effect on the farmland irrigation water requirement across different regions in the northeast china liu et al 2022 dang et al 2022 in addition et c showed an increasing and then a decreasing trend in the sanjiang plain however we further found that the p em showed a decreasing and then an increasing trend during each growth period in the study area the increase in p em and the decrease in et c led to an increase in md in the crop growing area indicating a decrease in ir per unit area of paddy fields however the total ir showed a significant upward trend due to the large expansion of paddy fields in the sanjiang plain area the total ir increased most considerably particularly during 1995 2000 therefore not only the md but also the change in regional crop cultivation area should be considered while carrying out the actual agricultural water security risk evaluation it should be noted that evaporation is one of the important factors affecting the change of water supply demand balance in paddy fields liu et al 2022 our results show that et c increased initially and decreased afterward during each growth period this seems to be inconsistent with the previous finding which indicated that potential evapotranspiration in china is decreasing year by year xie and wang 2020 however changes in potential evapotranspiration is affected by many factors including wind speed solar radiation temperature and land cover for the sanjiang plain the large scale expansion of irrigated farmland after 1990 result in significant decrease in temperature han and yang 2013 solar radiation and wind speed han et al 2012 yin et al 2010 showed that the evapotranspiration in northeast china showed an upward trend from 1990 to 2000 and a downward trend after 2000 which supports the results of this study the precipitation during the crop growing season directly affects the iwr of crop the majority of scholars agreed that precipitation in the northeast china will increase in the future feng et al 2011 gu et al 2017 liu et al 2018 which seems to alleviate the pressure on irrigation water for rice in the region however due to the seasonal behavior of crop growth it is difficult to determine whether there will be a positive effect on md at all rice growth stages due to the influence of et c there is spatial uncertainty in determining md changes solely based on precipitation 6 2 implication of regional water resource management for sustainable development of paddy filed we found that the overall trend of total ir in the region increased with the expansion of paddy fields as mentioned above the sanjiang plain has undergone a large scale adjustment of planting structure that is the conversion of dry land to paddy fields although such a switch could largely reduce the negative impact of climate change induced extreme weather events on agricultural production luo et al 2020a 2020b it comes at the cost of large water consumption fig 9 in 1990 the vast majority 93 8 of regional water supply needs were well matched and the ir of all paddy fields in the sanjiang plain was only 2 73 billion m³ during the entire rice growing periods this suggests that the amount of water available at the time was basically enough to sustain the rice fields however under the influence of socio economic and policy driven factors such as increasing farmers income and maintaining national food security zou et al 2018 wang et al 2011 the paddy fields area in the sanjiang plain continually expanded and the overall ir increased substantially although the increase in rainfall brought by climate change leads to an increase in available water in recent years the regional total ir still far exceeds the actual agricultural water requirement in 2020 the actual change in the paddy field area outdistanced the maximum paddy field area that could be supported by existing water resources in the face of frequent and intense droughts these excess paddy areas require even more water resources for this reason the sanjiang plain exploits large amounts of groundwater and river water resources and relies on external water transfers to make up for the shortfall in water resources this over appropriation of surface and groundwater has affected the security of other ecosystems wang et al 2015a 2015b 2006 for example the continued exploitation of groundwater has caused a decline in regional groundwater levels and the formation of localized leakages li et al 2022 the overutilization of river water resources has caused a decrease in a downstream runoff threatening downstream wetland ecological security wang et al 2015a 2015b xu et al 2023 this urgently requires improving the efficiency of water resources utilization in the paddy fields while carrying out integrated water resources allocation and regulation considering precipitation surface water regional water resources and transit water resources and groundwater 6 3 innovation uncertainties and prospects reliable assessment on the dynamic balance of agricultural water supply demand of is a significant challenge because of the considerable variation in spatial distribution of cropping patterns and contemporaneous climates in which crop is grown the effect of climate and technological changes on the rice to address this challenge the high resolution meteorological data and multi period of rice distribution datasets with 1 km resolution were used to precisely investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of water supply demand under the condition of large scale expansion of paddy fields the new research framework can clearly answer the matching degree pattern of water supply demand at different growth periods in the actual distribution of crops in a region and directly guide the practice of water resource allocation although valuable results were found in this study there are a few points that require further attention many studies have investigated the water requirements of rice with respect to climate change and showed that global warming affects various aspects in addition to crop water requirements including suitable cropping areas and the growing season length of rice ding et al 2020 2020 li et al 2023 for example the length of the growing season has been extended by 17 9 days per year and the double rice cropping area has shifted northward by 300 km from 1961 to 2009 in the southern rice growing area of china song et al 2009 further to achieve sustainable paddy field development it is important to estimate the changes in water resources under the condition of future climate change and project the appropriate distribution of paddy field and its development potential han et al 2021 li et al 2023 therefore it is necessary to incorporate crop information e g rice varieties cropping system types and sowing dates spatial patterns of potential suitable cropping areas changes in water resource and future climate change scenarios e g different radiative forcing pathways or global warming levels and thus to provide strong support for the actual adjustment of agricultural planting structure 7 conclusions it is closely related to the distribution and management of regional agricultural water resources that the spatiotemporal dynamics of water supply demand patterns under paddy large scale expansion quantifying the variation of meteorological factors and rice md is of great significance to cope with ongoing climate change and regional water shortage the p em and et c were calculated using daily high resolution meteorological data and rice distribution map in this study based on this investigated the md of water supply demand for paddy fields after that the ir on the grid and regional scales was calculated to determine how much water was needed to meet the water demand during the growth periods of paddy fields the results indicated that the paddy field expanded extensively under the influence of socio economic and policy driven factors p em et c and ir in the sanjiang plain varied across different growth periods most of the abundant rainfall was concentrated in the middle rice growth period and mainly distributed in the northern sanjiang plain the increase in p em and the decrease in et c led to an improvement in the water supply demand patterns in the rice planting area however with the expansion of paddy fields the overall ir of paddy fields increased considerably and far exceeded the agricultural available water resources in the sanjiang plain from 2000 2020 the irrigation water needed to be maintained at around 7 billion m³ to make up for the shortage of water resources in regional paddy fields the large scale of paddy field expansion resulted in the increase of water demand which caused the imbalance between supply and demand in the sanjiang plain aggravating the crisis of agricultural water resources and the unsustainability of regional development therefore the efficiency of water resource utilization should be urgently improved and integrated water resource planning and management should be implemented considering multi water resources to promote the sustainable development of regional agriculture declaration of competing
