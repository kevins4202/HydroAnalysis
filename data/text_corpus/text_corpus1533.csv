7665,study region qiyi glacier in the qilian mountains northeast tibetan plateau study focus future glacier changes are critical to the sustainable use of regional water resources and the survival and development of the densely populated tibetan plateau and surrounding regions a distributed energy mass balance model is applied to simulate the historical and future mass balance and ice volume of qiyi glacier from 1980 to 2100 the aims of this study are to illuminate the spatial and temporal patterns of mass balance and energy balance to forecast future changes of this glacier under different scenarios of cmip6 and to identify the timing of peak ice loss new hydrological insights for the region compared to the historical reconstruction future projections show that ablation will increase and accumulation will decrease due to less snowfall and increased net shortwave radiation that is induced by lower albedos the average mass balance increases by a factor of 1 08 1 67 and 2 68 under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios during 2021 2100 respectively by the end of the 21st century qiyi glacier ice volume will reduce by 107 61 106 m3 95 3 for the ssp1 2 6 scenario and 112 12 106 m3 99 3 for the ssp2 4 5 scenario and will disappear entirely by 2082 for the ssp5 8 5 scenario in all scenarios the glacier mass loss rate will peak around 2030 2045 then decrease in parallel with the decreasing ice volume graphical abstract ga1 keywords glacier modeling glacier mass balance energy balance cmip6 qiyi glacier data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp and its surroundings are sometimes referred to as the asian water tower which not only support the largest number of glaciers outside of the polar regions yao et al 2012 but also serve as the headwaters of many prominent asian rivers xu et al 2008 among the global mountain ranges the glacier mass loss of the asian water tower in the recent decade was ranked second next to the glacier mass loss observed in the southern andes ipcc 2021 it is projected that the tp will be the largest contributor to global sea level rise among mountain regions in 2015 2100 rounce et al 2020 glacier state of asian water tower had undergone imbalance variation in the spatial and temporal pattern yao et al 2022 most glaciers on the eastern tp are experiencing varying degrees of ice loss and area shrinkage yao et al 2012 neckel et al 2017 maurer et al 2019 the accelerated glacier ablation will increase runoff in the short term leading to the instability of regional water cycle and water resources supply however glacier runoff will reach the maximum peak water gleick and palaniappan 2010 at some moment in the future then will decrease and more than 2 billion people living in the regions will face water shortages biemans et al 2019 pritchard et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2020 glacier mass balance is the connection between energy ice and water exchange and is the mass basis of future glacier variation therefore accurate modeling and future projections of glacier mass balance and ice volume are critical to regional water sustainability numerical simulation especially the distributed model is an effective method to study the future glacier mass change and its response to climate change at present the degree day factor model and energy mass balance model are two main methods for simulating glacier mass change the degree day factor model is essentially based on the statistical relationship between glacier melt and air temperature which is widely used on the tp zhao et al 2016 it is difficult for this model to explain the mass balance process and the parameters are difficult to extend to other glacial areas due to the significant spatio temporal differentiation of degree day factors zhang et al 2006 by contrast various physical processes such as radiation refreezing and sublimation are considered in the energy mass balance model which initially focused on a single point fujita and ageta 2000 sun et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 or along with different altitude belts of glacier on the tp yang et al 2013 liang et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 most distributed energy mass balance models were used in the short term simulation according to the in situ measurements synchronously for example jiang et al 2010 simulated the mass balance variation of qiyi glacier and discussed its response to climate change from 2007 6 30 to 2007 10 10 m√∂lg et al 2012 reconstructed the mass balance of zhadang glacier in 2010 2011 at present the disadvantages of energy balance model such as more data input requirements difficult parameter calibration and result verification are being overcome in combination with more in situ observations more studies have focused on reconstructing the mass balance series over past decades and exploring its relationship with climate change liang et al 2020 kronenberg et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 wu et al 2022 the effect of mass balance change on glacier morphology was minimal in short term simulation however glacier morphology variation should be considered in long term simulation especially when the ice loss accelerated with ongoing warming huss and hock 2018 the qilian mountains located in the northeast tp is the headwaters of inland rivers in northwest china zhang et al 2015 most glaciers are small and are extremely sensitive to climate change glacier runoff is one of the water supplies for the middle and lower reaches and has an important impact on the downstream oasis farming and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems immerzeel et al 2020 qiyi glacier a representative glacier with excellent basis of in situ observations is an ideal area to explore the long term glacier variation and its response to climate change in the qilian mountains in this study the series of mass balance and ice volume of qiyi glacier was simulated in 1980 2100 by developing a distributed energy mass balance model embm the aims are 1 to compare the differences of mass balance between the historical 1980 2020 and future 2021 2100 periods of qiyi glacier 2 to present spatial and temporal patterns of mass balance from the perspective of mass and energy 3 to project the glacier area ice thickness and volume for the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in the future and 4 to identify the timing of peak water using the synchronous glacier peak ice loss as a proxy 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qiyi glacier 39 5 n 97 5 e is located in the qilian mountains northeast of the tp fig 1a and is controlled by the mid latitude westerlies yao et al 2012 it is a typical continental glacier with the area of 2 53 km2 and axis length of 3 7 km and flows northwest from an altitude of 5159 m at the peak to 4304 m at its terminus guo et al 2015 in the qilian mountains 342 12 74 glaciers cover an area between 1 and 5 km2 which account for 42 44 of the total glacier area sun et al 2018 the mass balance has been continuously observed on qiyi glacier since 2001 pu et al 2005 yao et al 2012 wang et al 2020a in situ observation showed annual mass balance of qiyi glacier was generally positive before 1990s then turned negative pu et al 2005 yao et al 2012 and the most negative annual mass balance appeared in 2012 13 with a value of 1005 mm w e wang et al 2020a further the equilibrium line altitude ela of qiyi glacier rose 230 m in 1958 2008 and the highest ela 5131 m appeared in 2005 06 wang et al 2010 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 glacier mass balance measurements qiyi glacier was found in 1958 and the discontinuous mass balance observation was processed in 1970 1980s wang et al 1984 liu et al 1992 after 2000 the in situ measurements were successive and systematic pu et al 2005 yao et al 2012 wang et al 2020a a monthly mass balance had been conducted continuously since july 2011 for this study 26 stakes fig 1b were distributed along with altitude to observe mass balance by using the glaciological method paterson 1994 and mass balance of the entire glacier was calculated by yao et al 2012 in this study the energy mass balance model was calibrated and validated through the monthly mass balance data in 2011 2018 2 2 2 meteorological data multi source meteorological data include glacio meteorological data from an automatic weather station aws fig 1b five chinese meteorological stations data from national climatic data center http data cma cn fig 1a and outputs from the high asia refined analysis version 2 har v2 and the phase six of coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 the aws was operated at an altitude of 4763 m on the glacier surface the wind speed and direction air temperature relative humidity barometric pressure snow depth precipitation short and long wave radiation were recorded at intervals of 30 min and the data used herein was from 2011 7 25 to 2012 9 9 fig a1 synchronously the measured mass balance and glacio meteorological data were used for calibrating parameters in the energy mass balance model five chinese meteorological stations fig 1a around qiyi glacier were selected to obtain the meteorological forcing data in 1980 2020 and five climate variables including daily air temperature t precipitation pr wind speed ws relative humidity rh and incoming shortwave radiation s in were used in the embm it should be pointed out that only jiuquan station measured the daily radiation and the series was collected from 1990 to 2014 thus the daily incoming shortwave radiation of har v2 was used as a supplement the har v2 datasets which were generated by dynamical downscaling using the weather research and forecasting model presented high temporal spatial resolution 10 km 10 km 1 h wang et al 2020b in the grid of har v2 the raw data of each station were obtained through bilinear interpolation and were calibrated by using a statistically downscaling method section 2 3 1 based on radiation data from jiuquan station the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 launched by the world climate research programme wcrp includes 23 cmip6 endorsed mips zhou et al 2019 scenario model intercomparison project scenariomip is the primary activity within cmip6 and the cryospheric ablation and its global implications is one of scientific concerns scenariomip provides a new set of emissions and land use scenarios based on the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and improves the effect of aerosol on the recent climate change which is ignored in cmip5 o neill et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 in the current study 12 models table b1 with good performance on the tp zhang et al 2022a 2023 chen et al 2023 for ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 of cmip6 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 were selected to estimate future climate and the effect on glacier mass balance and ice volume three ssps represent the low 2 6 w m 2 moderate 4 5 w m 2 and high 8 5 w m 2 end of the range of plausible future forcing pathways respectively ssp1 2 6 combines the low societal vulnerability and pressure with a low forcing level i e sustainability ssp2 4 5 combines the intermediate societal vulnerability with an intermediate forcing level i e normal development and ssp5 8 5 combines the extremely high societal vulnerability and forcing level i e fossil fueled development in order to directly reflect the climate and glacier variation in different periods the research period 1980 2100 was divided into the baseline period 1980 2020 near future 2021 2060 and far future 2061 2100 and the future climate and glacier evolution are projected under above three ssps respectively 2 2 3 glacier boundary topography and ice thickness data in the long term glacier area presents significant effect on mass balance and ice volume four satellite images cloud free conditions in summer table b2 in 1986 1995 2005 and 2015 were selected to extract the boundaries of qiyi glacier to calibrate the glacier outlines in embm in different decades and the areas were 2 622 2 596 2 542 and 2 517 km2 respectively the topography information was obtained from advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem resolution 30 m all the images were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn the ice thickness of qiyi glacier was measured by the pulse ekko pro ground penetrating radar gpr in aug 2015 wei et al 2022 which presented excellent performance in other glaciers on tp in bayi glacier 130 km away from qiyi glacier the relative error of ice thickness measurement is less than 1 by comparing the length of ice cores wang and pu 2009 the qiyi glacier area was 2 517 km2 by gpr observation with an average ice thickness of 44 9 m and ice volume of 0 1129 km3 respectively wei et al 2022 farinotti et al 2019 published the global glacier ice thickness datasets by integrating multiple models the simulated ice thickness of qiyi glacier in this dataset was almost consistent with measurement with an average ice thickness of 44 6 m and ice volume of 0 1129 km3 respectively therefore the simulated ice thickness data was used as the initial value in this study for future simulations and the initial year was set to 2015 2 3 methods 2 3 1 the bias correction of the cmip6 outputs a statistically downscaling method bouwer et al 2004 zhao et al 2019 was used to correct the outputs of individual models in cmip6 by estimating a corrected factor based on the average and standard deviation of monthly data from 5 meteorological stations the corrected factor could be estimated by the following formula 1 Œ± sta m Œ± cmip 6 m Œ± cmip 6 m œÉ obs m œÉ cmip 6 m Œ± obs m where Œ± sta m is the corrected factor of a climate variable in a certain month m for a station sta Œ± cmip6 m is the raw monthly data for a climate variable in cmip6 ·æ± cmip6 m and œÉ cmip6 m are the average and standard deviation of the climate variables in cmip6 over a certain month respectively and ·æ± obs m and œÉ obs m are the average and standard deviation of observations in meteorological stations in the same period respectively the daily meteorological data could be corrected based on above corrected factor and the formulas are as follows 2 Œ± s t a d Œ± c m i p 6 d Œ± s t a m Œ± c m i p 6 m for pr rh and w s Œ± c m i p 6 m Œ± s t a m Œ± c m i p 6 m for t and s i n where Œ± sta d is the corrected daily d meteorological data of climate variables for the station sta Œ± cmip6 d is the raw daily outputs for climate variables in cmip6 the bias correction steps of the cmip6 outputs were firstly the raw meteorological data of cmip6 for each station were obtained by using the bilinear interpolation method according to the closest four grid points then the baseline period 1980 2020 was divided into calibration 1980 2009 validation 1 2010 2014 and validation 2 2015 2020 the corrected factor Œ± sta m was estimated by the data in the calibration and the daily data from cmip6 were corrected by using above downscaling method for calibration and validation respectively the performance of downscaling method was assessed by contrasting the daily corrected data with measured data and the determination coefficient r 2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc were selected as the evaluation indexes r 2 and rmse assess the variability and bias between simulations and observations respectively and nsc assess the performance of downscaling method as shown in table 1 the bias corrected t was almost consistent with station observations followed by s in ws and rh and the accuracy of pr was the worst there were remarkable differences for precipitation patterns among the mountains and plains on the northeast tp wang et al 2017 the corrected factor of precipitation was re estimated based on two mountain meteorological stations tuple and yeniugou fig 1b and the accuracy of re calibrated pr was improved in 1980 2020 r 2 was enhanced from 0 17 0 21 to 0 30 0 32 and nsc was also improved from 0 02 0 05 to 0 08 0 09 between station observations and multi model ensemble average however there were no significant differences for r 2 rmse and nsc between the calibration 1980 2009 and validation 2010 2020 table 1 and the accuracy reflected by some indicators was even superior in the validation thus the performance of downscaling method was satisfactory compared to the individual model multi model ensemble average was superior which was consistent with the previous reports phillips and gleckler 2006 su et al 2013 r 2 rmse and nsc of multi model ensemble average were all best for t and sd especially t with r 2 0 96 and nsc 0 91 for the rest three variables pr ws rh the precision was also higher than most individual models consequently multi model ensemble average was determined to be the climate forcing of the embm a the units of t pr s in ws are c mm w m 2 and m s 1 respectively and rh has no unit b the value before and after comma symbol represents the evaluation of 12 individual models and multi model ensemble average respectively 2 3 2 glacier energy mass balance model the embm was developed by fujita and ageta 2000 and the original model was used to simulate the mass balance in the specific elevation bands the glacier mass balance could be estimated over any period t with the following formula yang et al 2013 3 m b t q m l m q l l v c e n p s n o w d t where mb mm w e is the glacier mass balance q m w m 2 is the melt energy q l w m 2 is the turbulent latent heat flux associated with ice snow sublimation or deposition l m is the latent heat of ice melt 3 34 105 j kg 1 l v is the latent heat of evaporation or sublimation 2 83 106 j kg 1 or 2 50 106 j kg 1 c en mm w e is the glacial accumulation owing to the refreezing of melt water which is estimated by the model proposed by fujita et al 1996 and p snow mm w e is the solid precipitation which is distinguished by the threshold temperatures for snow rain transition kang et al 1999 q m is calculated by the surface energy balance equation 4 q m s i n 1 Œ± l i n l o u t q s q l q g where s in is the incoming shortwave radiation Œ± is the surface albedo l in and l out are the incoming and outgoing longwave radiation respectively q s and q l are the sensible and latent heat flux respectively and qg is the subsurface heat flux all components of energy balance are defined as positive when directed to the glacier surface and the units are w m 2 in this study the incoming shortwave radiation s in was divided into the direct radiation and diffuse radiation both components were estimated relating to geographic coordinates and topography appendix c oerlemans 1992 assumed the partitioning between direct and diffuse radiation depends linearly on cloudiness 80 of the incoming shortwave radiation was diffuse radiation in a cloudy day cloud cover was 100 but the percentage dropped to 15 in sunny days cloud cover was 0 further the terrain shading effect was determined by the ray tracing method arnold et al 1996 both direct and diffuse radiation reached the glacier surface without terrain shading but only diffuse radiation could reach the glacier surface with terrain shading hock and holmgren 2005 a distributed energy mass balance model with spatial and temporal resolution of 30 m and 1 day was built by parameterizing all the mass balance and energy components the detailed methods and key parameters were shown in the appendix c and table b3 when the accumulated glacier mass loss at a grid exceeds the water equivalent of ice thickness the glacier extent decreases accordingly in a long term the impact of glacier area evolution on ice volume could not be ignored taking 2015 as the base year i e glacier area and ice thickness in 2015 were set as the initial values of embm the simulated previous year mass balance was added as the driving force into the embm to continuously update the initial glacier area to ensure the arithmetic speed and precision the glacier area is updated every two years 3 results and discussion 3 1 future climate change variations in glacier area averaged annual air temperature and precipitation are shown in fig 2 and table 2 after bias correction the uncertainty of climate projections is reduced by using the multi model ensemble average rather than 12 individual models compared to 1980 2020 the glacier area averaged air temperature has gone up 1 02 1 57 c in 2021 2060 with a rising rate of 0 26 0 60 c 10 yr 1 under three ssps scenarios the glacier area averaged precipitation has enhanced 53 24 65 63 mm in 2021 2060 with a rising rate of 8 06 12 63 mm 10 yr 1 under three ssps scenarios for the far future 2061 2100 glacier area averaged air temperature and precipitation will reach peak for ssp1 2 6 scenario in 2060s however the uptrend of air temperature and precipitation are more significant for ssp5 8 5 scenario in the far future with the increasing rate of 0 81 c 10 yr 1 and 17 43 mm 10 yr 1 respectively further the proportion of future snowfall to the total precipitation will decrease significantly snowfall accounted for 76 of the total precipitation from 1980 to 2020 and will decrease to 37 41 in 2021 2060 and 23 38 in 2061 2100 3 2 3 2 performance of embm to evaluate the performance of embm measured mass balances at multiple spatio temporal scales including monthly point mass balance fig 3 and fig 1b annual mass balance at different altitudes fig 4 and glacier wide mass balance fig 5 were compared with simulated mass balance as shown in fig 1b 5 stakes along the glacier flowline were chosen at different altitudes to simulate the accumulated mass balance from 2011 to 2018 the embm well simulated the seasonal pattern of point accumulated mass balance fig 3 in the ablation area stakes 1 3 the simulated mass balance was consistent with in situ measurements by comparing simulations driven by station observations or bias corrected cmip6 outputs and measurements of 2011 2014 or 2015 2018 table b4 r 2 was 0 68 0 92 rmse was 0 09 0 20 m w e and nsc was 0 46 0 84 the firn basin stakes 4 5 with higher elevation around or above the equilibrium line attitude ela presented slightly lower simulation accuracy than that in ablation area especially in 2011 11 2013 07 and 2017 07 2018 07 fig 3 the r 2 and nsc reduced to 0 38 0 80 and 0 13 0 60 respectively the bias may be caused by snowdrift in the firn basin qiyi glacier is a summer accumulation glacier the maximum of seasonal ablation and accumulation occur in summer ageta and higuchi 1984 fujita 2008 precipitation in the warm season may sep accounts for 91 5 of the year and snowfall accounts for 67 8 the influence of snowdrift on mass balance is slight in the ablation area because snow melts rapidly in summer and rarely falls in winter the concave terrain of the firn basin is prone to accumulating snow induced by snowdrift at higher elevation which greatly impacts the seasonal variation of accumulation and ablation and may lead to uncertainty in the simulation outcomes fig 4 illustrates the simulated and measured mass balance along with different altitudes of qiyi glacier in the seven mass balance years the simulated mass balance was basically consistent with the measurements at different altitudes especially for the outputs driven by station observations which almost perfectly reproduced the mass balance gradient however the projected mass balance driven by data of climate scenarios illustrated lower accuracy mass balance was overestimated at low altitudes except in 2014 2015 and underestimated at high altitudes as to the glacier wide mass balance fig 5 multi year average mass balance from in situ measurements was 382 mm w e while the simulation was 334 mm w e the bias was 25 112 and 19 mm w e in 1980s 2000s and 2010s respectively the larger bias in 2000s came from overestimates in certain years with extreme negative mass balance 2001 02 2005 06 and 2012 13 consequently the performance of calibrated embm is satisfactory from 1980 to 2020 3 3 variation in mass balance in 1980 2100 by using the embm the annual mass balance series in 1980 2020 were reconstructed and future mass balance was projected for the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in 2021 2100 fig 5 the average mass balance of qiyi glacier was 306 mm w e and the series decreased by 11 2 mm w e yr 1 in 1980 2020 combined cumulative departure curve and mann kendall test the time series in 1980 2020 showed an abrupt point in 1992 93 and the annual average mass balance was 97 and 416 mm w e in 1980 1992 and 1993 2020 respectively it is consistent with in situ measurements shifted from positive to negative in the 1990s pu et al 2005 yao et al 2012 in the future 2021 2100 a more negative trend of mass balance continues at least until mid 2040s with the linear decrease rate of 12 3 11 9 and 16 9 mm w e yr 1 for ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively subsequently the mass loss tends to slow down for ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 scenarios due to the shrinkage of ablation area while accelerate under the ssp5 8 5 scenario due to warmer and wetter climate conditions mass balance is more negative in 2021 2100 than that in the baseline period 1980 2020 and the average mass balance will increase by a factor of 1 08 1 67 and 2 68 for the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively 3 4 mass and energy balance characteristics figs 6 and 7 show the variations in monthly and multi year average mass balance components of qiyi glacier in 1980 2020 and 2021 2100 in 1980 2020 annual ablation was dominated by surface melt 430 mm w e followed by sublimation or evaporation 253 mm w e while annual accumulation was consisted of snowfall 349 mm w e and refreezing 27 mm w e for the ssp1 2 6 scenario in 2021 2100 both the components of annual mass balance and seasonal pattern are similar with those in 1980 2020 beyond that future mass balance tends to be more negative due to more ablation and less accumulation the increase of surface melt is absolutely dominant with the growth of 367 879 mm w e 85 205 for three climate scenarios less snowfall is the second reason although future annual precipitation increases by 12 20 the proportion of snowfall dropped from 76 to 37 49 sublimation evaporation increase 64 mm w e and refreezing decrease 16 mm w e have limited effect on future mass balance for the seasonal pattern of mass balance 98 of surface melt concentrated in summer jun aug and 89 of snowfall concentrated in the warm season may sep in 1980 2020 future surface melt will increase rapidly and snowfall reduce sharply in jul and aug using the historical reconstruction 1980 2020 as the basis for future projections surface melt for ssp5 8 5 scenario in 2061 2100 will increase a factor of 2 9 while snowfall almost disappear 5 5 mm mass balance in jun and sep in 1980 2020 was positive then will turn negative in most future periods in the cold season oct apr the sublimation evaporation leads to the slight negative mass balance in 1980 2100 figs 8 and 9 present the variations in monthly and multi year average energy balance of qiyi glacier in 1980 2020 and 2021 2100 for the annual energy balance components in 1980 2020 the largest incoming energy source was the net shortwave radiation 67 7 w m 2 followed by the sensible heat flux 26 6 w m 2 and subsurface heat flux 5 0 w m 2 the largest outgoing energy source was the net longwave radiation 61 2 w m 2 followed by the latent heat flux 22 4 w m 2 annual melt energy in the future will increase by 46 116 for three climate scenarios the extra energy mainly came from the net shortwave radiation with an increase of 12 6 21 3 w m 2 19 31 the variation of rest energy components is less than 6 w m 2 the net shortwave radiation is lower in summer due to more cloudy weather and the energy loss of net longwave radiation in summer is also lower than that in other seasons in the future summer the net shortwave radiation increases 9 2 26 1 w m 2 12 33 and the energy loss of net longwave radiation reduces 6 68 a larger proportion of liquid precipitation table 2 will reduce albedo of glacier surface through both snow surface moistening and snow covered area reduction 3 5 future variations in ice thickness area and volume of qiyi glacier driven by outputs of 12 model ensemble average in cmip6 and glacier morphology updated every two years the variations in ice thickness area and volume of qiyi glacier are projected for ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in 2015 2100 by using the calibrated embm as shown in figs 10 and 11 qiyi glacier presents various degrees of shrinkage and mass loss under three ssps scenarios for the ssp1 2 6 scenario the average ice thickness is 41 43 24 87 15 42 15 96 and 17 55 m in 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 respectively the glacier area is 2 52 2 24 1 17 0 50 and 0 30 km2 and the ice volume is 104 28 106 92 4 55 71 106 49 4 18 106 15 9 7 98 106 7 1 and 5 29 106 4 7 m3 for the ssp2 4 5 scenario the average ice thickness is 40 88 24 59 13 59 12 96 and 8 72 m in 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 respectively the glacier area is 2 52 2 25 1 13 0 31 and 0 09 km2 and the ice volume is 102 9 106 91 1 55 28 106 49 15 42 106 13 7 4 07 106 3 6 and 0 78 106 0 7 m3 for the ssp5 8 5 scenario qiyi glacier will disappear in 2082 the average ice thickness is 40 55 22 53 9 38 and 16 9 m in 2020 2040 2060 and 2080 respectively the glacier area is 2 52 2 18 0 74 and 0 02 km2 and the ice volume is 102 08 106 90 4 49 08 106 43 5 6 93 106 6 1 and 0 34 106 0 3 m3 time series of ice volume in 2015 2100 show a similar trend for ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios fig 12 i e the ice volume loss increases firstly then decreases and finally tends to the minimum after 2070 due to glacier intensive shrinkage according to the departure curve glacier mass loss is substantial for all scenarios from 2020 to mid 2050s further mass loss grows significantly from mid 2020s to early 2050s by using mann kendall test finally the data is smoothed through negative exponential to eliminate noise we project the peak mass loss of qiyi glacier falls from 2030 to 2045 for all scenarios fig 12 in arid and semi arid regions glacier runoff is a significant contributor to runoff glacier meltwater supply 48 of runoff in the headwaters of indus river on the western tp liu et al 2017 40 in tarim river kang 2002 and 10 30 from east to west in qilian mountains qin 2002 peak water refers to the timing of glacier peak mass loss which is a critical variable for water resources planning and management in catchments before peak water glaciers are expected to keep shrinking due to ongoing climate warming it not only increases the available water resources but also increases the risk of landslide debris flow glacial lake outburst flood and glacier collapse tian et al 2017 bazai et al 2021 lei et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b for example in the headwaters of indus river more than 50 of the increasing runoff will originate from glacier meltwater lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 two glaciers in the aru range on the western tp collapsed in 2016 causing fatal damage to local people and their livestock tian et al 2017 lei et al 2021 after peak water ice volume will significantly decrease glaciers will accelerate to shrink until disappear and the meltwater will continue to decrease water demand for agriculture is expected to increase as climate warming however inadequate water resources pose a potential threat to food security immerzeel et al 2020 there are large uncertainties in projections of glacier evolution especially for the peak water one uncertainty is climate forcing especially precipitation huss et al 2014 for example lutz et al 2014 reported that ice loss in the upper indus river would continue to increase before 2050 but this conclusion was overturned after updating model driven data for the rcp 8 5 scenario in cmip5 and the downscaling methods lutz et al 2016 spatio temporal pattern of precipitation at high altitudes is controlled by orography the change is difficult to accurately capture due to coarse resolution van tiel et al 2020 in this study downscaling precipitation showed larger bias and range than other climate variables table 1 compared to multi model ensemble average average annual precipitation of individual climate model in 2021 2100 ranges from 33 to 53 the other uncertainty is from models and parameters for most headwaters on the tp including yangtze yellow lantsang salween and brahmaputra rivers zhao et al 2019 reported that glaciers were likely experiencing or will soon from early 2000 2020s experience the most intense ice loss huss and hock 2018 projected that the peak water will occur not earlier than 2050 su et al 2016 concluded that glacier mass loss will continue to increase in 2015 2100 in these studies glacier melt was simulated using the degree day factor model at the large river basin scale degree day factors are considered as the largest uncertainty source of projections zhao et al 2019 degree day factors are often obtained from in situ observation of several glaciers making it difficult to accurately estimate glacier mass loss at a large scale due to spatial heterogeneity ramanathan and carmichael 2008 at the individual glacier additional uncertainty may originate from glacier area evolution combined degree day factor model with volume area scaling approach shi et al 2020 projected that ice loss of dongkemadi glacier in the central tp would reach peak not prior to 2030 gao et al 2021 reported that the peak mass loss of dongkemadi glacier was around 2060 2085 using degree day factor model and another area evolution scheme Œ¥h parameterization huss et al 2010 in this study a distributed energy mass balance model was developed to project the variations of mass balance and ice volume of qiyi glacier and the peak mass loss may fall from 2030 to 2045 as a classic case it not only deepens the understanding of glacier evolution worldwide but also presents important reference for the development allocation and sustainability of regional water resources 4 conclusions based on in situ observations glacier meteorology and mass balance of qiyi glacier combined with glacier boundary topography and ice thickness data a distributed energy mass balance model with the spatio temporal resolution of 30 m and 1 day was developed in the model the glacier morphology was updated on every two years based on simulated mass balance and initial ice thickness driven by station observations the series of mass balance and ice volume in 1980 2020 were reconstructed and the series for the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in 2021 2100 were forecast driven by 12 model ensemble average in cmip6 the results showed the multi year average mass balance of qiyi glacier was 306 mm w e in 1980 2020 and increased by a factor of 1 08 1 67 and 2 68 in 2021 2100 for the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively the primary reason for more negative future mass balance is surface melt increase in summer followed by snowfall decrease the higher air temperature and less snowfall in summer lead to albedo reduction of glacier surface thus the net shortwave radiation increases 12 33 for three climate scenarios resulting in the increase of 46 116 for annual melt energy by the end of the 21st century qiyi glacier volume will only remain 5 29 106 4 7 m3 for the ssp1 2 6 scenario and 0 78 106 0 7 m3 for the ssp2 4 5 scenario for the ssp5 8 5 scenario qiyi glacier will disappear in 2082 ice loss will reach peak around 2030 2045 then decrease in parallel with volume reduction the total uncertainty in projections is mainly from climate forcing and glacier models for the individual glacier since the model parameters calibration is often based on short term observation the uncertainties associated with model parameters can be significant continuous and large scale field glacier measurements is the key to improve the projection reliability in future study the field observation of qiyi glacier will continue and extend to other regions of the tp the projections of glacier mass balance and ice volume will expand to the qilian mountains and even the entire tp this persistent work will improve understanding on future glacier variation in the region with scarce measured data and provide scientific support for sustainable development and utilization of water resources in arid and semi arid

7665,study region qiyi glacier in the qilian mountains northeast tibetan plateau study focus future glacier changes are critical to the sustainable use of regional water resources and the survival and development of the densely populated tibetan plateau and surrounding regions a distributed energy mass balance model is applied to simulate the historical and future mass balance and ice volume of qiyi glacier from 1980 to 2100 the aims of this study are to illuminate the spatial and temporal patterns of mass balance and energy balance to forecast future changes of this glacier under different scenarios of cmip6 and to identify the timing of peak ice loss new hydrological insights for the region compared to the historical reconstruction future projections show that ablation will increase and accumulation will decrease due to less snowfall and increased net shortwave radiation that is induced by lower albedos the average mass balance increases by a factor of 1 08 1 67 and 2 68 under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios during 2021 2100 respectively by the end of the 21st century qiyi glacier ice volume will reduce by 107 61 106 m3 95 3 for the ssp1 2 6 scenario and 112 12 106 m3 99 3 for the ssp2 4 5 scenario and will disappear entirely by 2082 for the ssp5 8 5 scenario in all scenarios the glacier mass loss rate will peak around 2030 2045 then decrease in parallel with the decreasing ice volume graphical abstract ga1 keywords glacier modeling glacier mass balance energy balance cmip6 qiyi glacier data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp and its surroundings are sometimes referred to as the asian water tower which not only support the largest number of glaciers outside of the polar regions yao et al 2012 but also serve as the headwaters of many prominent asian rivers xu et al 2008 among the global mountain ranges the glacier mass loss of the asian water tower in the recent decade was ranked second next to the glacier mass loss observed in the southern andes ipcc 2021 it is projected that the tp will be the largest contributor to global sea level rise among mountain regions in 2015 2100 rounce et al 2020 glacier state of asian water tower had undergone imbalance variation in the spatial and temporal pattern yao et al 2022 most glaciers on the eastern tp are experiencing varying degrees of ice loss and area shrinkage yao et al 2012 neckel et al 2017 maurer et al 2019 the accelerated glacier ablation will increase runoff in the short term leading to the instability of regional water cycle and water resources supply however glacier runoff will reach the maximum peak water gleick and palaniappan 2010 at some moment in the future then will decrease and more than 2 billion people living in the regions will face water shortages biemans et al 2019 pritchard et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2020 glacier mass balance is the connection between energy ice and water exchange and is the mass basis of future glacier variation therefore accurate modeling and future projections of glacier mass balance and ice volume are critical to regional water sustainability numerical simulation especially the distributed model is an effective method to study the future glacier mass change and its response to climate change at present the degree day factor model and energy mass balance model are two main methods for simulating glacier mass change the degree day factor model is essentially based on the statistical relationship between glacier melt and air temperature which is widely used on the tp zhao et al 2016 it is difficult for this model to explain the mass balance process and the parameters are difficult to extend to other glacial areas due to the significant spatio temporal differentiation of degree day factors zhang et al 2006 by contrast various physical processes such as radiation refreezing and sublimation are considered in the energy mass balance model which initially focused on a single point fujita and ageta 2000 sun et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 or along with different altitude belts of glacier on the tp yang et al 2013 liang et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 most distributed energy mass balance models were used in the short term simulation according to the in situ measurements synchronously for example jiang et al 2010 simulated the mass balance variation of qiyi glacier and discussed its response to climate change from 2007 6 30 to 2007 10 10 m√∂lg et al 2012 reconstructed the mass balance of zhadang glacier in 2010 2011 at present the disadvantages of energy balance model such as more data input requirements difficult parameter calibration and result verification are being overcome in combination with more in situ observations more studies have focused on reconstructing the mass balance series over past decades and exploring its relationship with climate change liang et al 2020 kronenberg et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 wu et al 2022 the effect of mass balance change on glacier morphology was minimal in short term simulation however glacier morphology variation should be considered in long term simulation especially when the ice loss accelerated with ongoing warming huss and hock 2018 the qilian mountains located in the northeast tp is the headwaters of inland rivers in northwest china zhang et al 2015 most glaciers are small and are extremely sensitive to climate change glacier runoff is one of the water supplies for the middle and lower reaches and has an important impact on the downstream oasis farming and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems immerzeel et al 2020 qiyi glacier a representative glacier with excellent basis of in situ observations is an ideal area to explore the long term glacier variation and its response to climate change in the qilian mountains in this study the series of mass balance and ice volume of qiyi glacier was simulated in 1980 2100 by developing a distributed energy mass balance model embm the aims are 1 to compare the differences of mass balance between the historical 1980 2020 and future 2021 2100 periods of qiyi glacier 2 to present spatial and temporal patterns of mass balance from the perspective of mass and energy 3 to project the glacier area ice thickness and volume for the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in the future and 4 to identify the timing of peak water using the synchronous glacier peak ice loss as a proxy 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qiyi glacier 39 5 n 97 5 e is located in the qilian mountains northeast of the tp fig 1a and is controlled by the mid latitude westerlies yao et al 2012 it is a typical continental glacier with the area of 2 53 km2 and axis length of 3 7 km and flows northwest from an altitude of 5159 m at the peak to 4304 m at its terminus guo et al 2015 in the qilian mountains 342 12 74 glaciers cover an area between 1 and 5 km2 which account for 42 44 of the total glacier area sun et al 2018 the mass balance has been continuously observed on qiyi glacier since 2001 pu et al 2005 yao et al 2012 wang et al 2020a in situ observation showed annual mass balance of qiyi glacier was generally positive before 1990s then turned negative pu et al 2005 yao et al 2012 and the most negative annual mass balance appeared in 2012 13 with a value of 1005 mm w e wang et al 2020a further the equilibrium line altitude ela of qiyi glacier rose 230 m in 1958 2008 and the highest ela 5131 m appeared in 2005 06 wang et al 2010 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 glacier mass balance measurements qiyi glacier was found in 1958 and the discontinuous mass balance observation was processed in 1970 1980s wang et al 1984 liu et al 1992 after 2000 the in situ measurements were successive and systematic pu et al 2005 yao et al 2012 wang et al 2020a a monthly mass balance had been conducted continuously since july 2011 for this study 26 stakes fig 1b were distributed along with altitude to observe mass balance by using the glaciological method paterson 1994 and mass balance of the entire glacier was calculated by yao et al 2012 in this study the energy mass balance model was calibrated and validated through the monthly mass balance data in 2011 2018 2 2 2 meteorological data multi source meteorological data include glacio meteorological data from an automatic weather station aws fig 1b five chinese meteorological stations data from national climatic data center http data cma cn fig 1a and outputs from the high asia refined analysis version 2 har v2 and the phase six of coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 the aws was operated at an altitude of 4763 m on the glacier surface the wind speed and direction air temperature relative humidity barometric pressure snow depth precipitation short and long wave radiation were recorded at intervals of 30 min and the data used herein was from 2011 7 25 to 2012 9 9 fig a1 synchronously the measured mass balance and glacio meteorological data were used for calibrating parameters in the energy mass balance model five chinese meteorological stations fig 1a around qiyi glacier were selected to obtain the meteorological forcing data in 1980 2020 and five climate variables including daily air temperature t precipitation pr wind speed ws relative humidity rh and incoming shortwave radiation s in were used in the embm it should be pointed out that only jiuquan station measured the daily radiation and the series was collected from 1990 to 2014 thus the daily incoming shortwave radiation of har v2 was used as a supplement the har v2 datasets which were generated by dynamical downscaling using the weather research and forecasting model presented high temporal spatial resolution 10 km 10 km 1 h wang et al 2020b in the grid of har v2 the raw data of each station were obtained through bilinear interpolation and were calibrated by using a statistically downscaling method section 2 3 1 based on radiation data from jiuquan station the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 launched by the world climate research programme wcrp includes 23 cmip6 endorsed mips zhou et al 2019 scenario model intercomparison project scenariomip is the primary activity within cmip6 and the cryospheric ablation and its global implications is one of scientific concerns scenariomip provides a new set of emissions and land use scenarios based on the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and improves the effect of aerosol on the recent climate change which is ignored in cmip5 o neill et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 in the current study 12 models table b1 with good performance on the tp zhang et al 2022a 2023 chen et al 2023 for ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 of cmip6 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 were selected to estimate future climate and the effect on glacier mass balance and ice volume three ssps represent the low 2 6 w m 2 moderate 4 5 w m 2 and high 8 5 w m 2 end of the range of plausible future forcing pathways respectively ssp1 2 6 combines the low societal vulnerability and pressure with a low forcing level i e sustainability ssp2 4 5 combines the intermediate societal vulnerability with an intermediate forcing level i e normal development and ssp5 8 5 combines the extremely high societal vulnerability and forcing level i e fossil fueled development in order to directly reflect the climate and glacier variation in different periods the research period 1980 2100 was divided into the baseline period 1980 2020 near future 2021 2060 and far future 2061 2100 and the future climate and glacier evolution are projected under above three ssps respectively 2 2 3 glacier boundary topography and ice thickness data in the long term glacier area presents significant effect on mass balance and ice volume four satellite images cloud free conditions in summer table b2 in 1986 1995 2005 and 2015 were selected to extract the boundaries of qiyi glacier to calibrate the glacier outlines in embm in different decades and the areas were 2 622 2 596 2 542 and 2 517 km2 respectively the topography information was obtained from advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem resolution 30 m all the images were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn the ice thickness of qiyi glacier was measured by the pulse ekko pro ground penetrating radar gpr in aug 2015 wei et al 2022 which presented excellent performance in other glaciers on tp in bayi glacier 130 km away from qiyi glacier the relative error of ice thickness measurement is less than 1 by comparing the length of ice cores wang and pu 2009 the qiyi glacier area was 2 517 km2 by gpr observation with an average ice thickness of 44 9 m and ice volume of 0 1129 km3 respectively wei et al 2022 farinotti et al 2019 published the global glacier ice thickness datasets by integrating multiple models the simulated ice thickness of qiyi glacier in this dataset was almost consistent with measurement with an average ice thickness of 44 6 m and ice volume of 0 1129 km3 respectively therefore the simulated ice thickness data was used as the initial value in this study for future simulations and the initial year was set to 2015 2 3 methods 2 3 1 the bias correction of the cmip6 outputs a statistically downscaling method bouwer et al 2004 zhao et al 2019 was used to correct the outputs of individual models in cmip6 by estimating a corrected factor based on the average and standard deviation of monthly data from 5 meteorological stations the corrected factor could be estimated by the following formula 1 Œ± sta m Œ± cmip 6 m Œ± cmip 6 m œÉ obs m œÉ cmip 6 m Œ± obs m where Œ± sta m is the corrected factor of a climate variable in a certain month m for a station sta Œ± cmip6 m is the raw monthly data for a climate variable in cmip6 ·æ± cmip6 m and œÉ cmip6 m are the average and standard deviation of the climate variables in cmip6 over a certain month respectively and ·æ± obs m and œÉ obs m are the average and standard deviation of observations in meteorological stations in the same period respectively the daily meteorological data could be corrected based on above corrected factor and the formulas are as follows 2 Œ± s t a d Œ± c m i p 6 d Œ± s t a m Œ± c m i p 6 m for pr rh and w s Œ± c m i p 6 m Œ± s t a m Œ± c m i p 6 m for t and s i n where Œ± sta d is the corrected daily d meteorological data of climate variables for the station sta Œ± cmip6 d is the raw daily outputs for climate variables in cmip6 the bias correction steps of the cmip6 outputs were firstly the raw meteorological data of cmip6 for each station were obtained by using the bilinear interpolation method according to the closest four grid points then the baseline period 1980 2020 was divided into calibration 1980 2009 validation 1 2010 2014 and validation 2 2015 2020 the corrected factor Œ± sta m was estimated by the data in the calibration and the daily data from cmip6 were corrected by using above downscaling method for calibration and validation respectively the performance of downscaling method was assessed by contrasting the daily corrected data with measured data and the determination coefficient r 2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc were selected as the evaluation indexes r 2 and rmse assess the variability and bias between simulations and observations respectively and nsc assess the performance of downscaling method as shown in table 1 the bias corrected t was almost consistent with station observations followed by s in ws and rh and the accuracy of pr was the worst there were remarkable differences for precipitation patterns among the mountains and plains on the northeast tp wang et al 2017 the corrected factor of precipitation was re estimated based on two mountain meteorological stations tuple and yeniugou fig 1b and the accuracy of re calibrated pr was improved in 1980 2020 r 2 was enhanced from 0 17 0 21 to 0 30 0 32 and nsc was also improved from 0 02 0 05 to 0 08 0 09 between station observations and multi model ensemble average however there were no significant differences for r 2 rmse and nsc between the calibration 1980 2009 and validation 2010 2020 table 1 and the accuracy reflected by some indicators was even superior in the validation thus the performance of downscaling method was satisfactory compared to the individual model multi model ensemble average was superior which was consistent with the previous reports phillips and gleckler 2006 su et al 2013 r 2 rmse and nsc of multi model ensemble average were all best for t and sd especially t with r 2 0 96 and nsc 0 91 for the rest three variables pr ws rh the precision was also higher than most individual models consequently multi model ensemble average was determined to be the climate forcing of the embm a the units of t pr s in ws are c mm w m 2 and m s 1 respectively and rh has no unit b the value before and after comma symbol represents the evaluation of 12 individual models and multi model ensemble average respectively 2 3 2 glacier energy mass balance model the embm was developed by fujita and ageta 2000 and the original model was used to simulate the mass balance in the specific elevation bands the glacier mass balance could be estimated over any period t with the following formula yang et al 2013 3 m b t q m l m q l l v c e n p s n o w d t where mb mm w e is the glacier mass balance q m w m 2 is the melt energy q l w m 2 is the turbulent latent heat flux associated with ice snow sublimation or deposition l m is the latent heat of ice melt 3 34 105 j kg 1 l v is the latent heat of evaporation or sublimation 2 83 106 j kg 1 or 2 50 106 j kg 1 c en mm w e is the glacial accumulation owing to the refreezing of melt water which is estimated by the model proposed by fujita et al 1996 and p snow mm w e is the solid precipitation which is distinguished by the threshold temperatures for snow rain transition kang et al 1999 q m is calculated by the surface energy balance equation 4 q m s i n 1 Œ± l i n l o u t q s q l q g where s in is the incoming shortwave radiation Œ± is the surface albedo l in and l out are the incoming and outgoing longwave radiation respectively q s and q l are the sensible and latent heat flux respectively and qg is the subsurface heat flux all components of energy balance are defined as positive when directed to the glacier surface and the units are w m 2 in this study the incoming shortwave radiation s in was divided into the direct radiation and diffuse radiation both components were estimated relating to geographic coordinates and topography appendix c oerlemans 1992 assumed the partitioning between direct and diffuse radiation depends linearly on cloudiness 80 of the incoming shortwave radiation was diffuse radiation in a cloudy day cloud cover was 100 but the percentage dropped to 15 in sunny days cloud cover was 0 further the terrain shading effect was determined by the ray tracing method arnold et al 1996 both direct and diffuse radiation reached the glacier surface without terrain shading but only diffuse radiation could reach the glacier surface with terrain shading hock and holmgren 2005 a distributed energy mass balance model with spatial and temporal resolution of 30 m and 1 day was built by parameterizing all the mass balance and energy components the detailed methods and key parameters were shown in the appendix c and table b3 when the accumulated glacier mass loss at a grid exceeds the water equivalent of ice thickness the glacier extent decreases accordingly in a long term the impact of glacier area evolution on ice volume could not be ignored taking 2015 as the base year i e glacier area and ice thickness in 2015 were set as the initial values of embm the simulated previous year mass balance was added as the driving force into the embm to continuously update the initial glacier area to ensure the arithmetic speed and precision the glacier area is updated every two years 3 results and discussion 3 1 future climate change variations in glacier area averaged annual air temperature and precipitation are shown in fig 2 and table 2 after bias correction the uncertainty of climate projections is reduced by using the multi model ensemble average rather than 12 individual models compared to 1980 2020 the glacier area averaged air temperature has gone up 1 02 1 57 c in 2021 2060 with a rising rate of 0 26 0 60 c 10 yr 1 under three ssps scenarios the glacier area averaged precipitation has enhanced 53 24 65 63 mm in 2021 2060 with a rising rate of 8 06 12 63 mm 10 yr 1 under three ssps scenarios for the far future 2061 2100 glacier area averaged air temperature and precipitation will reach peak for ssp1 2 6 scenario in 2060s however the uptrend of air temperature and precipitation are more significant for ssp5 8 5 scenario in the far future with the increasing rate of 0 81 c 10 yr 1 and 17 43 mm 10 yr 1 respectively further the proportion of future snowfall to the total precipitation will decrease significantly snowfall accounted for 76 of the total precipitation from 1980 to 2020 and will decrease to 37 41 in 2021 2060 and 23 38 in 2061 2100 3 2 3 2 performance of embm to evaluate the performance of embm measured mass balances at multiple spatio temporal scales including monthly point mass balance fig 3 and fig 1b annual mass balance at different altitudes fig 4 and glacier wide mass balance fig 5 were compared with simulated mass balance as shown in fig 1b 5 stakes along the glacier flowline were chosen at different altitudes to simulate the accumulated mass balance from 2011 to 2018 the embm well simulated the seasonal pattern of point accumulated mass balance fig 3 in the ablation area stakes 1 3 the simulated mass balance was consistent with in situ measurements by comparing simulations driven by station observations or bias corrected cmip6 outputs and measurements of 2011 2014 or 2015 2018 table b4 r 2 was 0 68 0 92 rmse was 0 09 0 20 m w e and nsc was 0 46 0 84 the firn basin stakes 4 5 with higher elevation around or above the equilibrium line attitude ela presented slightly lower simulation accuracy than that in ablation area especially in 2011 11 2013 07 and 2017 07 2018 07 fig 3 the r 2 and nsc reduced to 0 38 0 80 and 0 13 0 60 respectively the bias may be caused by snowdrift in the firn basin qiyi glacier is a summer accumulation glacier the maximum of seasonal ablation and accumulation occur in summer ageta and higuchi 1984 fujita 2008 precipitation in the warm season may sep accounts for 91 5 of the year and snowfall accounts for 67 8 the influence of snowdrift on mass balance is slight in the ablation area because snow melts rapidly in summer and rarely falls in winter the concave terrain of the firn basin is prone to accumulating snow induced by snowdrift at higher elevation which greatly impacts the seasonal variation of accumulation and ablation and may lead to uncertainty in the simulation outcomes fig 4 illustrates the simulated and measured mass balance along with different altitudes of qiyi glacier in the seven mass balance years the simulated mass balance was basically consistent with the measurements at different altitudes especially for the outputs driven by station observations which almost perfectly reproduced the mass balance gradient however the projected mass balance driven by data of climate scenarios illustrated lower accuracy mass balance was overestimated at low altitudes except in 2014 2015 and underestimated at high altitudes as to the glacier wide mass balance fig 5 multi year average mass balance from in situ measurements was 382 mm w e while the simulation was 334 mm w e the bias was 25 112 and 19 mm w e in 1980s 2000s and 2010s respectively the larger bias in 2000s came from overestimates in certain years with extreme negative mass balance 2001 02 2005 06 and 2012 13 consequently the performance of calibrated embm is satisfactory from 1980 to 2020 3 3 variation in mass balance in 1980 2100 by using the embm the annual mass balance series in 1980 2020 were reconstructed and future mass balance was projected for the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in 2021 2100 fig 5 the average mass balance of qiyi glacier was 306 mm w e and the series decreased by 11 2 mm w e yr 1 in 1980 2020 combined cumulative departure curve and mann kendall test the time series in 1980 2020 showed an abrupt point in 1992 93 and the annual average mass balance was 97 and 416 mm w e in 1980 1992 and 1993 2020 respectively it is consistent with in situ measurements shifted from positive to negative in the 1990s pu et al 2005 yao et al 2012 in the future 2021 2100 a more negative trend of mass balance continues at least until mid 2040s with the linear decrease rate of 12 3 11 9 and 16 9 mm w e yr 1 for ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively subsequently the mass loss tends to slow down for ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 scenarios due to the shrinkage of ablation area while accelerate under the ssp5 8 5 scenario due to warmer and wetter climate conditions mass balance is more negative in 2021 2100 than that in the baseline period 1980 2020 and the average mass balance will increase by a factor of 1 08 1 67 and 2 68 for the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively 3 4 mass and energy balance characteristics figs 6 and 7 show the variations in monthly and multi year average mass balance components of qiyi glacier in 1980 2020 and 2021 2100 in 1980 2020 annual ablation was dominated by surface melt 430 mm w e followed by sublimation or evaporation 253 mm w e while annual accumulation was consisted of snowfall 349 mm w e and refreezing 27 mm w e for the ssp1 2 6 scenario in 2021 2100 both the components of annual mass balance and seasonal pattern are similar with those in 1980 2020 beyond that future mass balance tends to be more negative due to more ablation and less accumulation the increase of surface melt is absolutely dominant with the growth of 367 879 mm w e 85 205 for three climate scenarios less snowfall is the second reason although future annual precipitation increases by 12 20 the proportion of snowfall dropped from 76 to 37 49 sublimation evaporation increase 64 mm w e and refreezing decrease 16 mm w e have limited effect on future mass balance for the seasonal pattern of mass balance 98 of surface melt concentrated in summer jun aug and 89 of snowfall concentrated in the warm season may sep in 1980 2020 future surface melt will increase rapidly and snowfall reduce sharply in jul and aug using the historical reconstruction 1980 2020 as the basis for future projections surface melt for ssp5 8 5 scenario in 2061 2100 will increase a factor of 2 9 while snowfall almost disappear 5 5 mm mass balance in jun and sep in 1980 2020 was positive then will turn negative in most future periods in the cold season oct apr the sublimation evaporation leads to the slight negative mass balance in 1980 2100 figs 8 and 9 present the variations in monthly and multi year average energy balance of qiyi glacier in 1980 2020 and 2021 2100 for the annual energy balance components in 1980 2020 the largest incoming energy source was the net shortwave radiation 67 7 w m 2 followed by the sensible heat flux 26 6 w m 2 and subsurface heat flux 5 0 w m 2 the largest outgoing energy source was the net longwave radiation 61 2 w m 2 followed by the latent heat flux 22 4 w m 2 annual melt energy in the future will increase by 46 116 for three climate scenarios the extra energy mainly came from the net shortwave radiation with an increase of 12 6 21 3 w m 2 19 31 the variation of rest energy components is less than 6 w m 2 the net shortwave radiation is lower in summer due to more cloudy weather and the energy loss of net longwave radiation in summer is also lower than that in other seasons in the future summer the net shortwave radiation increases 9 2 26 1 w m 2 12 33 and the energy loss of net longwave radiation reduces 6 68 a larger proportion of liquid precipitation table 2 will reduce albedo of glacier surface through both snow surface moistening and snow covered area reduction 3 5 future variations in ice thickness area and volume of qiyi glacier driven by outputs of 12 model ensemble average in cmip6 and glacier morphology updated every two years the variations in ice thickness area and volume of qiyi glacier are projected for ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in 2015 2100 by using the calibrated embm as shown in figs 10 and 11 qiyi glacier presents various degrees of shrinkage and mass loss under three ssps scenarios for the ssp1 2 6 scenario the average ice thickness is 41 43 24 87 15 42 15 96 and 17 55 m in 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 respectively the glacier area is 2 52 2 24 1 17 0 50 and 0 30 km2 and the ice volume is 104 28 106 92 4 55 71 106 49 4 18 106 15 9 7 98 106 7 1 and 5 29 106 4 7 m3 for the ssp2 4 5 scenario the average ice thickness is 40 88 24 59 13 59 12 96 and 8 72 m in 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 respectively the glacier area is 2 52 2 25 1 13 0 31 and 0 09 km2 and the ice volume is 102 9 106 91 1 55 28 106 49 15 42 106 13 7 4 07 106 3 6 and 0 78 106 0 7 m3 for the ssp5 8 5 scenario qiyi glacier will disappear in 2082 the average ice thickness is 40 55 22 53 9 38 and 16 9 m in 2020 2040 2060 and 2080 respectively the glacier area is 2 52 2 18 0 74 and 0 02 km2 and the ice volume is 102 08 106 90 4 49 08 106 43 5 6 93 106 6 1 and 0 34 106 0 3 m3 time series of ice volume in 2015 2100 show a similar trend for ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios fig 12 i e the ice volume loss increases firstly then decreases and finally tends to the minimum after 2070 due to glacier intensive shrinkage according to the departure curve glacier mass loss is substantial for all scenarios from 2020 to mid 2050s further mass loss grows significantly from mid 2020s to early 2050s by using mann kendall test finally the data is smoothed through negative exponential to eliminate noise we project the peak mass loss of qiyi glacier falls from 2030 to 2045 for all scenarios fig 12 in arid and semi arid regions glacier runoff is a significant contributor to runoff glacier meltwater supply 48 of runoff in the headwaters of indus river on the western tp liu et al 2017 40 in tarim river kang 2002 and 10 30 from east to west in qilian mountains qin 2002 peak water refers to the timing of glacier peak mass loss which is a critical variable for water resources planning and management in catchments before peak water glaciers are expected to keep shrinking due to ongoing climate warming it not only increases the available water resources but also increases the risk of landslide debris flow glacial lake outburst flood and glacier collapse tian et al 2017 bazai et al 2021 lei et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b for example in the headwaters of indus river more than 50 of the increasing runoff will originate from glacier meltwater lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 two glaciers in the aru range on the western tp collapsed in 2016 causing fatal damage to local people and their livestock tian et al 2017 lei et al 2021 after peak water ice volume will significantly decrease glaciers will accelerate to shrink until disappear and the meltwater will continue to decrease water demand for agriculture is expected to increase as climate warming however inadequate water resources pose a potential threat to food security immerzeel et al 2020 there are large uncertainties in projections of glacier evolution especially for the peak water one uncertainty is climate forcing especially precipitation huss et al 2014 for example lutz et al 2014 reported that ice loss in the upper indus river would continue to increase before 2050 but this conclusion was overturned after updating model driven data for the rcp 8 5 scenario in cmip5 and the downscaling methods lutz et al 2016 spatio temporal pattern of precipitation at high altitudes is controlled by orography the change is difficult to accurately capture due to coarse resolution van tiel et al 2020 in this study downscaling precipitation showed larger bias and range than other climate variables table 1 compared to multi model ensemble average average annual precipitation of individual climate model in 2021 2100 ranges from 33 to 53 the other uncertainty is from models and parameters for most headwaters on the tp including yangtze yellow lantsang salween and brahmaputra rivers zhao et al 2019 reported that glaciers were likely experiencing or will soon from early 2000 2020s experience the most intense ice loss huss and hock 2018 projected that the peak water will occur not earlier than 2050 su et al 2016 concluded that glacier mass loss will continue to increase in 2015 2100 in these studies glacier melt was simulated using the degree day factor model at the large river basin scale degree day factors are considered as the largest uncertainty source of projections zhao et al 2019 degree day factors are often obtained from in situ observation of several glaciers making it difficult to accurately estimate glacier mass loss at a large scale due to spatial heterogeneity ramanathan and carmichael 2008 at the individual glacier additional uncertainty may originate from glacier area evolution combined degree day factor model with volume area scaling approach shi et al 2020 projected that ice loss of dongkemadi glacier in the central tp would reach peak not prior to 2030 gao et al 2021 reported that the peak mass loss of dongkemadi glacier was around 2060 2085 using degree day factor model and another area evolution scheme Œ¥h parameterization huss et al 2010 in this study a distributed energy mass balance model was developed to project the variations of mass balance and ice volume of qiyi glacier and the peak mass loss may fall from 2030 to 2045 as a classic case it not only deepens the understanding of glacier evolution worldwide but also presents important reference for the development allocation and sustainability of regional water resources 4 conclusions based on in situ observations glacier meteorology and mass balance of qiyi glacier combined with glacier boundary topography and ice thickness data a distributed energy mass balance model with the spatio temporal resolution of 30 m and 1 day was developed in the model the glacier morphology was updated on every two years based on simulated mass balance and initial ice thickness driven by station observations the series of mass balance and ice volume in 1980 2020 were reconstructed and the series for the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in 2021 2100 were forecast driven by 12 model ensemble average in cmip6 the results showed the multi year average mass balance of qiyi glacier was 306 mm w e in 1980 2020 and increased by a factor of 1 08 1 67 and 2 68 in 2021 2100 for the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively the primary reason for more negative future mass balance is surface melt increase in summer followed by snowfall decrease the higher air temperature and less snowfall in summer lead to albedo reduction of glacier surface thus the net shortwave radiation increases 12 33 for three climate scenarios resulting in the increase of 46 116 for annual melt energy by the end of the 21st century qiyi glacier volume will only remain 5 29 106 4 7 m3 for the ssp1 2 6 scenario and 0 78 106 0 7 m3 for the ssp2 4 5 scenario for the ssp5 8 5 scenario qiyi glacier will disappear in 2082 ice loss will reach peak around 2030 2045 then decrease in parallel with volume reduction the total uncertainty in projections is mainly from climate forcing and glacier models for the individual glacier since the model parameters calibration is often based on short term observation the uncertainties associated with model parameters can be significant continuous and large scale field glacier measurements is the key to improve the projection reliability in future study the field observation of qiyi glacier will continue and extend to other regions of the tp the projections of glacier mass balance and ice volume will expand to the qilian mountains and even the entire tp this persistent work will improve understanding on future glacier variation in the region with scarce measured data and provide scientific support for sustainable development and utilization of water resources in arid and semi arid

7666,study region lake okeechobee and its drainage basins the northern lake okeechobee nlo watershed have faced climate variability and changes the frequencies and magnitudes of extreme weather events are projected to increase in the future and the impact of climate change on hydrological changes in upstream watersheds would significantly affect the water quality of downstream waterbodies a holistic system wide modeling approach is necessary for a watershed lake system study focus this study evaluated the impacts of climate change on the water quantity and quality of the nlo watershed lake okeechobee system using a spatially integrated modeling framework combining watershed loading and receiving waterbody models together future climate projections and water level operation scenarios were incorporated into the modeling to investigate how the watershed lake system may react to projected climate changes and how management practices can mitigate the impacts new hydrological insights for the region the modeling results highlight that the water quality of the lake would be closely associated with the internal hydrodynamic process driven by wind and water level operation practices as well as external nutrient loads from the upstream drainage areas such findings indicate that the lake and watershed management requires implementation plans and practices to be uniquely customized to efficiently improve the lake s water quality in the future depending on the types of issues high nutrient loads concentrations and algal blooms graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change lake management watershed lake system water quality lake okeechobee northern lake okeechobee watershed data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction future climate change could significantly impact the hydrological processes of watersheds and subsequently the hydrodynamics and quality of their downstream waterbodies munar et al 2018 water quality issues such as algal blooms and dead zones occurring in waterbodies are commonly associated with water sediment and nutrient loading from upstream drainage areas with pollutant sources emphasizing the connectivity between two systems namely watersheds and waterbodies yang and best 2015 chen et al 2016 munar et al 2018 smith et al 2019 changes in climate and weather patterns can also directly affect a downstream waterbody by altering its hydrodynamics including water level currents and water temperature zhang et al 2019 thus an investigation of climate change impacts on the hydrology and water quality of a waterbody requires a holistic approach considering different mechanisms governing the water and nutrient transport in watersheds and mixing processes in waterbodies mathematical modeling has served as a useful tool for the analysis of a hydrological system providing an alternative or complementary option to monitoring watersheds streams and lakes or reservoirs are characterized by different hydraulic gradients and result in different speeds of water movement on the ground surface from running and standing water gravity moves surface water from one place to another along its flow path defined by topography in watersheds and streams in lakes water is vertically and horizontally stratified or mixed by the differences in heat energy and water density wind and inflowing and outflowing water due to the fundamental dissimilarity in mechanisms controlling water movements different modeling approaches are required to appropriately and efficiently describe their hydrology and water quality processes to our knowledge there is no single model that simulates the movement of water in both watersheds and receiving waterbodies e g lakes and reservoirs studies have proposed coupling unique modeling approaches and tools to represent hydrology and water quality processes occurring in a connected watershed and lake system dargahi and setegn 2011 munar et al 2018 shin et al 2019 every lake has its own upstream watershed and they act as a system that drains the land and stores the water the northern lake okeechobee nlo watershed lake okeechobee system in florida is one of them lake okeechobee is the heart of the greater everglades ecosystem and provides various ecosystem services including flood protection freshwater supply navigation fishery and wildlife habitats throughout the everglades ecosystem one of the major water quality issues in the lake is phosphorus enrichment from historical sources which exacerbates algae blooms in the lake and its downstream estuaries dunne et al 2011 lake okeechobee has a long history of receiving nutrient loads from cattle ranching and dairy farming in its drainage basins khare et al 2019 much effort has been taken to reduce phosphorus loading to the lake from the sources however this was not very successful because a large amount of legacy phosphorus still remains throughout watersheds and the current projects lack a holistic understanding of the interaction between the lakes and their surrounding areas nasem 2018 lake okeechobee and its drainage basins have faced climate variability and changes abrupt and nonlinear changes in the climate regulation capacity of the watershed lake ecosystem may increase water demand for irrigation degrade water quality and exacerbate algae problems and eutrophication which inevitably affect agricultural productivity and the tourism industry easterling et al 2000 pearlstine 2009 swain et al 2014 repetto 2012 grimm et al 2013 obeysekera et al 2015 hewitt et al 2016 the annual cost of climate change impacts in florida includes loss of tourism revenue increased hurricane damages and at risk residential real estate stanton and ackerman 2007 however ongoing management projects often neglect potential climate change impacts on the ecosystem nasem 2018 in addition most of the climate change impact assessments for the everglades system have focused on the south of lake okeechobee where the everglades national park and water conservation areas are located some climate change studies were conducted on lake okeechobee that focused on water elevation havens and steinman 2015 or water budget obeysekera et al 2015 rather than water quality there are a few studies about the water quality of lake okeechobee however they focused on extreme historical events such as hurricanes rather than projecting the future water quality status beaver et al 2013 havens et al 2016 it is critical to examine how projected climate change may affect the water quantity and quality of lake okeechobee and its drainage basins and how the current management can handle the changes which would help improve the existing and future plans in this study we evaluated the impacts of climate change on the water quality process of the nlo basin lake okeechobee system to answer the questions 1 how will global scale climate change influence a watershed lake system in the future and 2 how can water level operation management practices help mitigate these impacts for this study we calibrated and linked two simulation models capable of describing watershed and waterbody processes respectively namely soil and water assessment tool swat and environmental fluid dynamics code efdc the future climate projections of multiple global circulation models gcms were downscaled to the local weather stations and fed to the linked modeling tool to project the future water quality of the watershed and lake the modeling experiment also considered future water level operation scenarios that were prepared based on the lake okeechobee operation manual e g lake okeechobee regulation schedule the water balance of the lake and climate and flow projections made using the gcms and swat the results of this modeling experiment demonstrated how the water quality parameters of the lake and watershed would uniquely respond to future climate changes expecting to help better understand the interactions between global scale changes local watersheds and waterbodies and regional management practices 2 study area and data lake okeechobee is a large surface area of 1730 km2 and shallow mean depth of 2 7 m lake the lake has major inflows from the kissimmee river kr basin lake istokpoga li indian prairie ip fisheating creek fec and taylor creek nubbin slough tcns fig 1 and s1 most of these inflows are controlled by gravity fed or pump driven water control structures sfwmd 2021 the lake has outlets to discharge through the northern estuaries via the caloosahatchee canal c 43 to the west and the st lucie canal c 44 to the east four major canals connected to the lake convey water supply to the south traversing the water conservation areas wcas and capturing excess runoff from the everglades agricultural area eaa the water storage and quality provided by lake okeechobee have great implications for the hydrological and ecological conditions of both the lake and downstream ecosystems nasem 2018 the release of a large amount of water from the lake can contribute to harmful algal blooms low salinity and loss of fisheries and coastal habitat in the lake s downstream estuaries rosen et al 2017 lapointe et al 2017 the records of daily water surface elevation and outflow collected from 2011 to 2020 showed that water entered the lake stayed for 2 46 years residence or retention time on average with the variation from 1 29 years to 4 69 years table s7 vollenweider 1975 from the stage storage relationship the average water surface elevation and volume were estimated to be 4 2 m in the national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 ngvd 29 system and 4 8 109 m3 respectively fig s4 in addition the historical records showed that the daily average inflow and outflow rates of the lake were 96 4 m3 s and 73 8 m3 s respectively this study prepared two watershed models for the kr 5892 km2 and the s191 basin 490 km2 to project future water sediment and nutrient loads to lake okeechobee fig 1 the majority of the kr and the s191 basins are covered by wetland forest 15 and pasture 45 respectively both basins have shallow slopes 1 7 for kr and 0 5 for s191 with low reliefs 3 91 m for kr and 1 21 m for s191 table s1 most soils in the basin are spodosols which have a sand to loamy sand texture high infiltration rates and poor internal drainage due to the low permeability of an underlying spodic horizon at depths of 0 5 m to greater than 2 m annual average rainfall depths of 1321 and 1236 mm were observed at the kr and s191 basins respectively from 2011 to 2020 the majority 76 of the annual rainfall fell in the wet season from may to october and the dry season is defined to occur from november to april in this study for the watershed modeling the stream networks and subwatershed boundaries were delineated based on digital elevation models dems created by the university of florida geoplan center geoplan 2013 and obtained from the florida geographic data library https www fgdl org metadataexplorer explorer jsp the information on soils and land covers was derived from the ssurgo database of the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs 2012 and the cropland data layer cdl of the united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass 2011 respectively for the lake modeling the surface water boundary and bathymetry of the lake were obtained from the geospatial open data portal operated by the south florida water management district sfwmd https geo sfwmd hub arcgis com for both watershed and waterbody modeling the records of weather forcings external loads and in lake water quality concentrations observed from 2011 to 2020 were collected from the environmental database portal of dbhydro https www sfwmd gov science data dbhydro maintained by sfwmd the weather forcing data include the daily time series of atmospheric pressure air temperature relative humidity rainfall depth wind speed and direction evaporation and solar radiation the external water and nutrient loading data include daily streamflow discharge and monthly or biweekly water quality parameter measurements such as total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total suspended solids tss concentrations observed at outlets of the kr and s191 basins the waterbody modeling was calibrated to the concentrations of water quality parameters including algae biomass chlorophyll a chl a total organic carbon tp orthophosphate ammonia total kjeldahl nitrogen nitrate tn tss and dissolved oxygen do observed at the 19 in lake monitoring stations the cyanobacteria concentration data are available only for a limited period starting in 2020 at the majority of the stations thus we selected chl a as a proxy of algal biomass in this study 3 method 3 1 overall in this study we coupled a watershed loading model swat to a receiving waterbody model efdc to consider external loadings to lake okeechobee from the nlo basin as well as the hydrodynamic process and operation rules of the lake when evaluating the overall impacts of projected future climate change on the lake s water quality each model was calibrated and validated to observations made during the same period of 2015 2020 2015 2017 for calibration and 2018 2020 for validation the outputs of the calibrated watershed model were fed to the inflow boundary conditions of the receiving waterbody model shin et al 2019 the future climate projections and the water level operation i e water discharge to its downstream canals scenarios were incorporated into the calibrated watershed and waterbody models to investigate their impacts on the water quality of the nlo basin and lake okeechobee for example the watershed modeling predicted flow tn tp and tss loadings from the basin and the waterbody modeling simulated the algal biomass chl a tn tp tss and do of the lake 3 2 watershed modeling we selected the swat model as a watershed modeling tool for this study considering its proven applicability to various landscapes bosch et al 2010 amatya and jha 2011 zhang et al 2019 and capacity for describing agricultural management practices e g fertilizer applications and grazing operations commonly implemented in the study basin a preliminary study that investigated the performance of swat in its application to one of the study basins s191 demonstrated its acceptable prediction accuracy shin et al 2023 swat has been popularly used for watershed loading modeling presumably because its theoretical backgrounds are well documented its source code is open to the public so that anyone can retrofit it as needed and continuous model version control maintenance and updates the model was designed to describe various watershed and field management practices and evaluate their effects on water sediment and chemical yields in complex watersheds with varying soils land uses and management conditions arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 arnold et al 2012 watershed assessment model wam bottcher et al 2012 can be a good candidate for the hydrology and water quality model of this study when considering a wide range of applications in florida s water management planning however its theoretical background is not documented in detail compared to that of swat and thus it is not easy to understand the simulation mechanisms and interpret the modeling results in terms of approaches and methods used in the modeling in addition the source code is not open and the simulation takes a great deal of time to complete e g 5 8 h for a single 21 year daily simulation for the fec basin using a personal computer that has an intel core i7 8700 k processor 3 70 ghz and 32 gb ram so the use of a sampling based global optimization algorithm is not practical for parameter calibration the two subbasins of the nlo basin were delineated based on the topography represented by the dem the total numbers of 711 and 419 hydrological response units hrus were defined for the kr and the s191 basin respectively considering the unique combinations of land uses and soils with the proportion threshold of 10 land use 10 soil and 0 slope her et al 2015 daily rainfall depths and minimum and maximum air temperatures were collected from 40 weather stations associated with the basin and input to the swat model septic tanks in low density areas fertilizer and manure application in agricultural fields are the sources of nutrients in the basin the information about septic tanks e g location and year built located in the basins was taken from the florida water management inventory website http www floridahealth gov environmental health drinking water flwmi index html which has gaps in the data due to insufficient data availability from several wastewater providers and might add uncertainties for estimating the accurate density of septic systems in each basin the application loading rate and timing of the fertilizers and manure were determined based on the records of livestock numbers from usda nass the florida department of agriculture and consumer services fdacs guideline of agriculture conservation practices and literature table 1 usda nass florida statistics https www nass usda gov statistics by state florida publications livestock and poultry index php mayer et al 1999 rouse and zekri 2002 asae 2005 lowe et al 2009 toor et al 2011 usda ams 2018 khare et al 2019 obreza et al 2020 we selected the calibration parameters of swat and their value ranges based on the literature and our understanding of the parameters abbaspour 2007 douglas mankin et al 2010 arnold et al 2012 her and chaubey 2015 table s2 the parameters were calibrated to flow tn tp and tss load measurements made at the outlets of the study basins fig 1 in the calibration the parameter space of the two swat models for the kr and s191 basins was explored using a sampling based heuristic optimization algorithm namely a multi algorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 the total number of parameter sample sets to be populated was predefined as 10 368 and their performance or accuracy was evaluated in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 in the calibration the sampling algorithm was set to locate or approximate pareto solutions between the nse values of flow tn tp and tss simulations under a multi objective optimization framework this study included two subbasins i e the kr and s191 basins of the nlo basin in the swat modeling the swat model could not provide flow and nutrient load predictions for the other subbasins including fec li ip and tcns at an acceptable accuracy level e g nse 0 5 the details of the calibration results can be found in the supplementary materials s1 these subbasins were relatively highly managed with canals and pumps to control water and nutrient loading to the lake our investigation of the relationship between daily rainfall depth and discharge observed at the basin outlets found that the discharge did not respond to the rainfall events due to the storage of the canal pool and the control of canal gates and pumps figure s2 in addition a hydrological model such as swat cannot represent canal flow in ip diverged from the outlets of li figure s1 and table s3 for the future hydrological projection for these subbasins thus the regression relationships established among flow sediment and nutrient load observations made at the outlets of kr and the other subbasins in the historical periods 2011 2020 were employed to project the future flow sediment and nutrient loads of the subbasins for example the future flow of the fec basin was estimated from that of the kr basin projected using the swat model and gcms based on the regressional relationship between their historical flow the regression equations provided relative errors of less than 15 at the outlets of all the subbasins which were regarded as acceptable in terms of the percentage biases engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 2015 ritter and mu√±oz carpena 2013 however the regression models could not reproduce the daily variations of flow and nutrient loads which were expected to add uncertainty to the following waterbody s water quantity and quality projections the details of the regression coefficients of the simple linear relationships established and the goodness of fit statistics of the regression model can be found in table s5 swat could not reproduce flow and nutrient load predictions at an acceptable level for the entire nlo basins due to its inability to represent highly managed canal and pump flows thus this modeling approach using swat and regression analysis would add uncertainty to the hydrological projections and following waterbody s water quantity and quality projections 3 3 lake modeling we selected efdc hamrick 1992 as a waterbody model for this study to describe the internal hydrodynamics and water quality processes of lake okeechobee considering the model s flexibility and previous experience with lake okeechobee shin et al 2019 2023 efdc has been widely used to simulate the hydrodynamics sediment transport water quality and eutrophication processes of a variety of waterbodies including lake okeechobee jin et al 2000 jin and ji 2004 2013 the source code of efdc is accessible to the public which makes the model highly flexible and easily adaptable hamrick 1992 scavia et al 2016 the model has three sub models including the hydrodynamic sediment transport and water quality models which are integrated into a single source code implementation hamrick 1992 the hydrodynamic model solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with a turbulence closure model which was developed by mellor and yamada 1982 and modified by galperin et al 1988 to account for a vertically hydrostatic terrain hamrick 1992 the sediment transport model simulates the movement of sediment particles in the water column considering the influence of waves currents and sediment resuspension and deposition ji 2017 styles and glenn 2000 the hydrodynamic and sediment transport simulations can be linked to the water quality model ce qual icm cerco and cole 1995 which simulates algae dynamics including algal production or growth basal metabolism predation and settling and

based on the bathymetry information of the lake each grid cell was vertically divided into three layers so that each layer could represent one third of the total water depth the elevation of the bottom of the third layer was determined based on the bathymetry information of the lake https geo sfwmd hub arcgis com the initial conditions of the water surface elevation and the water temperature

considered eight different climate change projections made using four coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 gcms and two greenhouse gas emission scenarios the representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 the rcps were selected to represent the stabilization rcp 4 5 and worst case scenarios respectively they have been commonly employed in climate change impact studies and analysis thomson et al 2011 jehanzaib et al 2020 xie et al 2020 zamani et al 2020 fan and bai 2021 mattos et al 2021 table 2 the four gcms were selected for this study because they are the only gcms that project the wind speed solar radiation and air pressure required for the efdc modeling the daily gcm outputs were obtained for the historical 1950 2005 and future 2006 2100 periods from the apec climate center data service system https cliks apcc21 org dataset cmip5 the observed meteorological data were then used to correct biases in the daily climate projections made by the gcms at each station and to assess the performance of bias corrected gcm projections in this study we considered three water level operation or water level control scenarios for lake okeechobee based on the 2008 lake okeechobee regulation schedule 2008 lors usace 2008 fig 2 the first scenario high water or hw represents a water level control practice of maintaining high water levels e g 4 87 m in june fig 2 by discharging a relatively small volume of water from the lake high water management band usace 2008 on the other hand the second scenario low water or lw signifies a water control practice to maintain low water levels e g 3 50 m in june fig 2 by discharging a relatively large amount of water from the lake water shortage management band usace 2008 the third scenario average water or aw made for this study maintains the averaged level of stored water between hw and lw the amount of runoff sediment and nutrients discharged from the nlo basin rainfall and lake evapotranspiration was estimated using the climate projections and swat model the volume of the lake s outflows water discharged from the lake was then calculated by applying the estimated inflows to the stage volume relationship of lake okeechobee fig s4 the daily volume of inflows discharged from the drainage basins to the lake and outflows discharged from the lake was estimated using the water balance relationship eq 6 6 s inflow rainfall et outflow where s is the daily change in storage of the lake estimated based on the water level i e water level management scenarios fig 2 and the stage storage

the unit of each component is m3 s 4 results and discussion 4 1 climate projection 4 1 1 northern lake okeechobee basins the air temperature was projected to increase under all climate change scenarios at an annual scale for example the ensemble median air temperature of the kr basin was expected to increase from 23 0 c the baseline period of 1996 2015 in fig 3 to 24 6 c 2075 2095 or p4 in fig 3 under rcp 4 5 and from 23 0 c the baseline period to 26 5 c p4 under rcp 8 5 fig 3 the ensemble median air temperature of the s191 basin was projected to increase by 1 3 c from 23 1 c the baseline period to 24 4 c p4 under rcp 4 5 and by 2 8 c from 23 1 c the baseline period to 25 9 c p4 under rcp 8 5 the projected air temperature increase was accelerated over the periods from p1 to p4 in the case of the kr basin for instance the air temperature was expected to increase by 0 7 c during p1 and the rate was projected to increase to 0 9 c in p4 under rcp 8 5 the seasonal variations of projected air temperature were greater in the wet season i e from may to october than in the dry season fig s5 in the case of the kr basin the ensemble median of monthly average air temperature was projected to increase by 1 9 c from the baseline air temperature of 25 0 c in the wet season under rcp 4 5 but the increase rate decreased to 1 2 c from the baseline air temperature of 21 1 c in the dry season the gcms hadgem2 cc and gfdl esm2g projected the highest and lowest air temperature changes for both basins for instance hadgem2 cc projected the annual average air temperature of the kr basin to increase by 3 3 c in p4 from the baseline air temperature of 23 0 c but gfdl esm2g was expected to increase by 1 3 c under rcp 4 5 the annual average rainfall depth of the kr basin was projected to increase in p1 2 9 and p4 8 8 but decrease in p2 0 8 and p3 4 6 under rcp 4 5 compared to the annual average rainfall depth 1182 mm of the baseline period fig 3 on the other hand the rcp 8 5 scenario projected the rainfall depth to decrease in p1 p2 and p4 and increase by 2 1 in p3 compared to the rainfall depth 1213 mm of the baseline period the air temperature was expected to decrease the most 3 8 in p4 in the case of the s191 basin the annual average rainfall depth was projected to decrease from p1 to p3 and then increase by 3 6 in p4 under rcp 4 5 compared to the baseline projection 1131 mm overall the monthly rainfall depth was expected to decrease in the wet and dry seasons in both basins under rcp 8 5 fig s5 however the rcp 4 5 scenario projected the rainfall depth to increase in the dry season in both basins most of the projected rainfall depth decreases were found in the wet season during all the future periods i e p1 to p4 in both basins the frequency of large greater than 187 mm event rainfall events projected for the baseline and future periods were compared to examine how climate change may affect rainfall intensity in the future table 3 the size of a rainfall event that has a 50 or 2 year return period probability of occurring every year in the s191 basin was estimated to be 187 mm shin et al 2023 and we directly adopted 187 mm as a threshold to define large rainfall events in this study the projections of the large rainfall event frequency varied depending on the gcm models table 3 for instance the gfdl esm2g model projected the number of large events to decrease in the kr basin in future periods compared to those of the baseline period under rcp 4 5 on the other hand the inm cm4 model expected the large event to more frequently occur in the future previous studies reported that the frequency of extreme rainfall events in florida would increase in most regions sfwmd 2022 obeysekera et al 2021 or have no significant change in the future depending on the selection of the climate models wang et al 2013 such a finding demonstrates the amount of uncertainty in rainfall projections on a daily scale her et al 2019 song et al 2020 shin et al 2023 in the case of the annual average air temperature in the kr basin for example the difference between the projections made using the four gcms under rcp 4 5 was 4 in p4 based on the average of the percentage coefficient of variance cv the difference increased to 26 for the annual average rainfall depth in the kr basin this study projected the rainfall depth of the study areas located in central florida to increase in winter but to decrease in summer fig 3 and s5 which corresponds well with the previous studies lee et al 2011 misra et al 2011 rauscher et al 2011 obeysekera et al 2015 swain and hayhoe 2015 kirtman et al 2017 the level of disagreement between the frequency of large rainfall events projected by the gcms table 3 was also reported in other studies wang et al 2013 obeysekera et al 2021 sfwmd 2022 4 1 2 lake okeechobee the air temperature of lake okeechobee was projected to increase under all climate change scenarios from the baseline period to the future periods at the average rate of 0 056¬∫c year from 23 7 ¬∫c for the baseline period to 28 2¬∫c for p4 under rcp 8 5 raimi et al 2020 reported that summer air temperatures in florida would increase from 27 4 ¬∫c to 28 3 ¬∫c in the near future e g from 2020 to 2039 at a rate of 0 045¬∫c year as expected the annual air pressure was projected to remain the same with a slight difference of 0 04 compared to that of the baseline period 1016 mb all four gcms projected the wind speed to decrease by 1 2 3 6 in p4 under rcp 4 5 but they did not agree with each other under rcp 8 5 the gcms also did not agree with each other on the projection of solar radiation inm cm4 projected the solar radiation to decrease by up to 12 5 or 0 025 kw m2 compared to that of the baseline period 0 200 kw m2 under rcp 4 5 however the solar radiation projections made using gfdl esm2g and gfdl esm2m increased over future periods fig 4i and j the trends of the evaporation projections were similar to those of the solar radiation projections the disagreement between the gcms was identified for the projections of evaporation fig 4k and l the evaporation projections made using gfdl esm2g and gfdl esm2m increased over the future period while inm cm4 projected the evaporation decreased by up to 12 8 or 1173 mm year compared to that of the baseline period 1356 mm year under rcp 4 5 in this study we estimated the daily lake evaporation as a function of only the minimum and maximum air temperature and solar radiation using the abtew method 1996 that was suggested for lake okeechobee abtew 2001 price et al 2007 melesse et al 2009 thus the evaporation projections would not be sensitive to the wind speed projection but only the air temperature and solar radiation projections the use of the abtew method was expected to reduce the sensitivity of modeling outputs to highly uncertain wind speed projections the rainfall projections made by the gcms showed relatively large differences in the case of the lz40 weather station located in the middle of the lake for instance the annual average rainfall depth was projected to decrease by up to 9 6 or increase by up to 5 1 compared to the 1023 mm for the baseline period depending on the future periods under rcp 8 5 fig 4 both rcps 4 5 and 8 5 projected rainfall depths to decrease in the wet season but they did not agree with each other in the dry season fig s6 in the case of the rainfall projections made using gfdl esm2g under rcp 4 5 for lake okeechobee for example the monthly average rainfall depths were projected to decrease in the wet seasons by 16 21 in all future periods in the dry seasons on the other hand the gcms expected the monthly average rainfall depth to increase by 3 7 for the same future periods the rainfall projections made for the kr basin showed annual and seasonal trends similar to those of lake okeechobee fig 3 relatively large differences were found between the projections made using the gcms for the wind speed solar radiation and rainfall depth compared to those of air temperature and pressure and the rainfall data showed the largest variations in the projections fig s6 for example the difference between the minimum and maximum projections of the annual rainfall depth was 411 mm or 42 0 compared to the annual average rainfall depth of 980 mm observed in the baseline period in p3 under rcp 4 5 fig 4a in the case of air temperature on the other hand the largest difference of 1 4 c between the projections was found in p4 under rcp 4 5 which corresponds to 5 9 of the annual average air temperature of 23 5 c observed in the baseline period such a finding agrees with other studies that investigated florida s air temperature and rainfall raimi et al 2020 song et al 2020 shin et al 2023 4 2 model calibration the swat models were calibrated validated to daily flow tn tp and tss load observed at the outlets of the kr and s191 basins from 2015 to 2020 at acceptable accuracy levels with nses greater than 0 5 for flow and 0 4 for other water quality variables table 4 figs s7 s8 s9 the previous studies suggested acceptable accuracy levels for watershed modeling engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 2015 ritter and mu√±oz carpena 2013 moriasi et al 2015 recommended nses greater than 0 50 for flow 0 45 for sediment and 0 35 for nitrogen and phosphorus and biases of less than 15 for flow 20 for sediment and 30 for nitrogen and phosphorus in the case of the kr basin the nses and biases in the swat modeling for all the variables were within the acceptable ranges recommended by moriasi et al 2015 and engel et al 2007 the tp load of the s191 basin was overestimated by 42 and 99 in the calibration and validation periods respectively and the swat model provided acceptable accuracy in modeling the other variables in terms of nse and pbias the efdc model also provided acceptable accuracy in reproducing the hydrodynamics and water quality of lake okeechobee there are no general evaluation criteria recommended for receiving waterbody modeling however the previous studies regarded an rrmse of less than 40 as an acceptable efdc modeling level jin and ji 2005 gong et al 2016 tang et al 2021 the efdc model provided negative nses when predicting the water quality variables and such a case could be found in other efdc modeling studies shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 nelson et al 2020 nses are known to be sensitive to large values and the low nses indicate that the receiving waterbody modeling did not well predict the peaks of the water quality variations however it is difficult to predict peaks using the water quality data collected on a biweekly or monthly basis 4 3 watershed loading projection the flow and tss loads of the kr and s191 basins were projected to decrease in all future periods under both rcps at an annual scale except for p1 under rcp 8 5 figs 5 and 6 in the case of the kr basin for instance the ensemble median of the annual average flow was projected to decrease by 16 3 in p3 under rcp 4 5 compared to 60 1 m3 s at the baseline period rcp 8 5 projected the annual average flow to increase by 10 7 in p1 and decrease by up to 15 4 from p2 to p4 compared to 55 6 m3 s at the baseline period the tn load projections varied by the rcp scenarios in the kr basin and they showed a decreasing trend in the s191 basin for example rcps 4 5 and 8 5 for the kr basin projected the ensemble median of the annual average tn loads to increase by up to 1 8 and 44 8 in p2 and p1 respectively compared to the baseline period the tp loads were projected to increase in most of the future periods in the kr and s191 basins for instance the tp loads in the kr basin increased by up to 20 7 in p1 and 44 2 in p3 under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 respectively compared to the baseline period similar to the case of the kr basin the annual average flow and tss loads of the s191 basin were projected to decrease in most of the future periods and the tp load was also expected to decrease in the future fig 6 the ensemble median of the annual average flow and tss load projections decreased by up to 16 9 flow in p3 and 26 5 tss load in p3 in the future periods under rcp 4 5 compared to the baseline period the tn load projections for the s191 basin showed an opposite trend to those of the kr basin the tn load was projected to decrease in all future periods by up to 25 0 in p4 under rcp 4 5 the gcms projected the tp loads of the s191 basin to gradually increase from the baseline period to p4 under both rcp scenarios the tp loads were expected to increase by 70 in p4 the different tn load responses of the kr and s191 basins to future climate changes can be explained by the difference in the amount of fertilizers applied to orange fields the tn load increases were projected only for the orange fields of both basins the application rate of fertilizers was assumed to remain the same i e 845 kg ha application and three times per year table 1 for both basins in the projection but the kr basin has much larger orange fields e g 29 403 ha vs 858 ha than the s191 basin the tp loads were projected to increase in both basins in future periods the application rates of animal manure the annual rate of mineral p of 13 6 and 19 3 kg ha for the kr and s191 basis respectively table 1 in pasture and fertilizers the annual rate of mineral p of 88 7 kg ha for both basins table 1 in orange fields were assumed to be constant in the future which would increase the phosphorus levels of the soils the accumulated amount of soil phosphorus is much greater in the pasture 181 kg ha from the baseline period to p4 using gfdl esm2g under rcp 4 5 for the s191 basin and orange fields 1168 kg ha than in other natural areas such as wetland forests 21 kg ha the increased soil phosphorus levels then would increase the amount of phosphorus to be transported and loaded to downstream waterbodies sharpley et al 1994 whalen and chang 2001 the monthly average flow and tss loads were projected to decrease in most future periods in the kr basin compared to the baseline period figure s10 the tn and tp loads were expected to increase in most cases in the kr basin the monthly average flow and tss loads of the s191 basin were projected to decrease in the wet season but increase in the dry season figure s11 in the case of tn and tp loads however no significant seasonal pattern was identified 4 4 waterbody quality projection the tss tn tp and chl a concentrations of lake okeechobee were projected to increase in future periods but the do concentrations were expected to decrease fig 7 the projected increases in the tn and tp concentrations correspond well to the projected increases in the tn and tp loads from the kr basin to the lake however the lake s tss concentrations were still projected to increase even when decreases in the tss loads from the upstream watersheds were expected this finding implies that the tss concentrations of the lake would be less sensitive to the external loads of tss compared to the tn and tp concentrations in a shallow lake sediments tend to be mixed with overlying water well scheffer and nes 2007 the sediment resuspension and deposition are primarily driven by wind waves and sediment transportation is dominated by the circulation patterns of a lake jin et al 2000 the resuspension and transportation of sediment in large and shallow lakes such as lake okeechobee can affect the physical and chemical environment of the water column suspended sediments can attenuate light in the water column eq 4 which affects algal and aquatic vegetation growth and then the cycling of nutrients organic micropollutants and heavy metals we found strong correlations correlation coefficient greater than 0 7 between the wind speed and tss concentration projections made using gfdl esm2g under rcp 4 5 for p2 e g r of 0 72 and hadgem2 cc under rcp 8 5 for p3 e g r of 0 84 and inm cm4 under rcp 8 5 for p4 e g r of 0 70 however the correlation structure between the projections of external tss loads from the kr basin and tss concentrations in the lake was not strong e g the average r of 0 04 for all projections this indicates that changes in wind speed would have more substantial impacts on the tss concentrations of lake okeechobee than those of external tss loads from its drainage watersheds we converted do concentration to do percentage saturation using surface water temperature and air pressure based on the approach proposed by benson and krause 1984 we investigated how water temperature and the metabolic activity of aquatic organisms e g do production through photosynthesis or do consumption through respiration and decomposition might affect do levels in the water column the metabolic activity of aquatic organisms was estimated using chl a concentration which is an indicator of algal biomass or photosynthetic pigments in the water column for example a high concentration of chl a can indicate a high demand for oxygen through respiration and a high oxygen production potential through photosynthesis to isolate the influence of water temperature or algal biomass on do levels i e do concentration or do percentage saturation we investigated the relationship between the variations of one factor and do concentrations while the other factor stayed at a certain level figs s12 and s13 from the analysis we found that do levels had inverse relationships with both water temperature and chl a concentration when chl a concentrations were stable at 6 7 mg l for example the do concentrations decreased with increases in water temperature from 23 5 to 24 8 because warmer water could hold a smaller amount of oxygen than cooler water fig s12a and s12c the investigation results demonstrated that water temperature controlled do concentrations by affecting the solubility of oxygen in the water furthermore the do levels decreased with increases in chl a concentrations when the water temperature was stable at 24 fig s13a and s13c the modeling experiment showed that the projected increase of external nutrient loads would increase the tn and tp concentrations of lake okeechobee figs 5 and 7 the increased external nutrient loading would promote algal growth leading to a decrease in do concentrations when algae die eventually the decomposition of algal matters by bacteria consumes do which would further decrease the do concentrations in addition the decomposition of algal matters releases the nutrient into the water which can further promote algal growth and lead to algal blooms the direct impacts of the projected increase in external nutrient loadings on the lake s water quality and algal dynamics highlight the importance of nutrient management plans and practices especially in the context of climate change that is expected to increase the frequency of large storm events and resulting external loadings to the lake the projected increase in air temperature would increase the temperature of the lake water which would then create favorable conditions for algal growth when the water temperature falls in the optimal ranges eq 5 the modeling experiment demonstrated these processes for example the chl a concentrations were projected to increase while the air and water temperature were also expected to increase under all climate change scenarios in the future periods fig 7 specifically the chl a concentrations were projected to increase from 7 5 mg l in the baseline period to 9 3 mg l in p4 0 023 mg l year under rcp 8 5 while the water temperature was predicted to increase from 25 2 for all three layers 28 7 for the top layer to 27 5 for all three layers 31 1 for the top layer for the same time frame on the other hand the do concentrations were projected to decrease from 8 5 mg l in the baseline period to 8 0 mg l in p4 under rcp 8 5 fig 7 these modeling results imply that the projected changes in air temperature may negatively affect the water quality of the lake the tss and tn concentrations were projected to increase in both wet and dry seasons compared to the baseline scenario or period fig 8 the tp concentrations were also expected to increase but the projections made for the wet and dry seasons showed large differences for instance the projected tp concentrations made for the wet and dry seasons increased by up to 40 3 and 17 0 respectively in p4 under rcp 8 5 this is presumably due to the increased tp loads from the kr and s191 basins in the wet season the projected chl a concentrations also exhibited a clear seasonal pattern for example the chl a concentrations were projected to increase by up to 71 6 in the dry season but up to 6 8 in the wet season in p4 under rcp 8 5 the seasonal difference might be due to the projected changes in the air temperature the air temperature of the lake was projected to increase by up to 3 0 c from 20 4 to 23 4 c in the dry season and 3 4 c from 27 1 to 30 5 c in the wet season in p4 under rcp 8 5 4 5 water level operation scenario analysis the water quality variables of lake okeechobee uniquely responded to the water level operation scenarios fig 9 for example the lake s tn and tp concentrations projected under the hw scenario were lower than those of the other two scenarios i e aw and lw we calculated the water residence time for the three different water level operation scenarios hw aw and lw using a climate projection made using one of the climate change scenarios e g gfdl esm2g under rcp 4 5 for the period from 2021 to 2095 for the purpose of demonstration fig s14 the average lake water volumes for the hw aw and lw scenarios were projected to be 6 3 109 m3 5 0 109 m3 and 3 9 109 m3 respectively and the corresponding annual average water residence times were predicted to be 3 49 years 2 97 years and 2 17 years respectively the water volumes and residence times for the hw and aw scenarios were greater than the observed annual average of 2 46 years table s7 the differences in the water volumes and retention times could lead to different nutrient retention capacities of the lake which would then affect the concentrations of water quality parameters for instance the hw scenario i e the highest water level operation scenario provided the greatest water volume water and nutrient retention times leading to the greatest decrease in nutrient concentrations compared to the other scenarios the results can be explained by the fact that a longer water residence time increases the nutrient retention capacity and then nutrient removal efficiency vollenweider 1975 finlay et al 2013 tong et al 2019 this finding implies that maintaining a high water level can help mitigate the water quality problem of high nutrient concentrations the chl a and do concentration projections were less sensitive to the water level operation scenarios than the tn and tp concentration projections fig 9i and j for example the average differences between the projections of chl a and do concentrations under the rcp 8 5 scenario were relatively smaller 5 8 for chl a and 0 5 for do than those 11 5 for tn and 15 8 for tp of the tn and tp concentrations the details of calculating the distance between hw and lw projections can be found in table s6 under the hw scenario decreased nutrient concentrations due to dilution would slow algal growth and decrease chl a concentrations in addition increased water depth would decrease the light intensity reaching the bottom of the water column leading to decrease in chl a concentrations however the hw condition may not be able to be maintained in the wet season when rainfall and inflow are relatively large furthermore the water level operation scenarios may change water temperature depending on the types of water discharged from the lake if part of water is discharged or removed from the lower layer that is generally colder than water of the upper layers for example the overall water temperature of the lake may increase which can lead to increases in algal growth and chl a concentrations the opposite may happen if water is discharged from the upper layer thus the impacts of the water level operations on chl a concentrations would not be straightforward and changes in chl a concentrations may not be always correlated to those in tn and tp concentrations liu et al 2014 ji et al 2017 tang et al 2021 considering that do concentrations are sensitive to the rates of algal growth and death do concentrations also may be less responsive to the water level scenarios than the nutrient concentrations this finding suggests that the water level manipulation of the lake may not be effective for the mitigation of algal blooms but rather only for the reduction of nutrient concentrations the chl a and do concentration projections were more responsive to the climate change scenarios than to the three different water level operation scenarios fig 10 this finding confirms that the chl a concentrations of the lake would be more directly controlled by the projected climate changes than the internal changes caused by water level operation scenarios in the future moreover the seasonal differences in the chl a and do projections were greater than those of the tn and tp projections fig 10 studies showed that chl a and do concentrations would be more sensitive to seasonal changes in weather conditions than tn or tp concentrations zeng et al 2015 xiong et al 2023 the finding indicates that seasonal weather change may have substantial impacts on the water quality of the lake but the extent of these changes would vary depending on the water quality parameter being considered 5 conclusions this study evaluated the impacts of climate change on the water quantity and quality of the watersheds lake system using a spatially integrated modeling framework the modeling experiments found that the flow and tss loads from the upstream drainage basins of the lake might decrease in the future the projection of tn load to the lake varied depending on the basins their land uses and rcps the tp load was projected to increase in the future when the current manure and fertilizer rates were maintained the same in agricultural lands the water quality of lake okeechobee was projected to degrade in the future due to the projected increase in air temperature and or in the external nutrient loads from the upstream watersheds the water level operation e g hw was found to reduce the tn and tp concentrations of lake okeechobee but led to little change in the chl a concentrations the modeling experiment found that the chl a and do concentrations of the lake would be more sensitive to the climate forcings while the tn and tp concentrations would be more responsive to the external loadings from the upstream basins and the water level operation scenarios the findings suggest that the water level operation practices would reduce the nutrient levels but may not help mitigate algal blooms the results demonstrate that the water quality of the lake was a function of air temperature and internal hydrodynamics driven by lake water level operation and wind as well as nutrient loads from the upstream areas the future land use operations of the water control structures and agricultural management practices were assumed to be the same as the current practice which might be unrealistic conditions and add to uncertainty in the modeling results however the assumptions enabled us to test whether the current conditions can be effective under future climate changes future studies may consider various land use scenarios incorporating land use change dynamics and nutrient management scenarios the findings are expected to help develop spatially integrated climate adaptation plans for improved sustainability of the watershed lake system credit authorship contribution statement satbyeol shin conceptualization methodology

7666,study region lake okeechobee and its drainage basins the northern lake okeechobee nlo watershed have faced climate variability and changes the frequencies and magnitudes of extreme weather events are projected to increase in the future and the impact of climate change on hydrological changes in upstream watersheds would significantly affect the water quality of downstream waterbodies a holistic system wide modeling approach is necessary for a watershed lake system study focus this study evaluated the impacts of climate change on the water quantity and quality of the nlo watershed lake okeechobee system using a spatially integrated modeling framework combining watershed loading and receiving waterbody models together future climate projections and water level operation scenarios were incorporated into the modeling to investigate how the watershed lake system may react to projected climate changes and how management practices can mitigate the impacts new hydrological insights for the region the modeling results highlight that the water quality of the lake would be closely associated with the internal hydrodynamic process driven by wind and water level operation practices as well as external nutrient loads from the upstream drainage areas such findings indicate that the lake and watershed management requires implementation plans and practices to be uniquely customized to efficiently improve the lake s water quality in the future depending on the types of issues high nutrient loads concentrations and algal blooms graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change lake management watershed lake system water quality lake okeechobee northern lake okeechobee watershed data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction future climate change could significantly impact the hydrological processes of watersheds and subsequently the hydrodynamics and quality of their downstream waterbodies munar et al 2018 water quality issues such as algal blooms and dead zones occurring in waterbodies are commonly associated with water sediment and nutrient loading from upstream drainage areas with pollutant sources emphasizing the connectivity between two systems namely watersheds and waterbodies yang and best 2015 chen et al 2016 munar et al 2018 smith et al 2019 changes in climate and weather patterns can also directly affect a downstream waterbody by altering its hydrodynamics including water level currents and water temperature zhang et al 2019 thus an investigation of climate change impacts on the hydrology and water quality of a waterbody requires a holistic approach considering different mechanisms governing the water and nutrient transport in watersheds and mixing processes in waterbodies mathematical modeling has served as a useful tool for the analysis of a hydrological system providing an alternative or complementary option to monitoring watersheds streams and lakes or reservoirs are characterized by different hydraulic gradients and result in different speeds of water movement on the ground surface from running and standing water gravity moves surface water from one place to another along its flow path defined by topography in watersheds and streams in lakes water is vertically and horizontally stratified or mixed by the differences in heat energy and water density wind and inflowing and outflowing water due to the fundamental dissimilarity in mechanisms controlling water movements different modeling approaches are required to appropriately and efficiently describe their hydrology and water quality processes to our knowledge there is no single model that simulates the movement of water in both watersheds and receiving waterbodies e g lakes and reservoirs studies have proposed coupling unique modeling approaches and tools to represent hydrology and water quality processes occurring in a connected watershed and lake system dargahi and setegn 2011 munar et al 2018 shin et al 2019 every lake has its own upstream watershed and they act as a system that drains the land and stores the water the northern lake okeechobee nlo watershed lake okeechobee system in florida is one of them lake okeechobee is the heart of the greater everglades ecosystem and provides various ecosystem services including flood protection freshwater supply navigation fishery and wildlife habitats throughout the everglades ecosystem one of the major water quality issues in the lake is phosphorus enrichment from historical sources which exacerbates algae blooms in the lake and its downstream estuaries dunne et al 2011 lake okeechobee has a long history of receiving nutrient loads from cattle ranching and dairy farming in its drainage basins khare et al 2019 much effort has been taken to reduce phosphorus loading to the lake from the sources however this was not very successful because a large amount of legacy phosphorus still remains throughout watersheds and the current projects lack a holistic understanding of the interaction between the lakes and their surrounding areas nasem 2018 lake okeechobee and its drainage basins have faced climate variability and changes abrupt and nonlinear changes in the climate regulation capacity of the watershed lake ecosystem may increase water demand for irrigation degrade water quality and exacerbate algae problems and eutrophication which inevitably affect agricultural productivity and the tourism industry easterling et al 2000 pearlstine 2009 swain et al 2014 repetto 2012 grimm et al 2013 obeysekera et al 2015 hewitt et al 2016 the annual cost of climate change impacts in florida includes loss of tourism revenue increased hurricane damages and at risk residential real estate stanton and ackerman 2007 however ongoing management projects often neglect potential climate change impacts on the ecosystem nasem 2018 in addition most of the climate change impact assessments for the everglades system have focused on the south of lake okeechobee where the everglades national park and water conservation areas are located some climate change studies were conducted on lake okeechobee that focused on water elevation havens and steinman 2015 or water budget obeysekera et al 2015 rather than water quality there are a few studies about the water quality of lake okeechobee however they focused on extreme historical events such as hurricanes rather than projecting the future water quality status beaver et al 2013 havens et al 2016 it is critical to examine how projected climate change may affect the water quantity and quality of lake okeechobee and its drainage basins and how the current management can handle the changes which would help improve the existing and future plans in this study we evaluated the impacts of climate change on the water quality process of the nlo basin lake okeechobee system to answer the questions 1 how will global scale climate change influence a watershed lake system in the future and 2 how can water level operation management practices help mitigate these impacts for this study we calibrated and linked two simulation models capable of describing watershed and waterbody processes respectively namely soil and water assessment tool swat and environmental fluid dynamics code efdc the future climate projections of multiple global circulation models gcms were downscaled to the local weather stations and fed to the linked modeling tool to project the future water quality of the watershed and lake the modeling experiment also considered future water level operation scenarios that were prepared based on the lake okeechobee operation manual e g lake okeechobee regulation schedule the water balance of the lake and climate and flow projections made using the gcms and swat the results of this modeling experiment demonstrated how the water quality parameters of the lake and watershed would uniquely respond to future climate changes expecting to help better understand the interactions between global scale changes local watersheds and waterbodies and regional management practices 2 study area and data lake okeechobee is a large surface area of 1730 km2 and shallow mean depth of 2 7 m lake the lake has major inflows from the kissimmee river kr basin lake istokpoga li indian prairie ip fisheating creek fec and taylor creek nubbin slough tcns fig 1 and s1 most of these inflows are controlled by gravity fed or pump driven water control structures sfwmd 2021 the lake has outlets to discharge through the northern estuaries via the caloosahatchee canal c 43 to the west and the st lucie canal c 44 to the east four major canals connected to the lake convey water supply to the south traversing the water conservation areas wcas and capturing excess runoff from the everglades agricultural area eaa the water storage and quality provided by lake okeechobee have great implications for the hydrological and ecological conditions of both the lake and downstream ecosystems nasem 2018 the release of a large amount of water from the lake can contribute to harmful algal blooms low salinity and loss of fisheries and coastal habitat in the lake s downstream estuaries rosen et al 2017 lapointe et al 2017 the records of daily water surface elevation and outflow collected from 2011 to 2020 showed that water entered the lake stayed for 2 46 years residence or retention time on average with the variation from 1 29 years to 4 69 years table s7 vollenweider 1975 from the stage storage relationship the average water surface elevation and volume were estimated to be 4 2 m in the national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 ngvd 29 system and 4 8 109 m3 respectively fig s4 in addition the historical records showed that the daily average inflow and outflow rates of the lake were 96 4 m3 s and 73 8 m3 s respectively this study prepared two watershed models for the kr 5892 km2 and the s191 basin 490 km2 to project future water sediment and nutrient loads to lake okeechobee fig 1 the majority of the kr and the s191 basins are covered by wetland forest 15 and pasture 45 respectively both basins have shallow slopes 1 7 for kr and 0 5 for s191 with low reliefs 3 91 m for kr and 1 21 m for s191 table s1 most soils in the basin are spodosols which have a sand to loamy sand texture high infiltration rates and poor internal drainage due to the low permeability of an underlying spodic horizon at depths of 0 5 m to greater than 2 m annual average rainfall depths of 1321 and 1236 mm were observed at the kr and s191 basins respectively from 2011 to 2020 the majority 76 of the annual rainfall fell in the wet season from may to october and the dry season is defined to occur from november to april in this study for the watershed modeling the stream networks and subwatershed boundaries were delineated based on digital elevation models dems created by the university of florida geoplan center geoplan 2013 and obtained from the florida geographic data library https www fgdl org metadataexplorer explorer jsp the information on soils and land covers was derived from the ssurgo database of the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs 2012 and the cropland data layer cdl of the united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass 2011 respectively for the lake modeling the surface water boundary and bathymetry of the lake were obtained from the geospatial open data portal operated by the south florida water management district sfwmd https geo sfwmd hub arcgis com for both watershed and waterbody modeling the records of weather forcings external loads and in lake water quality concentrations observed from 2011 to 2020 were collected from the environmental database portal of dbhydro https www sfwmd gov science data dbhydro maintained by sfwmd the weather forcing data include the daily time series of atmospheric pressure air temperature relative humidity rainfall depth wind speed and direction evaporation and solar radiation the external water and nutrient loading data include daily streamflow discharge and monthly or biweekly water quality parameter measurements such as total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total suspended solids tss concentrations observed at outlets of the kr and s191 basins the waterbody modeling was calibrated to the concentrations of water quality parameters including algae biomass chlorophyll a chl a total organic carbon tp orthophosphate ammonia total kjeldahl nitrogen nitrate tn tss and dissolved oxygen do observed at the 19 in lake monitoring stations the cyanobacteria concentration data are available only for a limited period starting in 2020 at the majority of the stations thus we selected chl a as a proxy of algal biomass in this study 3 method 3 1 overall in this study we coupled a watershed loading model swat to a receiving waterbody model efdc to consider external loadings to lake okeechobee from the nlo basin as well as the hydrodynamic process and operation rules of the lake when evaluating the overall impacts of projected future climate change on the lake s water quality each model was calibrated and validated to observations made during the same period of 2015 2020 2015 2017 for calibration and 2018 2020 for validation the outputs of the calibrated watershed model were fed to the inflow boundary conditions of the receiving waterbody model shin et al 2019 the future climate projections and the water level operation i e water discharge to its downstream canals scenarios were incorporated into the calibrated watershed and waterbody models to investigate their impacts on the water quality of the nlo basin and lake okeechobee for example the watershed modeling predicted flow tn tp and tss loadings from the basin and the waterbody modeling simulated the algal biomass chl a tn tp tss and do of the lake 3 2 watershed modeling we selected the swat model as a watershed modeling tool for this study considering its proven applicability to various landscapes bosch et al 2010 amatya and jha 2011 zhang et al 2019 and capacity for describing agricultural management practices e g fertilizer applications and grazing operations commonly implemented in the study basin a preliminary study that investigated the performance of swat in its application to one of the study basins s191 demonstrated its acceptable prediction accuracy shin et al 2023 swat has been popularly used for watershed loading modeling presumably because its theoretical backgrounds are well documented its source code is open to the public so that anyone can retrofit it as needed and continuous model version control maintenance and updates the model was designed to describe various watershed and field management practices and evaluate their effects on water sediment and chemical yields in complex watersheds with varying soils land uses and management conditions arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 arnold et al 2012 watershed assessment model wam bottcher et al 2012 can be a good candidate for the hydrology and water quality model of this study when considering a wide range of applications in florida s water management planning however its theoretical background is not documented in detail compared to that of swat and thus it is not easy to understand the simulation mechanisms and interpret the modeling results in terms of approaches and methods used in the modeling in addition the source code is not open and the simulation takes a great deal of time to complete e g 5 8 h for a single 21 year daily simulation for the fec basin using a personal computer that has an intel core i7 8700 k processor 3 70 ghz and 32 gb ram so the use of a sampling based global optimization algorithm is not practical for parameter calibration the two subbasins of the nlo basin were delineated based on the topography represented by the dem the total numbers of 711 and 419 hydrological response units hrus were defined for the kr and the s191 basin respectively considering the unique combinations of land uses and soils with the proportion threshold of 10 land use 10 soil and 0 slope her et al 2015 daily rainfall depths and minimum and maximum air temperatures were collected from 40 weather stations associated with the basin and input to the swat model septic tanks in low density areas fertilizer and manure application in agricultural fields are the sources of nutrients in the basin the information about septic tanks e g location and year built located in the basins was taken from the florida water management inventory website http www floridahealth gov environmental health drinking water flwmi index html which has gaps in the data due to insufficient data availability from several wastewater providers and might add uncertainties for estimating the accurate density of septic systems in each basin the application loading rate and timing of the fertilizers and manure were determined based on the records of livestock numbers from usda nass the florida department of agriculture and consumer services fdacs guideline of agriculture conservation practices and literature table 1 usda nass florida statistics https www nass usda gov statistics by state florida publications livestock and poultry index php mayer et al 1999 rouse and zekri 2002 asae 2005 lowe et al 2009 toor et al 2011 usda ams 2018 khare et al 2019 obreza et al 2020 we selected the calibration parameters of swat and their value ranges based on the literature and our understanding of the parameters abbaspour 2007 douglas mankin et al 2010 arnold et al 2012 her and chaubey 2015 table s2 the parameters were calibrated to flow tn tp and tss load measurements made at the outlets of the study basins fig 1 in the calibration the parameter space of the two swat models for the kr and s191 basins was explored using a sampling based heuristic optimization algorithm namely a multi algorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 the total number of parameter sample sets to be populated was predefined as 10 368 and their performance or accuracy was evaluated in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 in the calibration the sampling algorithm was set to locate or approximate pareto solutions between the nse values of flow tn tp and tss simulations under a multi objective optimization framework this study included two subbasins i e the kr and s191 basins of the nlo basin in the swat modeling the swat model could not provide flow and nutrient load predictions for the other subbasins including fec li ip and tcns at an acceptable accuracy level e g nse 0 5 the details of the calibration results can be found in the supplementary materials s1 these subbasins were relatively highly managed with canals and pumps to control water and nutrient loading to the lake our investigation of the relationship between daily rainfall depth and discharge observed at the basin outlets found that the discharge did not respond to the rainfall events due to the storage of the canal pool and the control of canal gates and pumps figure s2 in addition a hydrological model such as swat cannot represent canal flow in ip diverged from the outlets of li figure s1 and table s3 for the future hydrological projection for these subbasins thus the regression relationships established among flow sediment and nutrient load observations made at the outlets of kr and the other subbasins in the historical periods 2011 2020 were employed to project the future flow sediment and nutrient loads of the subbasins for example the future flow of the fec basin was estimated from that of the kr basin projected using the swat model and gcms based on the regressional relationship between their historical flow the regression equations provided relative errors of less than 15 at the outlets of all the subbasins which were regarded as acceptable in terms of the percentage biases engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 2015 ritter and mu√±oz carpena 2013 however the regression models could not reproduce the daily variations of flow and nutrient loads which were expected to add uncertainty to the following waterbody s water quantity and quality projections the details of the regression coefficients of the simple linear relationships established and the goodness of fit statistics of the regression model can be found in table s5 swat could not reproduce flow and nutrient load predictions at an acceptable level for the entire nlo basins due to its inability to represent highly managed canal and pump flows thus this modeling approach using swat and regression analysis would add uncertainty to the hydrological projections and following waterbody s water quantity and quality projections 3 3 lake modeling we selected efdc hamrick 1992 as a waterbody model for this study to describe the internal hydrodynamics and water quality processes of lake okeechobee considering the model s flexibility and previous experience with lake okeechobee shin et al 2019 2023 efdc has been widely used to simulate the hydrodynamics sediment transport water quality and eutrophication processes of a variety of waterbodies including lake okeechobee jin et al 2000 jin and ji 2004 2013 the source code of efdc is accessible to the public which makes the model highly flexible and easily adaptable hamrick 1992 scavia et al 2016 the model has three sub models including the hydrodynamic sediment transport and water quality models which are integrated into a single source code implementation hamrick 1992 the hydrodynamic model solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with a turbulence closure model which was developed by mellor and yamada 1982 and modified by galperin et al 1988 to account for a vertically hydrostatic terrain hamrick 1992 the sediment transport model simulates the movement of sediment particles in the water column considering the influence of waves currents and sediment resuspension and deposition ji 2017 styles and glenn 2000 the hydrodynamic and sediment transport simulations can be linked to the water quality model ce qual icm cerco and cole 1995 which simulates algae dynamics including algal production or growth basal metabolism predation and settling and nutrient cycles as a function of water temperature dissolved organic and inorganic matter light intensity salinity mineralization and external loads cerco and cole 1995 cerco 2000 the efdc water

levels that limit the growth eqs 2 to 5 ji 2017 bae and seo 2021 light intensity decreases with water depth and sediments eq 4 there is the optimal water temperature range for algal growth and the algal growth rate gradually decreases outside the range eq 5 in this study water temperatures for optimal algal growth were set to the range between 20 ¬∫c and 30 ¬∫c based on the literature cerco and

boundary conditions for a hydrodynamic simulation a computational grid for 625 curvilinear horizontal cells was created with an average resolution of 1700 m using delft3d rgfgrid delft hydraulics 2007 based on the bathymetry information of the lake each grid cell was vertically divided into three layers so that each layer could represent one third of the total water depth the elevation of the bottom of the third layer was determined based on the bathymetry information of the lake https geo sfwmd hub arcgis com the initial conditions of the water surface elevation and the water temperature were assigned to 3 8 m and 20 c based on the observations and literature jin et al 2000 the bottom roughness coefficients were set to 0 05 for the littoral zone and 0 02 for other zones jin and ji 2001 2013 this study selected the constant atmospheric wet deposition rate for orthophosphate of 0 018 mg l and the benthic phosphate rate of 0 001 g m2 day based on the reported annual average of wet phosphorus deposition i e 35 tons year fdep 2001 rainfall depth i e 1100 mm year and tp loadings 653 tons year the boundary conditions were assigned to grid cells corresponding to their physical locations fig 1 the details of the data sources and boundary conditions are summarized in the supplementary materials table s5 the boundary conditions of daily nutrient loads were derived from the regressional relationship between streamflow discharge and nutrient concentrations runkel et al 2004 song et al 2022 the parameters and their ranges were selected based on the literature and theoretical documents for the efdc model wu and xu 2011 gong et al 2016 kim et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 nelson et al 2020 pyo et al 2021 table s2 the parameters were manually calibrated to the water surface elevation the water temperature and the measurements of the concentrations of chl a tn tp tss and do made at the 19 in lake monitoring stations the performance of the

considered eight different climate change projections made using four coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 gcms and two greenhouse gas emission scenarios the representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 the rcps were selected to represent the stabilization rcp 4 5 and worst case scenarios respectively they have been commonly employed in climate change impact studies and analysis thomson et al 2011 jehanzaib et al 2020 xie et al 2020 zamani et al 2020 fan and bai 2021 mattos et al 2021 table 2 the four gcms were selected for this study because they are the only gcms that project the wind speed solar radiation and air pressure required for the efdc modeling the daily gcm outputs were obtained for the historical 1950 2005 and future 2006 2100 periods from the apec climate center data service system https cliks apcc21 org dataset cmip5 the observed meteorological data were then used to correct biases in the daily climate projections made by the gcms at each station and to assess the performance of bias corrected gcm projections in this study we considered three water level operation or water level control scenarios for lake okeechobee based on the 2008 lake okeechobee regulation schedule 2008 lors usace 2008 fig 2 the first scenario high water or hw represents a water level control practice of maintaining high water levels e g 4 87 m in june fig 2 by discharging a relatively small volume of water from the lake high water management band usace 2008 on the other hand the second scenario low water or lw signifies a water control practice to maintain low water levels e g 3 50 m in june fig 2 by discharging a relatively large amount of water from the lake water shortage management band usace 2008 the third scenario average water or aw made for this study maintains the averaged level of stored water between hw and lw the amount of runoff sediment and nutrients discharged from the nlo basin rainfall and lake evapotranspiration was estimated using the climate projections and swat model the volume of the lake s outflows water discharged from the lake was then calculated by applying the estimated inflows to the stage volume relationship of lake okeechobee fig s4 the daily volume of inflows discharged from the drainage basins to the lake and outflows discharged from the lake was estimated using the water balance relationship eq 6 6 s inflow rainfall et outflow where s is the daily change in storage of the lake estimated based on the water level i e water level management scenarios fig 2 and the stage storage relationship for lake okeechobee figure s3 inflow is the volume of inflows discharged from the drainage basins to the lake estimated by watershed modeling and linear regression relationships of the amount of inflow between the kr basin and other inlets of the lake fig s2 rainfall is the daily rainfall projections made using climate projections et is the daily lake evapotranspiration estimated by the abtew method 1996 suggested for lake okeechobee e 0 52 r s Œª where e is evapotranspiration mm day r s is the solar radiation mj m2 and Œª is the latent heat evaporation of water mj kg and outflow is the volume of outflows discharged from the lake that are distributed to the seven outlets of the lake applying the percentage proportions calculated based on outflow measurements from 2011 to 2020 the unit of each component is m3 s 4 results and discussion 4 1 climate projection 4 1 1 northern lake okeechobee basins the air temperature was projected to increase under all climate change scenarios at an annual scale for example the ensemble median air temperature of the kr basin was expected to increase from 23 0 c the baseline period of 1996 2015 in fig 3 to 24 6 c 2075 2095 or p4 in fig 3 under rcp 4 5 and from 23 0 c the baseline period to 26 5 c p4 under rcp 8 5 fig 3 the ensemble median air temperature of the s191 basin was projected to increase by 1 3 c from 23 1 c the baseline period to 24 4 c p4 under rcp 4 5 and by 2 8 c from 23 1 c the baseline period to 25 9 c p4 under rcp 8 5 the projected air temperature increase was accelerated over the periods from p1 to p4 in the case of the kr basin for instance the air temperature was expected to increase by 0 7 c during p1 and the rate was projected to increase to 0 9 c in p4 under rcp 8 5 the seasonal variations of projected air temperature were greater in the wet season i e from may to october than in the dry season fig s5 in the case of the kr basin the ensemble median of monthly average air temperature was projected to increase by 1 9 c from the baseline air temperature of 25 0 c in the wet season under rcp 4 5 but the increase rate decreased to 1 2 c from the baseline air temperature of 21 1 c in the dry season the gcms hadgem2 cc and gfdl esm2g projected the highest and lowest air temperature changes for both basins for instance hadgem2 cc projected the annual average air temperature of the kr basin to increase by 3 3 c in p4 from the baseline air temperature of 23 0 c but gfdl esm2g was expected to increase by 1 3 c under rcp 4 5 the annual average rainfall depth of the kr basin was projected to increase in p1 2 9 and p4 8 8 but decrease in p2 0 8 and p3 4 6 under rcp 4 5 compared to the annual average rainfall depth 1182 mm of the baseline period fig 3 on the other hand the rcp 8 5 scenario projected the rainfall depth to decrease in p1 p2 and p4 and increase by 2 1 in p3 compared to the rainfall depth 1213 mm of the baseline period the air temperature was expected to decrease the most 3 8 in p4 in the case of the s191 basin the annual average rainfall depth was projected to decrease from p1 to p3 and then increase by 3 6 in p4 under rcp 4 5 compared to the baseline projection 1131 mm overall the monthly rainfall depth was expected to decrease in the wet and dry seasons in both basins under rcp 8 5 fig s5 however the rcp 4 5 scenario projected the rainfall depth to increase in the dry season in both basins most of the projected rainfall depth decreases were found in the wet season during all the future periods i e p1 to p4 in both basins the frequency of large greater than 187 mm event rainfall events projected for the baseline and future periods were compared to examine how climate change may affect rainfall intensity in the future table 3 the size of a rainfall event that has a 50 or 2 year return period probability of occurring every year in the s191 basin was estimated to be 187 mm shin et al 2023 and we directly adopted 187 mm as a threshold to define large rainfall events in this study the projections of the large rainfall event frequency varied depending on the gcm models table 3 for instance the gfdl esm2g model projected the number of large events to decrease in the kr basin in future periods compared to those of the baseline period under rcp 4 5 on the other hand the inm cm4 model expected the large event to more frequently occur in the future previous studies reported that the frequency of extreme rainfall events in florida would increase in most regions sfwmd 2022 obeysekera et al 2021 or have no significant change in the future depending on the selection of the climate models wang et al 2013 such a finding demonstrates the amount of uncertainty in rainfall projections on a daily scale her et al 2019 song et al 2020 shin et al 2023 in the case of the annual average air temperature in the kr basin for example the difference between the projections made using the four gcms under rcp 4 5 was 4 in p4 based on the average of the percentage coefficient of variance cv the difference increased to 26 for the annual average rainfall depth in the kr basin this study projected the rainfall depth of the study areas located in central florida to increase in winter but to decrease in summer fig 3 and s5 which corresponds well with the previous studies lee et al 2011 misra et al 2011 rauscher et al 2011 obeysekera et al 2015 swain and hayhoe 2015 kirtman et al 2017 the level of disagreement between the frequency of large rainfall events projected by the gcms table 3 was also reported in other studies wang et al 2013 obeysekera et al 2021 sfwmd 2022 4 1 2 lake okeechobee the air temperature of lake okeechobee was projected to increase under all climate change scenarios from the baseline period to the future periods at the average rate of 0 056¬∫c year from 23 7 ¬∫c for the baseline period to 28 2¬∫c for p4 under rcp 8 5 raimi et al 2020 reported that summer air temperatures in florida would increase from 27 4 ¬∫c to 28 3 ¬∫c in the near future e g from 2020 to 2039 at a rate of 0 045¬∫c year as expected the annual air pressure was projected to remain the same with a slight difference of 0 04 compared to that of the baseline period 1016 mb all four gcms projected the wind speed to decrease by 1 2 3 6 in p4 under rcp 4 5 but they did not agree with each other under rcp 8 5 the gcms also did not agree with each other on the projection of solar radiation inm cm4 projected the solar radiation to decrease by up to 12 5 or 0 025 kw m2 compared to that of the baseline period 0 200 kw m2 under rcp 4 5 however the solar radiation projections made using gfdl esm2g and gfdl esm2m increased over future periods fig 4i and j the trends of the evaporation projections were similar to those of the solar radiation projections the disagreement between the gcms was identified for the projections of evaporation fig 4k and l the evaporation projections made using gfdl esm2g and gfdl esm2m increased over the future period while inm cm4 projected the evaporation decreased by up to 12 8 or 1173 mm year compared to that of the baseline period 1356 mm year under rcp 4 5 in this study we estimated the daily lake evaporation as a function of only the minimum and maximum air temperature and solar radiation using the abtew method 1996 that was suggested for lake okeechobee abtew 2001 price et al 2007 melesse et al 2009 thus the evaporation projections would not be sensitive to the wind speed projection but only the air temperature and solar radiation projections the use of the abtew method was expected to reduce the sensitivity of modeling outputs to highly uncertain wind speed projections the rainfall projections made by the gcms showed relatively large differences in the case of the lz40 weather station located in the middle of the lake for instance the annual average rainfall depth was projected to decrease by up to 9 6 or increase by up to 5 1 compared to the 1023 mm for the baseline period depending on the future periods under rcp 8 5 fig 4 both rcps 4 5 and 8 5 projected rainfall depths to decrease in the wet season but they did not agree with each other in the dry season fig s6 in the case of the rainfall projections made using gfdl esm2g under rcp 4 5 for lake okeechobee for example the monthly average rainfall depths were projected to decrease in the wet seasons by 16 21 in all future periods in the dry seasons on the other hand the gcms expected the monthly average rainfall depth to increase by 3 7 for the same future periods the rainfall projections made for the kr basin showed annual and seasonal trends similar to those of lake okeechobee fig 3 relatively large differences were found between the projections made using the gcms for the wind speed solar radiation and rainfall depth compared to those of air temperature and pressure and the rainfall data showed the largest variations in the projections fig s6 for example the difference between the minimum and maximum projections of the annual rainfall depth was 411 mm or 42 0 compared to the annual average rainfall depth of 980 mm observed in the baseline period in p3 under rcp 4 5 fig 4a in the case of air temperature on the other hand the largest difference of 1 4 c between the projections was found in p4 under rcp 4 5 which corresponds to 5 9 of the annual average air temperature of 23 5 c observed in the baseline period such a finding agrees with other studies that investigated florida s air temperature and rainfall raimi et al 2020 song et al 2020 shin et al 2023 4 2 model calibration the swat models were calibrated validated to daily flow tn tp and tss load observed at the outlets of the kr and s191 basins from 2015 to 2020 at acceptable accuracy levels with nses greater than 0 5 for flow and 0 4 for other water quality variables table 4 figs s7 s8 s9 the previous studies suggested acceptable accuracy levels for watershed modeling engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 2015 ritter and mu√±oz carpena 2013 moriasi et al 2015 recommended nses greater than 0 50 for flow 0 45 for sediment and 0 35 for nitrogen and phosphorus and biases of less than 15 for flow 20 for sediment and 30 for nitrogen and phosphorus in the case of the kr basin the nses and biases in the swat modeling for all the variables were within the acceptable ranges recommended by moriasi et al 2015 and engel et al 2007 the tp load of the s191 basin was overestimated by 42 and 99 in the calibration and validation periods respectively and the swat model provided acceptable accuracy in modeling the other variables in terms of nse and pbias the efdc model also provided acceptable accuracy in reproducing the hydrodynamics and water quality of lake okeechobee there are no general evaluation criteria recommended for receiving waterbody modeling however the previous studies regarded an rrmse of less than 40 as an acceptable efdc modeling level jin and ji 2005 gong et al 2016 tang et al 2021 the efdc model provided negative nses when predicting the water quality variables and such a case could be found in other efdc modeling studies shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 nelson et al 2020 nses are known to be sensitive to large values and the low nses indicate that the receiving waterbody modeling did not well predict the peaks of the water quality variations however it is difficult to predict peaks using the water quality data collected on a biweekly or monthly basis 4 3 watershed loading projection the flow and tss loads of the kr and s191 basins were projected to decrease in all future periods under both rcps at an annual scale except for p1 under rcp 8 5 figs 5 and 6 in the case of the kr basin for instance the ensemble median of the annual average flow was projected to decrease by 16 3 in p3 under rcp 4 5 compared to 60 1 m3 s at the baseline period rcp 8 5 projected the annual average flow to increase by 10 7 in p1 and decrease by up to 15 4 from p2 to p4 compared to 55 6 m3 s at the baseline period the tn load projections varied by the rcp scenarios in the kr basin and they showed a decreasing trend in the s191 basin for example rcps 4 5 and 8 5 for the kr basin projected the ensemble median of the annual average tn loads to increase by up to 1 8 and 44 8 in p2 and p1 respectively compared to the baseline period the tp loads were projected to increase in most of the future periods in the kr and s191 basins for instance the tp loads in the kr basin increased by up to 20 7 in p1 and 44 2 in p3 under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 respectively compared to the baseline period similar to the case of the kr basin the annual average flow and tss loads of the s191 basin were projected to decrease in most of the future periods and the tp load was also expected to decrease in the future fig 6 the ensemble median of the annual average flow and tss load projections decreased by up to 16 9 flow in p3 and 26 5 tss load in p3 in the future periods under rcp 4 5 compared to the baseline period the tn load projections for the s191 basin showed an opposite trend to those of the kr basin the tn load was projected to decrease in all future periods by up to 25 0 in p4 under rcp 4 5 the gcms projected the tp loads of the s191 basin to gradually increase from the baseline period to p4 under both rcp scenarios the tp loads were expected to increase by 70 in p4 the different tn load responses of the kr and s191 basins to future climate changes can be explained by the difference in the amount of fertilizers applied to orange fields the tn load increases were projected only for the orange fields of both basins the application rate of fertilizers was assumed to remain the same i e 845 kg ha application and three times per year table 1 for both basins in the projection but the kr basin has much larger orange fields e g 29 403 ha vs 858 ha than the s191 basin the tp loads were projected to increase in both basins in future periods the application rates of animal manure the annual rate of mineral p of 13 6 and 19 3 kg ha for the kr and s191 basis respectively table 1 in pasture and fertilizers the annual rate of mineral p of 88 7 kg ha for both basins table 1 in orange fields were assumed to be constant in the future which would increase the phosphorus levels of the soils the accumulated amount of soil phosphorus is much greater in the pasture 181 kg ha from the baseline period to p4 using gfdl esm2g under rcp 4 5 for the s191 basin and orange fields 1168 kg ha than in other natural areas such as wetland forests 21 kg ha the increased soil phosphorus levels then would increase the amount of phosphorus to be transported and loaded to downstream waterbodies sharpley et al 1994 whalen and chang 2001 the monthly average flow and tss loads were projected to decrease in most future periods in the kr basin compared to the baseline period figure s10 the tn and tp loads were expected to increase in most cases in the kr basin the monthly average flow and tss loads of the s191 basin were projected to decrease in the wet season but increase in the dry season figure s11 in the case of tn and tp loads however no significant seasonal pattern was identified 4 4 waterbody quality projection the tss tn tp and chl a concentrations of lake okeechobee were projected to increase in future periods but the do concentrations were expected to decrease fig 7 the projected increases in the tn and tp concentrations correspond well to the projected increases in the tn and tp loads from the kr basin to the lake however the lake s tss concentrations were still projected to increase even when decreases in the tss loads from the upstream watersheds were expected this finding implies that the tss concentrations of the lake would be less sensitive to the external loads of tss compared to the tn and tp concentrations in a shallow lake sediments tend to be mixed with overlying water well scheffer and nes 2007 the sediment resuspension and deposition are primarily driven by wind waves and sediment transportation is dominated by the circulation patterns of a lake jin et al 2000 the resuspension and transportation of sediment in large and shallow lakes such as lake okeechobee can affect the physical and chemical environment of the water column suspended sediments can attenuate light in the water column eq 4 which affects algal and aquatic vegetation growth and then the cycling of nutrients organic micropollutants and heavy metals we found strong correlations correlation coefficient greater than 0 7 between the wind speed and tss concentration projections made using gfdl esm2g under rcp 4 5 for p2 e g r of 0 72 and hadgem2 cc under rcp 8 5 for p3 e g r of 0 84 and inm cm4 under rcp 8 5 for p4 e g r of 0 70 however the correlation structure between the projections of external tss loads from the kr basin and tss concentrations in the lake was not strong e g the average r of 0 04 for all projections this indicates that changes in wind speed would have more substantial impacts on the tss concentrations of lake okeechobee than those of external tss loads from its drainage watersheds we converted do concentration to do percentage saturation using surface water temperature and air pressure based on the approach proposed by benson and krause 1984 we investigated how water temperature and the metabolic activity of aquatic organisms e g do production through photosynthesis or do consumption through respiration and decomposition might affect do levels in the water column the metabolic activity of aquatic organisms was estimated using chl a concentration which is an indicator of algal biomass or photosynthetic pigments in the water column for example a high concentration of chl a can indicate a high demand for oxygen through respiration and a high oxygen production potential through photosynthesis to isolate the influence of water temperature or algal biomass on do levels i e do concentration or do percentage saturation we investigated the relationship between the variations of one factor and do concentrations while the other factor stayed at a certain level figs s12 and s13 from the analysis we found that do levels had inverse relationships with both water temperature and chl a concentration when chl a concentrations were stable at 6 7 mg l for example the do concentrations decreased with increases in water temperature from 23 5 to 24 8 because warmer water could hold a smaller amount of oxygen than cooler water fig s12a and s12c the investigation results demonstrated that water temperature controlled do concentrations by affecting the solubility of oxygen in the water furthermore the do levels decreased with increases in chl a concentrations when the water temperature was stable at 24 fig s13a and s13c the modeling experiment showed that the projected increase of external nutrient loads would increase the tn and tp concentrations of lake okeechobee figs 5 and 7 the increased external nutrient loading would promote algal growth leading to a decrease in do concentrations when algae die eventually the decomposition of algal matters by bacteria consumes do which would further decrease the do concentrations in addition the decomposition of algal matters releases the nutrient into the water which can further promote algal growth and lead to algal blooms the direct impacts of the projected increase in external nutrient loadings on the lake s water quality and algal dynamics highlight the importance of nutrient management plans and practices especially in the context of climate change that is expected to increase the frequency of large storm events and resulting external loadings to the lake the projected increase in air temperature would increase the temperature of the lake water which would then create favorable conditions for algal growth when the water temperature falls in the optimal ranges eq 5 the modeling experiment demonstrated these processes for example the chl a concentrations were projected to increase while the air and water temperature were also expected to increase under all climate change scenarios in the future periods fig 7 specifically the chl a concentrations were projected to increase from 7 5 mg l in the baseline period to 9 3 mg l in p4 0 023 mg l year under rcp 8 5 while the water temperature was predicted to increase from 25 2 for all three layers 28 7 for the top layer to 27 5 for all three layers 31 1 for the top layer for the same time frame on the other hand the do concentrations were projected to decrease from 8 5 mg l in the baseline period to 8 0 mg l in p4 under rcp 8 5 fig 7 these modeling results imply that the projected changes in air temperature may negatively affect the water quality of the lake the tss and tn concentrations were projected to increase in both wet and dry seasons compared to the baseline scenario or period fig 8 the tp concentrations were also expected to increase but the projections made for the wet and dry seasons showed large differences for instance the projected tp concentrations made for the wet and dry seasons increased by up to 40 3 and 17 0 respectively in p4 under rcp 8 5 this is presumably due to the increased tp loads from the kr and s191 basins in the wet season the projected chl a concentrations also exhibited a clear seasonal pattern for example the chl a concentrations were projected to increase by up to 71 6 in the dry season but up to 6 8 in the wet season in p4 under rcp 8 5 the seasonal difference might be due to the projected changes in the air temperature the air temperature of the lake was projected to increase by up to 3 0 c from 20 4 to 23 4 c in the dry season and 3 4 c from 27 1 to 30 5 c in the wet season in p4 under rcp 8 5 4 5 water level operation scenario analysis the water quality variables of lake okeechobee uniquely responded to the water level operation scenarios fig 9 for example the lake s tn and tp concentrations projected under the hw scenario were lower than those of the other two scenarios i e aw and lw we calculated the water residence time for the three different water level operation scenarios hw aw and lw using a climate projection made using one of the climate change scenarios e g gfdl esm2g under rcp 4 5 for the period from 2021 to 2095 for the purpose of demonstration fig s14 the average lake water volumes for the hw aw and lw scenarios were projected to be 6 3 109 m3 5 0 109 m3 and 3 9 109 m3 respectively and the corresponding annual average water residence times were predicted to be 3 49 years 2 97 years and 2 17 years respectively the water volumes and residence times for the hw and aw scenarios were greater than the observed annual average of 2 46 years table s7 the differences in the water volumes and retention times could lead to different nutrient retention capacities of the lake which would then affect the concentrations of water quality parameters for instance the hw scenario i e the highest water level operation scenario provided the greatest water volume water and nutrient retention times leading to the greatest decrease in nutrient concentrations compared to the other scenarios the results can be explained by the fact that a longer water residence time increases the nutrient retention capacity and then nutrient removal efficiency vollenweider 1975 finlay et al 2013 tong et al 2019 this finding implies that maintaining a high water level can help mitigate the water quality problem of high nutrient concentrations the chl a and do concentration projections were less sensitive to the water level operation scenarios than the tn and tp concentration projections fig 9i and j for example the average differences between the projections of chl a and do concentrations under the rcp 8 5 scenario were relatively smaller 5 8 for chl a and 0 5 for do than those 11 5 for tn and 15 8 for tp of the tn and tp concentrations the details of calculating the distance between hw and lw projections can be found in table s6 under the hw scenario decreased nutrient concentrations due to dilution would slow algal growth and decrease chl a concentrations in addition increased water depth would decrease the light intensity reaching the bottom of the water column leading to decrease in chl a concentrations however the hw condition may not be able to be maintained in the wet season when rainfall and inflow are relatively large furthermore the water level operation scenarios may change water temperature depending on the types of water discharged from the lake if part of water is discharged or removed from the lower layer that is generally colder than water of the upper layers for example the overall water temperature of the lake may increase which can lead to increases in algal growth and chl a concentrations the opposite may happen if water is discharged from the upper layer thus the impacts of the water level operations on chl a concentrations would not be straightforward and changes in chl a concentrations may not be always correlated to those in tn and tp concentrations liu et al 2014 ji et al 2017 tang et al 2021 considering that do concentrations are sensitive to the rates of algal growth and death do concentrations also may be less responsive to the water level scenarios than the nutrient concentrations this finding suggests that the water level manipulation of the lake may not be effective for the mitigation of algal blooms but rather only for the reduction of nutrient concentrations the chl a and do concentration projections were more responsive to the climate change scenarios than to the three different water level operation scenarios fig 10 this finding confirms that the chl a concentrations of the lake would be more directly controlled by the projected climate changes than the internal changes caused by water level operation scenarios in the future moreover the seasonal differences in the chl a and do projections were greater than those of the tn and tp projections fig 10 studies showed that chl a and do concentrations would be more sensitive to seasonal changes in weather conditions than tn or tp concentrations zeng et al 2015 xiong et al 2023 the finding indicates that seasonal weather change may have substantial impacts on the water quality of the lake but the extent of these changes would vary depending on the water quality parameter being considered 5 conclusions this study evaluated the impacts of climate change on the water quantity and quality of the watersheds lake system using a spatially integrated modeling framework the modeling experiments found that the flow and tss loads from the upstream drainage basins of the lake might decrease in the future the projection of tn load to the lake varied depending on the basins their land uses and rcps the tp load was projected to increase in the future when the current manure and fertilizer rates were maintained the same in agricultural lands the water quality of lake okeechobee was projected to degrade in the future due to the projected increase in air temperature and or in the external nutrient loads from the upstream watersheds the water level operation e g hw was found to reduce the tn and tp concentrations of lake okeechobee but led to little change in the chl a concentrations the modeling experiment found that the chl a and do concentrations of the lake would be more sensitive to the climate forcings while the tn and tp concentrations would be more responsive to the external loadings from the upstream basins and the water level operation scenarios the findings suggest that the water level operation practices would reduce the nutrient levels but may not help mitigate algal blooms the results demonstrate that the water quality of the lake was a function of air temperature and internal hydrodynamics driven by lake water level operation and wind as well as nutrient loads from the upstream areas the future land use operations of the water control structures and agricultural management practices were assumed to be the same as the current practice which might be unrealistic conditions and add to uncertainty in the modeling results however the assumptions enabled us to test whether the current conditions can be effective under future climate changes future studies may consider various land use scenarios incorporating land use change dynamics and nutrient management scenarios the findings are expected to help develop spatially integrated climate adaptation plans for improved sustainability of the watershed lake system credit authorship contribution statement satbyeol shin conceptualization methodology

7667,study region inner tibetan plateau itp is the largest plateau in the world with only four national basic stations covering an area of 5 76 105 km2 study focus satellite precipitation products spps have widely been evaluated on a regional scale however a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of spps using multiple indices has not been reported here 16 spps were quantitatively and comprehensively evaluated for precipitation occurrence and time series using an improved rank score rs method the new observation network which had more than the number of national stations was applied for evaluating spps to increase the reliability of results new hydrological insights for the region integrated multi satellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement imerg early and imerg late runs showed the best overall performance with an rs value of 0 91 the optimal spps varied according to the evaluation indices but mostly belonged to imerg early imerg late multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep global satellite mapping of precipitation near real time gsmap nrt and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann dynamic infrared rain rate near real time pdir now overall most spps detected precipitation however the spps poorly measured the precipitation time series but adequately detected precipitation in the range of 10 25 mm in terms of the three indices of precipitation occurrence the proposed improved rs method can be used to comprehensively evaluate other products and models graphical abstract ga1 keywords comprehensive evaluation satellite precipitation data multiple indices rank score qiangtang plateau northern tibet data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate estimates of precipitation are important for hydrological modelling weather forecasting and water resource management golian et al 2015 terink et al 2018 wang et al 2018 gauge observations are the most intuitive method for measuring precipitation yu et al 2020 however relatively few precipitation gauge stations are located in the vast and sparsely populated areas of western china and areas such as the unpopulated areas in the inner tibetan plateau itp are not even monitored the sparse distribution of meteorological gauges and or discontinuities in recording sequences often results in inaccurate estimation of the spatiotemporal features of precipitation duan et al 2016 satellite measurements can be used to directly monitor areal precipitation on a global scale the latest satellite precipitation products spps are becoming more accurate and reliable than before owing to the combination of multi satellite data with gauge observations and progress in retrieval algorithms the increased availability consistency and spatiotemporal resolution of spps have facilitated their widespread applications since spps have inherent drawbacks due to indirect observations of precipitation and inadequate sampling it is necessary to evaluate the performance of these global products before their regional applications sun et al 2018 overall the performance evaluations of spps have shown that the final version of the product of the integrated multi satellite retrievals from global precipitation measurement imerg final outperforms other products on the global and regional scales chen et al 2020 including in australia islam et al 2020 bali island liu et al 2020 bangladesh montes et al 2021 central asia peng et al 2021 eastern himalaya kumar et al 2021 india saikrishna et al 2021 nigeria nwachukwu et al 2020 thailand gunathilake et al 2020 and vietnam le et al 2020 although these evaluations have indicated that imerg final is the best spp in china chen et al 2020 tang et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 2021 xu et al 2022 it performed poorly in western china particularly in mountainous e g the qinghai tibetan plateau and arid regions zhang et al 2020 tang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 the inner tibetan plateau itp also known as qiangtang plateau is the largest plateau in the world with an average elevation of more than 5000 m above sea level located in the heart of the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp it is also called the third pole only four national basic stations are in itp covering an area of 5 76 105 km2 zhan et al 2023 first evaluated the imerg and global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap products via new observations on the western qtp and found that gsmap outperformed imerg similar results were observed while evaluating spps in the qtp for example gao and liu 2013 evaluated four spps in the qtp and found that the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42 and the climate prediction centre morphing technique outperformed other products over itp li et al 2021 evaluated three spps over the qtp and found that gsmap outperformed tmpa 34b2 and imerg final products in itp the spps in the qp performed poorly compared with those in other regions of china zhang et al 2020 tang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 accurate measurement of precipitation in itp is challenging because of its insufficient gauge sites complex terrain and high spatial heterogeneity in precipitation ma et al 2018 wang et al 2020 only four national basic stations that cover an area of 5 76 105 km2 in itp were used in the previous studies the low density of the station coverage notably limits the evaluation of spps in itp based on the ground observation stations set by researchers the national tibetan plateau data centre ntpdc developed a new precipitation observation network for itp this provides a new and spatially extended network of ground based observations for evaluating spps in the data scarce itp currently the evaluations of spps based on the new itp observation networks remain qualitative or limited although multiple indices have been used in other words only a few comprehensive quantitative evaluations of spps have been conducted using multiple indices with a prime focus on itp the key objectives of this study were to 1 develop an improved rank score rs method for a comprehensive quantitative evaluation and 2 quantitatively and comprehensively evaluate the ability of 16 spps to detect precipitation occurrence and time series based on the new observation network over itp 2 materials and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 gauge observed precipitation data gauge observed precipitation data from 47 ground stations including the national basic stations

precipitation occurrence the joint distribution of the satellite and gauge measurements is used to evaluate the ability of spps to detect precipitation wilks 2019 the marginal distribution of the satellite and gauge measurements can be classified as true positive a observed precipitation correctly detected by the satellite false negative b precipitation detected by the satellite but not observed false positive c observed precipitation not detected by the satellite and true negative d no precipitation observed or detected by the satellite various performance statistics can be calculated using the confusion matrix the most common parameters used to evaluate satellite measurements include the probability of detection pod also called the true positive rate or hit rate false positive rate fpr also called the false alarm rate false alarm ratio far critical success index csi also called the threat score and accuracy acc which were used in this study as follows fawcett 2006 ebert et al 2007 wilks 2019 1 pod a a c 2 fpr b b d 3 far b a b 4 csi a a b c 5 acc a d a b c d where pod far and csi are the fractions of precipitation occurrences that were correctly detected precipitation detections that were false alarm and observed and detected precipitation that was correctly detected respectively in particular these measures were useful when a precipitation event occurred substantially less frequently than the non occurrence of precipitation wilks 2019 which was consistent with the actual precipitation occurrence over itp according to the observation of the minimum unit precipitation a precipitation event was defined as daily precipitation when 0 1 mm 2 2 2 evaluation criteria for simulating precipitation time series the criteria used to evaluate the performance of the simulated monthly time series included relative error re pearson s correlation coefficient cc index of agreement ioa kling gupta efficiency kge and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse willmott et al 2012 gupta et al 2009 nash and sutcliffe 1970 the re value represented the deviation of bias from the observed values the kge value which integrates cc re and standard deviation was used instead of a single standard deviation the ioa and nse values indicated the goodness of fit of the simulated and observed time series data the best fit value was 1 0 whereas the goodness of fit value deteriorated with the increase in deviation from 1 0 the evaluation criteria were estimated as follows 6 re 1 n i 1 n x mi x oi x oi 7 cc i 1 n x oi x o x mi x m i 1 n x oi x o 2 i 1 n x mi x m 2 8 ioa 1 i 1 n x mi x oi 2 i 1 n x mi x o x oi x o 2 9 kge 1 1 cc 2 re 2 1 sd m sd o 2 10 sd 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 11 nse 1 i 1 n x mi x oi 2 i 1 n x oi x o 2 where x mi and x oi were the i th values of the satellite and observed precipitation time series respectively n was the time series length x m and x o were the means of the satellite and observed values respectively and sd m and sd o were the standard deviations of the satellite and observed precipitation respectively 2 2 3 comprehensive evaluation based on an improved rank score method the rs based evaluation uses multiple indices to comprehensively evaluate the performance of a model fu et al 2013 this method is similar to the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method li et al 2019 and subjectively merges rs values into integers ranging from 0 to 9 in this study an improved rs method was developed which objectively evaluated the comprehensive performance of a model using the degree of deviation between each index value and the optimal value of all the models the improved rs method was implemented as follows 12 rs i x i x min x max x min positive indexes 1 x i x min x max x min negative indexes where x i was the index value of the satellite product and x min and x max were the minimum and maximum index values for all the spps respectively the positive indices were pod csi acc cc ioa kge and nse while the negative indices included far fpr and the absolute value of re the rs metric was first calculated from the mean value of each index for each spp the total rs value for each spp was obtained by averaging the rs value for each index the performance of the spps in detecting precipitation occurrence and measuring precipitation time series was evaluated using the occurrence pod far fpr csi and acc and time series re cc ioa kge and nse indices respectively the measurements via the spps were comprehensively evaluated using the rs values of all 10 indices the 16 spps were evaluated using the gauge observed precipitation data from itp and the raw spatial resolution of each spp was used for the evaluation the pixels closest to each ground station were selected for each spp the evaluation was based on a daily time series and evaluation period was the time of intersection of each ground station and spp 3 results 3 1 ability of spps to detect precipitation occurrence the performance of the 16 spps for detecting precipitation at the 47 stations is shown in fig 2 in general satellite products were used to detect the probability of precipitation the mean pod value of all the spps across all the stations was 0 72 the mswep product showed the best performance with the pod value of all the stations exceeding 0 90 which was notably greater than the corresponding values of the other spps the mean pod value of mswep across all the stations was 0 98 this result was mainly due to higher precipitation frequency in mswep than in the other products a higher precipitation frequency also resulted in a higher far value in addition persiann cdr and imerg showed enhanced ability with the pod value being above 0 80 at more than 80 of the stations the mean and median pod values of the four products were approximately 0 90 the gsmap nrt products performed poorly with a mean pod value of 0 40 although the spps captured the probability of precipitation many false alarms were recorded for precipitation events the mean fpr and far values for all the products across all the stations were 0 38 and 0 39 respectively the evaluation results of fpr and far were opposite to those of pod the gsmap nrt product showed the best performance in terms of fpr and far with the mean fpr and far values of all the stations being 0 15 and 0 34 respectively the fpr value was 0 20 at 75 35 47 of the stations the mswep product showed the highest far value with the mean fpr and far values of 0 68 and 0 46 respectively the mean csi value of all the products across all the stations was 0 48 the performance of each spp varied substantially with the median csi value of all the stations ranging from 0 3 to 0 60 in each product the imerg product performed the best with a mean csi value of approximately 0 60 the csi value was 0 50 at 87 41 47 of the stations the gsmap mvk product performed poorly with a csi value of 0 30 at 55 26 47 of the stations the mean acc value for all the products across all the stations was 0 68 compared with the other four occurrence indices the acc performance varied relatively slightly among the spps the imerg early and imerg late products outperformed the other spps with a mean and median acc value of 0 74 the cmorph crt and cmorph cdr products exhibited the weakest performances with a mean and median acc value of 0 62 the performance of the spps for detecting precipitation occurrence at different levels of precipitation is shown in fig 3 overall the performance of the spps showed a positive correlation with the precipitation levels when fpr and acc were evaluated a higher precipitation amount enhanced the performance of the spps with the increased precipitation amount the performance of the spps first increased and then fell under the pod far and csi indices the spps exhibited the highest ability to capture precipitation in the range of 10 25 mm in terms of csi the spps efficiently detected precipitation in the range of 5 25 mm than at the other levels however all the products failed to capture 0 1 2 mm precipitation and rainstorms daily precipitation 50 mm with the mean csi value of all the stations being lower than 0 30 for each product the performances of the spps significantly varied from one another at each level the mswep product showed the best performance for precipitation 50 mm particularly in the range of 2 50 mm with the mean csi value of all the stations being 0 60 the evaluation results of pod and far were consistent with those of csi the acc based evaluation showed no notable difference in the performance of spps at each level of precipitation the standard deviation derived from the mean acc value of all the stations among the spps was within 0 05 for precipitation levels 2 mm the spps exhibited the weakest performance in capturing 0 1 2 mm precipitation occurrence with the mean acc value of all the products being 0 67 all the spps exhibited improvement in their ability to record precipitation over 5 mm particularly for heavy rain and rainstorms the evaluation results of fpr were consistent with those of acc 3 2 spatiotemporal performance of spps in detecting precipitation occurrence the spatial distribution performance of the spps in detecting precipitation is shown in fig 4 although it varied significantly among the indices the ability of the spps to capture precipitation varied minimally among the stations concerning the average performance of all the products the spps correctly evaluated the probability of precipitation in itp pod 0 60 except for three stations located at the margins of the northern and southern regions however the ability of the spps varied substantially with the standard deviation of pod among the spps varying between 0 11 and 0 29 in each station the variation was relatively greater in the central and northern itp regions than in the other regions with a standard deviation of pod 0 25 at most stations in terms of csi the spps showed strong capture ability csi 0 50 at only 36 of the stations mainly located in the eastern itp overall the ability of the spps varied slightly with a standard deviation of csi 0 16 at most stations 44 47 the variation was lowest in the western itp with a standard deviation of csi 0 08 at most stations the evaluation of acc showed that spps effectively captured the precipitation occurrence in itp overall this ability varied minimally between the stations and spps the acc value was 0 60 at most stations 45 47 and 0 65 at 77 of the stations 36 47 the standard deviation of acc was concentrated in the range of 0 06 0 08 and lower than 0 08 at 77 of the stations stations with a standard deviation of acc 0 16 were mainly located in the central and southern itp the overall performance of the spps in terms of fpr was better in the western itp than in the eastern itp the overall fpr value was 0 30 in the eastern itp for a few stations it was 0 50 but was 0 30 in the western regions similar to the spatial distribution of fpr the variation among the spps was greater in the eastern itp than in the western itp overall the standard deviation of fpr was 0 30 and 0 30 in the eastern and western itp respectively contrary to fpr far was 0 30 in the entire itp the far values of the spps were consistent with each other with a standard deviation of far 0 16 at almost all the stations 46 47 the spatial distribution of imerg early was consistent with the average performance of all the products while evaluating acc csi fpr and far overall imerg early displayed an above average performance across all the products with pod 0 80 at 83 39 47 of the stations the ability of imerg early to detect far was lower than the average performance of all the products with far 0 50 at most stations mainly located in the western and northern itp overall imerg early was capable of detecting precipitation occurrence in itp with pod 0 80 and csi 0 60 at most stations the performance of imerg early evaluated using acc and fpr was better in the western itp than in the eastern itp which was similar to the average performance of all the products however the far evaluation showed a different spatial distribution the ability of the spps to capture precipitation occurrence was also analysed for different months the cold december march and warm june september seasons and annually firstly the mean value of the evaluation indices of all the stations was calculated for each spp then the minimum maximum and median indices of the 16 spps were statically calculated the performances of the spps in the different periods are shown in fig 5 the performance of the spps in capturing the probability of precipitation varied substantially between the products and periods fig 5a with the median pod value of all the products varying between 0 20 and 0 80 overall the ability of the spps to capture was notably higher during the warm season than during the cold season the mean pod value of all the stations in each product was mainly concentrated in the range of 0 64 0 91 25 75 frequency range the same as below in the warm season except for gsmap nrt gsmap mvk and chirps the other spps showed a strong capturing ability with a mean pod value of all the stations being 0 60 the mean pod value was concentrated in the range of 0 10 0 52 in the cold season most spps 12 16 showed weak capturing ability during the cold season with a mean pod value of 0 50 except for mswep persiann persiann ccs and persiann cdr the overall performance of the spps showed a unimodal distribution throughout the year with their capture ability being strongest in july and weakest in december most spps lost their ability to capture the precipitation occurrence in december mean pod 0 50 except for mswep and persiann ccs mean pod 0 60 the performance of the spps evaluated using fpr also varied notably in different products and periods fig 5c with the median pod value of all the products varying between 0 11 and 0 53 the frp value was higher during the warm season than during the cold season the mean fpr value of each spp was mainly concentrated in the range of 0 29 0 48 in the warm season during the cold season fpr was predominantly in the range of 0 04 0 24 overall the monthly fpr value showed an annual unimodal distribution the fpr value was the highest in december with the mean fpr value of the spps concentrated in the range of 0 38 0 68 the gsmap nrt exhibited the best performance with a mean fpr value of 0 28 the fpr value was the lowest in january and december with the fpr value of the spps predominantly being in the range of 0 04 0 20 the performance of the spps evaluated using far also varied notably for different periods fig 5b however the variation of different products evaluated using far was lower than those evaluated using the other indices with the standard deviation of the mean far value of each spp being lower than 0 10 in most periods this indicated that the ability of the spps to detect far remained relatively consistent among the spps this result differed from those obtained using pod and far overall far was notably higher during the warm season than during the cold season the mean far value of each spp during the warm season was between 0 22 and 0 43 the imerg final product exhibited the best performance with the lowest far all the spps showed weak capturing ability in terms of far with the mean far value of each spp ranging from 0 63 to 0 91 in the cold season overall the monthly far value showed an annual single valley distribution the far value showed the best performance in july with a mean far value of the spps being between 0 18 and 0 30 the imerg product exhibited the best performance the chirps tmpa 3b42 and tmpa 3b42rt products also outperformed mean far 0 19 the other spps the far value peaked in december with the mean far value of most spps being above 0 90 the performance of the spps evaluated by the csi also showed a minimal difference in spps with a standard deviation being lower than 0 10 in most periods except for july the performance was notably better during the warm season than during the cold season the mean csi value of all the stations was larger than 0 50 for most spps 11 16 all the spps performed inefficiently during the cold season the mswep has the best performance with a mean csi value of 0 34 the csi value showed a regular annual unimodal distribution the spps showed the best performance in july with the mean csi value being concentrated in the range of 0 61 0 70 the performance of the spps evaluated using acc showed a minimal difference in the warm season with a standard deviation of approximately 0 06 the performance in terms of the first four indices showed a notable annual seasonal pattern however the performance in terms of acc did not show a seasonal variation the difference in the performance between the warm and cold seasons was not significant with the median acc values of each product recorded at 0 68 and 0 72 respectively 3 3 ability of spps in measuring precipitation time series the performance of the spps in measuring monthly precipitation at the observation stations is shown in fig 6 the bias varied notably for both the products and stations overall the re value varied between 80 and 80 at all the stations the mean re value of all the stations ranged from 55 98 in the spps most spps 9 16 overestimated precipitation in itp the mean overestimation of each spp at all the stations ranged from 8 to 98 with a mean value of 43 the mswep product which showed the best performance in terms of re underestimated the itp precipitation by 1 but substantially varied among the stations with only 23 of the stations 11 47 having an re value within 10 the imerg and tmpa 3b42 products also showed a better performance than the other products with a mean re value of 15 the re value of tmpa 3b42 was within 20 at 43 of the stations 20 47 the persiann ccs product was least accurate at estimating the amount of precipitation and overestimated by approximately 98 overall the measurements via the spps showed a strong positive correlation with the observed monthly precipitation in itp except for persiann the imerg product showed the strongest correlation and the mean cc value of all the stations was 0 84 the cc value of imerg final was greater than 0 70 at 94 44 47 of the stations the chirps and persiann cdr products also showed a strong correlation with a mean cc value of 0 83 the cc values of the two products were larger than 0 70 at 86 37 47 and 91 39 47 of the stations respectively the imerg early measurements strongly complied with the monthly observed precipitation in itp with a mean nse value of all the stations being 0 60 the nse value was 0 60 at 81 of the stations the measurements of pdir now and imerg late also conformed with the monthly observed time series with nse 0 60 at approximately 74 of the stations the mean nse values of the two products were 0 57 and 0 56 respectively however the other spps inefficiently complied with the monthly precipitation with a mean nse value of 0 40 for each spp the results of kge were consistent with those of nse in terms of kge the spps performed inefficiently with the mean kge value of all the spps being 0 07 the persiann cdr and imerg early products showed the best performance with kge 0 50 at approximately 74 and 67 of all the stations respectively however the mean kge value of all the stations was approximately 0 46 in the two products the variation of the spps among the stations was substantially smaller in terms of ioa than in terms of the other four indices the imerg early and imerg late products exhibited the best performance with the mean ioa value of all the stations reaching 0 90 overall the evaluation results of all the series indices showed that imerg early imerg late and pdir now outperformed the other products for measuring monthly precipitation time series in itp fig 7 showed the spatial distribution performance of the spps for measuring monthly precipitation in itp the imerg early underestimated precipitation at most stations 32 47 and greatly underestimated re 25 at 25 stations mainly located in the western and northern regions given the average performance of the 16 spps re was within 25 at most stations 35 47 the highest overestimation re 25 was at 11 stations chiefly located in the southeast regions including the lakes of selin co nam co and geren co overall the average performance of all the spps was better than most single products for measuring mean values due to the complementarity between the products the spp measurements were close to the observed values at the eastern stations with re being within 20 the spps substantially overestimated precipitation at the western and northern stations re 40 the satellite measurements varied substantially among the spps with the standard deviation of re among the spps 50 at 38 stations the other four indices showed that the average performance of all the spps was notably lower than that of imerg early given the average performance of all the spps only a few stations showed cc 0 80 the imerg early dataset included 36 stations with cc 0 80 the correlation between the measurements via the spps and observational values was substantially lower at the central and northern stations than at the other stations the ioa results were similar to those of cc the average performance of all the spps was inadequate when evaluated by nse and kge whose values were 0 50 at the 91 and 100 stations respectively the nse evaluation showed that imerg early performed well at most stations with nse 0 70 at 64 of the stations these stations were mainly located in the western south eastern and northern regions several stations mainly those located east of the selin co lake performed weakly 3 4 comprehensive evaluation of spps the overall performance of the spps was quantitatively evaluated using the improved rs method based on the 10 indices of precipitation occurrence and time series table 2 the evaluation of the five indices based on precipitation occurrence showed that the strongest spps were concentrated in imerg early imerg late gsmap nrt and mswep the mswep product showed the strongest performance in terms of pod with the strongest ability to capture precipitation in itp but had the weakest performance in terms of far and fpr the gsmap nrt product exhibited the strongest performance in terms of far and fpr with the lowest far value however it was the least accurate for capturing the precipitation occurrence with the lowest pod and csi values the imerg late and imerg early products showed the strongest performance in terms of csi and acc with the strongest overall capture capability these findings were confirmed through a comprehensive assessment of the five indices of precipitation occurrence using the improved rs method the imerg late and imerg early products showed the highest rs values of 0 86 and 0 85 respectively whereas cmorph cdr had the lowest rs value of 0 34 based on the precipitation time series the evaluation of the five indices showed that the spps with the strongest performance were imerg mswep and pdir now the imerg early product performed well in terms of cc nse and ioa indicating that the imerg early measurements were highly correlated and complied with the observed precipitation time series in terms of kge pdir now showed the strongest performance indicating that the mswep measurements exhibited the highest combined performance of the mean standard deviation and correlation values the mswep measurements were closest to the mean itp precipitation based on the precipitation time series the comprehensive evaluation of the five indices showed that imerg early had the strongest performance in measuring the observed time series with an rs value of 0 98 in addition imerg late outperformed the other spps with a rs value of 0 97 whereas persiann ccs exhibited the weakest comprehensive performance with a rs value of 0 16 and in terms of the re nse kge and ioa indices based on the precipitation occurrence and time series the comprehensive evaluation of all the 10 indices showed that imerg early and imerg late outperformed the other spps with a rs value of 0 91 overall imerg final pdir now and chirps outperformed the other spps with a rs value 0 75 the persiann ccs and cmorph cdr products exhibited the weakest comprehensive performances with the rs values of 0 36 and 0 40 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 improvements limitations and uncertainties the novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive quantitative evaluation of spps using multiple indices previous comprehensive evaluation results for spps were obtained from qualitative analyses of multiple indices which were subjectively determined and thus different comprehensive evaluation results may have been obtained this study comprehensively and quantitatively evaluated 16 spps using multiple indices based on the improved rs method the improved rs method provides the objective and comprehensive evaluation results and facilitates comprehensive evaluation of other products and models in addition this study included the new ground observation network set up by researchers to increase the reliability of the evaluation results for itp this study evaluated more spps and found that several new spps outperformed satellite products evaluated previously for example mswep and persiann cdr not included in previous evaluation reports for itp showed the best performance in terms of pod the mean pod value of mswep calculated for all the stations was 0 98 which was significantly higher than those of the other spps the mean pod value of persiann cdr was 0 90 which was also higher than the previously evaluated optimal spps 0 75 gao and liu 2013 ma et al 2018 li et al 2021 the satellite based measurements observed areal precipitation whereas ground station based observations were limited to the site scale although the station observations are often used as a reference to evaluate spps on a regional scale spatial scale differences inevitably occur during the evaluation therefore the evaluation results of the spps based on the station observations were considered as a reference value for comparative studies of the spps but not the absolute results of the evaluation further studies on spatial scale which were beyond the scope of this study must be conducted the utc of the spps was inconsistent with the beijing ground based observation time the hourly observed precipitation at the cma and ntpdc stations was converted to utc to make them consistent with the spp as described in section 2 1 1 based on the cma and ntpdc stations the spps were evaluated with ground observation in beijing in addition to the evaluation of the consistent time series between the spps and station observations a comparison of these two evaluation results showed that time inconsistency slightly affected each index value when the precipitation occurrence indices were used however this did not change the comparative evaluation results of the different spps thus time inconsistency resulted in a minimal effect on the results of the five indices of the time series 4 2 performance of spps in terms of indices precipitation levels and temporal periods the performance of the spps varied substantially for the different evaluation indexes and these indices yielded completely opposite evaluation results for example the performance of the spps in terms of the occurrence indices of pod csi and far was better in the warm season than in the cold season however the results of the occurrence of same type of indices of the fpr and acc were opposite fig 5 the gsmap nrt product exhibited the weakest performance in terms of pod and csi but was the strongest one in terms of far and fpr the mswep product exhibited the strongest performance in terms of pod but the weakest one in terms of far and fpr therefore multiple indices representing different characteristics are recommended to comprehensively evaluate spps this approach can be used for evaluating other products or models the spps evaluated using pod csi and far showed the strongest ability to detect precipitation in the range of 10 25 mm however rainstorms in itp were captured with reduced accuracy this result was consistent with the results of lei et al 2021 for the eastern qtp however in the evaluation using the fpr and acc the overall performance of the spps positively correlated with the precipitation levels a comparison with previous evaluations of spps in itp revealed similar results and also indicated a few inconsistent conclusions gao and liu 2013 found that tmpa 34b2 and cmorph outperformed tmpa 3b42rt and persian in itp the pod value was even lower than the far at itp cma stations in this study similar results were observed at all the stations li et al 2021 found that gsmap mvk outperformed tmpa 34b2 and imerg final at itp cma stations however this study found that the imerg measurements showed the strongest performance as evaluated at both the cma and ntpdc stations this might be due to the combination of all satellite microwave precipitation estimates with microwave calibrated infrared satellite estimates and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine spatiotemporal resolutions for the trmm and gpm eras improvements in the calibration of the imerg products might be expected to increase accuracy of precipitation estimates at the regional scale sui et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 xu et al 2022 in addition imerg early and imerg late showed stronger performance than imerg final indicating that the data processing in the final version limited the improvement in the product accuracy over the data scarce itp this study focused on the comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the 16 spps in itp several studies have recently published satellite model based and reanalysis precipitation products calibrated by gauge analysis for example the asian precipitation dataset improved using the fifth generation atmospheric reanalysis product of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era5 land aera5 asia and imerg aimerg might also be valuable for applications in itp ma et al 2020 2022 xu et al 2022 in addition more studies must be conducted on the fusion of multi source spps by considering precipitation events such as the morphology based adaptive algorithm of spatiotemporal merging zhu et al 2022 to further improve the accuracy of the satellite based measurements at the regional scale although spps could detect precipitation occurrences and time series in itp their performance in itp was relatively weak compared with that recorded in other areas in china for example tang et al 2020 found that the mean csi value of optimal spps in china is close to 0 70 however this study estimated the mean csi value of the optimal spps in itp at only 0 48 wei et al 2021 reported that the mean kge value of optimal spps in eastern china was 0 90 with a value 0 70 for most spps in this study the evaluation of both the ntpdc and cma stations showed that the mean kge value was 0 50 in each spp overall the accuracy of the measurements via the spps in itp requires further improvement nevertheless the results of this study can assist in improving spps for itp 5 conclusions based on the new observation network and national basic stations the improved rs method was used to quantitatively and comprehensively evaluate 6 spps in itp via the 10 indices of the precipitation occurrence and time series overall imerg early and imerg late showed the strongest performance when evaluated using precipitation occurrence and series indexes with an rs value of 0 91 the imerg late and imerg early products outperformed the others in measuring the precipitation occurrence rs 0 86 and time series rs 0 98 respectively although the optimal spps varied according to the evaluation indices they were concentrated among imerg early imerg late mswep gsmap nrt and pdir now the spps showed the highest ability to capture the precipitation occurrence in the range of 10 25 mm when evaluated using the pod far and csi indices moreover the spps performed better in the western and northern itp regions than in the other regions the performance was relatively weak in the middle east of itp mainly in the selin co lake basin overall most spps detected precipitation the mean pod csi acc far and fpr values for all the spps across all the stations were 0 72 0 48 0 68 0 39 and 0 38 respectively however the spps showed a relatively weak performance in measuring the precipitation time series the mean kge value for each spps was 0 50 only a few spps captured the precipitation time series with the mean nse value of all the stations exceeding 0 55 therefore the measurements via the spps over itp must be further improved particularly when precipitation time series are measured the evaluation of the spps in itp is useful for the estimation of precipitation in other data scarce regions and improving the accuracy of spps at regional scale additionally multiple indices representing different characteristics are recommended to evaluate spps to obtain comprehensive evaluation results the proposed improved rs method can

7667,study region inner tibetan plateau itp is the largest plateau in the world with only four national basic stations covering an area of 5 76 105 km2 study focus satellite precipitation products spps have widely been evaluated on a regional scale however a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of spps using multiple indices has not been reported here 16 spps were quantitatively and comprehensively evaluated for precipitation occurrence and time series using an improved rank score rs method the new observation network which had more than the number of national stations was applied for evaluating spps to increase the reliability of results new hydrological insights for the region integrated multi satellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement imerg early and imerg late runs showed the best overall performance with an rs value of 0 91 the optimal spps varied according to the evaluation indices but mostly belonged to imerg early imerg late multi source

graphical abstract ga1 keywords comprehensive evaluation satellite precipitation data multiple indices rank score qiangtang plateau northern tibet data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate estimates of precipitation are important for hydrological modelling weather forecasting and water resource management golian et al 2015 terink et al 2018 wang et al 2018 gauge observations are the most intuitive method for measuring precipitation yu et al 2020 however relatively few precipitation gauge stations are located in the vast and sparsely populated areas of western china and areas such as the unpopulated areas in the inner tibetan plateau itp are not even monitored the sparse distribution of meteorological gauges and or discontinuities in recording sequences often results in inaccurate estimation of the spatiotemporal features of precipitation duan et al 2016 satellite measurements can be used to directly monitor areal precipitation on a global scale the latest satellite precipitation products spps are becoming more accurate and reliable than before owing to the combination of multi satellite data with gauge observations and progress in retrieval algorithms the increased availability consistency and spatiotemporal resolution of spps have facilitated their widespread applications since spps have inherent drawbacks due to indirect observations of precipitation and inadequate sampling it is necessary to evaluate the performance of these global products before their regional applications sun et al 2018 overall the performance evaluations of spps have shown that the final version of the product of the integrated multi satellite retrievals from global precipitation measurement imerg final outperforms other products on the global and regional scales chen et al 2020 including in australia islam et al 2020 bali island liu et al 2020 bangladesh montes et al 2021 central asia peng et al 2021 eastern himalaya kumar et al 2021 india saikrishna et al 2021 nigeria nwachukwu et al 2020 thailand gunathilake et al 2020 and vietnam le et al 2020 although these evaluations have indicated that imerg final is the best spp in china chen et al 2020 tang et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 2021 xu et al 2022 it performed poorly in western china particularly in mountainous e g the qinghai tibetan plateau and arid regions zhang et al 2020 tang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 the inner tibetan plateau itp also known as qiangtang plateau is the largest plateau in the world with an average elevation of more than 5000 m above sea level located in the heart of the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp it is also called the third pole only four national basic stations are in itp covering an area of 5 76 105 km2 zhan et al 2023 first evaluated the imerg and global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap products via new observations on the western qtp and found that gsmap outperformed imerg similar results were observed while evaluating spps in the qtp for example gao and liu 2013 evaluated four spps in the qtp and found that the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42 and the climate prediction centre morphing technique outperformed other products over itp li et al 2021 evaluated three spps over the qtp and found that gsmap outperformed tmpa 34b2 and imerg final products in itp the spps in the qp performed poorly compared with those in other regions of china zhang et al 2020 tang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 accurate measurement of precipitation in itp is challenging because of its insufficient gauge sites complex terrain and high spatial heterogeneity in precipitation ma et al 2018 wang et al 2020 only four national basic stations that cover an area of 5 76 105 km2 in itp were used in the previous studies the low density of the station coverage notably limits the evaluation of spps in itp based on the ground observation stations set by researchers the national tibetan plateau data centre ntpdc developed a new precipitation observation network for itp this provides a new and spatially extended network of ground based observations for evaluating spps in the data scarce itp currently the evaluations of spps based on the new itp observation networks remain qualitative or limited although multiple indices have been used in other words only a few comprehensive quantitative evaluations of spps have been conducted using multiple indices with a prime focus on itp the key objectives of this study were to 1 develop an improved rank score rs method for a comprehensive quantitative evaluation and 2 quantitatively and comprehensively evaluate the ability of 16 spps to detect precipitation occurrence and time series based on the new observation network over itp 2 materials and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 gauge observed precipitation data gauge observed precipitation data from 47 ground stations including the national basic stations

precipitation occurrence the joint distribution of the satellite and gauge measurements is used to evaluate the ability of spps to detect precipitation wilks 2019 the marginal distribution of the satellite and gauge measurements can be classified as true positive a observed precipitation correctly detected by the satellite false negative b precipitation detected by the satellite but not observed false positive c observed precipitation not detected by the satellite and true negative d no precipitation observed or detected by the satellite various performance statistics can be calculated using the confusion matrix the most common parameters used to evaluate satellite measurements include the probability of detection pod also called the true positive rate or hit rate false positive rate fpr also called the false alarm rate false alarm ratio far critical success index csi also called the threat score and accuracy acc which were used in this study as follows fawcett 2006 ebert et al 2007 wilks 2019 1 pod a a c 2 fpr b b d 3 far b a b 4 csi a a b c 5 acc a d a b c d where pod far and csi are the fractions of precipitation occurrences that were correctly detected precipitation detections that were false alarm and observed and detected precipitation that was correctly detected respectively in particular these measures were useful when a precipitation event occurred substantially less frequently than the non occurrence of precipitation wilks 2019 which was consistent with the actual precipitation occurrence over itp according to the observation of the minimum unit precipitation a precipitation event was defined as daily precipitation when 0 1 mm 2 2 2 evaluation criteria for simulating precipitation time series the criteria used to evaluate the performance of the simulated monthly time series included relative error re pearson s correlation coefficient cc index of agreement ioa kling gupta efficiency kge and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse willmott et al 2012 gupta et al 2009 nash and sutcliffe 1970 the re value represented the deviation of bias from the observed values the kge value which integrates cc re and standard deviation was used instead of a single standard deviation the ioa and nse values indicated the goodness of fit of the simulated and observed time series data the best fit value was 1 0 whereas the goodness of fit value deteriorated with the increase in deviation from 1 0 the evaluation criteria were estimated as follows 6 re 1 n i 1 n x mi x oi x oi 7 cc i 1 n x oi x o x mi x m i 1 n x oi x o 2 i 1 n x mi x m 2 8 ioa 1 i 1 n x mi x oi 2 i 1 n x mi x o x oi x o 2 9 kge 1 1 cc 2 re 2 1 sd m sd o 2 10 sd 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 11 nse 1 i 1 n x mi x oi 2 i 1 n x oi x o 2 where x mi and x oi were the i th values of the satellite and observed precipitation time series respectively n was the time series length x m and x o were the means of the satellite and observed values respectively and sd m and sd o were the standard deviations of the satellite and observed precipitation respectively 2 2 3 comprehensive evaluation based on an improved rank score method the rs based evaluation uses multiple indices to comprehensively evaluate the performance of a model fu et al 2013 this method is similar to the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method li et al 2019 and subjectively merges rs values into integers ranging from 0 to 9 in this study an improved rs method was developed which objectively evaluated the comprehensive performance of a model using the degree of deviation between each index value and the optimal value of all the models the improved rs method was implemented as follows 12 rs i x i x min x max x min positive indexes 1 x i x min x max x min negative indexes where x i was the index value of the satellite product and x min and x max were the minimum and maximum index values for all the spps respectively the positive indices were pod csi acc cc ioa kge and nse while the negative indices included far fpr and the absolute value of re the rs metric was first calculated from the mean value of each index for each spp the total rs value for each spp was obtained by averaging the rs value for each index the performance of the spps in detecting precipitation occurrence and measuring precipitation time series was evaluated using the occurrence pod far fpr csi and acc and time series re cc ioa kge and nse indices respectively the measurements via the spps were comprehensively evaluated using the rs values of all 10 indices the 16 spps were evaluated using the gauge observed precipitation data from itp and the raw spatial resolution of each spp was used for the evaluation the pixels closest to each ground station were selected for each spp the evaluation was based on a daily time series and evaluation period was the time of intersection of each ground station and spp 3 results 3 1 ability of spps to detect precipitation occurrence the performance of the 16 spps for detecting precipitation at the 47 stations is shown in fig 2 in general satellite products were used to detect the probability of precipitation the mean pod value of all the spps across all the stations was 0 72 the mswep product showed the best performance with the pod value of all the stations exceeding 0 90 which was notably greater than the corresponding values of the other spps the mean pod value of mswep across all the stations was 0 98 this result was mainly due to higher precipitation frequency in mswep than in the other products a higher precipitation frequency also resulted in a higher far value in addition persiann cdr and imerg showed enhanced ability with the pod value being above 0 80 at more than 80 of the stations the mean and median pod values of the four products were approximately 0 90 the gsmap nrt products performed poorly with a mean pod value of 0 40 although the spps captured the probability of precipitation many false alarms were recorded for precipitation events the mean fpr and far values for all the products across all the stations were 0 38 and 0 39 respectively the evaluation results of fpr and far were opposite to those of pod the gsmap nrt product showed the best performance in terms of fpr and far with the mean fpr and far values of all the stations being 0 15 and 0 34 respectively the fpr value was 0 20 at 75 35 47 of the stations the mswep product showed the highest far value with the mean fpr and far values of 0 68 and 0 46 respectively the mean csi value of all the products across all the stations was 0 48 the performance of each spp varied substantially with the median csi value of all the stations ranging from 0 3 to 0 60 in each product the imerg product performed the best with a mean csi value of approximately 0 60 the csi value was 0 50 at 87 41 47 of the stations the gsmap mvk product performed poorly with a csi value of 0 30 at 55 26 47 of the stations the mean acc value for all the products across all the stations was 0 68 compared with the other four occurrence indices the acc performance varied relatively slightly among the spps the imerg early and imerg late products outperformed the other spps with a mean and median acc value of 0 74 the cmorph crt and cmorph cdr products exhibited the weakest performances with a mean and median acc value of 0 62 the performance of the spps for detecting precipitation occurrence at different levels of precipitation is shown in fig 3 overall the performance of the spps showed a positive correlation with the precipitation levels when fpr and acc were evaluated a higher precipitation amount enhanced the performance of the spps with the increased precipitation amount the performance of the spps first increased and then fell under the pod far and csi indices the spps exhibited the highest ability to capture precipitation in the range of 10 25 mm in terms of csi the spps efficiently detected precipitation in the range of 5 25 mm than at the other levels however all the products failed to capture 0 1 2 mm precipitation and rainstorms daily precipitation 50 mm with the mean csi value of all the stations being lower than 0 30 for each product the performances of the spps significantly varied from one another at each level the mswep product showed the best performance for precipitation 50 mm particularly in the range of 2 50 mm with the mean csi value of all the stations being 0 60 the evaluation results of pod and far were consistent with those of csi the acc based evaluation showed no notable difference in the performance of spps at each level of precipitation the standard deviation derived from the mean acc value of all the stations among the spps was within 0 05 for precipitation levels 2 mm the spps exhibited the weakest performance in capturing 0 1 2 mm precipitation occurrence with the mean acc value of all the products being 0 67 all the spps exhibited improvement in their ability to record precipitation over 5 mm particularly for heavy rain and rainstorms the evaluation results of fpr were consistent with those of acc 3 2 spatiotemporal performance of spps in detecting precipitation occurrence the spatial distribution performance of the spps in detecting precipitation is shown in fig 4 although it varied significantly among the indices the ability of the spps to capture precipitation varied minimally among the stations concerning the average performance of all the products the spps correctly evaluated the probability of precipitation in itp pod 0 60 except for three stations located at the margins of the northern and southern regions however the ability of the spps varied substantially with the standard deviation of pod among the spps varying between 0 11 and 0 29 in each station the variation was relatively greater in the central and northern itp regions than in the other regions with a standard deviation of pod 0 25 at most stations in terms of csi the spps showed strong capture ability csi 0 50 at only 36 of the stations mainly located in the eastern itp overall the ability of the spps varied slightly with a standard deviation of csi 0 16 at most stations 44 47 the variation was lowest in the western itp with a standard deviation of csi 0 08 at most stations the evaluation of acc showed that spps effectively captured the precipitation occurrence in itp overall this ability varied minimally between the stations and spps the acc value was 0 60 at most stations 45 47 and 0 65 at 77 of the stations 36 47 the standard deviation of acc was concentrated in the range of 0 06 0 08 and lower than 0 08 at 77 of the stations stations with a standard deviation of acc 0 16 were mainly located in the central and southern itp the overall performance of the spps in terms of fpr was better in the western itp than in the eastern itp the overall fpr value was 0 30 in the eastern itp for a few stations it was 0 50 but was 0 30 in the western regions similar to the spatial distribution of fpr the variation among the spps was greater in the eastern itp than in the western itp overall the standard deviation of fpr was 0 30 and 0 30 in the eastern and western itp respectively contrary to fpr far was 0 30 in the entire itp the far values of the spps were consistent with each other with a standard deviation of far 0 16 at almost all the stations 46 47 the spatial distribution of imerg early was consistent with the average performance of all the products while evaluating acc csi fpr and far overall imerg early displayed an above average performance across all the products with pod 0 80 at 83 39 47 of the stations the ability of imerg early to detect far was lower than the average performance of all the products with far 0 50 at most stations mainly located in the western and northern itp overall imerg early was capable of detecting precipitation occurrence in itp with pod 0 80 and csi 0 60 at most stations the performance of imerg early evaluated using acc and fpr was better in the western itp than in the eastern itp which was similar to the average performance of all the products however the far evaluation showed a different spatial distribution the ability of the spps to capture precipitation occurrence was also analysed for different months the cold december march and warm june september seasons and annually firstly the mean value of the evaluation indices of all the stations was calculated for each spp then the minimum maximum and median indices of the 16 spps were statically calculated the performances of the spps in the different periods are shown in fig 5 the performance of the spps in capturing the probability of precipitation varied substantially between the products and periods fig 5a with the median pod value of all the products varying between 0 20 and 0 80 overall the ability of the spps to capture was notably higher during the warm season than during the cold season the mean pod value of all the stations in each product was mainly concentrated in the range of 0 64 0 91 25 75 frequency range the same as below in the warm season except for gsmap nrt gsmap mvk and chirps the other spps showed a strong capturing ability with a mean pod value of all the stations being 0 60 the mean pod value was concentrated in the range of 0 10 0 52 in the cold season most spps 12 16 showed weak capturing ability during the cold season with a mean pod value of 0 50 except for mswep persiann persiann ccs and persiann cdr the overall performance of the spps showed a unimodal distribution throughout the year with their capture ability being strongest in july and weakest in december most spps lost their ability to capture the precipitation occurrence in december mean pod 0 50 except for mswep and persiann ccs mean pod 0 60 the performance of the spps evaluated using fpr also varied notably in different products and periods fig 5c with the median pod value of all the products varying between 0 11 and 0 53 the frp value was higher during the warm season than during the cold season the mean fpr value of each spp was mainly concentrated in the range of 0 29 0 48 in the warm season during the cold season fpr was predominantly in the range of 0 04 0 24 overall the monthly fpr value showed an annual unimodal distribution the fpr value was the highest in december with the mean fpr value of the spps concentrated in the range of 0 38 0 68 the gsmap nrt exhibited the best performance with a mean fpr value of 0 28 the fpr value was the lowest in january and december with the fpr value of the spps predominantly being in the range of 0 04 0 20 the performance of the spps evaluated using far also varied notably for different periods fig 5b however the variation of different products evaluated using far was lower than those evaluated using the other indices with the standard deviation of the mean far value of each spp being lower than 0 10 in most periods this indicated that the ability of the spps to detect far remained relatively consistent among the spps this result differed from those obtained using pod and far overall far was notably higher during the warm season than during the cold season the mean far value of each spp during the warm season was between 0 22 and 0 43 the imerg final product exhibited the best performance with the lowest far all the spps showed weak capturing ability in terms of far with the mean far value of each spp ranging from 0 63 to 0 91 in the cold season overall the monthly far value showed an annual single valley distribution the far value showed the best performance in july with a mean far value of the spps being between 0 18 and 0 30 the imerg product exhibited the best performance the chirps tmpa 3b42 and tmpa 3b42rt products also outperformed mean far 0 19 the other spps the far value peaked in december with the mean far value of most spps being above 0 90 the performance of the spps evaluated by the csi also showed a minimal difference in spps with a standard deviation being lower than 0 10 in most periods except for july the performance was notably better during the warm season than during the cold season the mean csi value of all the stations was larger than 0 50 for most spps 11 16 all the spps performed inefficiently during the cold season the mswep has the best performance with a mean csi value of 0 34 the csi value showed a regular annual unimodal distribution the spps showed the best performance in july with the mean csi value being concentrated in the range of 0 61 0 70 the performance of the spps evaluated using acc showed a minimal difference in the warm season with a standard deviation of approximately 0 06 the performance in terms of the first four indices showed a notable annual seasonal pattern however the performance in terms of acc did not show a seasonal variation the difference in the performance between the warm and cold seasons was not significant with the median acc values of each product recorded at 0 68 and 0 72 respectively 3 3 ability of spps in measuring precipitation time series the performance of the spps in measuring monthly precipitation at the observation stations is shown in fig 6 the bias varied notably for both the products and stations overall the re value varied between 80 and 80 at all the stations the mean re value of all the stations ranged from 55 98 in the spps most spps 9 16 overestimated precipitation in itp the mean overestimation of each spp at all the stations ranged from 8 to 98 with a mean value of 43 the mswep product which showed the best performance in terms of re underestimated the itp precipitation by 1 but substantially varied among the stations with only 23 of the stations 11 47 having an re value within 10 the imerg and tmpa 3b42 products also showed a better performance than the other products with a mean re value of 15 the re value of tmpa 3b42 was within 20 at 43 of the stations 20 47 the persiann ccs product was least accurate at estimating the amount of precipitation and overestimated by approximately 98 overall the measurements via the spps showed a strong positive correlation with the observed monthly precipitation in itp except for persiann the imerg product showed the strongest correlation and the mean cc value of all the stations was 0 84 the cc value of imerg final was greater than 0 70 at 94 44 47 of the stations the chirps and persiann cdr products also showed a strong correlation with a mean cc value of 0 83 the cc values of the two products were larger than 0 70 at 86 37 47 and 91 39 47 of the stations respectively the imerg early measurements strongly complied with the monthly observed precipitation in itp with a mean nse value of all the stations being 0 60 the nse value was 0 60 at 81 of the stations the measurements of pdir now and imerg late also conformed with the monthly observed time series with nse 0 60 at approximately 74 of the stations the mean nse values of the two products were 0 57 and 0 56 respectively however the other spps inefficiently complied with the monthly precipitation with a mean nse value of 0 40 for each spp the results of kge were consistent with those of nse in terms of kge the spps performed inefficiently with the mean kge value of all the spps being 0 07 the persiann cdr and imerg early products showed the best performance with kge 0 50 at approximately 74 and 67 of all the stations respectively however the mean kge value of all the stations was approximately 0 46 in the two products the variation of the spps among the stations was substantially smaller in terms of ioa than in terms of the other four indices the imerg early and imerg late products exhibited the best performance with the mean ioa value of all the stations reaching 0 90 overall the evaluation results of all the series indices showed that imerg early imerg late and pdir now outperformed the other products for measuring monthly precipitation time series in itp fig 7 showed the spatial distribution performance of the spps for measuring monthly precipitation in itp the imerg early underestimated precipitation at most stations 32 47 and greatly underestimated re 25 at 25 stations mainly located in the western and northern regions given the average performance of the 16 spps re was within 25 at most stations 35 47 the highest overestimation re 25 was at 11 stations chiefly located in the southeast regions including the lakes of selin co nam co and geren co overall the average performance of all the spps was better than most single products for measuring mean values due to the complementarity between the products the spp measurements were close to the observed values at the eastern stations with re being within 20 the spps substantially overestimated precipitation at the western and northern stations re 40 the satellite measurements varied substantially among the spps with the standard deviation of re among the spps 50 at 38 stations the other four indices showed that the average performance of all the spps was notably lower than that of imerg early given the average performance of all the spps only a few stations showed cc 0 80 the imerg early dataset included 36 stations with cc 0 80 the correlation between the measurements via the spps and observational values was substantially lower at the central and northern stations than at the other stations the ioa results were similar to those of cc the average performance of all the spps was inadequate when evaluated by nse and kge whose values were 0 50 at the 91 and 100 stations respectively the nse evaluation showed that imerg early performed well at most stations with nse 0 70 at 64 of the stations these stations were mainly located in the western south eastern and northern regions several stations mainly those located east of the selin co lake performed weakly 3 4 comprehensive evaluation of spps the overall performance of the spps was quantitatively evaluated using the improved rs method based on the 10 indices of precipitation occurrence and time series table 2 the evaluation of the five indices based on precipitation occurrence showed that the strongest spps were concentrated in imerg early imerg late gsmap nrt and mswep the mswep product showed the strongest performance in terms of pod with the strongest ability to capture precipitation in itp but had the weakest performance in terms of far and fpr the gsmap nrt product exhibited the strongest performance in terms of far and fpr with the lowest far value however it was the least accurate for capturing the precipitation occurrence with the lowest pod and csi values the imerg late and imerg early products showed the strongest performance in terms of csi and acc with the strongest overall capture capability these findings were confirmed through a comprehensive assessment of the five indices of precipitation occurrence using the improved rs method the imerg late and imerg early products showed the highest rs values of 0 86 and 0 85 respectively whereas cmorph cdr had the lowest rs value of 0 34 based on the precipitation time series the evaluation of the five indices showed that the spps with the strongest performance were imerg mswep and pdir now the imerg early product performed well in terms of cc nse and ioa indicating that the imerg early measurements were highly correlated and complied with the observed precipitation time series in terms of kge pdir now showed the strongest performance indicating that the mswep measurements exhibited the highest combined performance of the mean standard deviation and correlation values the mswep measurements were closest to the mean itp precipitation based on the precipitation time series the comprehensive evaluation of the five indices showed that imerg early had the strongest performance in measuring the observed time series with an rs value of 0 98 in addition imerg late outperformed the other spps with a rs value of 0 97 whereas persiann ccs exhibited the weakest comprehensive performance with a rs value of 0 16 and in terms of the re nse kge and ioa indices based on the precipitation occurrence and time series the comprehensive evaluation of all the 10 indices showed that imerg early and imerg late outperformed the other spps with a rs value of 0 91 overall imerg final pdir now and chirps outperformed the other spps with a rs value 0 75 the persiann ccs and cmorph cdr products exhibited the weakest comprehensive performances with the rs values of 0 36 and 0 40 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 improvements limitations and uncertainties the novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive quantitative evaluation of spps using multiple indices previous comprehensive evaluation results for spps were obtained from qualitative analyses of multiple indices which were subjectively determined and thus different comprehensive evaluation results may have been obtained this study comprehensively and quantitatively evaluated 16 spps using multiple indices based on the improved rs method the improved rs method provides the objective and comprehensive evaluation results and facilitates comprehensive evaluation of other products and models in addition this study included the new ground observation network set up by researchers to increase the reliability of the evaluation results for itp this study evaluated more spps and found that several new spps outperformed satellite products evaluated previously for example mswep and persiann cdr not included in previous evaluation reports for itp showed the best performance in terms of pod the mean pod value of mswep calculated for all the stations was 0 98 which was significantly higher than those of the other spps the mean pod value of persiann cdr was 0 90 which was also higher than the previously evaluated optimal spps 0 75 gao and liu 2013 ma et al 2018 li et al 2021 the satellite based measurements observed areal precipitation whereas ground station based observations were limited to the site scale although the station observations are often used as a reference to evaluate spps on a regional scale spatial scale differences inevitably occur during the evaluation therefore the evaluation results of the spps based on the station observations were considered as a reference value for comparative studies of the spps but not the absolute results of the evaluation further studies on spatial scale which were beyond the scope of this study must be conducted the utc of the spps was inconsistent with the beijing ground based observation time the hourly observed precipitation at the cma and ntpdc stations was converted to utc to make them consistent with the spp as described in section 2 1 1 based on the cma and ntpdc stations the spps were evaluated with ground observation in beijing in addition to the evaluation of the consistent time series between the spps and station observations a comparison of these two evaluation results showed that time inconsistency slightly affected each index value when the precipitation occurrence indices were used however this did not change the comparative evaluation results of the different spps thus time inconsistency resulted in a minimal effect on the results of the five indices of the time series 4 2 performance of spps in terms of indices precipitation levels and temporal periods the performance of the spps varied substantially for the different evaluation indexes and these indices yielded completely opposite evaluation results for example the performance of the spps in terms of the occurrence indices of pod csi and far was better in the warm season than in the cold season however the results of the occurrence of same type of indices of the fpr and acc were opposite fig 5 the gsmap nrt product exhibited the weakest performance in terms of pod and csi but was the strongest one in terms of far and fpr the mswep product exhibited the strongest performance in terms of pod but the weakest one in terms of far and fpr therefore multiple indices representing different characteristics are recommended to comprehensively evaluate spps this approach can be used for evaluating other products or models the spps evaluated using pod csi and far showed the strongest ability to detect precipitation in the range of 10 25 mm however rainstorms in itp were captured with reduced accuracy this result was consistent with the results of lei et al 2021 for the eastern qtp however in the evaluation using the fpr and acc the overall performance of the spps positively correlated with the precipitation levels a comparison with previous evaluations of spps in itp revealed similar results and also indicated a few inconsistent conclusions gao and liu 2013 found that tmpa 34b2 and cmorph outperformed tmpa 3b42rt and persian in itp the pod value was even lower than the far at itp cma stations in this study similar results were observed at all the stations li et al 2021 found that gsmap mvk outperformed tmpa 34b2 and imerg final at itp cma stations however this study found that the imerg measurements showed the strongest performance as evaluated at both the cma and ntpdc stations this might be due to the combination of all satellite microwave precipitation estimates with microwave calibrated infrared satellite estimates and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine spatiotemporal resolutions for the trmm and gpm eras improvements in the calibration of the imerg products might be expected to increase accuracy of precipitation estimates at the regional scale sui et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 xu et al 2022 in addition imerg early and imerg late showed stronger performance than imerg final indicating that the data processing in the final version limited the improvement in the product accuracy over the data scarce itp this study focused on the comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the 16 spps in itp several studies have recently published satellite model based and reanalysis precipitation products calibrated by gauge analysis for example the asian precipitation dataset improved using the fifth generation atmospheric reanalysis product of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era5 land aera5 asia and imerg aimerg might also be valuable for applications in itp ma et al 2020 2022 xu et al 2022 in addition more studies must be conducted on the fusion of multi source spps by considering precipitation events such as the morphology based adaptive algorithm of spatiotemporal merging zhu et al 2022 to further improve the accuracy of the satellite based measurements at the regional scale although spps could detect precipitation occurrences and time series in itp their performance in itp was relatively weak compared with that recorded in other areas in china for example tang et al 2020 found that the mean csi value of optimal spps in china is close to 0 70 however this study estimated the mean csi value of the optimal spps in itp at only 0 48 wei et al 2021 reported that the mean kge value of optimal spps in eastern china was 0 90 with a value 0 70 for most spps in this study the evaluation of both the ntpdc and cma stations showed that the mean kge value was 0 50 in each spp overall the accuracy of the measurements via the spps in itp requires further improvement nevertheless the results of this study can assist in improving spps for itp 5 conclusions based on the new observation network and national basic stations the improved rs method was used to quantitatively and comprehensively evaluate 6 spps in itp via the 10 indices of the precipitation occurrence and time series overall imerg early and imerg late showed the strongest performance when evaluated using precipitation occurrence and series indexes with an rs value of 0 91 the imerg late and imerg early products outperformed the others in measuring the precipitation occurrence rs 0 86 and time series rs 0 98 respectively although the optimal spps varied according to the evaluation indices they were concentrated among imerg early imerg late mswep gsmap nrt and pdir now the spps showed the highest ability to capture the precipitation occurrence in the range of 10 25 mm when evaluated using the pod far and csi indices moreover the spps performed better in the western and northern itp regions than in the other regions the performance was relatively weak in the middle east of itp mainly in the selin co lake basin overall most spps detected precipitation the mean pod csi acc far and fpr values for all the spps across all the stations were 0 72 0 48 0 68 0 39 and 0 38 respectively however the spps showed a relatively weak performance in measuring the precipitation time series the mean kge value for each spps was 0 50 only a few spps captured the precipitation time series with the mean nse value of all the stations exceeding 0 55 therefore the measurements via the spps over itp must be further improved particularly when precipitation time series are measured the evaluation of the spps in itp is useful for the estimation of precipitation in other data scarce regions and improving the accuracy of spps at regional scale additionally multiple indices representing different characteristics are recommended to evaluate spps to obtain comprehensive evaluation results the proposed improved rs method can

7668,study region southeast australia study focus regional flood frequency analysis rffa is a widely adopted statistical method to estimate design floods in ungauged catchments annual maximum flood amf model is the most popular method in developing rffa techniques however the amf based approaches are criticised for its limitations in the range of very frequent to frequent flood estimation as an alternative the peaks over threshold pot based approach has shown theoretical advantages in this flood range pot based rffa is currently underemployed internationally due to its complexity in modelling this study develops pot based rffa techniques for south eastern australia using data from 151 catchments a comparison is made between ordinary least squares ols and weighted least squares

have permission to share data 1 introduction flooding is one of the worst natural disasters across the globe it leads to economic burdens due to direct and indirect consequences of flooding acosta et al 2016 accurate flood risk assessment is needed to reduce flood damage flood frequency analysis ffa is one of the most preferred methods for design flood estimation extreme value distributions are widely used in flood and rainfall frequency analyses e g yilmaz et al 2017 hossain et al 2021 traditionally ffa adopts annual maximum flood amf model which extracts the single highest flow value per year from the streamflow record to construct the amf series adopting amf model in ffa is straightforward and this is the most commonly applied practice in australia and internationally however it has been criticised for its inaccurate and biased estimates in very frequent to frequent flood ranges metzger et al 2020 zaman et al 2012 a common practice of applying amf involves censoring of the potential low flow values to achieve better fitting in the higher flood ranges ball et al 2016 peaks over threshold pot approach is an alternative to amf and has been widely employed in environmental modelling bernardara et al 2011 liang et al 2019 northrop and jonathan 2011 thompson et al 2009 it is flexible in the data extraction process and theoretically advantageous in estimating very frequent to frequent floods karim et al 2017 moreover the additional flood information through retaining values above a selected threshold could be a particular interest to hydrologists kumar et al 2020 madsen et al 1997a one can adjust the threshold by altering average events per year using the pot modelling approach cunnane 1973 recommended pot1 63 average 1 63 events over the threshold per year to reduce sample variance compared with the amf approach later a practical guideline was proposed by lang et al 1999 which recommended an average of one to three events above the threshold per year for the pot modelling i e between pot1 and pot3 durocher et al 2018 further investigated and proposed a hybrid method which suggested a lower boundary of pot1 and a higher boundary of pot5 regional flood frequency analysis rffa is the commonly adopted technique to estimate flood quantiles in ungauged catchments the rationale of rffa is to transfer flood characteristics from gauged to ungauged sites based on hydrological similarity haddad and rahman 2012 haddad et al 2012 generally the rffa involves two steps first forming regions and then applying a parametric distribution or index flood or quantile regression technique qrt rahman 2005 for design flood estimation index flood approach is a popular rffa technique which depends on the assumption of homogeneity hosking and wallis 1993 in contrast the qrt relaxes the homogeneity assumption in qrt a multiple linear regression mlr technique is applied to develop a relationship between a flood quantile dependent variable and selected catchment characteristics independent variables in mlr ordinary least square ols and weighted least square wls approaches are generally used to estimate the coefficients of the regression equations stedinger and tasker 1985 compared the performance of ols and wls in rffa and concluded that improvement in using wls can be significant over the ols many studies in australia and internationally focused on flood frequency analysis for both at site and regional cases and the majority of the studies were based on the amf modelling approach ahammed et al 2014 burn et al 2007 haddad and rahman 2011 2012 haddad et al 2011 ishak and rahman 2015 ishak et al 2013 masan and hewa 2020 rahman et al 2018 shu and ouarda 2007 walpita gamage et al 2020 rahman et al 2020 however there is a rising interest in using the pot modelling approach due to its suitability for ecological and environmental studies as they need frequent flow estimation ammar et al 2020 jarajapu et al 2022 kiran and srinivas 2021a langousis et al 2016 pan and rahman 2022 pan et al 2022 sccarrott and macdonald 2012 madsen and rosbjerg 1997 proposed an index flood method with a bayesian approach based on generalised pareto gpa distribution using pot flood data from 48 new zealand catchments a simple linear estimator was found to be adequate in the adopted generalized least squares regression framework durocher et al 2019 applied a nonstationary index flood model for pot data from 425 catchments in canada which enabled extending stationary method to both at site and regional cases they compared four different estimators two were based on regression and l moments and two others applied likelihood based techniques the independent likelihood method was found to provide most accurate estimates of regional floods for 10 and 100 years return periods mostofi zadeh et al 2019 proposed a general framework to undertake rffa for both the annual maximum and pot data series using data from 684 canadian stations the pot based rffa technique is underutilised in australia rahman et al 2019 this study aims to fill this knowledge gap by developing a pot based rffa technique focusing on very frequent to frequent flood ranges using data from south eastern australia in this context the main purposes of this study are i development of prediction equations for selected return periods very frequent to frequent flood ranges based on pot modelling approach ii assessment of the performance of the developed prediction equations based on different regions in the study area and iii recommendation of the best performing prediction equations for the selected return periods it is expected that the outcome of this study will promote the wider application of the pot based modelling approach in flood frequency analysis 2 methods 2 1 selection of events in selecting the pot series at a given gauging station the threshold value is selected based on an automated method adopting pearson normality test as described in pan et al 2021 the average events per year k 1 2 3 k is selected to determine the size of the potk series based on series iterative processes the threshold is determined once the critical p value is met 2 2 multiple linear regression the multiple linear regression mlr technique develops a relationship between the dependent variable q and u independent variables x 1 x 2 x u eq 1 below is constructed for expressing the i th observation i 1 2 3 n where b 0 and b j j 1 2 3 u are unknown parameters associated with the error term e i based on n observations it is assumed that the term e i is normally distributed based on a mean equal to zero the model parameters b0 b1 bj are generally estimated using an ordinary least square ols approach it is a common practice that the regional regression model is constructed based on log transformed dependent and independent variables durocher et al 2016 1 q i b 0 b 1 x i 1 b 2 x i 2 b j x ij b u x iu e i ols is the most popular method to estimate parameters of eq 1 based on minimising the residual sum of squares ols is based on the assumption of homoscedasticity which is not generally satisfied with hydrological data in other words the standard deviation of error terms is not constant across all values of the independent variables to overcome this problem weighted least square wls is adopted which treats parameters differently by assigning a weight in the parameter estimation process based on traditional wls the weights should ideally be equal to the reciprocal of the variance of the observations hydrologists also apply sampling error eq 2 as weights in the wls approach this study uses statistical weight reciprocal of variance ws and hydrological weight sampling error wh for comparison 2 sampling error variance of pot flood series size of pot flood series 2 3 model construction a total of 1512 pot based regression models are constructed and evaluated in this study for nine return periods between very frequent and frequent range of flows which vary from 12 events per year ey to 10 average recurrence interval ari or 10 annual exceedance probability aep 12ey 6ey 4ey 3ey 2ey 1ey 0 5ey 0 2ey and 10ari to specify probability of very frequent to frequent flows ey is used following australian rainfall and runoff book 2 chapter 3 ball et al 2019 fig 1 illustrates the adopted procedures for constructing models in this study the model construction starts with selecting potk flood series for each of the selected stations based on k average events per year k 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 4 5 flood quantiles are estimated for the selected nine return periods for each potk series assuming a generalised pareto distribution the next step is forming a group region from the selected catchments for developing the prediction equations a total of three regions are formed based on the geographical factors of the selected catchments region 1 includes all the selected 151 catchments in the study area south eastern australia while regions 2 and 3 are formed based on drainage division 2 and drainage division 4 in australia details of these regions are discussed in later sections once regions are formed two regression techniques are applied for each potk flood series ols and wls in the regression flood quantiles are dependent variables and climatic and catchment characteristics as shown in table 1 are independent variables ols technique adopts stepwise elimination based on p value 5 significance level op and aic value oa while wls adopts statistical ws and hydrological wh weights baseflow factors volume factor vf and peak factor pf are additional independent variables when constructing models m1 includes vf and pf m2 excludes vf and pf finally each model is evaluated based on eq 3 to eq 7 using both split sample ss and leave one out loo validation techniques a typical model 12ey pot3 r1 op m1 is constructed based on 12 event per year ey frequency pot3 model data from region 1 baseflow factors as independent variables and regressed using ols stepwise elimination based on p value 5 significance level this study first selects the best performing potk flood series based on various statistical measures then the selected potk flood series is adopted for further modelling and analysis finally the performance of each region is compared and discussed 2 4 model evaluation a range of statistical measures are applied to evaluate the performance of potk rffa models median relative error rem eq 3 relative error rer eq 4 root mean square error rmser eq 5 the coefficient of determination r2 eq 6 and the ratio between predicted and observed flow quantiles ratior eq 7 qobs is the at site flood quantiles estimated using generalised pareto distribution pan and rahman 2022 based on potk flood series qpred is the estimated flood quantile based on various pot based rffe models here a smaller rem value is desirable for the selected potk rffe model and ratior closer to 1 indicates a better fit between the predicted and observed flood quantiles r2 is also applied for each constructed model and its values range from 0 to 1 a value closer to 1 is preferable each developed potk rffa model is evaluated based on split sample ss with 80 20 split and leave one out loo validation techniques the ss validation is repeated 100 times randomly for each of the developed models and is evaluated using eq 4 3 re m median q pred q obs q obs 100 4 re r q pred q obs q obs 100 5 rmse r 1 n i 1 n q obs q pred q obs 2 100 6 r 2 1 sum of squares of residuals total sum of squares 7 ratio r q pred q obs 100 3 study area and data this study focuses on the coastal region of south eastern australia as shown in fig 2 since this part of australia has high quality streamflow data a total of 151 gauged catchments are selected the area of selected catchments ranges from 11 km2 to 1010 km2 with an average of 357 km2 and a median of 309 km2 records of streamflow data range from 27 to 82 years with an average of 42 years and a median of 39 years it should be noted here that the smaller the record length the higher the sampling variability in estimated quantiles the adopted wls method considers the impacts of record length in modelling the selected catchments have no major change in land use and are unregulated among the selected 151 catchments 57 are from new south wales nsw and 94 are from victoria vic states of australia this study considers three different regions region 1 consists of all the selected 151 catchments region 2 and region 3 are formed based on drainage division 2 coastal 89 catchments and drainage division 4 inland 62 catchments respectively drainage division 4 contains longer rivers than drainage division 2 which flow into the murray darling river system the rationale behind forming three regions is to improve the accuracy of the developed prediction equations application of hosking and wallis 1993 test to these regions did not deliver any homogeneous regions since heterogeneity statistics h were much higher than threshold value of one h1 11 this finding is similar to previous australian studies where homogeneous regions could not be identified e g bates et al 1998 rahman and rahman 2020 a total of eighteen hydrological and physio meteorological variables are adopted in this study as independent variables to develop the prediction equations based on the pot based modelling approach these variables are catchment areas a mean annual rainfall mar shape factor sf mean annual evapotranspiration mae stream density sden mainstream slope s1085 fraction forest fst design rainfall intensity of 6 hr duration based on varied return period ii e g i12 design rainfall intensity of 12ey baseflow volume factor vf and baseflow peak factor pf the shape factor sf is defined as the shortest distance between a catchment s centroid and outlet divided by the square root of catchment area a baseflow volume factor vf is defined as the ratio of baseflow volume and streamflow volume baseflow peak factor pf is defined as the ratio of peak of baseflow and peak of streamflow hydrograph australian rainfall and runoff arr 2019 book 5 chapter 4 has developed regional method to estimate baseflow for ungauged catchments for any location in australia for catchment size of 7 7800 km2 ball et al 2019 table 1 summarises the adopted independent variables in this study the dependent variables in regression analysis are q t flood discharge for t year return period values which are estimated by fitting a generalised pareto gpa distribution to each of the selected potk series 4 results and discussion 4 1 selection of best performing potk flood series in this study the best performing potk flood series is firstly selected based on the adopted statistical measures using catchments from region 1 i e all of the selected 151 catchments based on ss validation 80 20 split three evaluation statistics rem rmser and r2 eq 3 5 and 6 are applied for each potk model op m1 op m2 oa m1 oa m2 ws m1 ws m2 wh m1 wh m2 the return period of 12ey smallest return period of very frequent flood and 0 5ey smallest return period of frequent flood are selected and assessed and it is expected that other selected return periods will provide similar results fig 3 plots the r2 values of very frequent 12ey and frequent 0 5ey potk models overall it is observed that the 0 5ey potk models have a higher r2 value 0 75 0 79 than the 12ey potk models 0 62 0 69 a similar r2 values of 0 68 for pot3 pot4 and pot5 models and a slightly smaller r2 value for other potk models where k is less than 3 are observed for a return period of 0 5ey pot2 and pot3 models provide the highest r2 value of 0 78 compared to all other potk models among all the selected potk rffa models pot3 provides the best performance in relation to r2 value considering both return periods of 12ey and 0 5ey it is worth noting that the addition of the baseflow factor m1 provides comparable results to models without considering the baseflow factor m2 rem fig 4 a b and rmser fig 4 c d are two other statistical measures applied in assessing the best performing potk model it is desirable for a model to have low rem and rmser values for the return period of 12ey pot4 and pot5 models provide the lowest rem and rmser 33 and 6 3 respectively in contrast pot1 5 and pot2 models provide the lowest rem and rmser 32 and 6 5 it is found that for very frequent floods the smaller k of the pot flood series provides a higher rem and rmsrr considering all the statistical measures applied the pot3 model best balances the very frequent and frequent flood categories and is selected for further analysis 4 2 region 1 4 2 1 very frequent flow 12ey the logarithm of predicted and observed flood quantiles adopting pot3 flood series based on eight approaches using catchments in region 1 are plotted in fig 5 it measures how well the very frequent flood can be estimated in ungauged catchments using mlr technique overall it is shown a good agreement between the observed and predicted flood quantiles most of the catchments in fig 5 are within the narrow range along the 45 degree reference line however a slightly higher scatter is located above the reference line indicating some over estimation fig 6 illustrates the standardised residual quantile quantile qq plot of very frequent 12ey for all pot3 models in region 1 these plots demonstrate a strong alignment to the normality assumption although a small light tailed behaviour is observed highlighting some overestimation ols based regression models have a slightly more over estimation than wls based models overall it is observed that more than 90 of the residuals fall within 2 normal scores which indicates that the residuals closely follow a normal distribution the relative error rer eq 4 measures the difference between the predicted and observed flood quantile and is plotted in fig 7 a very similar boxplot between m1 and m2 models is observed using various regression techniques i e op m1 and op m2 on the other hand a slight difference is observed between ols and wls techniques i e op m1 and ws m1 overall the mean of rer ranges between 30 and 40 this finding holds the preliminary finding discussed in the previous section in which the overall fitting shows a slight tendency of over estimation fig 7 also illustrates a slight difference in the inter quantile range iqr for different models ratior is another measure that indicates how well a predictive model performs to the observed data if the ratior is close to 100 it indicates a good agreement between estimated and observed flood quantiles fig 7 indicates a similar tendency of over estimation based on a mean of 120 135 with an average of 100 combining the findings from fig 7 left and right it is clear that the ols based regression technique provides more accurate quantile estimates than the wls for the return period of 12ey 4 2 2 frequent flow 0 5ey fig 8 a plots the logarithm of the observed and predicted flood quantile for the return period of 0 5ey it can be seen a narrower concentration along the 45 degree reference line indicating a closer fit compared to 12ey although the scatter is smaller for the return period of 0 5ey compared to 12ey the over estimation is still evident in the plot comparing various regression techniques the difference in scatter is minor compared to the return period of 12ey fig 8 b plots the qq plots for various regression models of 0 5ey return period a light tailed behaviour in the upper part is also observed in general it is reassuring that majority of the qq plots fall in the range of 2 fig 9 left plots the rer of selected models for the return period of 0 5ey the iqr is similar across all selected models with an average of 20 30 and a median just above 0 the wls based model with the addition of baseflow factors m1 presents a slightly better agreement smaller iqr among others fig 9 right plots the ratior with a mean of 120 130 and a median of 98 102 4 2 3 cross validation results split sampling with 100 repeats is firstly applied 80 training and 20 testing for each selected model fig 10 plots rem eq 3 for 12ey left and 0 5ey right for the return period of 12ey it can be seen that the median rem values are similar for the six selected approaches which range from 35 to 37 a similar result is also observed for 0 5ey among different regression techniques the boxplots of ols based techniques provide a smaller iqr for both the 12ey and 0 5 ey return periods comparing models m1 and m2 a small reduction in iqr is found for m2 table 2 tabulates the median of rem using the loo technique for all the selected return periods in this study it can be seen that the variation in median rem is minor among all the selected regression models overall the rem ranges from a minimum of 31 7 to a maximum of 38 table 3 presents the median of ratior it is observed that the ratior between various models is within the range of 4 with a minimum of 94 and a maximum of 102 considering the results and plots from various statistical indices ols based regression model based on p value of 0 1 and exclusion of baseflow factor op m2 is selected for construction of prediction equations table 4 presents prediction equations and associated coefficients for selected return periods the independent variable design rainfall intensity i shown in table 4 is corresponded to the associated return period and 6 h duration e g for 12ey i corresponds to 12ey return period and 6 h duration and for 6ey i corresponds to 6ey return period and 6 h duration for the very frequent floods a sden and i are found to be significant independent variables for frequent floods mean annual rainfall mar is added with a sden and i as significant independent variables fig 11 illustrate the spatial distribution of the absolute rer values of the individual catchments for return period of 12ey left and 0 5ey right a certain degree of spatial coherence can be seen in the lower region of the coastline of south eastern australia with the increased distance from the coastline the number of catchments showing larger absolute rer 50 increases overall a good predictive performance based on absolute rer is found for 12ey and 0 5ey models pot3 r1 op m2 it is found that 38 4 of catchments out of 151 in region 1 have absolute rer values less than 25 for the return period of 12ey this is 37 1 for the return period of 0 5ey table 5 provides the individual and cumulative percentages of catchments with a range of absolute rer values overall the selected model pot3 r1 op m2 provides a relatively accurate estimate for very frequent to frequent floods with over 70 9 and 72 8 of catchments for 12 ey and 0 5ey models respectively have absolute rer values less than or equal to 50 4 3 region 2 r2 values for region 2 are plotted in fig s1 supplementary section which illustrates similar values of r2 for return periods of 12ey and 0 5ey overall r2 0 7 0 8 values for region 2 are higher than for region 1 considering rem and rmser the pot3 model is the best performing pot time series based on balancing the score between very frequent 12ey and frequent 0 5ey return periods as can be seen in fig s2 considering the scatter plot between the logarithm of qobs and qpred pot3 models show a slightly larger range of variation along the 45 degree line in fig s3 left qq plot fig s3 right shows that more than 90 of the scatter falls between the range of 2 rer and ratior for the return period of 12ey are plotted in fig s4 left and s4 right respectively there is some notable overestimation in region 2 similar to region 1 it is also observed that the median of each box plot in fig s4 is close to 0 and 100 respectively which indicates an unbiased estimate based on the pot3 model similar results for frequent flood estimates are found based on fig s5 and fig s6 it is found that ols based models excluding the baseflow factor provide the smallest iqr and smallest mean for both rer and ratior the pot3 models are cross validated using split sample validation technique and the results are illustrated in fig 12 smallest iqr is observed for the ols based model op m2 for both return periods of 12ey and 0 5ey the median of rem is 45 for the return period of 12ey and 48 for 0 5ey overall ols based models outperform the wls based models which have a wider iqr and a higher median of rem loo is also conducted for region 2 and results are tabulated in table s1 median of rem and table s2 median of ratior the developed ols based pot3 r2 op m2 prediction equations for region 2 are provided in table 6 it is observed that the group of independent variables based on 5 significance level are similar to region 1 except that mar is not selected for region 2 the spatial distribution of the absolute rer values of the selected model pot3 r2 op m2 is shown in fig 13 left 12ey and fig 13 right 0 5ey it is noted that few catchments have larger absolute rer values 75 which are located along the upper part of the south eastern coastline for the return period of 12ey in contrast the total number of catchments having larger absolute rer values 75 is smaller for the return period of 0 5ey the distribution of absolute rer values in fig 13 for region 2 and in fig 11 region 1 shows a broad agreement 4 4 region 3 fig s7 plots r2 values of potk models for region 3 overall r2 values of very frequent flood 0 45 0 65 is significantly lower than frequent flood 0 6 0 68 among selected potk models selected potk models are also evaluated based on rem and rmser as illustrated in fig s8 left and right considering all the statistics from various potk models in region 3 the pot3 model performs the best while balancing the categories of the very frequent and frequent floods pot3 models for very frequent floods are further assessed through the scatter plot fig s9 left and the qq plot fig s9 right a narrower concentration along the reference line can be seen for oa m1 and oa m2 models as compared to op m1 and op m2 models statistics of rem and ratior are evaluated and plotted in fig s10 left and right respectively it is observed that the smallest iqr is found for oa m2 which is different to the findings of region 1 and region 2 similar approaches are applied to frequent floods 0 5ey as illustrated in fig s11 and fig s12 oa m2 are the second best performing models for the frequent flood considering both categories of very frequent and frequent floods oa based models are selected for further investigation while op models are disregarded the split sample validation method is applied for region 3 and results are presented in fig s12 it is observed that the oa m2 model provides the smallest iqr for both very frequent and frequent floods 22 35 and 28 38 respectively it is also observed that the median of rem based on oa m2 is the smallest among all the selected models for very frequent floods loo cross validation is also applied and the results are shown in table s3 and table s4 considering the evaluation statistics pot3 r3 oa m2 model performs the best table 7 presents the developed prediction equations fig 14 spatial distribution of the absolute rer values for pot3 r3 oa m2 model are plotted in fig 15 left 12ey and fig 15 right 0 5ey it can be seen that the majority of the catchments in the lower part of region 3 are performing quite well absolute rer 50 for 12ey and catchments showing significant variation absolute rer 75 are located far away from the coastline fig 15 right illustrates a similar result 4 5 comparison of three regional models region 1 region 2 and region 3 in this section a comparison is made to evaluate the performance of pot3 based rffa models across three regions the count of catchments falling in different ranges of absolute rer values are shown in table 8 it can be seen that region 3 performs the best having the highest percentage of catchments having a smaller absolute rer values followed by region 1 and region 2 region 3 has smaller degree of heterogeneity compared to region 1 and region 2 which could be the reason for smaller prediction error for region 3 further study is needed to understand the differences in the performances of the prediction models across the three regions table 9 shows the significant at 5 level independent variables for the rffa models for three different regions the variables a and sden are found to be significant for all the three regions for both very frequent and frequent floods it is found to be significant for region 1 and region 2 and for frequent floods in region 3 sf is significant for only region 3 mar is significant for region 1 for frequent floods and s1085 is significant for region 3 for very frequent floods 4 6 recommended regional prediction equations for application considering different regional models region 1 2 and 3 it is clear that region 2 model has the lowest prediction accuracy and hence these models are not recommended for practical application for simplicity region 1 models shown in table 4 should be applied to the whole study area since these provide quite accurate flood predictions with absolute median relative error rem in the range of 33 36 these results are comparable to ali and rahman 2022 who reported a rem value of 31 34 in south east australia for 2 and 5 years return periods based on kriging based rffa techniques using annual maximum flood model in another study for south east australia zalnezhad et al 2022 reported rem values of 42 and 33 for 2 and 5 years return periods respectively using artificial neural networks ann based rffa technique we developed prediction equations for 100 year ari for both the am and pot cases and we found that the pot based models provided more accurate results than am based models this indicates that in future pot data can be used to develop regional prediction equations for very frequent to 100 year ari ranges for australia 5 conclusion the method adopted and developed in this study focuses on the flood quantile estimation in ungauged catchments in south east australia in the range of very frequent to frequent floods 12 6 4 3 2 1 0 5 0 2ey and 10 year ari considering the advantages of pot based approach various potk at site estimates average events per year k 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 4 5 are modelled and evaluated based on 151 selected catchments from south east australia it has been found that pot3 based model provides the best performance while balancing the categories of very frequent to frequent floods this study also compares the performance of ols and wls based regression analyses it has been found that the ols based regression technique provides the least relative error than the wls method three different regions are considered in this study in this regard no significant improvement is found if the coastal region alone region 2 is considered however a considerable improvement in prediction performance is found by adopting the inland region alone region 3 for simplicity the prediction equations developed for the whole nsw region 1 are recommended for practical application these prediction equations require four predictor variables catchment area design rainfall intensity mean annual rainfall and stream density which are readily available based on independent testing these predictions show a median relative error values in the range of 32 36 which are smaller than australian rainfall and runoff recommended rffa models 49 59 rahman et al 2019 this study bridges the gap in the current edition of australian rainfall and runoff which does not have rffa method in the range of very frequent floods the findings of this study will promote adopting the pot based rffa approach in practice in south east australia further study should focus on the impacts of climate change on pot based rffa approach and uncertainty analysis similar to durocher burn and ashkar 2019 also to reduce parameter uncertainty in regression equations generalised least squares regression approach should be adopted similar to madsen and rosbjerg 1997 and haddad and rahman 2012 further study should consider developing rffa models from very frequent to 100 year flood quantiles based on

7668,study region southeast australia study focus regional flood frequency analysis rffa is a widely adopted statistical method to estimate design floods in ungauged catchments annual maximum flood amf model is the most popular method in developing rffa techniques however the amf based approaches are criticised for its limitations in the range of very frequent to frequent flood estimation as an alternative the peaks over threshold pot based approach has shown theoretical advantages in this flood range pot based rffa is currently underemployed internationally due to its complexity in modelling this study develops pot based rffa techniques for south eastern australia using data from 151 catchments a comparison is made between ordinary least squares ols and weighted least squares wls methods in developing pot based rffa techniques new hydrological insights for the region the ols based method is found to perform better than the wls the median relative error values of the developed prediction equations range 31 38 the new pot based rffa technique overcomes the limitations of the current australian rainfall and runoff which does not have any rffa technique for very frequent floods it is expected that these new pot based rffa technique will be used in practice in south east australia graphical abstract performance of peaks over threshold pot based regional flood

have permission to share data 1 introduction flooding is one of the worst natural disasters across the globe it leads to economic burdens due to direct and indirect consequences of flooding acosta et al 2016 accurate flood risk assessment is needed to reduce flood damage flood frequency analysis ffa is one of the most preferred methods for design flood estimation extreme value distributions are widely used in flood and rainfall frequency analyses e g yilmaz et al 2017 hossain et al 2021 traditionally ffa adopts annual maximum flood amf model which extracts the single highest flow value per year from the streamflow record to construct the amf series adopting amf model in ffa is straightforward and this is the most commonly applied practice in australia and internationally however it has been criticised for its inaccurate and biased estimates in very frequent to frequent flood ranges metzger et al 2020 zaman et al 2012 a common practice of applying amf involves censoring of the potential low flow values to achieve better fitting in the higher flood ranges ball et al 2016 peaks over threshold pot approach is an alternative to amf and has been widely employed in environmental modelling bernardara et al 2011 liang et al 2019 northrop and jonathan 2011 thompson et al 2009 it is flexible in the data extraction process and theoretically advantageous in estimating very frequent to frequent floods karim et al 2017 moreover the additional flood information through retaining values above a selected threshold could be a particular interest to hydrologists kumar et al 2020 madsen et al 1997a one can adjust the threshold by altering average events per year using the pot modelling approach cunnane 1973 recommended pot1 63 average 1 63 events over the threshold per year to reduce sample variance compared with the amf approach later a practical guideline was proposed by lang et al 1999 which recommended an average of one to three events above the threshold per year for the pot modelling i e between pot1 and pot3 durocher et al 2018 further investigated and proposed a hybrid method which suggested a lower boundary of pot1 and a higher boundary of pot5 regional flood frequency analysis rffa is the commonly adopted technique to estimate flood quantiles in ungauged catchments the rationale of rffa is to transfer flood characteristics from gauged to ungauged sites based on hydrological similarity haddad and rahman 2012 haddad et al 2012 generally the rffa involves two steps first forming regions and then applying a parametric distribution or index flood or quantile regression technique qrt rahman 2005 for design flood estimation index flood approach is a popular rffa technique which depends on the assumption of homogeneity hosking and wallis 1993 in contrast the qrt relaxes the homogeneity assumption in qrt a multiple linear regression mlr technique is applied to develop a relationship between a flood quantile dependent variable and selected catchment characteristics independent variables in mlr ordinary least square ols and weighted least square wls approaches are generally used to estimate the coefficients of the regression equations stedinger and tasker 1985 compared the performance of ols and wls in rffa and concluded that improvement in using wls can be significant over the ols many studies in australia and internationally focused on flood frequency analysis for both at site and regional cases and the majority of the studies were based on the amf modelling approach ahammed et al 2014 burn et al 2007 haddad and rahman 2011 2012 haddad et al 2011 ishak and rahman 2015 ishak et al 2013 masan and hewa 2020 rahman et al 2018 shu and ouarda 2007 walpita gamage et al 2020 rahman et al 2020 however there is a rising interest in using the pot modelling approach due to its suitability for ecological and environmental studies as they need frequent flow estimation ammar et al 2020 jarajapu et al 2022 kiran and srinivas 2021a langousis et al 2016 pan and rahman 2022 pan et al 2022 sccarrott and macdonald 2012 madsen and rosbjerg 1997 proposed an index flood method with a bayesian approach based on generalised pareto gpa distribution using pot flood data from 48 new zealand catchments a simple linear estimator was found to be adequate in the adopted generalized least squares regression framework durocher et al 2019 applied a nonstationary index flood model for pot data from 425 catchments in canada which enabled extending stationary method to both at site and regional cases they compared four different estimators two were based on regression and l moments and two others applied likelihood based techniques the independent likelihood method was found to provide most accurate estimates of regional floods for 10 and 100 years return periods mostofi zadeh et al 2019 proposed a general framework to undertake rffa for both the annual maximum and pot data series using data from 684 canadian stations the pot based rffa technique is underutilised in australia rahman et al 2019 this study aims to fill this knowledge gap by developing a pot based rffa technique focusing on very frequent to frequent flood ranges using data from south eastern australia in this context the main purposes of this study are i development of prediction equations for selected return periods very frequent to frequent flood ranges based on pot modelling approach ii assessment of the performance of the developed prediction equations based on different regions in the study area and iii recommendation of the best performing prediction equations for the selected return periods it is expected that the outcome of this study will promote the wider application of the pot based modelling approach in flood frequency analysis 2 methods 2 1 selection of events in selecting the pot series at a given gauging station the threshold value is selected based on an automated method adopting pearson normality test as described in pan et al 2021 the average events per year k 1 2 3 k is selected to determine the size of the potk series based on series iterative processes the threshold is determined once the critical p value is met 2 2 multiple linear regression the multiple linear regression mlr technique develops a relationship between the dependent variable q and u independent variables x 1 x 2 x u eq 1 below is constructed for expressing the i th observation i 1 2 3 n where b 0 and b j j 1 2 3 u are unknown parameters associated with the error term e i based on n observations it is assumed that the term e i is normally distributed based on a mean equal to zero the model parameters b0 b1 bj are generally estimated using an ordinary least square ols approach it is a common practice that the regional regression model is constructed based on log transformed dependent and independent variables durocher et al 2016 1 q i b 0 b 1 x i 1 b 2 x i 2 b j x ij b u x iu e i ols is the most popular method to estimate parameters of eq 1 based on minimising the residual sum of squares ols is based on the assumption of homoscedasticity which is not generally satisfied with hydrological data in other words the standard deviation of error terms is not constant across all values of the independent variables to overcome this problem weighted least square wls is adopted which treats parameters differently by assigning a weight in the parameter estimation process based on traditional wls the weights should ideally be equal to the reciprocal of the variance of the observations hydrologists also apply sampling error eq 2 as weights in the wls approach this study uses statistical weight reciprocal of variance ws and hydrological weight sampling error wh for comparison 2 sampling error variance of pot flood series size of pot flood series 2 3 model construction a total of 1512 pot based regression models are constructed and evaluated in this study for nine return periods between very frequent and frequent range of flows which vary from 12 events per year ey to 10 average recurrence interval ari or 10 annual exceedance probability aep 12ey 6ey 4ey 3ey 2ey 1ey 0 5ey 0 2ey and 10ari to specify probability of very frequent to frequent flows ey is used following australian rainfall and runoff book 2 chapter 3 ball et al 2019 fig 1 illustrates the adopted procedures for constructing models in this study the model construction starts with selecting potk flood series for each of the selected stations based on k average events per year k 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 4 5 flood quantiles are estimated for the selected nine return periods for each potk series assuming a generalised pareto distribution the next step is forming a group region from the selected catchments for developing the prediction equations a total of three regions are formed based on the geographical factors of the selected catchments region 1 includes all the selected 151 catchments in the study area south eastern australia while regions 2 and 3 are formed based on drainage division 2 and drainage division 4 in australia details of these regions are discussed in later sections once regions are formed two regression techniques are applied for each potk flood series ols and wls in the regression flood quantiles are dependent variables and climatic and catchment characteristics as shown in table 1 are independent variables ols technique adopts stepwise elimination based on p value 5 significance level op and aic value oa while wls adopts statistical ws and hydrological wh weights baseflow factors volume factor vf and peak factor pf are additional independent variables when constructing models m1 includes vf and pf m2 excludes vf and pf finally each model is evaluated based on eq 3 to eq 7 using both split sample ss and leave one out loo validation techniques a typical model 12ey pot3 r1 op m1 is constructed based on 12 event per year ey frequency pot3 model data from region 1 baseflow factors as independent variables and regressed using ols stepwise elimination based on p value 5 significance level this study first selects the best performing potk flood series based on various statistical measures then the selected potk flood series is adopted for further modelling and analysis finally the performance of each region is compared and discussed 2 4 model evaluation a range of statistical measures are applied to evaluate the performance of potk rffa models median relative error rem eq 3 relative error rer eq 4 root mean square error rmser eq 5 the coefficient of determination r2 eq 6 and the ratio between predicted and observed flow quantiles ratior eq 7 qobs is the at site flood quantiles estimated using generalised pareto distribution pan and rahman 2022 based on potk flood series qpred is the estimated flood quantile based on various pot based rffe models here a smaller rem value is desirable for the selected potk rffe model and ratior closer to 1 indicates a better fit between the predicted and observed flood quantiles r2 is also applied for each constructed model and its values range from 0 to 1 a value closer to 1 is preferable each developed potk rffa model is evaluated based on split sample ss with 80 20 split and leave one out loo validation techniques the ss validation is repeated 100 times randomly for each of the developed models and is evaluated using eq 4 3 re m median q pred q obs q obs 100 4 re r q pred q obs q obs 100 5 rmse r 1 n i 1 n q obs q pred q obs 2 100 6 r 2 1 sum of squares of residuals total sum of squares 7 ratio r q pred q obs 100 3 study area and data this study focuses on the coastal region of south eastern australia as shown in fig 2 since this part of australia has high quality streamflow data a total of 151 gauged catchments are selected the area of selected catchments ranges from 11 km2 to 1010 km2 with an average of 357 km2 and a median of 309 km2 records of streamflow data range from 27 to 82 years with an average of 42 years and a median of 39 years it should be noted here that the smaller the record length the higher the sampling variability in estimated quantiles the adopted wls method considers the impacts of record length in modelling the selected catchments have no major change in land use and are unregulated among the selected 151 catchments 57 are from new south wales nsw and 94 are from victoria vic states of australia this study considers three different regions region 1 consists of all the selected 151 catchments region 2 and region 3 are formed based on drainage division 2 coastal 89 catchments and drainage division 4 inland 62 catchments respectively drainage division 4 contains longer rivers than drainage division 2 which flow into the murray darling river system the rationale behind forming three regions is to improve the accuracy of the developed prediction equations application of hosking and wallis 1993 test to these regions did not deliver any homogeneous regions since heterogeneity statistics h were much higher than threshold value of one h1 11 this finding is similar to previous australian studies where homogeneous regions could not be identified e g bates et al 1998 rahman and rahman 2020 a total of eighteen hydrological and physio meteorological variables are adopted in this study as independent variables to develop the prediction equations based on the pot based modelling approach these variables are catchment areas a mean annual rainfall mar shape factor sf mean annual evapotranspiration mae stream density sden mainstream slope s1085 fraction forest fst design rainfall intensity of 6 hr duration based on varied return period ii e g i12 design rainfall intensity of 12ey baseflow volume factor vf and baseflow peak factor pf the shape factor sf is defined as the shortest distance between a catchment s centroid and outlet divided by the square root of catchment area a baseflow volume factor vf is defined as the ratio of baseflow volume and streamflow volume baseflow peak factor pf is defined as the ratio of peak of baseflow and peak of streamflow hydrograph australian rainfall and runoff arr 2019 book 5 chapter 4 has developed regional method to estimate baseflow for ungauged catchments for any location in australia for catchment size of 7 7800 km2 ball et al 2019 table 1 summarises the adopted independent variables in this study the dependent variables in regression analysis are q t flood discharge for t year return period values which are estimated by fitting a generalised pareto gpa distribution to each of the selected potk series 4 results and discussion 4 1 selection of best performing potk flood series in this study the best performing potk flood series is firstly selected based on the adopted statistical measures using catchments from region 1 i e all of the selected 151 catchments based on ss validation 80 20 split three evaluation statistics rem rmser and r2 eq 3 5 and 6 are applied for each potk model op m1 op m2 oa m1 oa m2 ws m1 ws m2 wh m1 wh m2 the return period of 12ey smallest return period of very frequent flood and 0 5ey smallest return period of frequent flood are selected and assessed and it is expected that other selected return periods will provide similar results fig 3 plots the r2 values of very frequent 12ey and frequent 0 5ey potk models overall it is observed that the 0 5ey potk models have a higher r2 value 0 75 0 79 than the 12ey potk models 0 62 0 69 a similar r2 values of 0 68 for pot3 pot4 and pot5 models and a slightly smaller r2 value for other potk models where k is less than 3 are observed for a return period of 0 5ey pot2 and pot3 models provide the highest r2 value of 0 78 compared to all other potk models among all the selected potk rffa models pot3 provides the best performance in relation to r2 value considering both return periods of 12ey and 0 5ey it is worth noting that the addition of the baseflow factor m1 provides comparable results to models without considering the baseflow factor m2 rem fig 4 a b and rmser fig 4 c d are two other statistical measures applied in assessing the best performing potk model it is desirable for a model to have low rem and rmser values for the return period of 12ey pot4 and pot5 models provide the lowest rem and rmser 33 and 6 3 respectively in contrast pot1 5 and pot2 models provide the lowest rem and rmser 32 and 6 5 it is found that for very frequent floods the smaller k of the pot flood series provides a higher rem and rmsrr considering all the statistical measures applied the pot3 model best balances the very frequent and frequent flood categories and is selected for further analysis 4 2 region 1 4 2 1 very frequent flow 12ey the logarithm of predicted and observed flood quantiles adopting pot3 flood series based on eight approaches using catchments in region 1 are plotted in fig 5 it measures how well the very frequent flood can be estimated in ungauged catchments using mlr technique overall it is shown a good agreement between the observed and predicted flood quantiles most of the catchments in fig 5 are within the narrow range along the 45 degree reference line however a slightly higher scatter is located above the reference line indicating some over estimation fig 6 illustrates the standardised residual quantile quantile qq plot of very frequent 12ey for all pot3 models in region 1 these plots demonstrate a strong alignment to the normality assumption although a small light tailed behaviour is observed highlighting some overestimation ols based regression models have a slightly more over estimation than wls based models overall it is observed that more than 90 of the residuals fall within 2 normal scores which indicates that the residuals closely follow a normal distribution the relative error rer eq 4 measures the difference between the predicted and observed flood quantile and is plotted in fig 7 a very similar boxplot between m1 and m2 models is observed using various regression techniques i e op m1 and op m2 on the other hand a slight difference is observed between ols and wls techniques i e op m1 and ws m1 overall the mean of rer ranges between 30 and 40 this finding holds the preliminary finding discussed in the previous section in which the overall fitting shows a slight tendency of over estimation fig 7 also illustrates a slight difference in the inter quantile range iqr for different models ratior is another measure that indicates how well a predictive model performs to the observed data if the ratior is close to 100 it indicates a good agreement between estimated and observed flood quantiles fig 7 indicates a similar tendency of over estimation based on a mean of 120 135 with an average of 100 combining the findings from fig 7 left and right it is clear that the ols based regression technique provides more accurate quantile estimates than the wls for the return period of 12ey 4 2 2 frequent flow 0 5ey fig 8 a plots the logarithm of the observed and predicted flood quantile for the return period of 0 5ey it can be seen a narrower concentration along the 45 degree reference line indicating a closer fit compared to 12ey although the scatter is smaller for the return period of 0 5ey compared to 12ey the over estimation is still evident in the plot comparing various regression techniques the difference in scatter is minor compared to the return period of 12ey fig 8 b plots the qq plots for various regression models of 0 5ey return period a light tailed behaviour in the upper part is also observed in general it is reassuring that majority of the qq plots fall in the range of 2 fig 9 left plots the rer of selected models for the return period of 0 5ey the iqr is similar across all selected models with an average of 20 30 and a median just above 0 the wls based model with the addition of baseflow factors m1 presents a slightly better agreement smaller iqr among others fig 9 right plots the ratior with a mean of 120 130 and a median of 98 102 4 2 3 cross validation results split sampling with 100 repeats is firstly applied 80 training and 20 testing for each selected model fig 10 plots rem eq 3 for 12ey left and 0 5ey right for the return period of 12ey it can be seen that the median rem values are similar for the six selected approaches which range from 35 to 37 a similar result is also observed for 0 5ey among different regression techniques the boxplots of ols based techniques provide a smaller iqr for both the 12ey and 0 5 ey return periods comparing models m1 and m2 a small reduction in iqr is found for m2 table 2 tabulates the median of rem using the loo technique for all the selected return periods in this study it can be seen that the variation in median rem is minor among all the selected regression models overall the rem ranges from a minimum of 31 7 to a maximum of 38 table 3 presents the median of ratior it is observed that the ratior between various models is within the range of 4 with a minimum of 94 and a maximum of 102 considering the results and plots from various statistical indices ols based regression model based on p value of 0 1 and exclusion of baseflow factor op m2 is selected for construction of prediction equations table 4 presents prediction equations and associated coefficients for selected return periods the independent variable design rainfall intensity i shown in table 4 is corresponded to the associated return period and 6 h duration e g for 12ey i corresponds to 12ey return period and 6 h duration and for 6ey i corresponds to 6ey return period and 6 h duration for the very frequent floods a sden and i are found to be significant independent variables for frequent floods mean annual rainfall mar is added with a sden and i as significant independent variables fig 11 illustrate the spatial distribution of the absolute rer values of the individual catchments for return period of 12ey left and 0 5ey right a certain degree of spatial coherence can be seen in the lower region of the coastline of south eastern australia with the increased distance from the coastline the number of catchments showing larger absolute rer 50 increases overall a good predictive performance based on absolute rer is found for 12ey and 0 5ey models pot3 r1 op m2 it is found that 38 4 of catchments out of 151 in region 1 have absolute rer values less than 25 for the return period of 12ey this is 37 1 for the return period of 0 5ey table 5 provides the individual and cumulative percentages of catchments with a range of absolute rer values overall the selected model pot3 r1 op m2 provides a relatively accurate estimate for very frequent to frequent floods with over 70 9 and 72 8 of catchments for 12 ey and 0 5ey models respectively have absolute rer values less than or equal to 50 4 3 region 2 r2 values for region 2 are plotted in fig s1 supplementary section which illustrates similar values of r2 for return periods of 12ey and 0 5ey overall r2 0 7 0 8 values for region 2 are higher than for region 1 considering rem and rmser the pot3 model is the best performing pot time series based on balancing the score between very frequent 12ey and frequent 0 5ey return periods as can be seen in fig s2 considering the scatter plot between the logarithm of qobs and qpred pot3 models show a slightly larger range of variation along the 45 degree line in fig s3 left qq plot fig s3 right shows that more than 90 of the scatter falls between the range of 2 rer and ratior for the return period of 12ey are plotted in fig s4 left and s4 right respectively there is some notable overestimation in region 2 similar to region 1 it is also observed that the median of each box plot in fig s4 is close to 0 and 100 respectively which indicates an unbiased estimate based on the pot3 model similar results for frequent flood estimates are found based on fig s5 and fig s6 it is found that ols based models excluding the baseflow factor provide the smallest iqr and smallest mean for both rer and ratior the pot3 models are cross validated using split sample validation technique and the results are illustrated in fig 12 smallest iqr is observed for the ols based model op m2 for both return periods of 12ey and 0 5ey the median of rem is 45 for the return period of 12ey and 48 for 0 5ey overall ols based models outperform the wls based models which have a wider iqr and a higher median of rem loo is also conducted for region 2 and results are tabulated in table s1 median of rem and table s2 median of ratior the developed ols based pot3 r2 op m2 prediction equations for region 2 are provided in table 6 it is observed that the group of independent variables based on 5 significance level are similar to region 1 except that mar is not selected for region 2 the spatial distribution of the absolute rer values of the selected model pot3 r2 op m2 is shown in fig 13 left 12ey and fig 13 right 0 5ey it is noted that few catchments have larger absolute rer values 75 which are located along the upper part of the south eastern coastline for the return period of 12ey in contrast the total number of catchments having larger absolute rer values 75 is smaller for the return period of 0 5ey the distribution of absolute rer values in fig 13 for region 2 and in fig 11 region 1 shows a broad agreement 4 4 region 3 fig s7 plots r2 values of potk models for region 3 overall r2 values of very frequent flood 0 45 0 65 is significantly lower than frequent flood 0 6 0 68 among selected potk models selected potk models are also evaluated based on rem and rmser as illustrated in fig s8 left and right considering all the statistics from various potk models in region 3 the pot3 model performs the best while balancing the categories of the very frequent and frequent floods pot3 models for very frequent floods are further assessed through the scatter plot fig s9 left and the qq plot fig s9 right a narrower concentration along the reference line can be seen for oa m1 and oa m2 models as compared to op m1 and op m2 models statistics of rem and ratior are evaluated and plotted in fig s10 left and right respectively it is observed that the smallest iqr is found for oa m2 which is different to the findings of region 1 and region 2 similar approaches are applied to frequent floods 0 5ey as illustrated in fig s11 and fig s12 oa m2 are the second best performing models for the frequent flood considering both categories of very frequent and frequent floods oa based models are selected for further investigation while op models are disregarded the split sample validation method is applied for region 3 and results are presented in fig s12 it is observed that the oa m2 model provides the smallest iqr for both very frequent and frequent floods 22 35 and 28 38 respectively it is also observed that the median of rem based on oa m2 is the smallest among all the selected models for very frequent floods loo cross validation is also applied and the results are shown in table s3 and table s4 considering the evaluation statistics pot3 r3 oa m2 model performs the best table 7 presents the developed prediction equations fig 14 spatial distribution of the absolute rer values for pot3 r3 oa m2 model are plotted in fig 15 left 12ey and fig 15 right 0 5ey it can be seen that the majority of the catchments in the lower part of region 3 are performing quite well absolute rer 50 for 12ey and catchments showing significant variation absolute rer 75 are located far away from the coastline fig 15 right illustrates a similar result 4 5 comparison of three regional models region 1 region 2 and region 3 in this section a comparison is made to evaluate the performance of pot3 based rffa models across three regions the count of catchments falling in different ranges of absolute rer values are shown in table 8 it can be seen that region 3 performs the best having the highest percentage of catchments having a smaller absolute rer values followed by region 1 and region 2 region 3 has smaller degree of heterogeneity compared to region 1 and region 2 which could be the reason for smaller prediction error for region 3 further study is needed to understand the differences in the performances of the prediction models across the three regions table 9 shows the significant at 5 level independent variables for the rffa models for three different regions the variables a and sden are found to be significant for all the three regions for both very frequent and frequent floods it is found to be significant for region 1 and region 2 and for frequent floods in region 3 sf is significant for only region 3 mar is significant for region 1 for frequent floods and s1085 is significant for region 3 for very frequent floods 4 6 recommended regional prediction equations for application considering different regional models region 1 2 and 3 it is clear that region 2 model has the lowest prediction accuracy and hence these models are not recommended for practical application for simplicity region 1 models shown in table 4 should be applied to the whole study area since these provide quite accurate flood predictions with absolute median relative error rem in the range of 33 36 these results are comparable to ali and rahman 2022 who reported a rem value of 31 34 in south east australia for 2 and 5 years return periods based on kriging based rffa techniques using annual maximum flood model in another study for south east australia zalnezhad et al 2022 reported rem values of 42 and 33 for 2 and 5 years return periods respectively using artificial neural networks ann based rffa technique we developed prediction equations for 100 year ari for both the am and pot cases and we found that the pot based models provided more accurate results than am based models this indicates that in future pot data can be used to develop regional prediction equations for very frequent to 100 year ari ranges for australia 5 conclusion the method adopted and developed in this study focuses on the flood quantile estimation in ungauged catchments in south east australia in the range of very frequent to frequent floods 12 6 4 3 2 1 0 5 0 2ey and 10 year ari considering the advantages of pot based approach various potk at site estimates average events per year k 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 4 5 are modelled and evaluated based on 151 selected catchments from south east australia it has been found that pot3 based model provides the best performance while balancing the categories of very frequent to frequent floods this study also compares the performance of ols and wls based regression analyses it has been found that the ols based regression technique provides the least relative error than the wls method three different regions are considered in this study in this regard no significant improvement is found if the coastal region alone region 2 is considered however a considerable improvement in prediction performance is found by adopting the inland region alone region 3 for simplicity the prediction equations developed for the whole nsw region 1 are recommended for practical application these prediction equations require four predictor variables catchment area design rainfall intensity mean annual rainfall and stream density which are readily available based on independent testing these predictions show a median relative error values in the range of 32 36 which are smaller than australian rainfall and runoff recommended rffa models 49 59 rahman et al 2019 this study bridges the gap in the current edition of australian rainfall and runoff which does not have rffa method in the range of very frequent floods the findings of this study will promote adopting the pot based rffa approach in practice in south east australia further study should focus on the impacts of climate change on pot based rffa approach and uncertainty analysis similar to durocher burn and ashkar 2019 also to reduce parameter uncertainty in regression equations generalised least squares regression approach should be adopted similar to madsen and rosbjerg 1997 and haddad and rahman 2012 further study should consider developing rffa models from very frequent to 100 year flood quantiles based on

7669,study region continental united states conus study focus micro hydrokinetic turbines are hydropower turbines that can utilize the current of the river to generate power without constructing a dam recent advances in micro hydrokinetic turbine technology have made their use an attractive alternative to traditional hydropower systems that require the construction of a dam in this paper we introduce a novel and practical analysis of continental to global scale hydrology and hydraulics that we use to assess continental united states conus stream locations with optimum hydraulic characteristics for an example micro hydrokinetic turbine volturnus we then utilize the boundaries of conus military installations to determine installations possessing the greatest potential to utilize the volturnus new hydrological insights for the region for the volturnus our results indicate that although less than 1 of conus stream locations possess the hydraulic characteristics necessary for the volturnus to function optimally this translates into roughly 224 544 million kwh per week considerably less than previous estimates of conus theoretical and recoverable power but substantial nonetheless around 26 40 conus military installations possess streams that are sometimes capable of producing hydropower with the volturnus and 12 20 of those military installations possess optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus year round in our analysis reducing either the minimum velocity or minimum depth threshold of the volturnus nearly double the proportion of conus locations with optimum volturnus hydraulic characteristics graphical abstract ga1 keywords hydropower hydrology hydraulics streamflow geographic information systems energy resources data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world needs energy to support human activity development and wellbeing if global energy consumption trends continue global energy consumption will continue to increase through the year 2050 driven by population and economic growth eia 2021c further complicating these trends in energy consumption is the need to reduce fossil fuel consumption during energy production to negate a significant portion of the anthropogenic influences on climate change jackson et al 2018 to offset fossil fuel consumption during energy production the world is shifting towards renewable energies such as hydropower papadis and tsatsaronis 2020 among renewable energy sources hydropower is one of the most significant hydropower accounts for double the energy generation of all other renewable electrical energy sources combined and nearly 1 5 of total electrical energy generation berga 2016 killingtveit 2019 hydropower generation broadly occurs via run of the river systems and storage systems run of the river systems produce energy by allowing the stream current to directly apply pressure to a hydro turbine and generate energy storage systems require the construction of a dam along a stretch of river to allow water to accumulate behind the dam and allow for that accumulated water to spill towards hydro turbines applying pressure to the hydro turbine and generating energy eia 2021b both modes of hydropower generation have traditionally relied upon construction of a fixed energy generation facility hydropower will continue to play a large role in offsetting the use of fossil fuels in generating electricity and meeting increased energy demands in the future berga 2016 despite the benefits of traditional hydropower systems there are also issues associated with traditional hydropower systems traditional hydropower system can also impose serious financial social and environmental costs joyce 1997 ansar et al 2014 zarfl et al 2015 moran et al 2018 furthermore climate change may affect traditional hydropower systems by inducing shifts in hydroclimatology yalew et al 2020 the presence of these hydropower facilities may also have the potential to incite diplomatic disputes in trans boundary watersheds zarfl et al 2015 llamosas and sovacool 2021 though traditional hydropower has and will continue to be a significant source of energy the impacts associated with this technology are not negligible however new technologies are overcoming the need for fixed facilities that traditional run of the river systems require small scale hydrokinetic or micro hydrokinetic river turbines may overcome many of the limitations associated with traditional hydropower moran et al 2018 chaudhari et al 2021 similar to traditional run of the river systems micro hydrokinetic energy conversion relies upon the current of a river to exert pressure on a turbine and generate energy in riverine environments however the main difference between traditional run of the river systems and micro hydrokinetic river turbines is that micro hydrokinetic river turbines do not require the construction of expensive fixed facilities vermaak et al 2014 chaudhari et al 2021 ibrahim et al 2021 a primary criticism of micro hydrokinetic power are the turbines operational constraints such as flow depth velocity and top width that impede the viability of hydrokinetic power kirke 2019 however there is potential for micro hydrokinetic turbines to function under less extreme conditions zhou and deng 2017 when evaluating the potential of hydrokinetic turbines at continental to global extents the literature has traditionally focused on examining the theoretical potential of hydropower and hydrokinetic power at large spatial extents theoretical hydrokinetic power assessments have typically converted discharge estimates into theoretical power and energy estimates that make use of stream discharge and head or change in elevation estimates epri 2012 kao et al 2014 hoes et al 2017 ridgill et al 2021 for instance ridgill et al 2021 utilize the global reach scale a priori discharge estimates for swot grades hydrologic modeling framework lin et al 2019 to convert streamflow and head into a theoretical estimate of power for 2 94 million river reaches across the globe recently studies of theoretical power have evolved to incorporate estimates of the reach level channel characteristics and velocity in the theoretical assessment ridgill et al 2022 however these studies on the theoretical potential of hydropower do not incorporate the practical operational constraints of micro hydrokinetic turbines there are instances where the literature examines practical constraints of hydrokinetic power the electric power research institute epri 2012 derive a recovery factor to estimate the proportion of theoretical power that is recoverable across all streams in the continental united states conus ridgill et al 2021 utilize an assumption that 20 of the theoretical hydropower they estimate is recoverable chaudhari et al 2021 developed a practical assessment of hydrokinetic turbines for the amazon river basin by using flow velocity and depth outputs from the leaf hydro flood lhf continental scale hydrologic model and empirical channel width estimates chaudhari et al 2019 2021 at river reach scale duvoy and toniolo 2012 developed the hydrokinetic calculator hydrokal module to convert two dimensional hydraulic model outputs into estimates of instantaneous power density and site stability to assess the practicality of hydrokinetic power at the river reach scale these studies provide a background for the application of hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to perform a practical investigation of micro hydrokinetic power however none of the current literature on practical hydrokinetic power analysis utilizes site specific hydrologic topographic hydraulic and land use estimates to derive a practical evaluation of micro hydrokinetic potential for conus as previously mentioned ridgill et al 2021 apply a recovery factor of 20 to their theoretical estimate of hydropower potential for conus to estimate a recoverable hydrokinetic power total but not attempt to account for local physical properties of a stream that may limit hydrokinetic turbine deployment epri 2012 represents another documented assessment of practical conus wide hydrokinetic power epri 2012 utilize the national hydrography dataset nhd plus nhdplus version 2 hydrography and the nhdplus hydrography s mean annual discharge slope and reach length to estimate a theoretical hydrokinetic power for all streams will mean annual discharge 28 m3 s 1 to convert their theoretical assessment of power to a recoverable or practical assessment epri 2012 derives a recoverability factor or the ratio of recoverable power to theoretical power the epri 2012 recoverability factor is a function of stream discharge and slope derived using a generalized hydraulic model with various configurations of discharge slope and turbine presence in the hydraulic model with v shaped cross sections along with specific depth and velocity constraints epri 2012 also limits the lower bound of discharge producing recoverable power to 28 m3 s 1 instead of deriving a recovery factor from a generalized model to determine practical hydropower potential at the reach level the present study uses a river reach s local topographic land use and streamflow at cross sections along the reach to estimate if the monthly average conditions result in depth velocity and top width that are necessary for a micro hydrokinetic turbine to operate effectively we utilize the same global discharge dataset used by the ridgill et al 2021 theoretical hydropower analysis and derive a practical analysis for conus by deriving estimates of local hydraulic properties at cross sections along a river reach instead of utilizing a reach level discharge and hydraulic head estimates using an additional continental scale discharge dataset in contrast to chaudhari et al 2021 who apply their analysis in the amazon basin we apply our analysis within conus and with different model configurations and spatial resolutions like ridgill et al 2021 and chaudhari et al 2021 the methodology can potentially extend to other regions of the world by making use of global datasets such as the forest and buildings removed copernicus dem fabdem hawker et al 2022 in this research our objective is to combine the investigations of epri 2012 ridgill et al 2021 and chaudhari et al 2021 and perform an updated practical evaluation and screening methodology of micro hydrokinetic power across conus the technique we describe combines known methods of continental scale hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and applies them in a novel way to create a technique to practically evaluate and screen any micro hydrokinetic turbine given the micro hydrokinetic turbines operational constraints unlike the previous practical assessments of conus hydrokinetic potential epri 2012 ridgill et al 2021 the main advantage to this assessment is that we do not derive a recovery factor to approximate hydraulic constraints at each reach but instead use estimates of topography hydrology hydraulics and land use along each reach and the known operational constraints of an example micro hydrokinetic turbine another advantage to our methodology is that instead of using only average annual hydrologic conditions epri 2012 we utilize large spatial extent hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to estimate monthly averages for riverine hydraulics parameters that constrain the use of an exemplar micro hydrokinetic turbine we then use geographic information systems gis processing to find all optimum micro hydrokinetic turbine locations that fall within conus military installations the result of this research is a novel methodology for practical evaluation micro hydrokinetic power across conus we intend to answer the following research questions for conus where and when can an example micro hydrokinetic turbine generate power what is an estimate of yearly micro hydrokinetic power that can be harvested by a state of art micro hydrokinetic turbine which military installations possess the highest potential for micro hydrokinetic turbine usage if the hydraulic constraints of a micro hydrokinetic turbine are increased or decreased which would provide the greatest increase in conus micro hydrokinetic potential 2 materials and methods we develop a systematic workflow to convert average monthly streamflow conditions to average monthly hydraulic conditions for the entire conus and use gis processing to filter out locations that do not meet the optimum requirements or do not fall within the boundaries of a conus military installation fig 1 is a system flowchart of our approach and the proceeding sections describe the different components of our methodology 2 1 streamflow data as our study builds upon ridgill et al 2021 we incorporate the use of the grades version 0 1 reanalysis streamflow data in this study lin et al 2019 generate grades daily streamflow estimates from globally available precipitation and hydrography to compare across streamflow generation spatial scales we also use the continental scale national water model nwm version 2 1 reanalysis hourly streamflow product that is produced for conus mccreight 2021 owp 2022 for both the datasets we generate monthly and overall averages of streamflow at each stream reach in both the grades and nwm hydrography 2 2 hydraulic modeling to convert the monthly estimates of streamflow into the hydraulic parameters depth top width and velocity we utilize the autoroute hydraulic model version 2 0 0 follum 2013 follum et al 2017 2020 in general autoroute requires three inputs a land use raster and accompanying roughness coefficients for each land use type a digital elevation model dem to represent topography and an estimate of baseflow and streamflow in this application we use the 2019 national land cover database nlcd as our land cover input mrlc 2022 the 1 3 arc second 10 m resolution national elevation dataset ned dem usgs 2022a and streamflow from grades and the nwm autoroute simulates riverine hydraulics at large spatial extents follum et al 2017 although recent application of autoroute centers on flood mapping follum et al 2017 2020 afshari et al 2018 tavakoly et al 2021 the model s original intent was to supply hydraulic parameters to mobility models to determine the fordability of streams mckinley et al 2012 autoroute is a raster based hydraulic model when using streamflow modeling like grades or the nwm as input autoroute discretizes the hydrography from a vector river network into rasterized stream cells that match the horizontal resolution of the dem as autoroute estimates the hydraulics at each stream cell the model will create multiple cross sections at each stream cell by extracting topographic data from the input dem autoroute then attempts to create a bathymetric profile for each cross section using baseflow and an assumed parabolic bathymetric profile shape and revises the cross section based upon this estimated bathymetry follum et al 2020 in this study we average each streams entire times series of discharge from the nwm or grades hydrologic model and use this as our baseflow estimate using each cross section with the incororated estimate of bathymetry autoroute then attempts produce an estimate of hydraulic characteristics for each cross section using the cross section monthly streamflow estimate estimated roughness and manning s equation follum 2017 2020 for each stream cell the cross section which autoroute estimates to have the shortest top width of the water surface is assumed the most representative for the stream cell and the stream cells depth velocity and top width for this cross section are output by autoroute for the stream cell follum et al 2020 the estimated hydraulic characteristics of each stream cell are independent of those estimated for upstream and downstream stream cells because the size of each stream cell is nearly identical we use the stream cell as the basic unit of representing hydraulic characteristics each stream cell is assumed to be a location where one micro hydrokinetic turbine may deploy because autoroute utilizes steady state uniform flow assumptions to derive hydraulic characteristics the model outputs are less informative in regions where backwater effects can occur such as areas of low topographic relief and in coastal regions follum et al 2017 2020 the technique we utilize to estimate a bathymetric profile for each stream cell is currently unable to estimate several fluvial sediment properties such as bed material and the location of sand bars that will influence site selection 2 3 filtering process after generating hydraulic characteristics for each month we perform three layers of filtering on the resulting data using operational constraints for an example micro hydrokinetic turbine waterbodies from the national hydrography dataset nhd usgs 2023 and department of defense dod installation boundaries the example micro hydrokinetic turbine we select is the state of the art volturnus micro hydrokinetic turbine while still a prototype we select the volturnus to demonstrate this capability due to previous testing and deployment investigations that reveal the volturnus unique capability to overcome the design limitations of other micro hydrokinetic turbines such as excessive fouling verterra energy 2020 while we select the volturnus in this study the technique we adopt is applicable for any turbine design given that the operational hydraulic constraints of the micro hydrokinetic turbine are known first we determine if the modeled hydraulic characteristics at each stream cell meet the optimum site requirements for the volturnus micro hydrokinetic turbine fig 2 second we geospatially analyze if the stream cell falls within an nhd waterbody as we assume that the water within any given waterbody e g lake pond marsh swamp reservoir or estuary is relatively stagnant hydraulically third we use the python library geopandas jordahl et al 2021 to perform an intersectional spatial join between the conus layer of stream cells meeting optimum volturnus site requirements and the defense installations spatial data infrastructure disdi portals military installlations ranges and training areas mirta polygons dod 2021 we summarize the results as monthly counts of stream cell locations that fall within the mirta polygons the dod considers mirta to be the authoritative geospatial dataset for point locations and boundaries of dod sites mirta includes installations that are greater than 10 acres in area anddhave a plant replacement value prv greater than 10 million which excludes a number of national guard and reserve sites 3 results 3 1 where and when can an example micro hydrokinetic turbine generate power we first examine the spatial and temporal distribution of optimum volturnus locations across conus fig 3 illustrates monthly kernel density plots of conus stream cells possessing optimum volturnus conditions there is certainly agreement between the nwm v2 1 and grades v0 1 both spatially and temporally in fig 3 we can see that a large portion of the eastern conus possesses some optimum volturnus locations with hotspots interspersed throughout the region for both the nwm and grades results the highest density region for both nwm and grades appears to be the pacific coast stretching from california up into washington and in the northern rocky mountains temporally we see that the density across conus is highest in the january june period decreasing to a lower density in the july october period until beginning to increase in density from november december overall we see a consistent signal that there are viable stream locations for the volturnus across the united states when we compute the proportion of stream cells that possess optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions the concentration of streams is not as dense as fig 3 might appear fig 4 presents a monthly and overall estimate of the percentage of conus stream cells that under average conditions provide optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions for both our nwm and grades analysis we see the same temporal pattern recognized in fig 3 with peaks occurring in the spring and troughs occurring during the late summer early fall however the peak percentage of stream cells with optimum volturnus locations only amounts to 0 18 for the nwm and 0 69 for grades the proportional differences between the nwm and grades results are the consequences of the differences in stream network density for the models we find that the nwm has approximately four times the number of stream cells as compared to grades and is roughly four times denser than grades however the total number of stream cells with optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions is roughly equivalent for the nwm and grades results on the surface this appears to represent only a small portion of the total number of potential locations however these fractions translate into about 400 000 900 000 stream locations across conus where optimum hydraulic conditions are present under average streamflow conditions merging the stream cell data back with the respective hydrography allows us to glean additional relationships between the volturnus operational hydraulic constraints and each stream cells upstream characteristics two typical ways of discerning the relationships between a watershed and local stream are the strahler stream order strahler 1957 hughes et al 2011 and the upstream drainage area both the nhdplus and merit hydro datasets that the nwm and grades utilize as their hydrography contain a strahler stream order and upstream drainage area calculation fig 5 depicts bar plots with counts of all stream cells summed for all 12 months of our analysis where we estimate to have optimum volturnus conditions and the stream cells respective straler stream order and drainage area characteristics the nwm results indicate that the typical stahler stream order possessing optimum volturnus conditions is roughly between stream orders 5 7 with a mode of stream order 6 the grades results indicate that this band of optimum stream orders is roughly 3 6 with a mode of stream order 4 because strahler stream order is dependent upon the scale at which the hydrography maps we can understand why the grades results appear to concentrate on lower order streams grades hydrography is less dense than the nwm hydrography however there is less of a concentration of stream cells at a particular range of drainage area but more agreement between the nwm and grades results fig 5c and fig 5d demonstrate that there is a range of drainage areas for stream cells where optimum volturnus conditions and that the pattern is nearly identical between nwm and grades results thus from a continental perspective there are a relative concentration of stream orders where the stream cell meets optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus however a variety of drainage areas for stream locations where optimum hydraulic conditions exist for the volturnus micro hydrokinetic turbine demonstrating that rivers of a particular stream order or size tend to accommodate the volturnus optimum hydraulic constraints 3 2 what is an estimate of yearly micro hydrokinetic power that can be harvested by a state of art micro hydrokinetic turbine as a function of streamflow velocity estimates indicate that one continuously functioning volturnus can generate about 206 1647 kwh per week verterra energy 2022 converting this information into a power function relationship where kwh per week is a function of streamflow velocity and using nwm and grades monthly average velocity estimates we estimate that roughly 225 544 million kwh per week can be generated using the volturnus throughout conus this is enough energy to power between 1 1 and 2 6 million average homes in the united states eia 2021a 3 3 which military installations possess the highest potential for micro hydrokinetic turbine usage despite what appears to be a large portion of conus where streams meet optimal volturnus conditions we initially estimate that only 26 30 of the 672 conus mirta installations possess at least one stream cell where our modeling framework estimates to have optimum hydraulic characteristics for the volturnus micro hydroturbine further we initially estimate that approximately 12 14 of conus mirta installations have at least one stream cell with optimum volturnus conditions for average conditions for all months of the year however the spatial relationship between the nwm grades hydrography and mirta polygons are a defining component of these results the stream hydrography uses a linear one dimensional feature to approximate the spatial location of streams that are in reality dynamic and two dimensional features on the earth s surface this approximation makes the linear stream hydrography an imperfect approximation of a stream s geographic location and extent at global extents stream hydrography are typically derived synthetically using dem data e g lin et al 2021 and although significant reduction in errors have occurred in the citing of stream hydrography misplacement of streams relative to their actual location occurs the mirta boundaries are also imperfect assessments of the installations boundary and are not a survey quality product conflating errors in the spatial placement of stream hydrography and installation boundaries appear to have some influence in the results of our analysis as an example consider the nwm results at fort hood pictured in fig 6 the leon river defines a portion of the northern border of fort hood imperfect alignment between the fort hood boundary and nwm hydrography results in the filtering of stream cells in the yellow polygon that our simulation indicates can potentially support the volturnus hydraulically our initial results are to some extent shaped by imperfections in the mapping of geographic features the result is that we may omit or include stream cells erroneously at installation boundaries shaped by streams or near streams to what extent such errors occur is difficult to quantify at continental to global extents we can utilize the horizontal accuracy of our geospatial of the datasets to create an error buffer with which to assess uncertainty in our results created by the mapping errors in our input geospatial datasets both the mirta and nwm hydrography national hydrography dataset plus version 2 meet national map accuracy standards meaning that 90 of features are within about 50 m of their true geographic position usgs 2022b department of defense dod 2021 the grades hydrography merit hydro derives from 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem data where 90 of errors are less than 12 6 m yamazaki et al 2019 farr et al 2007 the sum of dem resolution and error 100 m is a reasonable estimate of horizontal error for the grades hydrography when applying the buffer we observe some impact on the number of viable mirta conus installations the use of the buffer increases the number of installations that possess at least one stream cell with optimum hydraulic characteristics for the volturnus increases from 26 30 to 38 40 conus installations our estimate of conus mirta polygons have at least one stream cell with optimum volturnus conditions for average conditions for all months of the year increases to 12 14 to 19 20 conus installations thus it appears that positional errors may influence the results of our analysis as the number of installations with at least one stream cell with optimum hydraulic characteristic for volturnus increased by 33 46 and those will optimum volturnus conditions for average conditions for all months increased by 43 58 among the conus mirta locations with optimum volturnus stream cells the volume of stream cells at each installation varies by location and time the variety of results influences the likelihood of locating a viable site for deploying the volturnus at any given time of the year fig 7 illustrates the interplay between the volume of stream cells with optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions and the monthly volatility in the number of stream cells with optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions in fig 7 we measure volume by summing the total number of stream cells with optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions for all months of the year for each conus installation we measure monthly volatility by computing the coefficient of variation cv for each conus installation using eq 1 1 cv œÉ m Œº m in eq 1 œÉm is the standard deviation of the monthly number of stream cells meeting the optimum volturnus hydraulic constraints at each installation and ¬µm is the monthly mean number of stream locations meeting the volturnus optimum hydraulic constraints for each installation the result is a scatterplot for each nwm and grades analysis with and without the buffers conus installations near the bottom right corner of each plot are relatively qualified volturnus installations as the coefficient of variation is low representing a relatively low volatility in the number of optimum stream cells at the installation each month and a relatively large volume of stream cells in all four plots in fig 7 we see two installations that are consistently outliers in the bottom right corner of each scatterplot fort knox and national guard ng camp dodge johnston training site ts the result indicates that both locations are among the best locations for deployment of the volturnus unit thus while we do see an increase in the total number of conus military installations when we include the error buffer we don t see a substantial influence on the preeminent installations with the greatest micro hydrokinetic potential much of the salt river and a major tributary to the salt river rolling fork that run through fort knox are deemed viable for the volturnus to operate by both of our modeling runs fig 8a depicts the location of these streams within the fort knox mirta boundary because these streams run through the middle of fort knox the installation provides the advantage of multiple access points as both streams are encompassed by the installation and unimpeded by private land through inspection of cross sections of the salt river taken during inspection of one of the fort knox bridges gawel and barkuloo 2022 the channel profile both upstream and downstream of the bridge appear to align with the parabolic channel profile assumptions that are used in the autoroute model giving us some confidence in the bathymetric assumptions at fort knox however discussions with facilities management personnel at fort knox also highlight characteristics that may restrict the use of the volturnus and could challenge our modeling results fort knox routinely hosts live fire exercises that could impede access to sites chosen for deployment of the volturnus hydraulically the salt river drains into the ohio river see fig 8a and is periodically subject to backwater effects from the ohio river hydrologically the salt river and rolling fork are also regarded as flashy streams by the installation managers with steep increases in stream stage following flow generating rainfall events the modeling we undertake in this study does not consider either backwater or wet weather influences on the hydraulic characteristics of streams and may challenge our fort knox modeling results at ng camp dodge johnston ts both the nwm and grades results deem the des moines river a suitable location to deploy the volturnus during average conditions fig 8b illustrates the location of the des moines in relation to ng camp dodge johnston ts ng camp dodge johnston ts is co located with saylorville lake a multipurpose u s army corps of engineers usace reservoir usace 2019 2023 that impounds a large portion of the des moines river that runs through ng camp dodge johnston ts our modeling results indicate potential for the des moines to support operation of the volturnus both upstream and downstream of saylorville lake downstream of saylorville lake regulated outflow from the reservoir can provide more predictable flows that are not as influenced by wet or dry conditions as naturalized flows are enhancing the use of the stream as a host for the volturnus in fact because of the perceived ability of the des moines to support the volturnus saylorville lake may also provide a case study location of how hydrokinetic turbines could retrofit a non powered dam however physically accessing the section of the des moines river that flows through ng camp dodge johnston ts may be difficult given that the boundaries of the installation tend to encompass the stream channel itself but not the surrounding land access to these locations would require coordination with surrounding private landowners who would need to grant access to the stream from their property both installations where our modeling results predict suitable hydraulic characteristics for the volturnus present both opportunities and challenges that will ultimately impact each locations suitability this process of evaluating different geographic extents is reproducible for different administrative boundaries the evaluation could extend into examining the potential of countries states countries or other administrative divisions to harvest hydrokinetic power the process could allow governments and policy makers the ability to make quantified judgements about supporting these technology in particular geographic regions and compare this to traditional means of harvesting hydropower 3 4 if the hydraulic constraints of a micro hydrokinetic turbine are increased or decreased which would provide the greatest increase in conus micro hydrokinetic potential with a defined operational context for the current volturnus unit across conus and conus mirta installations we now seek to offer preliminary sensitivity analysis of optimum hydraulic conditions for micro hydrokinetic turbines by expanding the limits of the volturnus for instance if we expand the velocity the volturnus velocity constraints of 1 5 3 0 m s 1 to 1 0 3 0 m s 1 by lowering the minimum velocity threshold does that lead to an appreciable increase in the volume of locations where the turbine best operates providing an initial probe into these questions can highlight how our analysis may guide additional refinement of the volturnus by assisting the developers in understanding how they may best expand the geographic scope at which the volturnus operates optimally table 1 describes how various changes to the volturnus optimum hydraulic constraints affects the volume of stream cells that possess those optimum hydraulic conditions table 1 values are an average for all months of the year in table 1 we see that decreasing the minimum velocity and minimum depth constraints roughly doubles the number of locations where the volturnus could operate optimally in conus we also see that increasing the maximum velocity maximum depth and minimum top width constraints has little impact on the proportion of locations that provide optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus thus we can see that lowering the minimum velocity and depth thresholds of the optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus could significantly expand the geographic range of the volturnus likewise expanding other operational hydraulic constraints offers little expansion of geographic coverage this could offer the volturnus developers initial insight into how prioritize additional development of the volturnus 4 discussion 4 1 previous estimates of conus theoretical and recoverable hydrokinetic resources epri 2012 and ridgill et al 2021 previously computed twh per yr estimates of theoretical hydrokinetic power for conus streams with mean daily streamflow 28 m3 s 1 and found that between 1146 and 1350 twh per yr of theoretical hydrokinetic resources are available to conus epri 2012 using the same discharge filter estimates that 99 4 twh per yr were recoverable not using the same discharge filter ridgill et al 2021 estimate that 580 twh per yr are recoverable in the united states translating our kwh per week estimate to twh per year we estimate that between 11 7 and 28 3 twh per yr of hydrokinetic resources are recoverable to conus using the volturnus our estimate of practical hydrokinetic resource availability is roughly two orders of magnitude less than the epri 2012 and ridgill et al 2021 theoretical estimates for conus and 2 28 of their estimates of recoverable hydropower for conus the lower resource availability as compared to previous conus theoretical and recoverable or practical estimates of hydropower likely reflects our use of local hydraulic constraints of our exemplar micro hydrokinetic turbine the volturnus bothepri 2012 and ridgill et al 2021 derive a recovery factor to estimate the proportion of recoverable hydropower for conus however neither study utilizes the local hydraulic constraints to estimate recoverable hydropower instead relying upon generalizations the epri 2012 recoverability factor is a function of stream discharge and slope derived using a generalized hydraulic model with various configurations of discharge slope and turbine presence in the hydraulic model with v shaped cross sections along with specific depth and velocity constraints ridgill et al 2021 multiplied their theoretical conus estimate by 20 to estimate recoverable hydropower and note the crudeness of this recoverable or practical estimate of power generation at a conus scale our study appears to indicate that previous estimates of the proportion of recoverable hydropower using hydrokinetic turbines is lower when accounting for the local hydraulic conditions we estimate for conus in a further geographic downscaling epri 2012 assessed their findings at roughly a regional two digit hydrologic unit code huc level to further our comparison to the epri 2012 results we perform the same regionalization and average our monthly results for each conus two digit huc note that for simlicity we aggregate the epri 2012 results in the upper and lower missouri into the missouri two digit huc table 2 depicts the comparison in this discretization we see that regional hydropower potential estimates can vary widely by region between epri 2012 results and our own the most notable of these differences is the lower mississippi where epri 2012 estimates that 57 4 twh per yr are recoverable while our estimates are between 0 6 and 1 2 twh per year or roughly 2 of those estimated by epri 2012 the main driver still appears to be the use of a recovery factor for epri 2012 and our use of local topographic and hydraulic constraints of the volturnus regions that are driving major differences between epri 2012 and our study include the ohio upper mississippi lower mississippi missouri lower colorado and pacific northwest these regions all include large rivers such as the ohio mississippi colorado and columbia rivers that epri 2012 includes in their list of top theoretical hydropower producing streams the voltunus hydraulic constraints we utilize tend to not to allow for the operation of the volturnus on most segments of these large rivers particularly in the downstream regions where epri 2012 estimates there to be recoverable hydropower thus we speculate that the largest differences in epri 2012 regional hydrokinetic power estimates and our studies regional kinetic hydropower estimates is epri 2012 allowing for the harvesting of kinetic hydropower on these large rivers where our study tends to deem the volturnus inoperable for large portions of these streams 4 2 study limitations and future work like most previous studies of hydrokinetic potential for continental and global spatial extents e g epri 2012 ridgill et al 2021 2022 this study does not include a field validation component the authors intend to use the process of defining the conus military installations that have the most robust microhydro potential as a means of both evaluating the volturnus turbine and evaluating the accuracy of our analysis in this study as a future next step field assessment and validation of the hydrologic and hydraulic modeling we deploy in this study is a critical in the analysis of hydrokinetic power potential at continental extents the field evaluation should expose the critical weaknesses of our study one of the perceived weaknesses in this study that is likely to alter our results is the employment of simplified hydrologic and hydraulic modeling whose assumptions are primarily less effective in low gradient and coastal regions because of the modeling chains inability to estimate backwater effects follum et al 2016 2020 backwater effects can also occur at stream confluences conus scale hydraulic modeling frameworks with higher physical fidelity have been developed for analyzing flood hazard risk bates et al 2021 application of similar frameworks for studying hydrokinetic power potential at continental to global extents may better represent hydraulic characteristics for streams however existing continental and global scale hydraulic models regardless of model fidelity tend to lack a measured bathymetry and must approximate the bathymetry our simplified hydraulic modeling must also estimate a bathymetric profile at all locations due to the lack of bathymetry for a significant portion of conus zheng et al 2018 and global neal et al 2021 gutenson et al 2018 dems because our bathymetry is approximate and likely plays a significant role in determining a stream cells hydraulic characteristics future study should investigate the uncertainty that this input injects into the modeling chain and should continue to devise improved ways of estimating bathymetry accurate characterization of stream channel bathymetry will remain a challenge in effectively and accurately estimating hydrokinetic power potential at large spatial extents because measurements of bathymetry will remain unavailable for most streams for the foreseeable future another topic of further investigation should be incorporation of additional suitability characteristics for instance when analyzing the suitability of stream cells the current study does not consider ingress egress into the waterway nor do we consider riverbed material furthermore we do not consider wet or dry hydrologic conditions which may affect each stream cells suitability for the volturnus and other hydrokinetic turbines stream accessibility and the impact of wet dry conditions are also potential criteria for evaluating a stream cell location for micro hydrokinetic potential an unknown amount of stream cells that this study deems suitable may not be so because access to the stream is restricted by vegetation streambank slopes the built environment or bedload material 5 conclusions in this article the authors present a new methodology for a practical evaluation of micro hydrokinetic turbines we utilize verterra energy s voltunus turbine to illustrate the evaluation process and we restrict our initial geographic scope to conus we use the monthly average streamflow from two different continental scale hydrologic models nwm version 2 1 and grades version 0 1 to feed into a continental scale hydraulic model autoroute version 2 0 0 0 utilizing the operational constraints of the volturnus we estimate the volume of stream locations stream cells that provide the optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus in conus we further determine which conus military installations possess the greatest potential for utilizing the volturnus turbine to generate power by comparing the total number of locations with optimum hydraulic conditions and monthly variation in the number of locations with optimum hydraulic conditions across conus we determine that much of the eastern half of conus possesses some stream locations with optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus and we find the highest concentrations of locations with optimum volturnus conditions to be along the northern pacific coast although we find that less than 1 of conus streams locations possess the optimum conditions for volturnus for any given month of the year this percentage represents roughly 400 000 900 000 locations under average streamflow conditions generating between 224 and 544 million kwh per week or enough energy to power between 1 1 and 2 6 million average american single family houses this assessment of conus hydrokinetic resource availability is roughly two orders of magnitude less than previous assessments of conus theoretical hydrokinetic potential epri 2012 ridgill et al 2021 for conus as compared to existing practical assessments of conus hydrokinetic potential epri 2012 ridgill et al 2021 we estimate about 2 28 of those studies estimates of recoverable power totals for conus we speculate that because our assessment accounts for local hydraulic constraints depth velocity and top width when estimating recoverable hydrokinetic power previous estimates of recoverable hydropower are higher than our study indicates discrepancies between epri 2012 and our results appear most prominent in regions where epri 2012 allows for recovery of hydropower at large powerful rivers in which the voltunus cannot operate depending upon the density of the stream network hydrography used in the hydrologic and hydraulic modeling streams where the volturnus can operate are predominantly stream order 3 6 grades or 5 7 nwm and for a variety of upstream drainage areas utilizing the mirta database of conus military installation boundaries we further demonstrate how administrative boundaries are useful in further honing an assessment of micro hydrokinetic potential our analysis finds that approximately 26 40 conus installations possess streams that are sometimes capable of producing optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions and 12 20 of those military installations possess optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus year round under average streamflow conditions among those locations we find that two conus installations fort knox and ng camp dodge johnston ts possess the greatest potential to utilize the volturnus this potential for utilizing the volturnus comes from a relatively large volume of summed monthly stream cells with optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions and a low monthly cv indicating a high number of stream locations possess optimum hydraulic conditions with relatively small variation on an average monthly basis both fort knox and ng camp dodge johnston ts possess perceived opportunities and challenges when it comes to the deployment of the volturnus and reliability of our modeling assumptions with a defined operational context for the volturnus we then turn our analysis towards an initial sensitivity investigation to understand how expanding the optimum hydraulic constraints of the volturnus affects the proportion of stream cells that can provide those optimum constraints our analysis reveals that decreasing the minimum velocity and minimum depth operational constraints can nearly double the proportion of stream cells with optimum hydraulic conditions while expanding other hydraulic constraints maximum velocity maximum depth and minimum top width of the volturnus offers little expansion of the geographic scale at which the volturnus can operate this analysis can help guide the turbine designers on how to refine their design to best expand the geographic scope of the volturnus this study illustrates how access to the hydraulic datasets such as the one we develop in this study can provide developers of micro hydrokinetic technology and those acquiring micro hydrokinetic technologies an understanding of how designed hydraulic constraints correspondingly impact the proportion of stream locations that the technology may operate in credit authorship contribution statement joseph l gutenson writing original draft writing review editing supervision data curation

7669,study region continental united states conus study focus micro hydrokinetic turbines are hydropower turbines that can utilize the current of the river to generate power without constructing a dam recent advances in micro hydrokinetic turbine technology have made their use an attractive alternative to traditional hydropower systems that require the construction of a dam in this paper we introduce a novel and practical analysis of continental to global scale hydrology and hydraulics that we use to assess continental united states conus stream locations with optimum hydraulic characteristics for an example micro hydrokinetic turbine volturnus we then utilize the boundaries of conus military installations to determine installations possessing the greatest potential to utilize the volturnus new hydrological insights for the region for the volturnus our results indicate that although less than 1 of conus stream locations possess the hydraulic characteristics necessary for the volturnus to function optimally this translates into roughly 224 544 million kwh per week considerably less than previous estimates of conus theoretical and recoverable power but substantial nonetheless around 26 40 conus military installations possess streams that are sometimes capable of producing hydropower with the volturnus and 12 20 of those military installations possess optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus year round in our analysis reducing either the minimum velocity or minimum depth threshold of the volturnus nearly double the proportion of conus locations with optimum volturnus hydraulic characteristics graphical abstract ga1 keywords hydropower hydrology hydraulics streamflow geographic information systems energy resources data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world needs energy to support human activity development and wellbeing if global energy consumption trends continue global energy consumption will continue to increase through the year 2050 driven by population and economic growth eia 2021c further complicating these trends in energy consumption is the need to reduce fossil fuel consumption during energy production to negate a significant portion of the anthropogenic influences on climate change jackson et al 2018 to offset fossil fuel consumption during energy production the world is shifting towards renewable energies such as hydropower papadis and tsatsaronis 2020 among renewable energy sources hydropower is one of the most significant hydropower accounts for double the energy generation of all other renewable electrical energy sources combined and nearly 1 5 of total electrical energy generation berga 2016 killingtveit 2019 hydropower generation broadly occurs via run of the river systems and storage systems run of the river systems produce energy by allowing the stream current to directly apply pressure to a hydro turbine and generate energy storage systems require the construction of a dam along a stretch of river to allow water to accumulate behind the dam and allow for that accumulated water to spill towards hydro turbines applying pressure to the hydro turbine and generating energy eia 2021b both modes of hydropower generation have traditionally relied upon construction of a fixed energy generation facility hydropower will continue to play a large role in offsetting the use of fossil fuels in generating electricity and meeting increased energy demands in the future berga 2016 despite the benefits of traditional hydropower systems there are also issues associated with traditional hydropower systems traditional hydropower system can also impose serious financial social and environmental costs joyce 1997 ansar et al 2014 zarfl et al 2015 moran et al 2018 furthermore climate change may affect traditional hydropower systems by inducing shifts in hydroclimatology yalew et al 2020 the presence of these hydropower facilities may also have the potential to incite diplomatic disputes in trans boundary watersheds zarfl et al 2015 llamosas and sovacool 2021 though traditional hydropower has and will continue to be a significant source of energy the impacts associated with this technology are not negligible however new technologies are overcoming the need for fixed facilities that traditional run of the river systems require small scale hydrokinetic or micro hydrokinetic river turbines may overcome many of the limitations associated with traditional hydropower moran et al 2018 chaudhari et al 2021 similar to traditional run of the river systems micro hydrokinetic energy conversion relies upon the current of a river to exert pressure on a turbine and generate energy in riverine environments however the main difference between traditional run of the river systems and micro hydrokinetic river turbines is that micro hydrokinetic river turbines do not require the construction of expensive fixed facilities vermaak et al 2014 chaudhari et al 2021 ibrahim et al 2021 a primary criticism of micro hydrokinetic power are the turbines operational constraints such as flow depth velocity and top width that impede the viability of hydrokinetic power kirke 2019 however there is potential for micro hydrokinetic turbines to function under less extreme conditions zhou and deng 2017 when evaluating the potential of hydrokinetic turbines at continental to global extents the literature has traditionally focused on examining the theoretical potential of hydropower and hydrokinetic power at large spatial extents theoretical hydrokinetic power assessments have typically converted discharge estimates into theoretical power and energy estimates that make use of stream discharge and head or change in elevation estimates epri 2012 kao et al 2014 hoes et al 2017 ridgill et al 2021 for instance ridgill et al 2021 utilize the global reach scale a priori discharge estimates for swot grades hydrologic modeling framework lin et al 2019 to convert streamflow and head into a theoretical estimate of power for 2 94 million river reaches across the globe recently studies of theoretical power have evolved to incorporate estimates of the reach level channel characteristics and velocity in the theoretical assessment ridgill et al 2022 however these studies on the theoretical potential of hydropower do not incorporate the practical operational constraints of micro hydrokinetic turbines there are instances where the literature examines practical constraints of hydrokinetic power the electric power research institute epri 2012 derive a recovery factor to estimate the proportion of theoretical power that is recoverable across all streams in the continental united states conus ridgill et al 2021 utilize an assumption that 20 of the theoretical hydropower they estimate is recoverable chaudhari et al 2021 developed a practical assessment of hydrokinetic turbines for the amazon river basin by using flow velocity and depth outputs from the leaf hydro flood lhf continental scale hydrologic model and empirical channel width estimates chaudhari et al 2019 2021 at river reach scale duvoy and toniolo 2012 developed the hydrokinetic calculator hydrokal module to convert two dimensional hydraulic model outputs into estimates of instantaneous power density and site stability to assess the practicality of hydrokinetic power at the river reach scale these studies provide a background for the application of hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to perform a practical investigation of micro hydrokinetic power however none of the current literature on practical hydrokinetic power analysis utilizes site specific hydrologic topographic hydraulic and land use estimates to derive a practical evaluation of micro hydrokinetic potential for conus as previously mentioned ridgill et al 2021 apply a recovery factor of 20 to their theoretical estimate of hydropower potential for conus to estimate a recoverable hydrokinetic power total but not attempt to account for local physical properties of a stream that may limit hydrokinetic turbine deployment epri 2012 represents another documented assessment of practical conus wide hydrokinetic power epri 2012 utilize the national hydrography dataset nhd plus nhdplus version 2 hydrography and the nhdplus hydrography s mean annual discharge slope and reach length to estimate a theoretical hydrokinetic power for all streams will mean annual discharge 28 m3 s 1 to convert their theoretical assessment of power to a recoverable or practical assessment epri 2012 derives a recoverability factor or the ratio of recoverable power to theoretical power the epri 2012 recoverability factor is a function of stream discharge and slope derived using a generalized hydraulic model with various configurations of discharge slope and turbine presence in the hydraulic model with v shaped cross sections along with specific depth and velocity constraints epri 2012 also limits the lower bound of discharge producing recoverable power to 28 m3 s 1 instead of deriving a recovery factor from a generalized model to determine practical hydropower potential at the reach level the present study uses a river reach s local topographic land use and streamflow at cross sections along the reach to estimate if the monthly average conditions result in depth velocity and top width that are necessary for a micro hydrokinetic turbine to operate effectively we utilize the same global discharge dataset used by the ridgill et al 2021 theoretical hydropower analysis and derive a practical analysis for conus by deriving estimates of local hydraulic properties at cross sections along a river reach instead of utilizing a reach level discharge and hydraulic head estimates using an additional continental scale discharge dataset in contrast to chaudhari et al 2021 who apply their analysis in the amazon basin we apply our analysis within conus and with different model configurations and spatial resolutions like ridgill et al 2021 and chaudhari et al 2021 the methodology can potentially extend to other regions of the world by making use of global datasets such as the forest and buildings removed copernicus dem fabdem hawker et al 2022 in this research our objective is to combine the investigations of epri 2012 ridgill et al 2021 and chaudhari et al 2021 and perform an updated practical evaluation and screening methodology of micro hydrokinetic power across conus the technique we describe combines known methods of continental scale hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and applies them in a novel way to create a technique to practically evaluate and screen any micro hydrokinetic turbine given the micro hydrokinetic turbines operational constraints unlike the previous practical assessments of conus hydrokinetic potential epri 2012 ridgill et al 2021 the main advantage to this assessment is that we do not derive a recovery factor to approximate hydraulic constraints at each reach but instead use estimates of topography hydrology hydraulics and land use along each reach and the known operational constraints of an example micro hydrokinetic turbine another advantage to our methodology is that instead of using only average annual hydrologic conditions epri 2012 we utilize large spatial extent hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to estimate monthly averages for riverine hydraulics parameters that constrain the use of an exemplar micro hydrokinetic turbine we then use geographic information systems gis processing to find all optimum micro hydrokinetic turbine locations that fall within conus military installations the result of this research is a novel methodology for practical evaluation micro hydrokinetic power across conus we intend to answer the following research questions for conus where and when can an example micro hydrokinetic turbine generate power what is an estimate of yearly micro hydrokinetic power that can be harvested by a state of art micro hydrokinetic turbine which military installations possess the highest potential for micro hydrokinetic turbine usage if the hydraulic constraints of a micro hydrokinetic turbine are increased or decreased which would provide the greatest increase in conus micro hydrokinetic potential 2 materials and methods we develop a systematic workflow to convert average monthly streamflow conditions to average monthly hydraulic conditions for the entire conus and use gis processing to filter out locations that do not meet the optimum requirements or do not fall within the boundaries of a conus military installation fig 1 is a system flowchart of our approach and the proceeding sections describe the different components of our methodology 2 1 streamflow data as our study builds upon ridgill et al 2021 we incorporate the use of the grades version 0 1 reanalysis streamflow data in this study lin et al 2019 generate grades daily streamflow estimates from globally available precipitation and hydrography to compare across streamflow generation spatial scales we also use the continental scale national water model nwm version 2 1 reanalysis hourly streamflow product that is produced for conus mccreight 2021 owp 2022 for both the datasets we generate monthly and overall averages of streamflow at each stream reach in both the grades and nwm hydrography 2 2 hydraulic modeling to convert the monthly estimates of streamflow into the hydraulic parameters depth top width and velocity we utilize the autoroute hydraulic model version 2 0 0 follum 2013 follum et al 2017 2020 in general autoroute requires three inputs a land use raster and accompanying roughness coefficients for each land use type a digital elevation model dem to represent topography and an estimate of baseflow and streamflow in this application we use the 2019 national land cover database nlcd as our land cover input mrlc 2022 the 1 3 arc second 10 m resolution national elevation dataset ned dem usgs 2022a and streamflow from grades and the nwm autoroute simulates riverine hydraulics at large spatial extents follum et al 2017 although recent application of autoroute centers on flood mapping follum et al 2017 2020 afshari et al 2018 tavakoly et al 2021 the model s original intent was to supply hydraulic parameters to mobility models to determine the fordability of streams mckinley et al 2012 autoroute is a raster based hydraulic model when using streamflow modeling like grades or the nwm as input autoroute discretizes the hydrography from a vector river network into rasterized stream cells that match the horizontal resolution of the dem as autoroute estimates the hydraulics at each stream cell the model will create multiple cross sections at each stream cell by extracting topographic data from the input dem autoroute then attempts to create a bathymetric profile for each cross section using baseflow and an assumed parabolic bathymetric profile shape and revises the cross section based upon this estimated bathymetry follum et al 2020 in this study we average each streams entire times series of discharge from the nwm or grades hydrologic model and use this as our baseflow estimate using each cross section with the incororated estimate of bathymetry autoroute then attempts produce an estimate of hydraulic characteristics for each cross section using the cross section monthly streamflow estimate estimated roughness and manning s equation follum 2017 2020 for each stream cell the cross section which autoroute estimates to have the shortest top width of the water surface is assumed the most representative for the stream cell and the stream cells depth velocity and top width for this cross section are output by autoroute for the stream cell follum et al 2020 the estimated hydraulic characteristics of each stream cell are independent of those estimated for upstream and downstream stream cells because the size of each stream cell is nearly identical we use the stream cell as the basic unit of representing hydraulic characteristics each stream cell is assumed to be a location where one micro hydrokinetic turbine may deploy because autoroute utilizes steady state uniform flow assumptions to derive hydraulic characteristics the model outputs are less informative in regions where backwater effects can occur such as areas of low topographic relief and in coastal regions follum et al 2017 2020 the technique we utilize to estimate a bathymetric profile for each stream cell is currently unable to estimate several fluvial sediment properties such as bed material and the location of sand bars that will influence site selection 2 3 filtering process after generating hydraulic characteristics for each month we perform three layers of filtering on the resulting data using operational constraints for an example micro hydrokinetic turbine waterbodies from the national hydrography dataset nhd usgs 2023 and department of defense dod installation boundaries the example micro hydrokinetic turbine we select is the state of the art volturnus micro hydrokinetic turbine while still a prototype we select the volturnus to demonstrate this capability due to previous testing and deployment investigations that reveal the volturnus unique capability to overcome the design limitations of other micro hydrokinetic turbines such as excessive fouling verterra energy 2020 while we select the volturnus in this study the technique we adopt is applicable for any turbine design given that the operational hydraulic constraints of the micro hydrokinetic turbine are known first we determine if the modeled hydraulic characteristics at each stream cell meet the optimum site requirements for the volturnus micro hydrokinetic turbine fig 2 second we geospatially analyze if the stream cell falls within an nhd waterbody as we assume that the water within any given waterbody e g lake pond marsh swamp reservoir or estuary is relatively stagnant hydraulically third we use the python library geopandas jordahl et al 2021 to perform an intersectional spatial join between the conus layer of stream cells meeting optimum volturnus site requirements and the defense installations spatial data infrastructure disdi portals military installlations ranges and training areas mirta polygons dod 2021 we summarize the results as monthly counts of stream cell locations that fall within the mirta polygons the dod considers mirta to be the authoritative geospatial dataset for point locations and boundaries of dod sites mirta includes installations that are greater than 10 acres in area anddhave a plant replacement value prv greater than 10 million which excludes a number of national guard and reserve sites 3 results 3 1 where and when can an example micro hydrokinetic turbine generate power we first examine the spatial and temporal distribution of optimum volturnus locations across conus fig 3 illustrates monthly kernel density plots of conus stream cells possessing optimum volturnus conditions there is certainly agreement between the nwm v2 1 and grades v0 1 both spatially and temporally in fig 3 we can see that a large portion of the eastern conus possesses some optimum volturnus locations with hotspots interspersed throughout the region for both the nwm and grades results the highest density region for both nwm and grades appears to be the pacific coast stretching from california up into washington and in the northern rocky mountains temporally we see that the density across conus is highest in the january june period decreasing to a lower density in the july october period until beginning to increase in density from november december overall we see a consistent signal that there are viable stream locations for the volturnus across the united states when we compute the proportion of stream cells that possess optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions the concentration of streams is not as dense as fig 3 might appear fig 4 presents a monthly and overall estimate of the percentage of conus stream cells that under average conditions provide optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions for both our nwm and grades analysis we see the same temporal pattern recognized in fig 3 with peaks occurring in the spring and troughs occurring during the late summer early fall however the peak percentage of stream cells with optimum volturnus locations only amounts to 0 18 for the nwm and 0 69 for grades the proportional differences between the nwm and grades results are the consequences of the differences in stream network density for the models we find that the nwm has approximately four times the number of stream cells as compared to grades and is roughly four times denser than grades however the total number of stream cells with optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions is roughly equivalent for the nwm and grades results on the surface this appears to represent only a small portion of the total number of potential locations however these fractions translate into about 400 000 900 000 stream locations across conus where optimum hydraulic conditions are present under average streamflow conditions merging the stream cell data back with the respective hydrography allows us to glean additional relationships between the volturnus operational hydraulic constraints and each stream cells upstream characteristics two typical ways of discerning the relationships between a watershed and local stream are the strahler stream order strahler 1957 hughes et al 2011 and the upstream drainage area both the nhdplus and merit hydro datasets that the nwm and grades utilize as their hydrography contain a strahler stream order and upstream drainage area calculation fig 5 depicts bar plots with counts of all stream cells summed for all 12 months of our analysis where we estimate to have optimum volturnus conditions and the stream cells respective straler stream order and drainage area characteristics the nwm results indicate that the typical stahler stream order possessing optimum volturnus conditions is roughly between stream orders 5 7 with a mode of stream order 6 the grades results indicate that this band of optimum stream orders is roughly 3 6 with a mode of stream order 4 because strahler stream order is dependent upon the scale at which the hydrography maps we can understand why the grades results appear to concentrate on lower order streams grades hydrography is less dense than the nwm hydrography however there is less of a concentration of stream cells at a particular range of drainage area but more agreement between the nwm and grades results fig 5c and fig 5d demonstrate that there is a range of drainage areas for stream cells where optimum volturnus conditions and that the pattern is nearly identical between nwm and grades results thus from a continental perspective there are a relative concentration of stream orders where the stream cell meets optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus however a variety of drainage areas for stream locations where optimum hydraulic conditions exist for the volturnus micro hydrokinetic turbine demonstrating that rivers of a particular stream order or size tend to accommodate the volturnus optimum hydraulic constraints 3 2 what is an estimate of yearly micro hydrokinetic power that can be harvested by a state of art micro hydrokinetic turbine as a function of streamflow velocity estimates indicate that one continuously functioning volturnus can generate about 206 1647 kwh per week verterra energy 2022 converting this information into a power function relationship where kwh per week is a function of streamflow velocity and using nwm and grades monthly average velocity estimates we estimate that roughly 225 544 million kwh per week can be generated using the volturnus throughout conus this is enough energy to power between 1 1 and 2 6 million average homes in the united states eia 2021a 3 3 which military installations possess the highest potential for micro hydrokinetic turbine usage despite what appears to be a large portion of conus where streams meet optimal volturnus conditions we initially estimate that only 26 30 of the 672 conus mirta installations possess at least one stream cell where our modeling framework estimates to have optimum hydraulic characteristics for the volturnus micro hydroturbine further we initially estimate that approximately 12 14 of conus mirta installations have at least one stream cell with optimum volturnus conditions for average conditions for all months of the year however the spatial relationship between the nwm grades hydrography and mirta polygons are a defining component of these results the stream hydrography uses a linear one dimensional feature to approximate the spatial location of streams that are in reality dynamic and two dimensional features on the earth s surface this approximation makes the linear stream hydrography an imperfect approximation of a stream s geographic location and extent at global extents stream hydrography are typically derived synthetically using dem data e g lin et al 2021 and although significant reduction in errors have occurred in the citing of stream hydrography misplacement of streams relative to their actual location occurs the mirta boundaries are also imperfect assessments of the installations boundary and are not a survey quality product conflating errors in the spatial placement of stream hydrography and installation boundaries appear to have some influence in the results of our analysis as an example consider the nwm results at fort hood pictured in fig 6 the leon river defines a portion of the northern border of fort hood imperfect alignment between the fort hood boundary and nwm hydrography results in the filtering of stream cells in the yellow polygon that our simulation indicates can potentially support the volturnus hydraulically our initial results are to some extent shaped by imperfections in the mapping of geographic features the result is that we may omit or include stream cells erroneously at installation boundaries shaped by streams or near streams to what extent such errors occur is difficult to quantify at continental to global extents we can utilize the horizontal accuracy of our geospatial of the datasets to create an error buffer with which to assess uncertainty in our results created by the mapping errors in our input geospatial datasets both the mirta and nwm hydrography national hydrography dataset plus version 2 meet national map accuracy standards meaning that 90 of features are within about 50 m of their true geographic position usgs 2022b department of defense dod 2021 the grades hydrography merit hydro derives from 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem data where 90 of errors are less than 12 6 m yamazaki et al 2019 farr et al 2007 the sum of dem resolution and error 100 m is a reasonable estimate of horizontal error for the grades hydrography when applying the buffer we observe some impact on the number of viable mirta conus installations the use of the buffer increases the number of installations that possess at least one stream cell with optimum hydraulic characteristics for the volturnus increases from 26 30 to 38 40 conus installations our estimate of conus mirta polygons have at least one stream cell with optimum volturnus conditions for average conditions for all months of the year increases to 12 14 to 19 20 conus installations thus it appears that positional errors may influence the results of our analysis as the number of installations with at least one stream cell with optimum hydraulic characteristic for volturnus increased by 33 46 and those will optimum volturnus conditions for average conditions for all months increased by 43 58 among the conus mirta locations with optimum volturnus stream cells the volume of stream cells at each installation varies by location and time the variety of results influences the likelihood of locating a viable site for deploying the volturnus at any given time of the year fig 7 illustrates the interplay between the volume of stream cells with optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions and the monthly volatility in the number of stream cells with optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions in fig 7 we measure volume by summing the total number of stream cells with optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions for all months of the year for each conus installation we measure monthly volatility by computing the coefficient of variation cv for each conus installation using eq 1 1 cv œÉ m Œº m in eq 1 œÉm is the standard deviation of the monthly number of stream cells meeting the optimum volturnus hydraulic constraints at each installation and ¬µm is the monthly mean number of stream locations meeting the volturnus optimum hydraulic constraints for each installation the result is a scatterplot for each nwm and grades analysis with and without the buffers conus installations near the bottom right corner of each plot are relatively qualified volturnus installations as the coefficient of variation is low representing a relatively low volatility in the number of optimum stream cells at the installation each month and a relatively large volume of stream cells in all four plots in fig 7 we see two installations that are consistently outliers in the bottom right corner of each scatterplot fort knox and national guard ng camp dodge johnston training site ts the result indicates that both locations are among the best locations for deployment of the volturnus unit thus while we do see an increase in the total number of conus military installations when we include the error buffer we don t see a substantial influence on the preeminent installations with the greatest micro hydrokinetic potential much of the salt river and a major tributary to the salt river rolling fork that run through fort knox are deemed viable for the volturnus to operate by both of our modeling runs fig 8a depicts the location of these streams within the fort knox mirta boundary because these streams run through the middle of fort knox the installation provides the advantage of multiple access points as both streams are encompassed by the installation and unimpeded by private land through inspection of cross sections of the salt river taken during inspection of one of the fort knox bridges gawel and barkuloo 2022 the channel profile both upstream and downstream of the bridge appear to align with the parabolic channel profile assumptions that are used in the autoroute model giving us some confidence in the bathymetric assumptions at fort knox however discussions with facilities management personnel at fort knox also highlight characteristics that may restrict the use of the volturnus and could challenge our modeling results fort knox routinely hosts live fire exercises that could impede access to sites chosen for deployment of the volturnus hydraulically the salt river drains into the ohio river see fig 8a and is periodically subject to backwater effects from the ohio river hydrologically the salt river and rolling fork are also regarded as flashy streams by the installation managers with steep increases in stream stage following flow generating rainfall events the modeling we undertake in this study does not consider either backwater or wet weather influences on the hydraulic characteristics of streams and may challenge our fort knox modeling results at ng camp dodge johnston ts both the nwm and grades results deem the des moines river a suitable location to deploy the volturnus during average conditions fig 8b illustrates the location of the des moines in relation to ng camp dodge johnston ts ng camp dodge johnston ts is co located with saylorville lake a multipurpose u s army corps of engineers usace reservoir usace 2019 2023 that impounds a large portion of the des moines river that runs through ng camp dodge johnston ts our modeling results indicate potential for the des moines to support operation of the volturnus both upstream and downstream of saylorville lake downstream of saylorville lake regulated outflow from the reservoir can provide more predictable flows that are not as influenced by wet or dry conditions as naturalized flows are enhancing the use of the stream as a host for the volturnus in fact because of the perceived ability of the des moines to support the volturnus saylorville lake may also provide a case study location of how hydrokinetic turbines could retrofit a non powered dam however physically accessing the section of the des moines river that flows through ng camp dodge johnston ts may be difficult given that the boundaries of the installation tend to encompass the stream channel itself but not the surrounding land access to these locations would require coordination with surrounding private landowners who would need to grant access to the stream from their property both installations where our modeling results predict suitable hydraulic characteristics for the volturnus present both opportunities and challenges that will ultimately impact each locations suitability this process of evaluating different geographic extents is reproducible for different administrative boundaries the evaluation could extend into examining the potential of countries states countries or other administrative divisions to harvest hydrokinetic power the process could allow governments and policy makers the ability to make quantified judgements about supporting these technology in particular geographic regions and compare this to traditional means of harvesting hydropower 3 4 if the hydraulic constraints of a micro hydrokinetic turbine are increased or decreased which would provide the greatest increase in conus micro hydrokinetic potential with a defined operational context for the current volturnus unit across conus and conus mirta installations we now seek to offer preliminary sensitivity analysis of optimum hydraulic conditions for micro hydrokinetic turbines by expanding the limits of the volturnus for instance if we expand the velocity the volturnus velocity constraints of 1 5 3 0 m s 1 to 1 0 3 0 m s 1 by lowering the minimum velocity threshold does that lead to an appreciable increase in the volume of locations where the turbine best operates providing an initial probe into these questions can highlight how our analysis may guide additional refinement of the volturnus by assisting the developers in understanding how they may best expand the geographic scope at which the volturnus operates optimally table 1 describes how various changes to the volturnus optimum hydraulic constraints affects the volume of stream cells that possess those optimum hydraulic conditions table 1 values are an average for all months of the year in table 1 we see that decreasing the minimum velocity and minimum depth constraints roughly doubles the number of locations where the volturnus could operate optimally in conus we also see that increasing the maximum velocity maximum depth and minimum top width constraints has little impact on the proportion of locations that provide optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus thus we can see that lowering the minimum velocity and depth thresholds of the optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus could significantly expand the geographic range of the volturnus likewise expanding other operational hydraulic constraints offers little expansion of geographic coverage this could offer the volturnus developers initial insight into how prioritize additional development of the volturnus 4 discussion 4 1 previous estimates of conus theoretical and recoverable hydrokinetic resources epri 2012 and ridgill et al 2021 previously computed twh per yr estimates of theoretical hydrokinetic power for conus streams with mean daily streamflow 28 m3 s 1 and found that between 1146 and 1350 twh per yr of theoretical hydrokinetic resources are available to conus epri 2012 using the same discharge filter estimates that 99 4 twh per yr were recoverable not using the same discharge filter ridgill et al 2021 estimate that 580 twh per yr are recoverable in the united states translating our kwh per week estimate to twh per year we estimate that between 11 7 and 28 3 twh per yr of hydrokinetic resources are recoverable to conus using the volturnus our estimate of practical hydrokinetic resource availability is roughly two orders of magnitude less than the epri 2012 and ridgill et al 2021 theoretical estimates for conus and 2 28 of their estimates of recoverable hydropower for conus the lower resource availability as compared to previous conus theoretical and recoverable or practical estimates of hydropower likely reflects our use of local hydraulic constraints of our exemplar micro hydrokinetic turbine the volturnus bothepri 2012 and ridgill et al 2021 derive a recovery factor to estimate the proportion of recoverable hydropower for conus however neither study utilizes the local hydraulic constraints to estimate recoverable hydropower instead relying upon generalizations the epri 2012 recoverability factor is a function of stream discharge and slope derived using a generalized hydraulic model with various configurations of discharge slope and turbine presence in the hydraulic model with v shaped cross sections along with specific depth and velocity constraints ridgill et al 2021 multiplied their theoretical conus estimate by 20 to estimate recoverable hydropower and note the crudeness of this recoverable or practical estimate of power generation at a conus scale our study appears to indicate that previous estimates of the proportion of recoverable hydropower using hydrokinetic turbines is lower when accounting for the local hydraulic conditions we estimate for conus in a further geographic downscaling epri 2012 assessed their findings at roughly a regional two digit hydrologic unit code huc level to further our comparison to the epri 2012 results we perform the same regionalization and average our monthly results for each conus two digit huc note that for simlicity we aggregate the epri 2012 results in the upper and lower missouri into the missouri two digit huc table 2 depicts the comparison in this discretization we see that regional hydropower potential estimates can vary widely by region between epri 2012 results and our own the most notable of these differences is the lower mississippi where epri 2012 estimates that 57 4 twh per yr are recoverable while our estimates are between 0 6 and 1 2 twh per year or roughly 2 of those estimated by epri 2012 the main driver still appears to be the use of a recovery factor for epri 2012 and our use of local topographic and hydraulic constraints of the volturnus regions that are driving major differences between epri 2012 and our study include the ohio upper mississippi lower mississippi missouri lower colorado and pacific northwest these regions all include large rivers such as the ohio mississippi colorado and columbia rivers that epri 2012 includes in their list of top theoretical hydropower producing streams the voltunus hydraulic constraints we utilize tend to not to allow for the operation of the volturnus on most segments of these large rivers particularly in the downstream regions where epri 2012 estimates there to be recoverable hydropower thus we speculate that the largest differences in epri 2012 regional hydrokinetic power estimates and our studies regional kinetic hydropower estimates is epri 2012 allowing for the harvesting of kinetic hydropower on these large rivers where our study tends to deem the volturnus inoperable for large portions of these streams 4 2 study limitations and future work like most previous studies of hydrokinetic potential for continental and global spatial extents e g epri 2012 ridgill et al 2021 2022 this study does not include a field validation component the authors intend to use the process of defining the conus military installations that have the most robust microhydro potential as a means of both evaluating the volturnus turbine and evaluating the accuracy of our analysis in this study as a future next step field assessment and validation of the hydrologic and hydraulic modeling we deploy in this study is a critical in the analysis of hydrokinetic power potential at continental extents the field evaluation should expose the critical weaknesses of our study one of the perceived weaknesses in this study that is likely to alter our results is the employment of simplified hydrologic and hydraulic modeling whose assumptions are primarily less effective in low gradient and coastal regions because of the modeling chains inability to estimate backwater effects follum et al 2016 2020 backwater effects can also occur at stream confluences conus scale hydraulic modeling frameworks with higher physical fidelity have been developed for analyzing flood hazard risk bates et al 2021 application of similar frameworks for studying hydrokinetic power potential at continental to global extents may better represent hydraulic characteristics for streams however existing continental and global scale hydraulic models regardless of model fidelity tend to lack a measured bathymetry and must approximate the bathymetry our simplified hydraulic modeling must also estimate a bathymetric profile at all locations due to the lack of bathymetry for a significant portion of conus zheng et al 2018 and global neal et al 2021 gutenson et al 2018 dems because our bathymetry is approximate and likely plays a significant role in determining a stream cells hydraulic characteristics future study should investigate the uncertainty that this input injects into the modeling chain and should continue to devise improved ways of estimating bathymetry accurate characterization of stream channel bathymetry will remain a challenge in effectively and accurately estimating hydrokinetic power potential at large spatial extents because measurements of bathymetry will remain unavailable for most streams for the foreseeable future another topic of further investigation should be incorporation of additional suitability characteristics for instance when analyzing the suitability of stream cells the current study does not consider ingress egress into the waterway nor do we consider riverbed material furthermore we do not consider wet or dry hydrologic conditions which may affect each stream cells suitability for the volturnus and other hydrokinetic turbines stream accessibility and the impact of wet dry conditions are also potential criteria for evaluating a stream cell location for micro hydrokinetic potential an unknown amount of stream cells that this study deems suitable may not be so because access to the stream is restricted by vegetation streambank slopes the built environment or bedload material 5 conclusions in this article the authors present a new methodology for a practical evaluation of micro hydrokinetic turbines we utilize verterra energy s voltunus turbine to illustrate the evaluation process and we restrict our initial geographic scope to conus we use the monthly average streamflow from two different continental scale hydrologic models nwm version 2 1 and grades version 0 1 to feed into a continental scale hydraulic model autoroute version 2 0 0 0 utilizing the operational constraints of the volturnus we estimate the volume of stream locations stream cells that provide the optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus in conus we further determine which conus military installations possess the greatest potential for utilizing the volturnus turbine to generate power by comparing the total number of locations with optimum hydraulic conditions and monthly variation in the number of locations with optimum hydraulic conditions across conus we determine that much of the eastern half of conus possesses some stream locations with optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus and we find the highest concentrations of locations with optimum volturnus conditions to be along the northern pacific coast although we find that less than 1 of conus streams locations possess the optimum conditions for volturnus for any given month of the year this percentage represents roughly 400 000 900 000 locations under average streamflow conditions generating between 224 and 544 million kwh per week or enough energy to power between 1 1 and 2 6 million average american single family houses this assessment of conus hydrokinetic resource availability is roughly two orders of magnitude less than previous assessments of conus theoretical hydrokinetic potential epri 2012 ridgill et al 2021 for conus as compared to existing practical assessments of conus hydrokinetic potential epri 2012 ridgill et al 2021 we estimate about 2 28 of those studies estimates of recoverable power totals for conus we speculate that because our assessment accounts for local hydraulic constraints depth velocity and top width when estimating recoverable hydrokinetic power previous estimates of recoverable hydropower are higher than our study indicates discrepancies between epri 2012 and our results appear most prominent in regions where epri 2012 allows for recovery of hydropower at large powerful rivers in which the voltunus cannot operate depending upon the density of the stream network hydrography used in the hydrologic and hydraulic modeling streams where the volturnus can operate are predominantly stream order 3 6 grades or 5 7 nwm and for a variety of upstream drainage areas utilizing the mirta database of conus military installation boundaries we further demonstrate how administrative boundaries are useful in further honing an assessment of micro hydrokinetic potential our analysis finds that approximately 26 40 conus installations possess streams that are sometimes capable of producing optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions and 12 20 of those military installations possess optimum hydraulic conditions for the volturnus year round under average streamflow conditions among those locations we find that two conus installations fort knox and ng camp dodge johnston ts possess the greatest potential to utilize the volturnus this potential for utilizing the volturnus comes from a relatively large volume of summed monthly stream cells with optimum volturnus hydraulic conditions and a low monthly cv indicating a high number of stream locations possess optimum hydraulic conditions with relatively small variation on an average monthly basis both fort knox and ng camp dodge johnston ts possess perceived opportunities and challenges when it comes to the deployment of the volturnus and reliability of our modeling assumptions with a defined operational context for the volturnus we then turn our analysis towards an initial sensitivity investigation to understand how expanding the optimum hydraulic constraints of the volturnus affects the proportion of stream cells that can provide those optimum constraints our analysis reveals that decreasing the minimum velocity and minimum depth operational constraints can nearly double the proportion of stream cells with optimum hydraulic conditions while expanding other hydraulic constraints maximum velocity maximum depth and minimum top width of the volturnus offers little expansion of the geographic scale at which the volturnus can operate this analysis can help guide the turbine designers on how to refine their design to best expand the geographic scope of the volturnus this study illustrates how access to the hydraulic datasets such as the one we develop in this study can provide developers of micro hydrokinetic technology and those acquiring micro hydrokinetic technologies an understanding of how designed hydraulic constraints correspondingly impact the proportion of stream locations that the technology may operate in credit authorship contribution statement joseph l gutenson writing original draft writing review editing supervision data curation
