7195,large tipping bucket flow meters tbfs one tip 200 ml have been employed by hydrologists to quantify various water fluxes in a variety of contexts the over arching goal of this study is to develop a generalized correction equation for various tbfs based on our testing we recommend the following to minimize tbf error 1 periodic checking of the static calibration volume c since c is a gauge specific value which has been found to vary after field deployment and 2 for dynamic calibration the use of our newly derived generalized correction equation when the tipping rate is less than 0 2 hz in equation form the generalized correction equation for common tbfs with flat triangular buckets is v 0 75q 2 0 72q 1 r 2 0 843 p 0 0001 where v v c and v is the water volume for one tip under dynamic conditions and q q c s 1 and q is the water flow rate into the tbf from our field test in a japanese cedar forest stand using stemflow s f as an example we found that use of the generalized correction equation was successful in eliminating the 2 3 error in s f amounts moreover we found that the generalized correction equation performed nearly as well as gauge specific derived correction equations thus our generalized correction equation is applicable to correct flow estimates of tbfs when one does not have time and or laboratory set up for the laborious task of testing individual tbfs themselves although our correction procedure may not completely eliminate all error we recommend use of the generalized correction equation for tbfs to improve the accuracy of water flux calculations in hydrologic studies keywords large tipping bucket flow meter correction guideline static volume calibration generalized dynamic calibration equation stemflow 1 introduction a large tipping bucket flow meter tbf is a convenient and widely applicable instrument to measure water flow tipping bucket flow meters have been employed at the scale of square meters to measure outflow from trenches or soil pits excavated in forest hillslopes e g freer et al 2002 kim et al 2005 and from lysimeters e g dunin et al 1988 storck et al 2002 von unold and fank 2008 tipping bucket flow meters also have been used to observe throughfall t f and or stemflow s f in a forests and agroforestry ecosystems e g konishi et al 2006 liang et al 2011 holwerda et al 2012 iida et al 2017 while weirs are well suited for measuring long term water flow from a watershed scale e g swank et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 kosugi and katsuyama 2007 likens 2017 a tbf is preferable for shorter term investigations due to its mobility lower cost and ease of installation in addition tbfs have been used with higher temporal resolution without concern about overflow which can occur when using collectors e g masukata et al 1990 schroth et al 1999 marin et al 2000 macinnis ng et al 2012 it has long been recognized that both tbfs edwards et al 1974 calder and kidd 1978 and tipping bucket rain gauges tbrs e g marsalek 1981 niemczynowicz 1986 habib et al 2001 iida et al 2012 shedekar et al 2016 iida et al 2018 require dynamic calibration for a more precise estimation of volume inputs across a range of inflow rates some researchers obtained the calibration parameters for each individual tbf they used e g calder and kidd 1978 hsu 1990 shimizu et al 2015 while others presented the typical calibration equation for certain types of tbfs e g takahashi et al 2011 iida et al 2012 shiraki and yamato 2004 derived an equation for smaller tbfs with c m 75 200 ml where c m is the water volume for one tip regulated by each tbr tbf manufacturer however for tbfs including larger tipping thersholds i e c m 200 ml a generalized correction equation has not been established due to the labor intensive nature of the task and or preparation of a precise flow control system e g humphrey et al 1997 vasv√°ri 2005 iida et al 2012 necessary to calibrate tbfs with c m 200 ml the corresponding lack of correction equations for larger tbfs has hampered their use another practical issue is the applicability of the calibration equation obtained from a laboratory test to field conditions this is caused by the variation of flow velocities into the tbf which may usually occur in the field while constant flow is supplied in the laboratory test as such it is recommended that the water passed through the tbf be recollected and stored in the field to compare the water mass with that estimated from the tipping record and the calibration processes to check whether large differences have occurred although this kind of test was carried out in some studies e g dunin et al 1988 staelens et al 2006 no comparative results have been clearly presented to date recognizing the need for a generalized correction equation for larger tbfs we aim to 1 develop a generalized correction equation for larger tbfs with c m 200 ml based on results of previous studies and our laboratory test of six additional tbfs including larger c m models c m 500 ml and 2 compare a tbf to field observations of s f to examine the effect of both static and dynamic calibrations on decreasing the measurement error the gauge specific static calibration value c is defined as the tipping volume under conditions of nearly zero inflow the novelty of this study lies in the development of a generalized correction equation for larger tbfs for both static and dynamic calibrations which is currently lacking in the scientific literature and applying the generalized calibration equations to field observation data of s f as an example hydrologic application based on accomplishment of these two aims we describe a simple and recommendable calibration approach for tbf users the results obtained will be of practical use not only to hydrologists who seek to use tbfs with a higher level of confidence but also those who have applied tbfs without considering the potential error caused by neglecting calibration procedures 2 materials and methods 2 1 calibration equations from laboratory tests calibration tests were conducted for three types of tbfs one was with c m 200 ml uiz 200 uizin co ltd tokyo japan and two others with c m 500 ml uiz 500 uizin and 500 ml model of yokogawa electric corp tokyo japan hereafter yoko 500 a total of six tbfs were tested which included three uiz 200s two uiz 500s and one yoko 500 among them two uiz 200 s and one uiz 500 were tested twice in the laboratory before field installation and 3 years after field deployment the tests for the other three tbfs were performed only before field installation for the uiz 200 and uiz 500 the heights of the support screws were adjustable and thus c could be adjusted to be closer to c m meanwhile for the yoko 500 the margin for such kind of adjustment was limited i e not within 1 of c m in our case because of the narrow range over which the support screws could be moved the details of the laboratory test are described in shimizu et al 2015 and illustrated schematically in fig 1 the gauge specific static volume c was directly tested for some of the tbfs as depicted in fig 1a while the dynamic calibration test was conducted for all the tbfs the maximum tipping rates were around 0 1 0 2 hz for the three uiz 200 s and 0 06 0 1 hz for the two uiz 500s and the yoko 500 the dynamic calibration tests on each tbf were carried out as depicted in fig 1b with tipping intervals t s measured for 6 8 different inflow rates some calibration equations have been formulated for tbfs table 1 the best fit function and parameter s for each tbf tested in this study were obtained by fitting equations utilized by past work since one of the fitting parameters of the calder and kidd s 1978 equation p ck1 in table 1 is compatible with the c obtained from the static test we compared these values for some tbfs when the static test was skipped once c was determined the inflow rate into a tbf q and tipping volume for one tip v was normalized by the value of c and then the function of q q c s 1 versus v v c dimensionless was established e g shiraki and yamato 2004 iida et al 2012 2 2 field measurement the field experiment was conducted at the kahoku experimental watershed khew 33 08 n 130 43 e located on kyushu island in southwestern japan a detailed description of the measurement plot plot 1 and methods are described in shimizu et al 2015 s f was collected from four japanese cedar cryptmeria japonica d don trees by using 3 cm thick urethane rubber levia and germer 2015 and funneled to a single yoko 500 tbf the date and time of each bucket tip was recorded by a datalogger hobo h07 onset computer corp bourne ma usa with a time resolution of 0 5 s the number of tips and the tipping intervals were utilized for the estimation of water quantities the volume of s f was converted to depth equivalents by dividing the total canopy projection area of four measured trees 21 4 m2 the water inflow through the tbf was re collected and weighed after each large rainfall event fig 2 the tbf and the paired plastic tray was covered by a plastic bag to avoid incoming rain the storage water data were successfully acquired for five periods table 2 without overflow from the tank the average rainfall intensity mm hour 1 was calculated as the ratio of the gross rainfall p in the period divided by number of 1 hour blocks in which rainfall was recorded or at least one tipping was occurred the values of p were measured in a small clearing near the watershed using a 0 5 mm tipping bucket rain gauge rt 5 ikeda keiki seisakusho co ltd tokyo japan with a datalogger hobo h07 onset corp the accuracy of the tbr was checked monthly by using a rainfall storage bottle with a funnel whose orifice area was 705 6 cm2 corresponding to an approximate diameter of 30 cm as the result when assuming c c m and applying no dynamic calibration p measured by the tbr and that by the storage bottle agreed well r 2 1 when the bottle did not overflow and the difference in total p for 3 years was 0 4 the maximum rainfall intensity when the tbr and the bottle values were successfully compared was 117 5 mm day 1 these suggest in our case actual c of the tbr might be slightly smaller than c m and it possibly compensated for the underestimation caused by skipping the dynamic calibration whose effect on estimation of p would be rather small when using a 0 5 mm tbr at least under rainfall intensities around or less than 100 mm day 1 see also iida et al 2012 for each period we compared s f estimated by the collected water with the amount estimated from tbf output under the following conditions 1 setting c c m without dynamic calibration 2 applying an experimentally obtained c value for each tbf without dynamic calibration 3 applying an experimentally obtained c and the best fit equation for dynamic calibration of each tbf and 4 applying an experimentally obtained c and the generalized dynamic correction equation these assumptions were applied for the comparison of total values for the five periods of measurement table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of c and its importance as shown in table 3 the values of c estimated from the equation of calder and kidd 1978 and obtained by the static calibration test were within 0 5 range for three of the four tbfs and within 1 range for the other yoko 500 suggesting that c also can be satisfactorily estimated via dynamic calibration for large tbfs this result was different from that of shedekar et al 2016 they tested three tbrs with c m corresponding to p 0 25 mm and found at least a 3 error between c estimated from the equation of calder and kidd 1978 and that obtained from the static calibration test for uiz 200 1 the difference in c between a new tbf and one used in the field for 3 years was approximately 2 5 which shows the importance of an occasional check of c during field maintenance to ensure measurement accuracy as described above we could adjust the values of c to approach c m for the uiz 200 and uiz 500 while a 1 5 difference remained between c m and c for the yoko 500 this suggests that c of a new and factory calibrated tbf may differ 2 from the c m in the instrument specifications thereby indicating that calibration of c is desirable even for a new tbf 3 2 dynamic calibration and derivation of the generalized correction equation the q v calibration curves obtained from the previous studies table 1 were drawn in fig 3 the q v relation for a tbf with c m 12000 ml which are extracted from the calibration line in fig 6 of edwards et al 1974 is also plotted in the same figure the q v curve for tqx 400 ikeda keiki seisakushio co ltd tokyo japan obtained by iida et al 2012 see table 1 lies in an intermediate position amongst most of the other calibration curves and plots and they are within the 2 range of the tqx 400 curve when q 0 12 even the calibration plots for a relatively large tbf with c 1600 ml calder and kidd 1978 are included in the range the exception was the plots for the tbf examined by edwards et al 1974 whose tipping volume was exceptionally large the results of laboratory dynamic calibration tests are plotted in fig 4 the best fit parameters for each equation form and each tbf are listed in table 4 the q v curve for tqx 400 and its 2 range are depicted as the solid line and bold gray lines respectively most of the plots are within the bounded range depicted in fig 4 a and 4 b these results suggest that for a large tbf with c m 1600 ml at least the calibration equation for tqx 400 can serve as a useful comparator especially when the measurement system is established to have a maximum tipping rate of 0 1 0 2 hz which is the upper range of our calibration tests this commonality might be corresponding to convergence of tipping bucket design this is to say that in profile view the tqx 200 400 and all types of tbfs tested in this study have flat triangular buckets for a schematic of this tbf design please refer to fig s1a meanwhile a higher tipping frequency would occur when an unexpected hydrologic phenomenon such as huge rainfall occurs when q exceeds a threshold of q 0 48 or t 2 4 from the equation of tqx 400 v in the equation for tqx 400 starts to decrease we consider the decrease of v reasonable since we confirmed the occurrence of destructive quick tips when q was entered an extreme range e g q 1 0 although the actual threshold q values could not be fixed from the observation this is due to decreasing tipping times iida et al 2018 and increasing bucket rebound with the kinematic pressure of water flow being larger on the other hand a factory calibration result of a tbf by the manufacturer hyquest solutions 2016 suggested that dv dq of their tbf would not become less than zero when q 0 83 this particular tbf has a diamond shaped bucket fig s1b which is the most distinguishable difference from the common tbf the difference of bucket shape would affect the center of gravity and the tipping time accordingly we have derived the two following generalized dynamic calibration equations 1 v 0 75 q 2 0 72 q 1 for the common tbf with a flat triangular bucket and 2 v 0 5 0 5 1 6 4 q 1 4 for a tbf with a diamond shaped bucket eq 1 is the equation for tqx 400 with its parameters simplified regression analysis between the experimentally obtained q v plots from all the tbfs uiz 200 uiz 500 and yoko 500 both new and used and the values estimated from eq 1 yielded r 2 was 0 843 with p 0 0001 eq 2 is parameterized in accordance with the tbf calibration result by hyquest solutions 2016 as shown in fig s2 interestingly the plots of eq 2 are almost the same as those of eq 1 in the range of q 0 25 or t 4 5 meanwhile for many tbfs the decrease of v possibly starts when q 0 5 as expected form eq 1 therefore eq 1 is satisfactory and applicable when t 2 4 especially when using a tbf with a flat triangular bucket to ensure the best estimates of water inputs it is important to limit the occurrence of short tipping times as t 2 4 and more recommendable t 4 5 by selecting properly sized tbfs for the expected water input for example in the case of this study the observed minimum t was 7 5 in instances where q is much larger than 0 5 and close to 1 researchers are advised to use eq 2 for dynamic calibration to improve water flux estimates the value of q can be obtained from eq 1 with use of the general solution of quadratic equation as in iida et al 2012 substituting v q t and measured or estimated t into the equation the solution of eq 2 is much more complex interested readers are referred to table s1 for enumeration of the real solutions of eq 2 except zero for t 1 0 4 5 for every 0 1 s step 3 3 comparison of stemflow recollected with that estimated from tbf data estimated errors in s f for each period under the four assumptions described in section 2 1 are compiled in fig 5 when applying c c m without any dynamic calibration the total underestimation was 4 note that since c of the yoko 500 was directly tested only once the c value should have been applied for the field observation nevertheless the error was decreased by more than 1 when applying c 507 35 ml as in table 3 even though no dynamic calibration was applied in addition application of the best fit dynamic calibration for the yoko 500 see table 4 reduced the total error to about 1 the q v plots for yoko 500 placed in the upper range of the generalized function line fig 4b suggesting that use of the generalized correction equation enables us to effectively correct the tbfs without a labor intensive dynamic calibration process as shown in fig 5 similar results were found for t f in the field test see table s2 and fig s1 the periodic errors in s f were not strongly correlated with the values of p and the intensity table 2 this may imply that flow rate of s f was limited in the measurement system and did not become drastically large even under large rainfall intensities it could also imply that there are other unknown causes of the remaining error in s f than underestimation of inflow rate although this work has utilized s f as an example it is critical to mention that our calibration of tbfs and the corresponding generalize correction equation is equally applicable to other hydrologic measurements for example freer et al 2002 measured trench subsurface flow in the panola mountain research watershed georgia usa by using tbfs with c m 125 ml and 250 ml in their study the maximum tipping rate for each tbf was 60 70 times per minutes which corresponds to q 1 kim et al 2005 used tbfs with c m 250 1000 ml to measure stormflow from particular soil layers in the upper gray creek catchment in the southern coast mountains of british columbia canada their observed maximum flow rate was more than 1000 liters per hour corresponding to q 0 28 assuming utilization of a tbf with c m 1000 ml the quantitative accuracy of these hydrologic flows whether s f t f supplementary materials table s2 and fig s3 or subsurface flow would be improved by applying the generalize correction equations see eq 1 and or eq 2 4 concluding remarks this study demonstrated the importance of setting the gauge specific static volume c and the applicability and utility of the generalized dynamic correction equation to reduce the error of large tbfs the value of c should be calibrated before installation and at least every few years after field installation since it usually deviates from the manufacturer s specifications given the labor intensive efforts in developing gauge specific dynamic calibration equations for tbfs we recommend that hydrologists and other scientists conduct a static calibration test in the field and apply our generalized correction equation eqs 1 and 2 to minimize gauge error in this study we have demonstrated that the application of our dynamic correction equation decreased the errors in s f by 2 6 while static and dynamic calibrations undoubtedly improve tbf accuracy it is important to note that the observation error was not completely resolved by the static and dynamic calibrations for certain tbfs as suggested by shedekar et al 2016 acknowledgements maintenance of the khew is supported by the kyushu research center of the forestry and forest products research

the kahoku experimental watershed khew 33 08 n 130 43 e located on kyushu island in southwestern japan a detailed description of the measurement plot plot 1 and methods are described in shimizu et al 2015 s f was collected from four japanese cedar cryptmeria japonica d don trees by using 3 cm thick urethane rubber levia and germer 2015 and funneled to a single yoko 500 tbf the date and time of each bucket tip was recorded by a datalogger hobo h07 onset computer corp bourne ma usa with a time resolution of 0 5 s the number of tips and the tipping intervals were utilized for the estimation of water quantities the volume of s f was converted to depth equivalents by dividing the total canopy projection area of four measured trees 21 4 m2 the water inflow through the tbf was re collected and weighed after each large rainfall event fig 2 the tbf and the paired plastic tray was covered by a plastic bag to avoid incoming rain the storage water data were successfully acquired for five periods table 2 without overflow from the tank the average rainfall intensity mm hour 1 was calculated as the ratio of the gross rainfall p in the period divided by number of 1 hour blocks in which rainfall

overflow and the difference in total p for 3 years was 0 4 the maximum rainfall intensity when the tbr and the bottle values were successfully compared was 117 5 mm day 1 these suggest in our case actual c of the tbr might be slightly smaller than c m and it possibly compensated for the underestimation caused by skipping the dynamic calibration whose effect on estimation of p would be rather small when using a 0 5 mm tbr at least under rainfall intensities around or less than 100 mm day 1 see also iida et al 2012 for each period we compared s f estimated by the collected water with the amount estimated from tbf output under the following conditions 1 setting c c m without dynamic calibration 2 applying an experimentally obtained c value for each tbf without dynamic calibration 3 applying an experimentally obtained c and the best fit equation for dynamic calibration of each tbf and 4 applying an experimentally obtained c and the generalized dynamic correction equation these assumptions were applied for the comparison of total values for the five periods of measurement table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of c and its importance as shown in table 3 the values of c estimated from the equation of calder and kidd 1978 and obtained by the static calibration test were within 0 5 range for three of the four tbfs and within 1 range for the other yoko 500 suggesting that c also can be satisfactorily estimated via dynamic calibration for large tbfs this result was different from that of shedekar et al 2016 they tested three tbrs with c m corresponding to p 0 25 mm and found at least a 3 error between c estimated from the equation of calder and kidd 1978 and that obtained from the static calibration test for uiz 200 1 the difference in c between a new tbf and one used in the field for 3 years was approximately 2 5 which shows the importance of an occasional check of c during field maintenance to ensure measurement accuracy as described above we could adjust the values of c to approach c m for the uiz 200 and uiz 500 while a 1 5 difference remained between c m and c for the yoko 500 this suggests that c of a new and factory calibrated tbf may differ 2 from the c m in the instrument specifications thereby indicating that calibration of c is desirable even for a new tbf 3 2 dynamic calibration and derivation of the generalized correction

amongst most of the other calibration curves and plots and they are within the 2 range of the tqx 400 curve when q 0 12 even the calibration plots for a relatively large tbf with c 1600 ml calder and kidd 1978 are included in the range the exception was the plots for the tbf examined by edwards et al 1974 whose tipping volume was exceptionally large the results of laboratory dynamic calibration tests are plotted in fig 4 the best fit parameters for each equation form and each tbf are listed in table 4 the q v curve for tqx 400 and its 2 range are depicted as the solid line and bold gray lines respectively most of the plots are within the bounded range depicted in fig 4 a and 4 b these results suggest that for a large tbf with c m 1600 ml at least the calibration equation for tqx 400 can serve as a useful comparator especially when the measurement system is established to have a maximum tipping rate of 0 1 0 2 hz which is the upper range of our calibration tests this commonality might be corresponding to convergence of tipping bucket design this is to say that in profile view the tqx 200 400 and all types of tbfs tested in this study have flat triangular buckets for a schematic of this tbf design please refer to fig s1a meanwhile a higher tipping frequency would occur when an unexpected hydrologic phenomenon such as huge rainfall occurs when q exceeds a threshold of q 0 48 or t 2 4 from the equation of tqx 400 v in the equation for tqx 400 starts to decrease we consider the decrease of v reasonable since we confirmed the occurrence of destructive quick tips when q was entered an extreme range e g q 1 0 although the actual threshold q values could not be fixed from the observation this is due to decreasing tipping times iida et al 2018 and increasing bucket rebound with the kinematic pressure of water flow being larger on the other hand a factory calibration result of a tbf by the manufacturer hyquest solutions 2016 suggested that dv dq of their tbf would not become less than zero when q 0 83 this particular tbf has a diamond shaped bucket fig s1b which is the most distinguishable difference from the common tbf the difference of bucket shape would affect the center of gravity and the tipping time accordingly we have derived the two following generalized dynamic calibration equations 1 v 0 75 q 2 0 72 q 1 for the common tbf with a flat triangular bucket and 2 v 0 5 0 5 1 6 4 q 1 4 for a tbf with a diamond shaped bucket eq 1 is the equation for tqx 400 with its parameters simplified regression analysis between the experimentally obtained q v plots from all the tbfs uiz 200 uiz 500 and yoko 500 both new and used and the values estimated from eq 1 yielded r 2 was 0 843 with p 0 0001 eq 2 is parameterized in accordance with the tbf calibration result by hyquest solutions 2016 as shown in fig s2 interestingly the plots of eq 2 are almost the same as those of eq 1 in the range of q 0 25 or t 4 5 meanwhile for many tbfs the decrease of v possibly starts when q 0 5 as expected form eq 1 therefore eq 1 is satisfactory and applicable when t 2 4 especially when using a tbf with a flat triangular bucket to ensure the best estimates of water inputs it is important to limit the occurrence of short tipping times as t 2 4 and more recommendable t 4 5 by selecting properly sized tbfs for the expected water input for example in the case of this study the observed minimum t was 7 5 in instances where q is much larger than 0 5 and close to 1 researchers are advised to use eq 2 for dynamic calibration to improve water flux estimates the value of q can be obtained from eq 1 with use of the general solution of quadratic equation as in iida et al 2012 substituting v q t and measured or estimated t into the equation the solution of eq 2 is much more complex interested readers are referred to table s1 for enumeration of the real solutions of eq 2 except zero for t 1 0 4 5 for every 0 1 s step 3 3 comparison of stemflow recollected with that estimated from tbf data estimated errors in s f for each period under the four assumptions described in section 2 1 are compiled in fig 5 when applying c c m without any dynamic calibration the total underestimation was 4 note that since c of the yoko 500 was directly tested only once the c value should have been applied for the field observation nevertheless the error was decreased by more than 1 when applying c 507 35 ml as in table 3 even though no dynamic calibration was applied in addition application of the best fit dynamic calibration for the yoko 500 see table 4 reduced the total error to about 1 the q v plots for yoko 500 placed in the upper range of the generalized function line fig 4b suggesting that use of the generalized correction equation enables us to effectively correct the tbfs without a labor intensive dynamic calibration process as shown in fig 5 similar results were found for t f in the field test see table s2 and fig s1 the periodic errors in s f were not strongly correlated with the values of p and the intensity table 2 this may imply that flow rate of s f was limited in the measurement system and did not become drastically large even under large rainfall intensities it could also imply that there are other unknown causes of the remaining error in s f than underestimation of inflow rate although this work has utilized s f as an example it is critical to mention that our calibration of tbfs and the corresponding generalize correction equation is equally applicable to other hydrologic measurements for example freer et al 2002 measured trench subsurface flow in the panola mountain research watershed georgia usa by using tbfs with c m 125 ml and 250 ml in their study the maximum tipping rate for each tbf was 60 70 times per minutes which corresponds to q 1 kim et al 2005 used tbfs with c m 250 1000 ml to measure stormflow from particular soil layers in the upper gray creek catchment in the southern coast mountains of british columbia canada their observed maximum flow rate was more than 1000 liters per hour corresponding to q 0 28 assuming utilization of a tbf with c m 1000 ml the quantitative accuracy of these hydrologic flows whether s f t f supplementary materials table s2 and fig s3 or subsurface flow would be improved by applying the generalize correction equations see eq 1 and or eq 2 4 concluding remarks this study demonstrated the importance of setting the gauge specific static volume c and the applicability and utility of the generalized dynamic correction equation to reduce the error of large tbfs the value of c should be calibrated before installation and at least every few years after field installation since it usually deviates from the manufacturer s specifications given the labor intensive efforts in developing gauge specific dynamic calibration equations for tbfs we recommend that hydrologists and other scientists conduct a static calibration test in the field and apply our generalized correction equation eqs 1 and 2 to minimize gauge error in this study we have demonstrated that the application of our dynamic correction equation decreased the errors in s f by 2 6 while static and dynamic calibrations undoubtedly improve tbf accuracy it is important to note that the observation error was not completely resolved by the static and dynamic

7196,a rivers longitudinal gradient i e slope is a key parameter in fluvial hydrology hydraulics and geomorphology it affects a multitude of fluvial variables such as flow velocity and sediment transport limitations in river slope data both its availability and accuracy constrain the fidelity of fluvial modeling particularly at larger or global scales traditional slope calculation algorithms cannot accurately predict river slopes as these are based on cell by cell calculation which is only suitable for hillslopes and small mountainous streams this paper presents a methodology for calculating global river slope and a procedure to upscale it for relatively coarse resolution suitable for global scale modeling the methodology is based on a simple principle of calculating slope from elevation depression over the length of a river segment which is automated to allow global scale calculations version 1 0 of the global river slope glors geospatial dataset is introduced and shown to be a step improvement over a previous product nhdplus for the contiguous united states and compares favorably to observed slope data collected from the literature statistical analysis of earth s continents and large basins highlights interesting spatial trends a semi empirical regression analysis between basin average river slope and other basin scale parameters show that terrain slope accounts for 67 of the variability in basin average river slope with average discharge sediment load and basin temperature contributing additional improvements to global predictions of 3 4 and 3 respectively keywords global rivers slope gis 1 introduction river slope gradient is a key parameter in hydrological and geomorphic modeling slope controls the gravitational related factors of water flow and sediment movement in fluvial systems du boys 1879 meyer peter and m√ºller 1948 bagnold 1966 in hydrologic and hydraulic applications river slope is a key parameter controlling flow velocity manning 1891 river slope through its control on flow velocity affects the shear stress exerted on sediment particles and thus their transport rates and mechanism meyer peter and m√ºller 1948 bagnold 1966 slope also controls the gravitational potential exerted on sediment and rock and thus their susceptibility to movement as a result the dominant sediment transport mechanism in steep mountainous streams is typically bedload transport while most sediment transported in lowland rivers is typically in suspension about 90 meade et al 1990 bartram and ballance 1996 it is important to note that these differences in sediment transport mechanisms between headwater and lowland rivers are also driven by sediment size characteristics and local hydraulic and geomorphic processes e g river evolution floodplain erodibility mueller and pitlick 2013 slope calculation for a river reach is simple dividing the elevation difference between the up and downslope points by the length of the reach these parameters can be measured in the field for individual reaches or extracted from a digital elevation model dem and aerial imagery in a gis system for long reaches and even entire river systems traditional automated slope calculation algorithms on the other hand are based on measuring the elevation difference between each grid cell in a dem and one of its neighboring cells in most slope algorithms the adjacent grid cell selection is based on steepest elevation decent d8 algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 more directionality flexible algorithms have been developed over the years e g dinf tarboton 1997 several river slope calculation approaches were developed over the years based on calculating the distance between a river location and a downstream point or the basin outlet e g moore et al 1991 thieken et al 1999 walker and willgoose 1999 olivera 2001 fekete et al 2001 reed 2003 mayorga et al 2005 lin et al 2006 these approaches can be highly inaccurate when based on relatively coarse resolution dems used in regional and global scale modeling as grid cells may represent both the river and surrounding landscape and may not capture small scale meandering slope calculations are scale dependent and are thus sensitive to the spatial resolution of the dem gregory and schumm 1987 snow and slingerland 1987 knighton 1999 biedenharn et al 2000 montgomery and brandon 2002 this poses a challenge for calculating river slopes large rivers typically have a very low local topographic gradient e g 1 10 5 m m for the lower mississippi river nittrouer et al 2008 while small rivers may be considerably narrower than the dem grid cell size as a result the vertical and horizontal resolution of the dem is typically inadequate for accurate calculation of river slope using standard slope calculation algorithms high resolution dems e g lidar based may provide sufficient resolution but are challenging to use for medium and large rivers as the channel width will be represented by a large number of grid cells and thus different slope values which will complicate large scale modeling and analysis here we present an automated method for calculating river slope based on river segment length and elevation depression the methodology is used to calculate the first global river slope layer refer to herein as glors the accuracy of glors is evaluated by comparing the calculated slope against reported slope values and an independent hydrography dataset employing glors offers a first set of river slope statistics at global and continental scales and within large river basins in this paper basin averaged river slope values are used for an exploratory exercise looking at potential causality or predictability of other basin scale parameters e g water and sediment discharge lithology temperature 2 methodology 2 1 river slope calculation our river slope methodology is following hannon 2011 where slope for a given river segment length was calculated using the difference between its highest and the lowest elevation derived from an underlying dem corresponding to its most upstream and downstream locations respectively we apply this method to a global scale stream network and dem to compile glors through an automated procedure using a python script the interval length of the stream network s river segments influences the accuracy of river slope calculation and the resulting dataset spatial resolution longer segments yield coarser resolution while shorter segments are limited by the dem vertical and horizontal resolution stream network layers are typically split into feature segments at river confluences quite often many of these segments will be very long primarily along the main stem of large rivers the glors calculation script includes a feature splitting procedure which splits river network segments longer than a user defined value e g 50 km it works by generating points at the user defined distances along the stream network fig 1 which are then used to add new joints to the original stream network line features the user defined splitting interval controls the maximum reach length the stream network will include many shorter features that originally existed between confluence points the splitting procedure will therefore only affect segments longer than the user defined length while retaining the natural stream network segments which are shorter than the user defined value following the stream network splitting the minimum and maximum elevation of each segment are extracted from an underlying dem the segment lengths are calculated using a gis tool these values are added to the stream network layer attribute table as new fields columns elevation depression is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum elevations for each river segment river slope is then calculated by dividing the elevation depression attribute value by the river segment s length attribute value the stream network vector layer can then be converted to raster layer based on the slope attribute value ensuring that the raster extent and spatial resolution are similar to the dem used 2 2 upscaling using as high as possible resolution of the stream network and dem is advisable for the aforedescribed river slope calculation as these will better capture river sinuosity and in stream elevation we will discuss the importance of these factors later upscaling a river slope layer to coarser spatial resolution is warranted for different applications such as large scale river modeling frameworks e g wbmsed cohen et al 2013 2014 standard gis resolution conversion tools average the cell values of the high resolution grid cells underlying a coarse resolution grid cell fig 2 which will lead to overestimation of river slope this is because a grid cell in the upscaled raster layer is meant to represent the highest order river reach within its spatial domain think for example of a 6 arc min 11 11 km river layer a grid cell with such a resolution will cover with the exception of few very large river reaches not just the largest river in that domain but also many of its smaller tributaries averaging the values of all the fine resolution grid cells will therefore skew the resulting river slope in the upscaled layer as it will also capture and give equal weight to small river reaches which typically have higher slopes to alleviate this problem we develop an upscaling procedure that extracts the minimum value of the underlying high resolution grid cells and uses this value for the upscaled raster layer fig 2 this approach assumes that the lowest slope value in the high resolution layer represents the largest river reach within the coarse resolution gird cell domain while this is a reasonable assumption its simplicity mans that cells at the upscaled glors dataset may not align with the stream network for a specific dem product in some locations users should therefore use caution when using glors as an input dataset for a model stream network based upscaling approaches e g wu et al 2011 dominant river tracing drt approach and the use of e g contributing area or stream order to identify the largest reach within an upscaled domain will be used in future versions of glors 2 3 input datasets for version 1 0 of glors the the 15arc sec resolution 460 460 m shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds dem and stream network were used downloaded from http hydrosheds cr usgs gov index php the 15 arc sec hydrosheds product lehner et al 2008 is available as a post processed continental scale gis file and includes flow direction accumulated area and stream network layers an advantage over higher resolution global dem products e g 3 arc sec hydrosheds 1 arc sec aster as the hydrosheds product is limited to below latitude 60 n we also use the 1 arc min etopo dem amante and eakins 2009 for higher latitudes unlike hydrosheds river network layers are not available for etopo and need to be calculated using the standard stream delineation methodology the file size of these products is suitable for continental scale calculations which considerably simplifies the calculation algorithm but considerably reduce the confidence in the resulting river slope layer for small rivers and streams we will discuss this later a 50 km interval was used to split the stream network features river slope layers using 10 and 100 km splitting intervals were also calculated and found to have weaker correlation to the validation datasets results not shown here 2 4 validation two datasets were used to evaluate the accuracy of glors observed slope values obtained from literature sources and the national hydrography dataset plus version 2 nhdplusv2 layer only observation locations with a drainage area greater than 1000 km2 were used in this study given the resolution of the upscaled glors 11 11 km a total of 34 river slope observations slope measurement of riverbed or water surface were collected fig 3 table a1 from hinton et al 2016 williams and rosgen 1989 graf 1984 knott and lipscomb 1985 and jones and seitz 1979 observation sites are concentrated in north america 29 out of 34 due to the greater availability of data from the u s while not ideal for global scale analysis the u s sites represent diverse river reaches ranging from the rocky mountains to the great plains and the tectonically active alaska through california the dataset also include three sites along the nile river and one location in loire river in france the observational range of river slope values was approximately two orders of magnitudes across the 34 sites nhdplus v2 is a geospatial geospatial and hydrologic framework dataset produced by the u s environmental protection agency mckay et al 2012 it is a geospatial dataset for the continental u s that integrates features of the national hydrography dataset nhd the national elevation dataset ned and the watershed boundary dataset wbd based on the medium resolution nhd 1 100 000 scale nhdplus slope estimates are calculated using a similar concept as our methodology extraction of elevation depression and length of each stream network segment but based on higher resolution dem and more detailed and better curated stream network we compare nhdplus river slope values to glors and the observational dataset the comparison between nhdplus and glors is based on 500 random points were generated along rivers with a total drainage area larger than 1000 km2 the use of random point for comparison is done because spatial mismatch between the two stream networks complicate feature to feature comparison with a reasonable sized point dataset biases in the comparison due to differences in the location of the river feature can be identified by calculating differences in drainage area here points with a difference of 15 were removed from the analysis the nhdplus dataset also includes stream features with a calculated slope of zero or a set minimum value of 0 00001 m m points that fell on these reaches were also removed from the analysis the total number of point remaining after these removals was 173 3 results and discussion the upscaled 6 arc minute glors layer is shown in fig 3 half the river segments have a slope value smaller than 0 0006 m m dark blue color in figs 3 and 4 and the world average river reach slope is 0 0026 m m high river slope values are observed at the headwaters of major river basins these high slope values are expected and demonstrate that the slope dataset is highly sensitive to intra basin spatial dynamics even at this resolution it also shows that the slope values can range by over four orders of magnitudes within large river basins table a2 it is important to remember that while fig 3 may look like a standard terrain slope layer their values and utility are considerably different for comparison we calculated a global scale terrain slope map not shown here based on 15 arc sec hydrosheds and 1 arc min etopo dems using standard d8 slope calculation global average terrain slope was found to be 6 12 m m compared to glors s 0 003 m m 3 1 validation analysis of glors accuracy is based on root mean square error rmse difference in mean values and log log linear regression equivalent to power law regression on the original variables a log log analysis is used given the high positive skewness of the data fig 5 which means that a linear analysis will reduce the influence of low slope values on the regression results as low slope reaches are often associated with large rivers these low values are particularly important given the scale and potential application of glors input to global riverine modeling the results show that the 6 arc min glors corresponds relatively well to observed slope data fig 5a table 1 the correlation between glors and observed data is similar for the 6 arc min and 15 arc sec products 0 64 and 0 63 respectively rmse and difference in average slope are high for the 15 arc sec product by a factor of over 2 these results show that the 6 arc min upscaling not only does not reduce the accuracy of the river slope layer it actually improves it this can be explained by the fact that the upscaling procedure mitigate overestimation in individual river reaches in the 15 arc sec product by assigning the lowest river slope value within each 6 arc min grid cell both products overpredict river slope by an average factor of nearly 2 for the 6 arc min comparison and a factor of 3 for the 15 arc sec layers table 1 overestimations are likely due to under representation of river sinuosity and spatial mismatch in the stream network layer sinuosity can considerably effect reach scale slope calculation due to its effect on reach length using higher resolution stream network and dem will likely reduce this source of bias a dem resolution coarser than the river floodplain can lead to overestimation of river slope as the maximum elevation used to calculate it is not that of the upstream river node but of the surrounding terrain as shown later this issue is expected to be particularly problematic in river reaches confined within steep valleys this source of bias could be alleviated by using a higher resolution dem and as done here a stream network layer which was derived directly from it an adjustment equation was developed to better fit glors predictions to observed values the bias in glors values decreases with slope values fig 5b meaning that high slope reaches require little adjustment while low slope values require a greater one the adjustment equation was developed by fitting a linear regression between the highest and lowest data points an adjustment value of 1 no change was set to the high slope point 0 0041 and an adjustment value of 0 15 was set to the lowest slope data point 0 00018 the resulting equation was applied to the 6 arc min glors layer 1 s a s o 216 84 s o 0 111 where sa is adjusted and so is original river slope values the adjusted 6 arc min glors resulted in similar r2 and rmse as the pre adjusted 6 arc min table 1 but the bias in the low slope values is greatly reduced fig 5c and d and the adjusted glors log log linear trend line now much better matches a 1 1 trend line fig 5c the rmse did not seem to improve because the differences between the two layers in the low slope values which while improved considerably percent wise exert little influence on the rmse calculation the improvement in low slope values reduction of biases from a factor of 4 8 to less than 2 fig 5b and d is a considerable improvement given the intended usage of glors for global scale modeling of large rivers three observation points mid range observed slope values remains with a considerable bias fig 5d these sites clearwater river drainage area 24 000 km2 and north fork clearwater river drainage area 3 300 km2 in idaho and yampa river drainage area 20 000 km2 in colorado table a1 are all within narrow mountainous valleys excluding these three sites from the validation analysis considerably improves the correlation between glors and the observation r2 0 79 for the adjusted 6 arc min product overall no correlation was found between drainage area and bias in river slope calculations for any glors product results not shown here the range of drainage area in the validation dataset used here is between 1000 and 3 000 000 km2 this indicates that river slope predictions within the glors dataset are quite robust for mid and large size rivers but as discussed earlier are much less so for rivers with narrow floodplains glors v 1 0 presented here is based on a 15 arc sec resolution 460 460 m dem we can therefore conclude that the confidence in glors values decrease for river reaches with a drainage area less than 1000 km2 and floodplains narrower than at least 500 m while drainage area is easy to calculate floodplain width is very challenging to estimate at a global scale using higher resolution dems for future glors versions is expected to improve its accuracy and considerably expend its range of applicability particularly for medium resolution global modeling the correlation between glors pre adjustment and nhdplus is mild r2 0 5 n 173 table 1 but show a fairly close 1 1 trend fig 6 b when both glors and nhdplus are compared to the 25 observation points excluding 9 non contiguous u s sites from the 34 observation locations nhdplus resulted in a weaker correlation higher rmse and greater difference in mean from observed slope compared to glors table 1 and fig 6a six 6 of the points have an nhdplus value of 0 00001 the constant minimum value within nhdplus this minimum value is common for large river segments at the nhdplus dataset with nearly half the river segments in the greater than 1000 km2 subset with either nodata 9998 or 0 00001 values this is a major disadvantage of nhdplus excluding these 6 points from the analysis not shown does not improve the regression between nhdplus and observed slope the weaker correspondence of nhdplus to observed slope values compared to glors is likely due to its much shorter stream segments even though nhdplus river slope was calculated based on a higher resolution dem and better curated stream network its high resolution network lead to much shorter stream network segments this means that slope calculations for each segment is more sensitive to the dem vertical resolution and biases this is consistent with our sensitivity analysis not presented here that showed that a 50 km splitting value yielded better results than 10 km in addition to the dem resolution its accuracy is also likely play an important role in the accuracy of river slope derived from it accuracy issues in global dems are well documented particularly for srtm e g rodriguez et al 2006 a number of new high resolution global dems have recently been or are expected to be released e g advanced land observing satellite alos world 3d dem tadono et al 2015 tandem x dem krieger et al 2007 yamazaki et al 2017 generated the merit dem at 3 arc sec 90 m resolution which is based on automatic error correction procedure of two existing dems srtm3 v2 1 and aw3d 30 m v1 these new and upcoming dem products could considerably improve glors but due to their much higher resolution will require considerable enhancement of its calculation procedure this will be the focus of future work 3 2 distribution analysis average continental river slope table 2 and fig 7 range by a factor of nearly 6 between the continents with australia having the lowest average 0 0006 and asia the highest 0 0035 low river slope averages in australia are expected given the absence of a significant continental mountain ranges attributable to its generally older basement geology south america is particularly interesting as it includes both very high river slope values concentrated along the narrow andes and extensive areas of relatively low sloping rivers primarily within the amazon basin fig 3 this contrast results in south america having the greatest variability in river slope fig 7 and table 2 the continents show relatively similar coefficient of variance except for oceania whose river slope values are dominated by small mountainous islands primarily papua and new zealand while average river slope is high variability within the islands is small basin scale analysis reveals a heterogenetic mosaic of average river slopes fig 8 table a2 high river slope basins include himalayan fed and rocky mountain fed basins low river slope basins include northeast europe and central africa rivers of the world s 30 largest river basins three asian rivers indus ganges brahmaputra and yangtze have the highest average slope fig 9 a these rivers are among the world s most tectonically active basins fig 9b demonstrates that there is no direct link between basin size and its average river slope high within basin variability in river slope is associated with rivers draining continental mountain ranges fig 10 central asian basins yielded the highest variability followed by south american basins the most homogenous basins are clustered in northeast europe e g volga and don basins basins with high cv fig 11 include large rivers draining mountain chains and developing extensive floodplains typically these rivers are those draining into the passive margin side of large continental plates 3 3 factors affecting river slope an exploratory exercise was conducted to investigate the potential influence of different factors on river slope by testing the correlation between basin averaged river slope as the dependent variable n 234 and basin statistics mean max std and range of lithology discharge sediment flux precipitation and terrain slope table 3 the goal of this analysis is to identify potential linkages that may lead to broader understanding of the factors controlling river slope distribution at large e g basin scales log converted values were used for both the dependent and independent parameters a step wise multi regression analysis was first used that included all the listed parameters following this initial analysis a semi empirical model not purely based on regression algorithm but also on user knowledge was developed basin averaged terrain slope explains 67 of the variability in basin average river slope table 4 this is an expected outcome given that rivers draining steep terrain have high slopes this suggests that 37 of the variability in basin averaged river slope is explained by other factors the strongest multi regression result with the parameters listed in table 3 adj r2 0 8 found the following parameters as having significant contribution ordered in strength of contribution arrows represent positive or negative correlation tslopemean qsmean tmean qsstd qstd qsmax and pmean the positive relationship with sediment load qsmean qsmax may be explained by the fact that basins with high topographic relief have relatively higher sediment fluxes syvitski and milliman 2007 basin averaged sediment flux in this context can also be thought of as a proxy or indicator of the impact of tectonic uplift rates on river slope the inverse relationship found between river slope and basin averaged air temperature tmean may be driven by the relatively low river slopes of many high latitude basins fig 8 this can partly be explained by the fact that most continental mountain ranges leading to high river slope values are located in low latitudes however basin average river slope does not show a strong latitudinal distribution especially given the low values in central african as well as arctic basins fig 8 we may therefore speculate that temperature s effect on river slope is mechanistic in nature where high temperatures will contribute to higher rock weathering rates and lower topographic reliefs syvitski and milliman 2007 intra basin variability in water and sediment fluxes qstd and qsstd are inversely correlated to river slope high spatial variability in river fluxes is indicative of larger basins which tend to have overall lower average river slopes the inverse relationship between river slope and mean precipitation pmean may be indicative of long term landform evolution efficiency in which greater sediment production and transport enabled by a greater amount of precipitation the correlation between river slope and precipitation was the weakest among all the parameters given the difficulty in demonstrating causality between some parameters and river slope at this scale we propose the following semi empirical regression model based on the above analysis and our general assertions about the underlying drivers and mechanisms that may control river slope 2 rslop e mean 10 11 82 t s l o p e mean 0 86 q mean 0 17 q s mean 0 19 t mean 6 18 the adjusted r2 of this model is 0 76 fig 12 a decrease in parameter estimation as before terrain slope accounts for 67 of the variability in basin averaged river reach slope table 4 qmean contributed an additional 3 qsmean adds 4 and tmean 3 while the model can estimate basin averaged river slope quite well fig 12 its main utility is as an initial framework for exploring the factors influencing river slope beyond terrain slope the contribution of water discharge sediment flux and temperature to the model are quite similar and are marginal causality between these parameters and river slope is difficult to assess at this scale it is reasonable however to speculate that discharge qmean represent the sediment transport capability of a basin which will be inversely correlated to river slope as higher capacity will enable greater rates of topographic degradation the potential relationships between sediment and temperature were discussed earlier 4 conclusions we introduce a version 1 0 of the global river slope glors geospatial database glors is calculated based on a simple principle of obtaining the maximum upstream and minimum downstream elevation of each river segment from an underlying dem and calculating the reach average slope by dividing the elevation range by the segment s length to reduce biases due to the size of the dem cells the use of high resolution dem and relatively long river reach segments are warranted here we used the 15 arc sec hydrosheds dem and stream network for 60 latitudes and the 1 arc min etopo dem for greater than 60 latitude the use of higher resolution and quality dem e g yamazaki et al 2017 is expected to improve the calculation results particularly for smaller rivers but introduce computational challenges for global or even continental scale calculations given the file size of these datasets this will be the focus of future development the 15 arc sec glors product was upscaled to 6 arc min resolution to align it with typical global scale riverine modeling applications an upscaling procedure was developed in which the value of the coarse resolution output 6 arc min in this case is based on the grid cell in the underlying high resolution input 15 arc sec in this case with the lowest minimum value this is meant to capture the slope value of the largest river typically will have the lowest slope within each of the upscaled raster grid cell domain while the results of this upscaling procedure seemed to produce a very favorable output better correlate to observations more sophisticated approaches could further improve glors this will also be a focus of future development efforts glors river slope values were compared to 34 point observations and to the u s national hydrography dataset nhdplus in 173 random locations the 6 arc min glors product was found to have the strongest correlation to observed river slope compared to both the 15 arc sec glors product and nhdplus it was however found to consistently overpredict slope for mid and low values likely due to underrepresentation of river meandering in the input stream network layer an adjustment equation was developed which resolved this bias the adjusted 6 arc min glors was used to explore globe continental and basin scale river slope statistics providing a first of its kind insights into global distribution of river slope river slope values ranged by 5 orders of magnitude from flat coastal reaches of large rivers to steep reaches along continental mountain ranges differences in average slopes between continents were found to be large a factor of 6 and the inter continental variability was found to be associated with the topographic configuration of the continent variability between and within global basins was found to be very high these results demonstrate the importance of a spatially explicit estimation of river slope the factors controlling basin averaged river slope were investigated basin averaged terrain slope was found to be the strongest explanatory variable explaining 67 of the variability this means that river slope at least at the basin averaged scale is not solely a function of the terrain but that other factors affect its distribution our initial analysis found that basin average suspended sediment flux mean air temperature and precipitation and intra basin variability in sediment and water discharge explain an additional 13 of the variability in basin averaged river slope adj r2 0 8 based on the regression results a simpler semi empirical model was developed in which terrain slope mean sediment and water discharge and air temperature are the independent variables the resulting model eq 2 explains 77 of global scale variability in basin averaged river slope causality between the dependent and independent variables is difficult to assess at this scale this exercise was however useful for proposing hypotheses that may explain the relationships identified the inverse relationship between river slope and mean air temperature supported our initial assertion that higher temperature will lead to higher rates of rock weathering which will contribute to lower slopes the positive relationship between average sediment flux and river slope was proposed to be co linked to basins terrain but also as an indicator of tectonic uplift rates inverse relationship to average water discharge was proposed to be associated with basins material transport capacity where higher capacity will promote lowering of terrain and river slopes acknowledgment this project was funded by the national science foundation

7196,a rivers longitudinal gradient i e slope is a key parameter in fluvial hydrology hydraulics and geomorphology it affects a multitude of fluvial variables such as flow velocity and sediment transport limitations in river slope data both its availability and accuracy constrain the fidelity of fluvial modeling particularly at larger or global scales traditional slope calculation algorithms cannot accurately predict river slopes as these are based on cell by cell calculation which is only suitable for hillslopes and small mountainous streams this paper presents a methodology for calculating global river slope and a procedure to upscale it for relatively coarse resolution suitable for global scale modeling the methodology is based on a simple principle of calculating slope from elevation depression over the length of a river segment which is automated to allow global scale calculations version 1 0 of the global river slope glors geospatial dataset is introduced and shown to be a step improvement over a previous product nhdplus for the contiguous united states and compares favorably to observed slope data collected from the literature statistical analysis of earth s continents and large basins highlights interesting spatial trends a semi empirical regression analysis between basin average river slope and other basin scale parameters show that terrain slope accounts for 67 of the variability in basin average river slope with average discharge sediment load and basin temperature contributing additional improvements to global predictions of 3 4 and 3 respectively keywords global rivers slope gis 1 introduction river slope gradient is a key parameter in hydrological and geomorphic modeling slope controls the gravitational related factors of water flow and sediment movement in fluvial systems du boys 1879 meyer peter and m√ºller 1948 bagnold 1966 in hydrologic and hydraulic applications river slope is a key parameter controlling flow velocity manning 1891 river slope through its control on flow velocity affects the shear stress exerted on sediment particles and thus their transport rates and mechanism meyer peter and m√ºller 1948 bagnold 1966 slope also controls the gravitational potential exerted on sediment and rock and thus their susceptibility to movement as a result the dominant sediment transport mechanism in steep mountainous streams is typically bedload transport while most sediment transported in lowland rivers is typically in suspension about 90 meade et al 1990 bartram and ballance 1996 it is important to note that these differences in sediment transport mechanisms between headwater and lowland rivers are also driven by sediment size characteristics and local hydraulic and geomorphic processes e g river evolution floodplain erodibility mueller and pitlick 2013 slope calculation for a river reach is simple dividing the elevation difference between the up and downslope points by the length of the reach these parameters can be measured in the field for individual reaches or extracted from a digital elevation model dem and aerial imagery in a gis system for long reaches and even entire river systems traditional automated slope calculation algorithms on the other hand are based on measuring the elevation difference between each grid cell in a dem and one of its neighboring cells in most slope algorithms the adjacent grid cell selection is based on steepest elevation decent d8 algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 more directionality flexible algorithms have been developed over the years e g dinf tarboton 1997 several river slope calculation approaches were developed over the years based on calculating the distance between a river location and a downstream point or the basin outlet e g moore et al 1991 thieken et al 1999 walker and willgoose 1999 olivera 2001 fekete et al 2001 reed 2003 mayorga et al 2005 lin et al 2006 these approaches can be highly inaccurate when based on relatively coarse resolution dems used in regional and global scale modeling as grid cells may represent both the river and surrounding landscape and may not capture small scale meandering slope calculations are scale dependent and are thus sensitive to the spatial resolution of the dem gregory and schumm 1987 snow and slingerland 1987 knighton 1999 biedenharn et al 2000 montgomery and brandon 2002 this poses a challenge for calculating river slopes large rivers typically have a very low local topographic gradient e g 1 10 5 m m for the lower mississippi river nittrouer et al 2008 while small rivers may be considerably narrower than the dem grid cell size as a result the vertical and horizontal resolution of the dem is typically inadequate for accurate calculation of river slope using standard slope calculation algorithms high resolution dems e g lidar based may provide sufficient resolution but are challenging to use for medium and large rivers as the channel width will be represented by a large number of grid cells and thus different slope values which will complicate large scale modeling and analysis here we present an automated method for calculating river slope based on river segment length and elevation depression the methodology is used to calculate the first global river slope layer refer to herein as glors the accuracy of glors is evaluated by comparing the calculated slope against reported slope values and an independent hydrography dataset employing glors offers a first set of river slope statistics at global and continental scales and within large river basins in this paper basin averaged river slope values are used for an exploratory exercise looking at potential causality or predictability of other basin scale parameters e g water and sediment discharge lithology temperature 2 methodology 2 1 river slope calculation our river slope methodology is following hannon 2011 where slope for a given river segment length was calculated using the difference between its highest and the lowest elevation derived from an underlying dem corresponding to its most upstream and downstream locations respectively we apply this method to a global scale stream network and dem to compile glors through an automated procedure using a python script the interval length of the stream network s river segments influences the accuracy of river slope calculation and the resulting dataset spatial resolution longer segments yield coarser resolution while shorter segments are limited by the dem vertical and horizontal resolution stream network layers are typically split into feature segments at river confluences quite often many of these segments will be very long primarily along the main stem of large rivers the glors calculation script includes a feature splitting procedure which splits river network segments longer than a user defined value e g 50 km it works by generating points at the user defined distances along the stream network fig 1 which are then used to add new joints to the original stream network line features the user defined splitting interval controls the maximum reach length the stream network will include many shorter features that originally existed between confluence points the splitting procedure will therefore only affect segments longer than the user defined length while retaining the natural stream network segments which are shorter than the user defined value following the stream network splitting the minimum and maximum elevation of each segment are extracted from an underlying dem the segment lengths are calculated using a gis tool these values are added to the stream network layer attribute table as new fields columns elevation depression is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum elevations for each river segment river slope is then calculated by dividing the elevation depression attribute value by the river segment s length attribute value the stream network vector layer can then be converted to raster layer based on the slope attribute value ensuring that the raster extent and spatial resolution are similar to the dem used 2 2 upscaling using as high as possible resolution of the stream network and dem is advisable for the aforedescribed river slope calculation as these will better capture river sinuosity and in stream elevation we will discuss the importance of these factors later upscaling a river slope layer to coarser spatial resolution is warranted for different applications such as large scale river modeling frameworks e g wbmsed cohen et al 2013 2014 standard gis resolution conversion tools average the cell values of the high resolution grid cells underlying a coarse resolution grid cell fig 2 which will lead to overestimation of river slope this is because a grid cell in the upscaled raster layer is meant to represent the highest order river reach within its spatial domain think for example of a 6 arc min 11 11 km river layer a grid cell with such a resolution will cover with the exception of few very large river reaches not just the largest river in that domain but also many of its smaller tributaries averaging the values of all the fine resolution grid cells will therefore skew the resulting river slope in the upscaled layer as it will also capture and give equal weight to small river reaches which typically have higher slopes to alleviate this problem we develop an upscaling procedure that extracts the minimum value of the underlying high resolution grid cells and uses this value for the upscaled raster layer fig 2 this approach assumes that the lowest slope value in the high resolution layer represents the largest river reach within the coarse resolution gird cell domain while this is a reasonable assumption its simplicity mans that cells at the upscaled glors dataset may not align with the stream network for a specific dem product in some locations users should therefore use caution when using glors as an input dataset for a model stream network based upscaling approaches e g wu et al 2011 dominant river tracing drt approach and the use of e g contributing area or stream order to identify the largest reach within an upscaled domain will be used in future versions of glors 2 3 input datasets for version 1 0 of glors the the 15arc sec resolution 460 460 m shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds dem and stream network were used downloaded from http hydrosheds cr usgs gov index php the 15 arc sec hydrosheds product lehner et al 2008 is available as a post processed continental scale gis file and includes flow direction accumulated area and stream network layers an advantage over higher resolution global dem products e g 3 arc sec hydrosheds 1 arc sec aster as the hydrosheds product is limited to below latitude 60 n we also use the 1 arc min etopo dem amante and eakins 2009 for higher latitudes unlike hydrosheds river network layers are not available for etopo and need to be calculated using the standard stream delineation methodology the file size of these products is suitable for continental scale calculations which considerably simplifies the calculation algorithm but considerably reduce the confidence in the resulting river slope layer for small rivers and streams we will discuss this later a 50 km interval was used to split the stream network features river slope layers using 10 and 100 km splitting intervals were also calculated and found to have weaker correlation to the validation datasets results not shown here 2 4 validation two datasets were used to evaluate the accuracy of glors observed slope values obtained from literature sources and the national hydrography dataset plus version 2 nhdplusv2 layer only observation locations with a drainage area greater than 1000 km2 were used in this study given the resolution of the upscaled glors 11 11 km a total of 34 river slope observations slope measurement of riverbed or water surface were collected fig 3 table a1 from hinton et al 2016 williams and rosgen 1989 graf 1984 knott and lipscomb 1985 and jones and seitz 1979 observation sites are concentrated in north america 29 out of 34 due to the greater availability of data from the u s while not ideal for global scale analysis the u s sites represent diverse river reaches ranging from the rocky mountains to the great plains and the tectonically active alaska through california the dataset also include three sites along the nile river and one location in loire river in france the observational range of river slope values was approximately two orders of magnitudes across the 34 sites nhdplus v2 is a geospatial geospatial and hydrologic framework dataset produced by the u s environmental protection agency mckay et al 2012 it is a geospatial dataset for the continental u s that integrates features of the national hydrography dataset nhd the national elevation dataset ned and the watershed boundary dataset wbd based on the medium resolution nhd 1 100 000 scale nhdplus slope estimates are calculated using a similar concept as our methodology extraction of elevation depression and length of each stream network segment but based on higher resolution dem and more detailed and better curated stream network we compare nhdplus river slope values to glors and the observational dataset the comparison between nhdplus and glors is based on 500 random points were generated along rivers with a total drainage area larger than 1000 km2 the use of random point for comparison is done because spatial mismatch between the two stream networks complicate feature to feature comparison with a reasonable sized point dataset biases in the comparison due to differences in the location of the river feature can be identified by calculating differences in drainage area here points with a difference of 15 were removed from the analysis the nhdplus dataset also includes stream features with a calculated slope of zero or a set minimum value of 0 00001 m m points that fell on these reaches were also removed from the analysis the total number of point remaining after these removals was 173 3 results and discussion the upscaled 6 arc minute glors layer is shown in fig 3 half the river segments have a slope value smaller than 0 0006 m m dark blue color in figs 3 and 4 and the world average river reach slope is 0 0026 m m high river slope values are observed at the headwaters of major river basins these high slope values are expected and demonstrate that the slope dataset is highly sensitive to intra basin spatial dynamics even at this resolution it also shows that the slope values can range by over four orders of magnitudes within large river basins table a2 it is important to remember that while fig 3 may look like a standard terrain slope layer their values and utility are considerably different for comparison we calculated a global scale terrain slope map not shown here based on 15 arc sec hydrosheds and 1 arc min etopo dems using standard d8 slope calculation global average terrain slope was found to be 6 12 m m compared to glors s 0 003 m m 3 1 validation analysis of glors accuracy is based on root mean square error rmse difference in mean values and log log linear regression equivalent to power law regression on the original variables a log log analysis is used given the high positive skewness of the data fig 5 which means that a linear analysis will reduce the influence of low slope values on the regression results as low slope reaches are often associated with large rivers these low values are particularly important given the scale and potential application of glors input to global riverine modeling the results show that the 6 arc min glors corresponds relatively well to observed slope data fig 5a table 1 the correlation between glors and observed data is similar for the 6 arc min and 15 arc sec products 0 64 and 0 63 respectively rmse and difference in average slope are high for the 15 arc sec product by a factor of over 2 these results show that the 6 arc min upscaling not only does not reduce the accuracy of the river slope layer it actually improves it this can be explained by the fact that the upscaling procedure mitigate overestimation in individual river reaches in the 15 arc sec product by assigning the lowest river slope value within each 6 arc min grid cell both products overpredict river slope by an average factor of nearly 2 for the 6 arc min comparison and a factor of 3 for the 15 arc sec layers table 1 overestimations are likely due to under representation of river sinuosity and spatial mismatch in the stream network layer sinuosity can considerably effect reach scale slope calculation due to its effect on reach length using higher resolution stream network and dem will likely reduce this source of bias a dem resolution coarser than the river floodplain can lead to overestimation of river slope as the maximum elevation used to calculate it is not that of the upstream river node but of the surrounding terrain as shown later this issue is expected to be particularly problematic in river reaches confined within steep valleys this source of bias could be alleviated by using a higher resolution dem and as done here a stream network layer which was derived directly from it an adjustment equation was developed to better fit glors predictions to observed values the bias in glors values decreases with slope values fig 5b meaning that high slope reaches require little adjustment while low slope values require a greater one the adjustment equation was developed by fitting a linear regression between the highest and lowest data points an adjustment value of 1 no change was set to the high slope point 0 0041 and an adjustment value of 0 15 was set to the lowest slope data point 0 00018 the resulting equation was applied to the 6 arc min glors layer 1 s a s o 216 84 s o 0 111 where sa is adjusted and so is original river slope values the adjusted 6 arc min glors resulted in similar r2 and rmse as the pre adjusted 6 arc min table 1 but the bias in the low slope values is greatly reduced fig 5c and d and the adjusted glors log log linear trend line now much better matches a 1 1 trend line fig 5c the rmse did not seem to improve because the differences between the two layers in the low slope values which while improved considerably percent wise exert little influence on the rmse calculation the improvement in low slope values reduction of biases from a factor of 4 8 to less than 2 fig 5b and d is a considerable improvement given the intended usage of glors for global scale modeling of large rivers three observation points mid range observed slope values remains with a considerable bias fig 5d these sites clearwater river drainage area 24 000 km2 and north fork clearwater river drainage area 3 300 km2 in idaho and yampa river drainage area 20 000 km2 in colorado table a1 are all within narrow mountainous valleys excluding these three sites from the validation analysis considerably improves the correlation between glors and the observation r2 0 79 for the adjusted 6 arc min product overall no correlation was found between drainage area and bias in river slope calculations for any glors product results not shown here the range of drainage area in the validation dataset used here is between 1000 and 3 000 000 km2 this indicates that river slope predictions within the glors dataset are quite robust for mid and large size rivers but as discussed earlier are much less so for rivers with narrow floodplains glors v 1 0 presented here is based on a 15 arc sec resolution 460 460 m dem we can therefore conclude that the confidence in glors values decrease for river reaches with a drainage area less than 1000 km2 and floodplains narrower than at least 500 m while drainage area is easy to calculate floodplain width is very challenging to estimate at a global scale using higher resolution dems for future glors versions is expected to improve its accuracy and considerably expend its range of applicability particularly for medium resolution global modeling the correlation between glors pre adjustment and nhdplus is mild r2 0 5 n 173 table 1 but show a fairly close 1 1 trend fig 6 b when both glors and nhdplus are compared to the 25 observation points excluding 9 non contiguous u s sites from the 34 observation locations nhdplus resulted in a weaker correlation higher rmse and greater difference in mean from observed slope compared to glors table 1 and fig 6a six 6 of the points have an nhdplus value of 0 00001 the constant minimum value within nhdplus this minimum value is common for large river segments at the nhdplus dataset with nearly half the river segments in the greater than 1000 km2 subset with either nodata 9998 or 0 00001 values this is a major disadvantage of nhdplus excluding these 6 points from the analysis not shown does not improve the regression between nhdplus and observed slope the weaker correspondence of nhdplus to observed slope values compared to glors is likely due to its much shorter stream segments even though nhdplus river slope was calculated based on a higher resolution dem and better curated stream network its high resolution network lead to much shorter stream network segments this means that slope calculations for each segment is more sensitive to the dem vertical resolution and biases this is consistent with our sensitivity analysis not presented here that showed that a 50 km splitting value yielded better results than 10 km in addition to the dem resolution its accuracy is also likely play an important role in the accuracy of river slope derived from it accuracy issues in global dems are well documented particularly for srtm e g rodriguez et al 2006 a number of new high resolution global dems have recently been or are expected to be released e g advanced land observing satellite alos world 3d dem tadono et al 2015 tandem x dem krieger et al 2007 yamazaki et al 2017 generated the merit dem at 3 arc sec 90 m resolution which is based on automatic error correction procedure of two existing dems srtm3 v2 1 and aw3d 30 m v1 these new and upcoming dem products could considerably improve glors but due to their much higher resolution will require considerable enhancement of its calculation procedure this will be the focus of future work 3 2 distribution analysis average continental river slope table 2 and fig 7 range by a factor of nearly 6 between the continents with australia having the lowest average 0 0006 and asia the highest 0 0035 low river slope averages in australia are expected given the absence of a significant continental mountain ranges attributable to its generally older basement geology south america is particularly interesting as it includes both very high river slope values concentrated along the narrow andes and extensive areas of relatively low sloping rivers primarily within the amazon basin fig 3 this contrast results in south america having the greatest variability in river slope fig 7 and table 2 the continents show relatively similar coefficient of variance except for oceania whose river slope values are dominated by small mountainous islands primarily papua and new zealand while average river slope is high variability within the islands is small basin scale analysis reveals a heterogenetic mosaic of average river slopes fig 8 table a2 high river slope basins include himalayan fed and rocky mountain fed basins low river slope basins include northeast europe and central africa rivers of the world s 30 largest river basins three asian rivers indus ganges brahmaputra and yangtze have the highest average slope fig 9 a these rivers are among the world s most tectonically active basins fig 9b demonstrates that there is no direct link between basin size and its average river slope high within basin variability in river slope is associated with rivers draining continental mountain ranges fig 10 central asian basins yielded the highest variability followed by south american basins the most homogenous basins are clustered in northeast europe e g volga and don basins basins with high cv fig 11 include large rivers draining mountain chains and developing extensive floodplains typically these rivers are those draining into the passive margin side of large continental plates 3 3 factors affecting river slope an exploratory exercise was conducted to investigate the potential influence of different factors on river slope by testing the correlation between basin averaged river slope as the dependent variable n 234 and basin statistics mean max std and range of lithology discharge sediment flux precipitation and terrain slope table 3 the goal of this analysis is to identify potential linkages that may lead to broader understanding of the factors controlling river slope distribution at large e g basin scales log converted values were used for both the dependent and independent parameters a step wise multi regression analysis was first used that included all the listed parameters following this initial analysis a semi empirical model not purely based on regression algorithm but also on user knowledge was developed basin averaged terrain slope explains 67 of the variability in basin average river slope table 4 this is an expected outcome given that rivers draining steep terrain have high slopes this suggests that 37 of the variability in basin averaged river slope is explained by other factors the strongest multi regression result with the parameters listed in table 3 adj r2 0 8 found the following parameters as having significant contribution ordered in strength of contribution arrows represent positive or negative correlation tslopemean qsmean tmean qsstd qstd qsmax and pmean the positive relationship with sediment load qsmean qsmax may be explained by the fact that basins with high topographic relief have relatively higher sediment fluxes syvitski and milliman 2007 basin averaged sediment flux in this context can also be thought of as a proxy or indicator of the impact of tectonic uplift rates on river slope the inverse relationship found between river slope and basin averaged air temperature tmean may be driven by the relatively low river slopes of many high latitude basins fig 8 this can partly be explained by the fact that most continental mountain ranges leading to high river slope values are located in low latitudes however basin average river slope does not show a strong latitudinal distribution especially given the low values in central african as well as arctic basins fig 8 we may therefore speculate that temperature s effect on river slope is mechanistic in nature where high temperatures will contribute to higher rock weathering rates and lower topographic reliefs syvitski and milliman 2007 intra basin variability in water and sediment fluxes qstd and qsstd are inversely correlated to river slope high spatial variability in river fluxes is indicative of larger basins which tend to have overall lower average river slopes the inverse relationship between river slope and mean precipitation pmean may be indicative of long term landform evolution efficiency in which greater sediment production and transport enabled by a greater amount of precipitation the correlation between river slope and precipitation was the weakest among all the parameters given the difficulty in demonstrating causality between some parameters and river slope at this scale we propose the following semi empirical regression model based on the above analysis and our general assertions about the underlying drivers and mechanisms that may control river slope 2 rslop e mean 10 11 82 t s l o p e mean 0 86 q mean 0 17 q s mean 0 19 t mean 6 18 the adjusted r2 of this model is 0 76 fig 12 a decrease in parameter estimation as before terrain slope accounts for 67 of the variability in basin averaged river reach slope table 4 qmean contributed an additional 3 qsmean adds 4 and tmean 3 while the model can estimate basin averaged river slope quite well fig 12 its main utility is as an initial framework for exploring the factors influencing river slope beyond terrain slope the contribution of water discharge sediment flux and temperature to the model are quite similar and are marginal causality between these parameters and river slope is difficult to assess at this scale it is reasonable however to speculate that discharge qmean represent the sediment transport capability of a basin which will be inversely correlated to river slope as higher capacity will enable greater rates of topographic degradation the potential relationships between sediment and temperature were discussed earlier 4 conclusions we introduce a version 1 0 of the global river slope glors geospatial database glors is calculated based on a simple principle of obtaining the maximum upstream and minimum downstream elevation of each river segment from an underlying dem and calculating the reach average slope by dividing the elevation range by the segment s length to reduce biases due to the size of the dem cells the use of high resolution dem and relatively long river reach segments are warranted here we used the 15 arc sec hydrosheds dem and stream network for 60 latitudes and the 1 arc min etopo dem for greater than 60 latitude the use of higher resolution and quality dem e g yamazaki et al 2017 is expected to improve the calculation results particularly for smaller rivers but introduce computational challenges for global or even continental scale calculations given the file size of these datasets this will be the focus of future development the 15 arc sec glors product was upscaled to 6 arc min resolution to align it with typical global scale riverine modeling applications an upscaling procedure was developed in which the value of the coarse resolution output 6 arc min in this case is based on the grid cell in the underlying high resolution input 15 arc sec in this case with the lowest minimum value this is meant to capture the slope value of the largest river typically will have the lowest slope within each of the upscaled raster grid cell domain while the results of this upscaling procedure seemed to produce a very favorable output better correlate to observations more sophisticated approaches could further improve glors this will also be a focus of future development efforts glors river slope values were compared to 34 point observations and to the u s national hydrography dataset nhdplus in 173 random locations the 6 arc min glors product was found to have the strongest correlation to observed river slope compared to both the 15 arc sec glors product and nhdplus it was however found to consistently overpredict slope for mid and low values likely due to underrepresentation of river meandering in the input stream network layer an adjustment equation was developed which resolved this bias the adjusted 6 arc min glors was used to explore globe continental and basin scale river slope statistics providing a first of its kind insights into global distribution of river slope river slope values ranged by 5 orders of magnitude from flat coastal reaches of large rivers to steep reaches along continental mountain ranges differences in average slopes between continents were found to be large a factor of 6 and the inter continental variability was found to be associated with the topographic configuration of the continent variability between and within global basins was found to be very high these results demonstrate the importance of a spatially explicit estimation of river slope the factors controlling basin averaged river slope were investigated basin averaged terrain slope was found to be the strongest explanatory variable explaining 67 of the variability this means that river slope at least at the basin averaged scale is not solely a function of the terrain but that other factors affect its distribution our initial analysis found that basin average suspended sediment flux mean air temperature and precipitation and intra basin variability in sediment and water discharge explain an additional 13 of the variability in basin averaged river slope adj r2 0 8 based on the regression results a simpler semi empirical model was developed in which terrain slope mean sediment and water discharge and air temperature are the independent variables the resulting model eq 2 explains 77 of global scale variability in basin averaged river slope causality between the dependent and independent variables is difficult to assess at this scale this exercise was however useful for proposing hypotheses that may explain the relationships identified the inverse relationship between river slope and mean air temperature supported our initial assertion that higher temperature will lead to higher rates of rock weathering which will contribute to lower slopes the positive relationship between average sediment flux and river slope was proposed to be co linked to basins terrain but also as an indicator of tectonic uplift rates inverse relationship to average water discharge was proposed to be associated with basins material transport capacity where higher capacity will promote lowering of terrain and river slopes acknowledgment this project was funded by the national science foundation

7197,when restoring dryland ecosystems growing biological soil crust biocrust may greatly change the redistribution of rainfall in layered soils however ecohydrological modelling studies generally ignore biocrust and thus the ecohydrological effects of biocrust on restorations remain largely unexplored using a long term restoration case located in the southeast edge of the tengger desert northern china we developed an ecohydrological model with explicit consideration of the infiltration in three layered soils biocrust shallow and deep sand layers to investigate influences of biocrust on restoration dynamics in drylands the proportion of infiltration that reaches annual grass including biocrust and shallow sand layers 0 30 cm and shrub layers 30 150 cm with biocrust significantly increased and decreased relative to the values without biocrust respectively meanwhile biocrust significantly decreased soil water content in deep sand layer but not in shallow sand layer as more water was used by transpiration than evaporation the ecosystem with biocrust reached a final grass dominated state high grass cover of 40 low shrub cover of 4 rather than a shrub dominated state grass cover of 3 shrub cover of 20 this study suggests that we need to account for the roles of biocrust on rainfall infiltration to better understand vegetation and restoration dynamics in dryland ecosystems keywords drylands long term restoration infiltration ecohydrological model biocrust layered soils 1 introduction drylands cover about 41 of earth s land surface and are home to about 38 of the global population mea 2005 about 10 20 of drylands have been degraded and more are under serious threat of further degradation because of global environmental change and more intensified

biocrust promotes the growth of the underlying soil which is also characterized by a high water holding capacity unless indicated otherwise biocrust also includes the subsurface soil hereafter belnap and lange 2003 li et al 2010 although the thickness of biocrust generally only ranges in millimeters and centimeters it still largely alters the redistribution of rainfall in soil because of the relatively low amount and intensity of rainfall events in drylands belnap 2006 chamizo et al 2016 corradini et al 2011a theoretical and empirical studies have discussed the role of biocrust in regulating the ecohydrological properties of soils in drylands assouline et al 2015 belnap 2006 kidron and benenson 2014 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 xiao et al 2015 overall studying the redistribution of rainfall in different soil layers as affected by biocrust is critical for understanding the vegetation and restoration dynamics of dryland ecosystems bowker 2007 chamizo et al 2016 after restoration biocrust thickness increases gradually and thus the redistribution of rainfall in soil becomes shallower in depth belnap 2006 li et al 2014b xiao et al 2015 therefore more rainfall is redistributed to the biocrust layer and the availability of water to grass shallow rooted increases accordingly past studies have empirically examined the effects of biocrust on the relationships between layered soil water and vegetation after restoration in drylands li et al 2010 liu and shao 2015 for instance li et al 2014b suggested that increasing shallow soil water 0 0 4 m associated with increases in biocrust may be responsible for the growth of grass cover in a dryland ecosystem however theoretically a systematic understanding of the influence of biocrust on the redistribution of rainfall in soil via effects on infiltration and thereby on the dynamics of restoration remain largely limited the minimalist process based ecohydrological model of coupled soil resource vegetation dynamics has been widely used to study vegetation dynamics von hardenberg et al 2001 however these ecohydrological model studies on vegetation dynamics generally ignored biocrust and its role on infiltration and rainfall redistribution table 1 although some studies have implicitly or explicitly accounted for the roles of biocrust baudena et al 2013 d onofrio et al 2015 yu and d odorico 2014a yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a but see gilad et al 2004 whitney et al 2017 while some hydrological models i e green ampt model comprehensively describe the infiltration of rainfall in layered soils as affected by biocrust they are usually not incorporated into ecological processes such as interspecific interactions biotic abiotic interactions and ecosystem productivity thereby limiting our understanding of the ecohydrological effects of biocrust on vegetation dynamics corradini et al 2011b critically minimalist process based ecohydrological models parameterized from adequate field data is still largely lacking in understanding and forecasting the effects of biocrust on soil water balance and then the dynamics of ecosystem state in this study we investigated a long term restoration case implemented in 1956 in a dryland ecosystem located in the southeast fringe of the tengger desert northwest china fig 1 a b shapotou 1991 after restoration biocrust and the underlying soil began to develop on the surface of sand and increased in thickness gradually li 2012 using long term restoration as an empirical case we developed a dynamic ecohydrological model with explicit consideration of the infiltration of rainfall in three layered soils to investigate restoration dynamics in a dryland ecosystem we aimed at increasing our understanding of the role of biocrust on influencing restoration we propose that the succession of biocrust leads to an increase in the proportion of rainfall infiltration that reaches the shallow soil layer and thereby increasing in grass cover then the ecosystem was recovering from the bare state to the steppified desert state dominated by grasses 2 model and methods 2 1 study site the study area locates in shapotou region in the southeast edge of the tengger desert 37 32 n 105 02 e 1330 m above sea level the sand dunes are made up of reticulated chains of barchan dunes and are inclined from northwest to southeast with a relative height difference of 15 20 m the main soils are orthic sierozem and aeolian sandy soil shapotou 1991 the mean annual january and july temperature are 10 0 6 9 and 24 3 c respectively rainfall is the only water source for vegetation and the mean annual rainfall is 182 5 mm the mean annual potential evaporation is 2900 mm the water table is 60 m below ground and cannot be used by vegetation the mean air relative humidity is 40 with the lowest value of 10 the mean annual wind velocity is 2 9 m s 1 and annual number of dust storm days per year is 59 li et al 2014b before restoration the area was covered by psammophytes e g hedysarum scoparium fisch stilpnolepis centiflora krasch and agriophyllum squarrosum moq with cover below 1 shapotou 1991 in 1956 a 16 km length vegetation project was built along the baotou lanzhou railway by planting 1 m 1 m straw checkerboards to prevent possible damage induced by wind erosion and sand burial fig 1c within each straw checkerboard 2 year old xerophytic shrubs were planted artemisia ordosica krasch caragana korshinskii kom and h scoparium grasses were not planted because they initially could not survive shapotou 1991 since restoration the ecosystem was shielded from further anthropogenic disturbances such as fires and grazing shapotou 1991 after more than 50 years the ecosystem had changed from bare soil state to a vegetated state with shrub and grass cover of around 10 and 35 respectively li et al 2014b soil water content volumetric in 30 150 cm below ground declined from around 5 4 to 2 while that in 0 30 cm fluctuated around 3 li et al 2014b zhang et al 2016a 2 2 general model structure soil moisture and vegetation dynamics we used a dynamical ecohydrological model to quantify the influences of biocrust on rainfall

2015 the annual grass layer z1 0 30 cm annual layer hereafter includes two parts biocrust time dependent thickness refer to section 2 3 and shallow sand layers also time dependent the shrub layer z2 includes only deep sand layer 30 150 cm fig 2 zhang et al 2016a soil water in deep sand layer is assumed to be negligible if not entirely unavailable to grasses in this study similarly soil water in shallow sand layer is not available to shrubs either because the distribution of grass and shrub roots dominate in the 10 20 cm and 30 50 cm below ground respectively chen et al 2017 soil water in annual layer is subjected to infiltration f mm day 1 evaporation e mm day 1 and transpiration t mm day 1 whereas in shrub layer it only experiences infiltration and transpiration vegetation dynamics

layered soils under the effects of each other and of the biocrust the widely documented process of hydrological redistribution and its role on shrub grass interactions yu and d odorico 2015 yu and d odorico 2014b was not accounted for because 1 experimental evidence of the occurrence of hydraulic redistribution performed by shrubs has not yet been found in our study site 2 shrub cover was low i e 20 and decreased with time thus having limited capability to perform a significant magnitude of hydraulic redistribution in the landscape scale and 3 grasses were observed to be scarce under shrub canopies and thus its dynamics were not largely affected by hydraulic redistribution performed by shrubs li et al 2014b shapotou 1991 extra rainfall that exceeds the capacity the soil can intercept

soil is subjected to a rainfall event a vertically downward moving wetting front is developed al maktoumi et al 2015 corradini et al 2011a liu and shao 2015 mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 the explicit approach to modelling infiltration is that if the amount of rainfall exceeds the capacity of one layer to absorb water for a specific rainfall event the extra rainfall will infiltrate into the lower layers or produce runoff r given that rainfall amount exceeds the capacity of interception by the three soil layers within each layer a simplified green ampt model is used to numerically simulate the interception by soil corradini et al 2011b heber green and ampt 1911 mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 the redistribution of infiltrated rainfall fi among three layers for a specific rainfall event is described by the following equations 5a f 11 s 11 r r r n 11 z 11 m 11 Œ¥ t n 11 z 11 m 11 Œ¥ t r n 11 z 11 m 11 Œ¥ t 5b f 12 s 11 s 12 r 0 r n 11 z 11 m 11 Œ¥ t r n

i and volumetric soil water content si of the corresponding layers i 11 12 or 2 in drylands residues may also play a role in influencing surface hydrological processes zhang et al 2016b residues generally accumulate under shrubs and some grasses rather than in the interspace of shrubs thus the direct effects of residues on infiltration are limited in most cases berkeley et al 2005 zhang et al 2016b generally in this study residues indirectly influenced surface processes by disturbing the growth of biocrust leading to its absence thus for areas under vegetation only processes f12 eq 5b and f 2 eq 5c were involved meanwhile the thickness of the shallow sand layer z12 stayed constant throughout fig 2 therefore the proportion of total infiltration that reached each layer shallow sand f12 and deep sand layers f2 can be described by the following equation 5d f i g s f i v 1 g s f i b where fi v and fi b denote infiltration terms under and between i e interspace vegetation i 12 2

evaporation in shrub layer when soil water content is lower than soil hygroscopic points sh i the evaporation rate is zero however when the soil water content is higher than soil water field capacity sfc i evaporation rate reaches the maximum efc i mm day 1 for other values of soil water content evaporation rate is a function of soil water content therefore it can be described as d onofrio et al

shrubs respectively 2 6 transpiration in areas covered by vegetation besides evaporation transpiration ti which is a function of soil water content also takes place for both grasses and shrubs however below the soil wilting point of soil water content no transpiration occurs when soil water content is larger than soil field capacity the transpiration rate reaches its maximum value tmax mm day 1 transpiration rate can be expressed by the following equation baudena et al 2007 8 t i s i 0 s i s w i t max i s i s w i s fc i s w i s w i s i s fc i t max i s fc i s i 1 where i 11 12 and 2 2 7 rainfall annual rainfall is simulated as a sequence of intermittent rainfall events with a fixed duration of one day a new marked poisson distribution is applied to produce a specific rainfall event for a rainfall event two key parameters of rainfall frequency Œª event day 1 and rainfall intensity Œ± mm event 1 the latter of which is exponentially distributed with a random depth r are averaged over multiple years rainfall depth can be described by 9 f r 1 a e r a 2 8 model parameterization calibration and simulations the model was parameterized with respect to a long term restoration in the shapotou region with grasses using soil water in shallow layer and shrubs using soil water in deep layer more detailed information about parameter values are available in table 3 obtained from previous studies in the shapotou region and model studies in other regions baudena et al 2007 baudena et al 2013 chen et al 2017 d onofrio et al 2015 li 2012 li et al 2007 li et al 2014b zhang et al 2016a although the growth season of grasses from may to october is slightly shorter than that of shrubs from april to october we assume a coincident growth season for both grasses and shrubs i e around 200 days shapotou 1991 most annual rainfall above 80 falls during the growth season of vegetation during the non growth season it is assumed that there is no change in vegetation dynamics and rainfall recharges soil water according to equations in section 2 4 in this study we used four annual rainfall regimes 1 fixed observed annual rainfall amount with observed rainfall frequency and intensity r1 we produced rainfall events using observed rainfall frequency and intensity until the cumulative rainfall amount reached the annual rainfall in this way rainfall frequency and annual rainfall amount of the simulated time series may be slightly different from the observed values 2 non fixed simulated annual rainfall with observed rainfall frequency and intensity r2 we produced rainfall events with exact values of the observed rainfall frequency and intensity thus annual rainfall amount might significantly differ among cases 3 constant fixed annual rainfall with solely observed frequency r3 we used the exact observed rainfall frequency while tuning rainfall intensity to obtain a fixed annual rainfall amount 4 constant fixed annual rainfall with solely observed intensity r4 we used the observed rainfall intensity and tune rainfall frequency to obtain a fixed annual rainfall amount for regimes r3 and r4 annual rainfall amount may still differ among replications like r1 in evaluating the role of biocrust on restoration dynamics all the annual rainfall regimes were used with time periods equal to restoration lengths only results under r1 were reported because of similar performances among different rainfall regimes in subsequent sections unless otherwise specified we have referred to the r1 rainfall regime furthermore to estimate the role of biocrust on the final state of the restoration r2 was employed with a time period of 300 years based on the recovery of soil physicochemical properties mostly 23 245 years li et al 2007 to initialize the model we set the soil water content in biocrust s11 shallow sand s12 and deep layers s2 to 3 4 and 4 respectively grass and shrub cover to 1 values similar to these under natural conditions and 2 estimated from initial planting of shrubs respectively shapotou 1991 root depths of grasses and shrubs were set to 0 30 cm and 30 150 cm respectively we also tested the cases of simulation with annual and shrub layer to be 0 40 cm and 40 150 cm respectively the results were put in fig a 1 consistent with the general conclusions as discussed here to further validate the robustness of this model to initial conditions we also explored various combinations of different initial conditions of soil water contents 0 s11 20 1 s12 10 1 s2 10 and vegetation cover 0 5 g 5 0 5 s 5 only results based on values for these parameters in table 3 were reported because similar results were obtained from different initial conditions for each simulation with or without biocrust different rainfall regimes 500 replications were used to reduce possible fluctuations induced by randomly generated rainfall events without specific statement we used the average values of 500 replications 2 9 observed data annual rainfall amount rainfall frequency 49 rainfall events one year and intensity mean of 3 72 mm event 1 and maximum of 62 7 mm event 1 of the shapotou region were estimated from shapotou station cern chinese ecosystem research network database of rainfall event records larger than 0 1 mm the continuously observed time series resolution of 1 year of soil water content in both shallow and deep sand layers and vegetation cover of both grasses and shrubs which has been extensively discussed by li et al 2014b were also obtained from the shapotou station cern database although the boundary of the shallow and deep sand layers in the data was 40 cm below ground i e 0 cm 40 cm and 40 cm 150 cm for the shallow and deep sand layers respectively rather than 30 cm in this study we considered it suitable to use the observed time series of soil water because soil water in both depths showed similar average values huang et al 2013 li et al 2014b furthermore to convert gravimetric soil water content in the data to the volumetric counterparts used in this study we used a bulk density of the annual and shrub layers of 1 5 g cm 3 and 1 6 g cm 3 respectively li 2012 li et al 2007 2 10 statistical analyses to assess the roles of biocrust on separated ecohydrological processes i e runoff infiltration soil water content evaporation transpiration and vegetation cover we applied the two tailed or one tailed if necessary paired wilcoxon signed rank test implemented by the wilcox test to these terms with and without biocrust r core team 2015 furthermore we compared the simulated with or without considering biocrust and observed values of soil water content and vegetation cover to test the roles of biocrust using the paired wilcoxon signed rank test to investigate whether there were any significant trends in ecohydrological processes such as the growth of biocrust thickness we conducted the following procedures first we built null models for each process by reshuffling the associated original time series 1000 times second we calculated the trend strengths measured by kendall s tau of each process in the original and simulated time series from null model third we ranked the trend strength of each process in the simulated time series and lastly we calculated the p values as the ratio of the absolute values of trend strength in the original time series larger than those in the simulated time series the significance level was set to 0 05 in this study 3 results 3 1 runoff and rainfall redistribution in layered soils runoff with and

simulated time series reached or almost the final state around year 40 even earlier the grass and shrub cover with biocrust generally performed better in fitting the observed values than those without biocrust fig 6 the final state would be distinct grass dominated and shrub dominated states with and without biocrust respectively fig 6 4 discussion this study developed a dynamic ecohydrological model to investigate the role of biocrust in influencing infiltration rainfall redistribution and soil moisture in three layered soils and the ecosystem state after restoration in a dryland ecosystem in this study we simplified the modelling of rainfall infiltration using green ampt model without considering the explicit moving dynamics of rainfall in soils in this way the infiltration model could be relatively easily integrated with modules of soil water balance to study the role of biocrust on vegetation dynamics in the dynamic ecohydrological model the results showed that biocrust significantly decreased the proportion of rainfall infiltration that reached the deep layer thus causing more rainfall to be redistributed to the shallow layers where only grasses shallow rooted could get access to it giving them an advantage over shrubs thus the transient dominance of planted shrubs ultimately shifted to grass dominance we suggest that biocrust should be accounted for in ecohydrological models baudena et al 2013 d onofrio et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a our results offer an approach using a minimalist process based ecohydrological model of coupled soil resource vegetation dynamics to advance our ability to model ecohydrological processes under the effects of biocrust after restoration of dryland ecosystems to explain vegetation dynamics after restoration in drylands we systematically explored the effects of biocrust on ecohydrological processes related to water flux chamizo et al 2016 li et al 2010 owing to the fact that biocrust increases in thickness and water holding capacity after restoration increasingly more rainfall is intercepted by the biocrust layer correlation between biocrust thickness and rainfall intercepted by biocrust layer kendall s tau 0 87 p value 0 001 which can be used by grasses correlation between biocrust thickness and soil water content of biocrust layer kendall s tau 0 62 p value 0 001 correlation between biocrust thickness and transpiration from biocrust layer kendall s tau 0 80 p value 0 001 chamizo et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 although infiltration that reached shallow sand layer decreased overall soil water available for evaporation and transpiration increased from 0 75 to 1 11 mm day 1 over the whole restoration period for annual layer this pattern is more obvious with the transpiration rate figs 3a 4a as a result of increasing grass cover fig 6a the increased advantage of grasses increased consuming of soil water in the shallow layer thus leading to a non significant difference between soil water content between cases with and without biocrust fig 5a in contrast to annual layer biocrust reduced the proportion of infiltration of rainfall that reached shrub layer because of higher water hold capacity and relatively constant soil water content of annual layer hence there was a reduction in available soil water for transpiration by shrubs fig 3b 4b however transpiration by shrubs consumes nearly all the infiltration that reaches shrub layer leading to a low soil water content of around 1 98 from year 8 after restoration fig 5b therefore shrub cover possesses a death debt and decreases gradually and eventually settles down at around 4 in the long term fig 6b while there is one possibility that the vegetation cover is more related to changes in annual rainfall amount rather than ecohydrological processes associated with biocrust discussed here we built several multivariate regressions the results suggested that rainfall was highly collinear with infiltration table c 1 and including rainfall regression m1 did not improve it actually decreased although not significantly the goodness of the fittings any more when infiltration and soil water were already considered regression m2 table c 1 therefore this possibility can be ruled out as the results of rainfall redistribution in layered soils biocrust significantly altered the vegetation dynamics and particularly the final state of ecosystem since restoration in fact we found that with the effects of biocrust the ecosystem transits from the initial shrub dominated state shrub cover of around 20 and grass cover of around 3 to grass dominated state grass cover of around 40 and shrub cover of around 4 this general pattern suggested in a previous empirical study li et al 2010 could be captured only when biocrust was considered further validating the roles of biocrust in impacting dryland restoration the final state of shrub cover 4 obtained here is a bit lower than the 10 found in other studies for this ecosystem li et al 2010 li et al 2014b we interpret that the transition to a final state i e with shrub almost disappearing usually takes a very long time i e decades to centuries li et al 2007 and thus an extremely low cover of shrubs is not usually seen in empirical studies although zhang et al 2016a suggested a higher cover of shrubs the role of biocrust on reducing infiltration and soil moisture in the deep soil available for shrubs were not explicitly included in their theoretical study alternatively the effects of ants nests on leaking rainfall to deeper soils li et al 2014a and the rainfall anomalies on fostering the transition to grass dominated state chen et al 2018 were not considered in this study the effects of biocrust on the infiltration of rainfall generally depend on biocrust type and soil texture across different drylands in general biocrusts in hyperarid hot drylands e g sahara desert named smooth biocrust and in drylands where soils do not freeze e g mojave desert named rugose biocrust exhibit lower soil field capacity and lower values in thickness limiting their ability to influence infiltration processes and perhaps restoration dynamics e g the final state in contrast to that in mid latitude cool deserts named pinnacled biocrust and that in colder lower pet regions e g northern great basin named rolling biocrust belnap 2006 this ecosystem belongs to pinnacled biocrust where biocrust can play a significant role as shown in the section 3 li 2012 from the perspective of soil texture the effects of biocrust on rainfall infiltration may be more profound in regions with deep layers of finer soils loamy soils than those of coarser soils sandy soils the reason is likely that the influence of reduced rainfall input from upper layers is weaker for the latter because its ability to intercept rainfall infiltration is relatively limited chamizo et al 2016 corradini et al 2011a xiao et al 2016 xiao et al 2015 while our study site has a lower layer of sandy soils and upper layer of loamy soils and biocrust this ecosystem showed a decreased rainfall infiltration that reaches deep sand layer from 0 23 mm day 1 to 0 14 mm day 1 after biocrust developed consistent with the findings of previous studies ahuja 1983 belnap 2006 chamizo et al 2013 corradini et al 2011b kidron 2015 li 2012 philip 1998 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 more specifically this model framework with explicit consideration of biocrust is more suitable for mid latitude cool deserts and for sites with lower layers of sandy soils one should pay attention when applying this model to other situations we also would like to stress that some crucial variables such as soil water content and vegetation cover in this study were monitored annually since 1982 thus offering a unique opportunity for data model inter comparisons these kinds of observed time series are generally lacking in previous ecohydrological model studies baudena et al 2013 d onofrio et al 2015 and their inclusion validates the choices of parameters and more importantly greatly increase the robustness of the modeling results and predictions moreover since restoration the ecosystem underwent succession over 60 years thus largely favoring the testing of the final state grass dominated of the ecosystem after restoration in fact if the data set is short we would misinterpret the transient dynamics of ecosystems shrub dominated as shown in this study to be a stable state when constructing model structures fig 6 fukami and nakajima 2011 li et al 2007 this study has general implications for restoration in dryland ecosystems first the roles of biocrust on restoration dynamics via ecohydrological processes such as infiltration for drylands should be explicitly involved in modelling studies assouline et al 2015 maestre et al 2011 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 otherwise misleading or even wrong conclusions may be derived for instance the initial shrub dominated state appears to be stable without the effects of biocrust but this is actually a transient state as it finally transited to a grass dominated state under the effects of biocrust second while biocrust reduces shrub dominance the increasing advantageous grass usually has higher vegetation cover this shift of shrub dominance to grass dominance reduces the dependence of vegetation on deeper soil water resources that have been largely depleted under a drier climate and increasing influences of human activities i e irrigation and groundwater depletion this sustainable grass layer albeit annual and the capability of biocrust to photosynthesize may help prevent desertification promote restorations and increase carbon sequestration in some dryland ecosystems bowker 2007 chen and wang 2016 ravi et al 2011 third under the influence of biocrust which is usually a slow and long process a long time may be needed for dryland ecosystems to reach the final stable state after restoration thus empirical evidence of low grass cover over a short time period i e within 15 years after restoration does not always mean the failure of restoration projects li et al 2007 ransijn et al 2015 5 conclusions this study investigated the potential role of biocrust on the transition of system state from shrub dominated state to a grass dominated state in a dryland ecosystem we developed a dynamic ecohydrological model which simulated soil moisture dynamics in three soil layers coupled with vegetation dynamics we found that biocrust significantly altered the redistribution of rainfall in three layered soils by intercepting more rainfall in the annual layer biocrust and shallow sand layers thus favoring grasses over shrubs this advantages that grasses gain with biocrust finally led to the final state of grass dominance this grass dominated state has a much higher cover 40 than shrub cover 20 which may better protect the drylands from wind and water erosion this kind of transition to a novel grass dominated state is not found without the effects of biocrust our study suggests that biocrust plays a very important role in influencing the dynamics of restoration and that it is crucial to account

7197,when restoring dryland ecosystems growing biological soil crust biocrust may greatly change the redistribution of rainfall in layered soils however ecohydrological modelling studies generally ignore biocrust and thus the ecohydrological effects of biocrust on restorations remain largely unexplored using a long term restoration case located in the southeast edge of the tengger desert northern china we developed an ecohydrological model with explicit consideration of the infiltration in three layered soils biocrust shallow and deep sand layers to investigate influences of biocrust on restoration dynamics in drylands the proportion of infiltration that reaches annual grass including biocrust and shallow sand layers 0 30 cm and shrub layers 30 150 cm with biocrust significantly increased and decreased relative to the values without biocrust respectively meanwhile biocrust significantly decreased soil water content in deep sand layer but not in shallow sand layer as more water was used by transpiration than evaporation the ecosystem with biocrust reached a final grass dominated state high grass cover of 40 low shrub cover of 4 rather than a shrub dominated state grass cover of 3 shrub cover of 20 this study suggests that we need to account for the roles of biocrust on rainfall infiltration to better understand vegetation and restoration dynamics in dryland ecosystems keywords drylands long term restoration infiltration ecohydrological model biocrust layered soils 1 introduction drylands cover about 41 of earth s land surface and are home to about 38 of the global population mea 2005 about 10 20 of drylands have been degraded and more are under serious threat of further degradation because of global environmental change and more intensified anthropogenic influences mea 2005 degradation adversely affects dryland ecosystem functions and the associated services such as water resource supply water quality and carbon sequestration petrie et al 2015 sala and maestre 2014 yl√§nne et al 2015 therefore it is urgent to prevent further degradation and to restore the degraded ecosystems in drylands rainfall is an important factor and may be the sole water resource for dryland ecosystems d odorico et al 2013 li et al 2014a schlesinger et al 1990 therefore the availability and redistribution of rainfall play a significant role in influencing the dynamics of vegetation and restoration d onofrio et al 2015 li et al 2014b rietkerk et al 2004 among the factors influencing the availability and redistribution of rainfall biological soil crust covering a large part of the world s terrestrial land surface biocrust hereafter may be the dominant one in many cases belnap 2006 belnap and lange 2003 lebron et al 2007 li 2012 biocrust generally has a greater water holding capacity e g over 15 gravimetric soil water content than the underlying sand e g about 4 and thus can intercept more rainfall relative to sand belnap 2006 li 2012 meanwhile biocrust promotes the growth of the underlying soil which is also characterized by a high water holding capacity unless indicated otherwise biocrust also includes the subsurface soil hereafter belnap and lange 2003 li et al 2010 although the thickness of biocrust generally only ranges in millimeters and centimeters it still largely alters the redistribution of rainfall in soil because of the relatively low amount and intensity of rainfall events in drylands belnap 2006 chamizo et al 2016 corradini et al 2011a theoretical and empirical studies have discussed the role of biocrust in regulating the ecohydrological properties of soils in drylands assouline et al 2015 belnap 2006 kidron and benenson 2014 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 xiao et al 2015 overall studying the redistribution of rainfall in different soil layers as affected by biocrust is critical for understanding the vegetation and restoration dynamics of dryland ecosystems bowker 2007 chamizo et al 2016 after restoration biocrust thickness increases gradually and thus the redistribution of rainfall in soil becomes shallower in depth belnap 2006 li et al 2014b xiao et al 2015 therefore more rainfall is redistributed to the biocrust layer and the availability of water to grass shallow rooted increases accordingly past studies have empirically examined the effects of biocrust on the relationships between layered soil water and vegetation after restoration in drylands li et al 2010 liu and shao 2015 for instance li et al 2014b suggested that increasing shallow soil water 0 0 4 m associated with increases in biocrust may be responsible for the growth of grass cover in a dryland ecosystem however theoretically a systematic understanding of the influence of biocrust on the redistribution of rainfall in soil via effects on infiltration and thereby on the dynamics of restoration remain largely limited the minimalist process based ecohydrological model of coupled soil resource vegetation dynamics has been widely used to study vegetation dynamics von hardenberg et al 2001 however these ecohydrological model studies on vegetation dynamics generally ignored biocrust and its role on infiltration and rainfall redistribution table 1 although some studies have implicitly or explicitly accounted for the roles of biocrust baudena et al 2013 d onofrio et al 2015 yu and d odorico 2014a yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a but see gilad et al 2004 whitney et al 2017 while some hydrological models i e green ampt model comprehensively describe the infiltration of rainfall in layered soils as affected by biocrust they are usually not incorporated into ecological processes such as interspecific interactions biotic abiotic interactions and ecosystem productivity thereby limiting our understanding of the ecohydrological effects of biocrust on vegetation dynamics corradini et al 2011b critically minimalist process based ecohydrological models parameterized from adequate field data is still largely lacking in understanding and forecasting the effects of biocrust on soil water balance and then the dynamics of ecosystem state in this study we investigated a long term restoration case implemented in 1956 in a dryland ecosystem located in the southeast fringe of the tengger desert northwest china fig 1 a b shapotou 1991 after restoration biocrust and the underlying soil began to develop on the surface of sand and increased in thickness gradually li 2012 using long term restoration as an empirical case we developed a dynamic ecohydrological model with explicit consideration of the infiltration of rainfall in three layered soils to investigate restoration dynamics in a dryland ecosystem we aimed at increasing our understanding of the role of biocrust on influencing restoration we propose that the succession of biocrust leads to an increase in the proportion of rainfall infiltration that reaches the shallow soil layer and thereby increasing in grass cover then the ecosystem was recovering from the bare state to the steppified desert state dominated by grasses 2 model and methods 2 1 study site the study area locates in shapotou region in the southeast edge of the tengger desert 37 32 n 105 02 e 1330 m above sea level the sand dunes are made up of reticulated chains of barchan dunes and are inclined from northwest to southeast with a relative height difference of 15 20 m the main soils are orthic sierozem and aeolian sandy soil shapotou 1991 the mean annual january and july temperature are 10 0 6 9 and 24 3 c respectively rainfall is the only water source for vegetation and the mean annual rainfall is 182 5 mm the mean annual potential evaporation is 2900 mm the water table is 60 m below ground and cannot be used by vegetation the mean air relative humidity is 40 with the lowest value of 10 the mean annual wind velocity is 2 9 m s 1 and annual number of dust storm days per year is 59 li et al 2014b before restoration the area was covered by psammophytes e g hedysarum scoparium fisch stilpnolepis centiflora krasch and agriophyllum squarrosum moq with cover below 1 shapotou 1991 in 1956 a 16 km length vegetation project was built along the baotou lanzhou railway by planting 1 m 1 m straw checkerboards to prevent possible damage induced by wind erosion and sand burial fig 1c within each straw checkerboard 2 year old xerophytic shrubs were planted artemisia ordosica krasch caragana korshinskii kom and h scoparium grasses were not planted because they initially could not survive shapotou 1991 since restoration the ecosystem was shielded from further anthropogenic disturbances such as fires and grazing shapotou 1991 after more than 50 years the ecosystem had changed from bare soil state to a vegetated state with shrub and grass cover of around 10 and 35 respectively li et al 2014b soil water content volumetric in 30 150 cm below ground declined from around 5 4 to 2 while that in 0 30 cm fluctuated around 3 li et al 2014b zhang et al 2016a 2 2 general model structure soil moisture and vegetation dynamics we used a dynamical ecohydrological model to quantify the influences of biocrust on rainfall

2015 the annual grass layer z1 0 30 cm annual layer hereafter includes two parts biocrust time dependent thickness refer to section 2 3 and shallow sand layers also time dependent the shrub layer z2 includes only deep sand layer 30 150 cm fig 2 zhang et al 2016a soil water in deep sand layer is assumed to be negligible if not entirely unavailable to grasses in this study similarly soil water in shallow sand layer is not available to shrubs either because the distribution of grass and shrub roots dominate in the 10 20 cm and 30 50 cm below ground respectively chen et al 2017 soil water in annual layer is subjected to infiltration f mm day 1 evaporation e mm day 1 and transpiration t mm day 1 whereas in shrub layer it only experiences infiltration and transpiration vegetation dynamics are determined by logistic growth equations with crucial parameters of growth gg gs day 1 and death Œºg Œºs day 1 rates shrubs interact with grasses only indirectly via rainfall redistribution in layered soils under the effects of each other and of the biocrust the widely documented process of hydrological redistribution and its role on shrub grass interactions yu and d odorico 2015 yu and d odorico 2014b was not accounted for because 1 experimental evidence of the occurrence of hydraulic redistribution performed by shrubs has not yet been found in our study site 2 shrub cover was low i e 20 and decreased with time thus having limited capability to perform a significant magnitude of hydraulic redistribution in the landscape scale and 3 grasses were observed to be scarce under shrub canopies and thus its dynamics were not largely affected by hydraulic redistribution performed by shrubs li et al 2014b shapotou 1991 extra rainfall that exceeds the capacity the soil can intercept produces land surface runoff r mm day 1 li et al 2008 the introduction to the meaning and dimension of the variables and function symbols are listed in table 2 the general pattern of the model can be

soil is subjected to a rainfall event a vertically downward moving wetting front is developed al maktoumi et al 2015 corradini et al 2011a liu and shao 2015 mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 the explicit approach to modelling infiltration is that if the amount of rainfall exceeds the capacity of one layer to absorb water for a specific rainfall event the extra rainfall will infiltrate into the lower layers or produce runoff r given that rainfall amount exceeds the capacity of interception by the three soil layers within each layer a simplified green ampt model is used to numerically simulate the interception by soil corradini et al 2011b heber green and ampt 1911 mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 the redistribution of infiltrated rainfall fi among three layers for a specific rainfall event is described by the following equations 5a f 11 s 11 r r r n 11 z 11 m 11 Œ¥ t n 11 z 11 m 11 Œ¥ t r n 11 z 11 m 11 Œ¥ t 5b f 12 s 11 s 12 r 0 r n 11 z 11 m 11 Œ¥ t r n

i and volumetric soil water content si of the corresponding layers i 11 12 or 2 in drylands residues may also play a role in influencing surface hydrological processes zhang et al 2016b residues generally accumulate under shrubs and some grasses rather than in the interspace of shrubs thus the direct effects of residues on infiltration are limited in most cases berkeley et al 2005 zhang et al 2016b generally in this study residues indirectly influenced surface processes by disturbing the growth of biocrust leading to its absence thus for areas under vegetation only processes f12 eq 5b and f 2 eq 5c were involved meanwhile the thickness of the shallow sand layer z12 stayed constant throughout fig 2 therefore the proportion of total infiltration that reached each layer shallow sand f12 and deep sand layers f2 can be described by the following equation 5d f i g s f i v 1 g s f i b where fi v and fi b denote infiltration terms under and between i e interspace vegetation i 12 2 respectively accordingly runoff can be estimated by the following equation 6 r 0 r n 11 z 11 m 11 Œ¥ t n 12 z 12 m 12 Œ¥ t n 2 z 2 m 2 Œ¥ t r n 11 z 11 m 11 Œ¥ t n 12 z 12 m 12 Œ¥ t n 2 z 2 m 2 Œ¥ t r

evaporation in shrub layer when soil water content is lower than soil hygroscopic points sh i the evaporation rate is zero however when the soil water content is higher than soil water field capacity sfc i evaporation rate reaches the maximum efc i mm day 1 for other values of soil water content evaporation rate is a function of soil water content therefore it can be described as d onofrio et al 2015 7a e i s i 0 s i s h i e fc i s i s h i s fc i s h i s h i s i s fc i e fc i s fc i s i 1 where i 11 and 12 in areas covered by vegetation the evaporation rate is reduced because of the sheltering effect of vegetation therefore the realized evaporation rate ei r mm day 1 becomes 7b e i r e i 1 g s e i Œ∏ g g Œ∏ s s where Œ∏g and Œ∏s are sheltering coefficients of the grasses and shrubs respectively 2 6 transpiration in areas covered by vegetation besides evaporation transpiration ti which is a function of soil water content also takes place for both grasses and shrubs however below the soil wilting point of soil water content no transpiration occurs when soil water content is larger than soil field capacity the transpiration rate reaches its maximum value tmax mm day 1 transpiration rate can be expressed by the following equation baudena et al 2007 8 t i s i 0 s i s w i t max i s i s w i s fc i s w i s w i s i s fc i t max i s fc i s i 1 where i 11 12 and 2 2 7 rainfall annual rainfall is simulated as a sequence of intermittent rainfall events with a fixed duration of one day a new marked poisson distribution is applied to produce a specific rainfall event for a rainfall event two key parameters of rainfall frequency Œª event day 1 and rainfall intensity Œ± mm event 1 the latter of which is exponentially distributed with a random depth r are averaged over multiple years rainfall depth can be described by 9 f r 1 a e r a 2 8 model parameterization calibration and simulations the model was parameterized with respect to a long term restoration in the shapotou region with grasses using soil water in shallow layer and shrubs using soil water in deep layer more detailed information about parameter values are available in table 3 obtained from previous studies in the shapotou region and model studies in other regions baudena et al 2007 baudena et al 2013 chen et al 2017 d onofrio et al 2015 li 2012 li et al 2007 li et al 2014b zhang et al 2016a although the growth season of grasses from may to october is slightly shorter than that of shrubs from april to october we assume a coincident growth season for both grasses and shrubs i e around 200 days shapotou 1991 most annual rainfall above 80 falls during the growth season of vegetation during the non growth season it is assumed that there is no change in vegetation dynamics and rainfall recharges soil water according to equations in section 2 4 in this study we used four annual rainfall regimes 1 fixed observed annual rainfall amount with observed rainfall frequency and intensity r1 we produced rainfall events using observed rainfall frequency and intensity until the cumulative rainfall amount reached the annual rainfall in this way rainfall frequency and annual rainfall amount of the simulated time series may be slightly different from the observed values 2 non fixed simulated annual rainfall with observed rainfall frequency and intensity r2 we produced rainfall events with exact values of the observed rainfall frequency and intensity thus annual rainfall amount might significantly differ among cases 3 constant fixed annual rainfall with solely observed frequency r3 we used the exact observed rainfall frequency while tuning rainfall intensity to obtain a fixed annual rainfall amount 4 constant fixed annual rainfall with solely observed intensity r4 we used the observed rainfall intensity and tune rainfall frequency to obtain a fixed annual rainfall amount for regimes r3 and r4 annual rainfall amount may still differ among replications like r1 in evaluating the role of biocrust on restoration dynamics all the annual rainfall regimes were used with time periods equal to restoration lengths only results under r1 were reported because of similar performances among different rainfall regimes in subsequent sections unless otherwise specified we have referred to the r1 rainfall regime furthermore to estimate the role of biocrust on the final state of the restoration r2 was employed with a time period of 300 years based on the recovery of soil physicochemical properties mostly 23 245 years li et al 2007 to initialize the model we set the soil water content in biocrust s11 shallow sand s12 and deep layers s2 to 3 4 and 4 respectively grass and shrub cover to 1 values similar to these under natural conditions and 2 estimated from initial planting of shrubs respectively shapotou 1991 root depths of grasses and shrubs were set to 0 30 cm and 30 150 cm respectively we also tested the cases of simulation with annual and shrub layer to be 0 40 cm and 40 150 cm respectively the results were put in fig a 1 consistent with the general conclusions as discussed here to further validate the robustness of this model to initial conditions we also explored various combinations of different initial conditions of soil water contents 0 s11 20 1 s12 10 1 s2 10 and vegetation cover 0 5 g 5 0 5 s 5 only results based on values for these parameters in table 3 were reported because similar results were obtained from different initial conditions for each simulation with or without biocrust different rainfall regimes 500 replications were used to reduce possible fluctuations induced by randomly generated rainfall events without specific statement we used the average values of 500 replications 2 9 observed data annual rainfall amount rainfall frequency 49 rainfall events one year and intensity mean of 3 72 mm event 1 and maximum of 62 7 mm event 1 of the shapotou region were estimated from shapotou station cern chinese ecosystem research network database of rainfall event records larger than 0 1 mm the continuously observed time series resolution of 1 year of soil water content in both shallow and deep sand layers and vegetation cover of both grasses and shrubs which has been extensively discussed by li et al 2014b were also obtained from the shapotou station cern database although the boundary of the shallow and deep sand layers in the data was 40 cm below ground i e 0 cm 40 cm and 40 cm 150 cm for the shallow and deep sand layers respectively rather than 30 cm in this study we considered it suitable to use the observed time series of soil water because soil water in both depths showed similar average values huang et al 2013 li et al 2014b furthermore to convert gravimetric soil water content in the data to the volumetric counterparts used in this study we used a bulk density of the annual and shrub layers of 1 5 g cm 3 and 1 6 g cm 3 respectively li 2012 li et al 2007 2 10 statistical analyses to assess the roles of biocrust on separated ecohydrological processes i e runoff infiltration soil water content evaporation transpiration and vegetation cover we applied the two tailed or one tailed if necessary paired wilcoxon signed rank test implemented by the wilcox test to these terms with and without biocrust r core team 2015 furthermore we compared the simulated with or without considering biocrust and observed values of soil water content and vegetation cover to test the roles of biocrust using the paired wilcoxon signed rank test to investigate whether there were any significant trends in ecohydrological processes such as the growth of biocrust thickness we conducted the following procedures first we built null models for each process by reshuffling the associated original time series 1000 times second we calculated the trend strengths measured by kendall s tau of each process in the original and simulated time series from null model third we ranked the trend strength of each process in the simulated time series and lastly we calculated the p values as the ratio of the absolute values of trend strength in the original time series larger than those in the simulated time series the significance level was set to 0 05 in this study 3 results 3 1 runoff and rainfall redistribution in layered soils runoff with and without biocrust was always close to 0 mm day 1 except in the first few years and during extreme wet years although there was a significant decreasing trend with biocrust kendall s tau 0 290 p value 0

simulated time series reached or almost the final state around year 40 even earlier the grass and shrub cover with biocrust generally performed better in fitting the observed values than those without biocrust fig 6 the final state would be distinct grass dominated and shrub dominated states with and without biocrust respectively fig 6 4 discussion this study developed a dynamic ecohydrological model to investigate the role of biocrust in influencing infiltration rainfall redistribution and soil moisture in three layered soils and the ecosystem state after restoration in a dryland ecosystem in this study we simplified the modelling of rainfall infiltration using green ampt model without considering the explicit moving dynamics of rainfall in soils in this way the infiltration model could be relatively easily integrated with modules of soil water balance to study the role of biocrust on vegetation dynamics in the dynamic ecohydrological model the results showed that biocrust significantly decreased the proportion of rainfall infiltration that reached the deep layer thus causing more rainfall to be redistributed to the shallow layers where only grasses shallow rooted could get access to it giving them an advantage over shrubs thus the transient dominance of planted shrubs ultimately shifted to grass dominance we suggest that biocrust should be accounted for in ecohydrological models baudena et al 2013 d onofrio et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a our results offer an approach using a minimalist process based ecohydrological model of coupled soil resource vegetation dynamics to advance our ability to model ecohydrological processes under the effects of biocrust after restoration of dryland ecosystems to explain vegetation dynamics after restoration in drylands we systematically explored the effects of biocrust on ecohydrological processes related to water flux chamizo et al 2016 li et al 2010 owing to the fact that biocrust increases in thickness and water holding capacity after restoration increasingly more rainfall is intercepted by the biocrust layer correlation between biocrust thickness and rainfall intercepted by biocrust layer kendall s tau 0 87 p value 0 001 which can be used by grasses correlation between biocrust thickness and soil water content of biocrust layer kendall s tau 0 62 p value 0 001 correlation between biocrust thickness and transpiration from biocrust layer kendall s tau 0 80 p value 0 001 chamizo et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 although infiltration that reached shallow sand layer decreased overall soil water available for evaporation and transpiration increased from 0 75 to 1 11 mm day 1 over the whole restoration period for annual layer this pattern is more obvious with the transpiration rate figs 3a 4a as a result of increasing grass cover fig 6a the increased advantage of grasses increased consuming of soil water in the shallow layer thus leading to a non significant difference between soil water content between cases with and without biocrust fig 5a in contrast to annual layer biocrust reduced the proportion of infiltration of rainfall that reached shrub layer because of higher water hold capacity and relatively constant soil water content of annual layer hence there was a reduction in available soil water for transpiration by shrubs fig 3b 4b however transpiration by shrubs consumes nearly all the infiltration that reaches shrub layer leading to a low soil water content of around 1 98 from year 8 after restoration fig 5b therefore shrub cover possesses a death debt and decreases gradually and eventually settles down at around 4 in the long term fig 6b while there is one possibility that the vegetation cover is more related to changes in annual rainfall amount rather than ecohydrological processes associated with biocrust discussed here we built several multivariate regressions the results suggested that rainfall was highly collinear with infiltration table c 1 and including rainfall regression m1 did not improve it actually decreased although not significantly the goodness of the fittings any more when infiltration and soil water were already considered regression m2 table c 1 therefore this possibility can be ruled out as the results of rainfall redistribution in layered soils biocrust significantly altered the vegetation dynamics and particularly the final state of ecosystem since restoration in fact we found that with the effects of biocrust the ecosystem transits from the initial shrub dominated state shrub cover of around 20 and grass cover of around 3 to grass dominated state grass cover of around 40 and shrub cover of around 4 this general pattern suggested in a previous empirical study li et al 2010 could be captured only when biocrust was considered further validating the roles of biocrust in impacting dryland restoration the final state of shrub cover 4 obtained here is a bit lower than the 10 found in other studies for this ecosystem li et al 2010 li et al 2014b we interpret that the transition to a final state i e with shrub almost disappearing usually takes a very long time i e decades to centuries li et al 2007 and thus an extremely low cover of shrubs is not usually seen in empirical studies although zhang et al 2016a suggested a higher cover of shrubs the role of biocrust on reducing infiltration and soil moisture in the deep soil available for shrubs were not explicitly included in their theoretical study alternatively the effects of ants nests on leaking rainfall to deeper soils li et al 2014a and the rainfall anomalies on fostering the transition to grass dominated state chen et al 2018 were not considered in this study the effects of biocrust on the infiltration of rainfall generally depend on biocrust type and soil texture across different drylands in general biocrusts in hyperarid hot drylands e g sahara desert named smooth biocrust and in drylands where soils do not freeze e g mojave desert named rugose biocrust exhibit lower soil field capacity and lower values in thickness limiting their ability to influence infiltration processes and perhaps restoration dynamics e g the final state in contrast to that in mid latitude cool deserts named pinnacled biocrust and that in colder lower pet regions e g northern great basin named rolling biocrust belnap 2006 this ecosystem belongs to pinnacled biocrust where biocrust can play a significant role as shown in the section 3 li 2012 from the perspective of soil texture the effects of biocrust on rainfall infiltration may be more profound in regions with deep layers of finer soils loamy soils than those of coarser soils sandy soils the reason is likely that the influence of reduced rainfall input from upper layers is weaker for the latter because its ability to intercept rainfall infiltration is relatively limited chamizo et al 2016 corradini et al 2011a xiao et al 2016 xiao et al 2015 while our study site has a lower layer of sandy soils and upper layer of loamy soils and biocrust this ecosystem showed a decreased rainfall infiltration that reaches deep sand layer from 0 23 mm day 1 to 0 14 mm day 1 after biocrust developed consistent with the findings of previous studies ahuja 1983 belnap 2006 chamizo et al 2013 corradini et al 2011b kidron 2015 li 2012 philip 1998 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 more specifically this model framework with explicit consideration of biocrust is more suitable for mid latitude cool deserts and for sites with lower layers of sandy soils one should pay attention when applying this model to other situations we also would like to stress that some crucial variables such as soil water content and vegetation cover in this study were monitored annually since 1982 thus offering a unique opportunity for data model inter comparisons these kinds of observed time series are generally lacking in previous ecohydrological model studies baudena et al 2013 d onofrio et al 2015 and their inclusion validates the choices of parameters and more importantly greatly increase the robustness of the modeling results and predictions moreover since restoration the ecosystem underwent succession over 60 years thus largely favoring the testing of the final state grass dominated of the ecosystem after restoration in fact if the data set is short we would misinterpret the transient dynamics of ecosystems shrub dominated as shown in this study to be a stable state when constructing model structures fig 6 fukami and nakajima 2011 li et al 2007 this study has general implications for restoration in dryland ecosystems first the roles of biocrust on restoration dynamics via ecohydrological processes such as infiltration for drylands should be explicitly involved in modelling studies assouline et al 2015 maestre et al 2011 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 otherwise misleading or even wrong conclusions may be derived for instance the initial shrub dominated state appears to be stable without the effects of biocrust but this is actually a transient state as it finally transited to a grass dominated state under the effects of biocrust second while biocrust reduces shrub dominance the increasing advantageous grass usually has higher vegetation cover this shift of shrub dominance to grass dominance reduces the dependence of vegetation on deeper soil water resources that have been largely depleted under a drier climate and increasing influences of human activities i e irrigation and groundwater depletion this sustainable grass layer albeit annual and the capability of biocrust to photosynthesize may help prevent desertification promote restorations and increase carbon sequestration in some dryland ecosystems bowker 2007 chen and wang 2016 ravi et al 2011 third under the influence of biocrust which is usually a slow and long process a long time may be needed for dryland ecosystems to reach the final stable state after restoration thus empirical evidence of low grass cover over a short time period i e within 15 years after restoration does not always mean the failure of restoration projects li et al 2007 ransijn et al 2015 5 conclusions this study investigated the potential role of biocrust on the transition of system state from shrub dominated state to a grass dominated state in a dryland ecosystem we developed a dynamic ecohydrological model which simulated soil moisture dynamics in three soil layers coupled with vegetation dynamics we found that biocrust significantly altered the redistribution of rainfall in three layered soils by intercepting more rainfall in the annual layer biocrust and shallow sand layers thus favoring grasses over shrubs this advantages that grasses gain with biocrust finally led to the final state of grass dominance this grass dominated state has a much higher cover 40 than shrub cover 20 which may better protect the drylands from wind and water erosion this kind of transition to a novel grass dominated state is not found without the effects of biocrust our study suggests that biocrust plays a very important role in influencing the dynamics of restoration and that it is crucial to account

7198,management of groundwater requires a sufficient coverage of accurate groundwater quality data these data are usually collected from monitoring wells which are spatially distributed in the river basin or the groundwater body that is studied a minimum number of monitoring wells with an optimum spatial distribution is desired to ensure a cost effective observation of the groundwater body therefore the configuration of groundwater monitoring networks and the number of required wells becomes an important engineering optimization problem the goal of this study is to find an optimum monitoring network with the fewest wells that provides sufficient spatial coverage on groundwater quality with the presented method redundant wells in an already existing network are identified here a genetic algorithm ga based optimization approach is used in which each monitoring well in the watershed is represented with a binary ga bit to evaluate if the corresponding monitoring well will be selected for the network the proposed approach can solve the problem by simultaneously optimizing two conflicting objectives the first objective is the maximization of the match between the interpolated groundwater quality concentration distributions obtained using data from all available monitoring wells and the wells from the newly generated network the match is primarily evaluated using the nash sutcliffe ns model efficiency groundwater quality is represented by the water quality index wqi that aggregates several quality parameters the second objective deals with the minimization of the number of monitoring wells in the newly generated network by considering cost related constraints these two objectives are integrated in a single objective function where different combinations of both objectives are investigated by considering two cases the applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated for the groundwater monitoring network of the gediz river basin grb which is one of the most important river basins in turkey findings indicate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of monitoring wells with a relatively small deviation of the spatial distribution of the wqi values also the monitoring network is optimized such that sampling points are removed from less polluted areas and selected in areas with higher pollutant concentrations keywords groundwater quality monitoring network optimization genetic algorithm 1 introduction the planning and management of groundwater systems require appropriate monitoring of groundwater quantity and quality data obtained from this kind of monitoring is typically collected using monitoring well networks which may consist of more or less randomly distributed wells drilled in the studied aquifer system the number and spatial distribution of wells in a monitoring network are important considerations that can affect the outcome of groundwater quality characterization studies the selection of a groundwater monitoring network that is used for groundwater sampling depends on several site specific factors such as locations of already existing wells suitability of a well for groundwater sampling well configuration number and depth of screens accessibility distance between wells number of required groundwater samples and also available budget and time groundwater quality monitoring networks are designed using two general approaches the first is the hydrogeological approach where the design is based on qualitative and quantitative expert judgment of descriptive information by the hydrogeologist this approach is conventional and is commonly used in practice and does not involve any sophisticated methods the second approach is the statistical method where advanced geostatistical methods are used that can be based on simulation variance or probability loaiciga et al 1992 main variables in this method are hydraulic conductivity for the simulation based approach and groundwater quality indicators from monitoring wells in the variance based approach since groundwater quality monitoring in the conventional sense involves going to the site collecting groundwater samples in most cases transporting samples to the laboratory and conducting analyses in the laboratory it can easily become a costly task therefore the number of wells in a groundwater monitoring network must be optimized to facilitate cost efficiency however the optimum monitoring network is not necessarily the most cost effective when more monitoring wells are needed the optimum monitoring network provides groundwater quality data that represents the groundwater body with the least number of sampling wells finding the optimum network can be accomplished by configuring designing a new network or by reconfiguring redesigning an already existing network reconfiguring a network can pertain expanding or reducing a current network which results in either an increased or decreased number of monitoring wells respectively previous studies dealt with the optimization of groundwater monitoring well networks to identify the distribution of contaminant plumes e g chadalavada and datta 2008 kim and lee 2007 to identify unknown pollution sources e g jin et al 2014 bashi azghadi and kerachian 2010 datta et al 2009 to reduce redundancy and minimize cost e g guo et al 2011 dhar and datta 2010 baalousha 2010 wu et al 2005 methods used in these studies vary however most of them are based on nonlinear search and optimization methods used in combination with geostatistics chadalavada and datta 2008 flow and transport modeling wu et al 2005 reed et al 2000 or groundwater vulnerability mapping baalousha 2010 a more efficient network of monitoring wells may be established by evaluating the value of observations measured at each well and the degree to which observations are redundant and then removing low value or redundant wells from the observation network fisher 2013 the study presented in this article aims to find a monitoring network with the fewest wells that provides sufficient information on groundwater quality this goal is achieved by identifying the redundant wells in an already existing network by means of optimization groundwater related optimization problems have usually non continuous and non convex solution surfaces mckinney and lin 1994 sun 1994 for such problems traditional nonlinear optimization approaches may not result in global optimum solutions unless the optimization begins with a good initial solution arora 2004 therefore heuristic optimization approaches are usually preferred since they do not require any initial solutions currently there are many heuristic optimization approaches available which are mostly based on different natural phenomena in this study a genetic algorithm ga based optimization approach is used ga is an evolutionary optimization method which is based on the survival of the fittest observed in natural selection and genetics in the literature different versions of ga were proposed to solve different kinds of optimization problems most of these versions adopted the binary ga structure which is also used in this study here a possible network set of monitoring wells located in a watershed corresponds to a chromosome and each monitoring well in this network is represented by a binary bit that determines if that well will be selected for the network bit value 1 or not bit value 0 for each monitoring well network in the ga solution the fitness of the network is determined by interpolating the associated water quality data over the basin using the inverse distance to a power interpolation approach in the previous study by ayvaz and elci 2017 a similar approach for seeking the optimum groundwater monitoring network was presented by considering only electrical conductivity ec as the groundwater quality information used in the optimization process the study presented in this article is an extension of the study by ayvaz and elci 2017 instead of using a single groundwater quality parameters several parameters in the form of a water quality index wqi are taken into account for a more comprehensive evaluation of the monitoring network 2 materials and methods in this section first the calculation of the wqi values is presented second general information about study area grb and groundwater quality information collected from grb is provided third mathematical structure of the ga based optimization model is described 2 1 calculation of the water quality index wqi wqi is a composite indicator that aggregates the influence of several groundwater quality parameters the calculation method used in this study is based on the methodology used by tiwari and mishra 1985 out of 33 parameters that were analyzed in each groundwater sample those with a standard value in the turkish drinking water quality regulation moh 2005 are selected depending on its relative importance in the evaluation of the overall drinking water quality each of the parameters is assigned a weighting coefficient w j j 1 2 3 n where n is the number of selected groundwater quality parameters seventeen regulated water quality parameters n 17 are selected which are listed from most important w j 5 to least important w j 1 arsenic lead cadmium chromium nickel and aluminum w j 5 nitrate nitrite ammonium electrical conductivity and boron w j 4 iron and manganese w j 3 chloride and sulfate w j 2 sodium and fluoride w j 1 by using the weights for these water quality parameters the relative weight w j is calculated as follows 1 w j w j j 1 n w j j 1 2 3 n the concentration values for each parameter is then normalized based on the limit value provided by the drinking water standard moh 2005 the normalized concentration is referred to as the quality rating q j and is calculated as follows 2 q j c j s j 100 j 1 2 3 n where c j is the concentration of parameter j in the groundwater sample and s j is the drinking water standard for parameter j for each sample the sub index values si j for the j th parameter and then the water quality index value wqi are calculated using the following equations 3 s i j w j q j j 1 2 3 n 4 wqi j 1 n si j the lower the wqi values the better the overall water quality at the sampling location the resulting wqi values can be classified into categories for further interpretation with respect to the suitability for drinking purposes e g ≈üener et al 2017 wqi 50 excellent water 50 wqi 100 good water 100 wqi 200 poor water 200 wqi 300 very poor water wqi 300 unsuitable for drinking 2 2 study area as indicated previously the applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated by using the groundwater monitoring data collected from the gediz river basin grb which is located in western turkey grb has a drainage area of 17 146 km2 and receives on average a total of 617 mm precipitation annually based on long term meteorological records the agriculture sector is the most important water consumer in the grb hydrogeology of the grb is classified as 8 groundwater bodies consisting of different lithological units which are mainly sedimentary units such as clay sand and gravel karstic rocks such as limestones and marbles fractured volcanic rocks and other types of rocks such as sandstone shale schist and gneiss dsi 2014 a general location map of the grb is provided in fig 1 groundwater quality data set for the grb is obtained from dsi 2014 which is a report of a comprehensive hydrogeological study conducted in the grb during the mentioned study groundwater samples from selected 618 wells were collected in three sampling periods which represent wet and dry seasons of the year wet seasons mar may 2013 and mar may 2014 dry season sep nov 2013 all of these selected wells are located in different yet hydraulically connected groundwater bodies that are capable to supply a significant amount of water monitoring wells located in perched aquifers or isolated hydrogeological units were excluded and not used in this study for the demonstration of the proposed approach data sets for the wet sampling periods are selected which are referred to as first and second sampling period the first sampling period mar may 2013 data is used directly in the optimization process while the second sampling period mar may 2014 data is used for the verification of the optimized monitoring network in the study by dsi 2014 all groundwater samples were analyzed for more than 20 groundwater quality parameters for this study seventeen of these parameters are selected to calculate the wqi values for each sampling location these values are further used in the optimization of the monitoring network for each monitoring period spatial distributions of wqi values are given in fig 2 2 3 optimization model a ga based optimization approach is proposed in this study for seeking the optimum groundwater quality monitoring network in the classical version of ga decision variables are encoded as binary strings genes for a given search space sequential combinations of these genes generate chromosomes which correspond to possible monitoring networks i e candidate solutions the evolution starts from a population of completely random chromosomes and occurs in generations in each generation the fitness of the whole population is evaluated and multiple chromosomes are stochastically selected from the current population based on their fitness and modified using genetic operators such as crossover and mutation to form a new population the new population is then used in the next iteration generation of the algorithm davis 1991 by following this solution sequence the primary goal is to identify less effective monitoring wells in the proposed approach this task is conducted by considering the computational steps given below ayvaz and elci 2017 let n p be the number of candidate solutions in the ga population n b be the total number of monitoring wells in the field and i c c 1 2 3 n p be the c th candidate solution i e the newly obtained well network in the current generation of the ga population the solution of i c has a total of n b bits where each bit corresponds to a monitoring well such that a value of 1 means the corresponding monitoring well is selected whereas a value of 0 means the well is not selected in the network the first task is to generate the initial population which includes randomly generated n p n b bits as an example case fig 3 shows two randomly generated ga chromosomes and their corresponding well networks by considering n p 2 and n b 10 for a hypothetical watershed as shown in fig 3 the watershed area includes a total of n b 10 monitoring wells and 6 and 4 of them are selected for i 1 and i 2 respectively after the network is generated for each candidate solution the next task is to interpolate the water quality index value of wqi k at k th monitoring well k 1 2 3 n b the purpose of this process is to transpose the point observations at the selected well locations to an aerial distribution that represents the groundwater quality distribution over the entire watershed then the interpolated water quality index values coinciding with interpolation grid points inside the watershed area are used to calculate the network fitness value this procedure can be mathematically stated as follows 5 z c max f 1 œâ f 2 6 f 1 1 i 1 m x m y wqj i wqj i 2 i 1 m x m y wqj i w q j 2 f 1 1 7 f 2 Œ∑ n b subject to 8 wqj i wqi i if i th grid point is in the watershed 0 otherwise i 1 2 3 m x m y 9 wq i i wq i k Œ∑ m x m y i 1 2 3 m x m y k 1 2 3 n b 10 Œ∑ k 1 n b Œ∑ k 11 Œ∑ k 1 if k th monitoring well is active 0 otherwise k 1 2 3 n b where z c is the network fitness value for the c th candidate solution of ga population c 1 2 3 n p wqi k is the groundwater quality value at the k th monitoring well k 1 2 3 n b Œ∑ k is an integer variable which takes a value of 1 if k th monitoring well is selected otherwise it takes a value of 0 Œ∑ is the number of selected wells which is calculated by taking the sum of all Œ∑ k values k 1 2 3 n b wq i k Œ∑ m x m y is the interpolation model used to convert the point observations in the Œ∑ wells into a two dimensional surface in a m x m y domain where m x and m y are the number of grid points in x and y directions respectively wqi i is the interpolated water quality index value at the i th grid point i 1 2 3 m x m y wqj i is the water quality index value at the i th grid point i 1 2 3 m x m y using all available monitoring wells n b at the beginning of the optimization and w q j is the mean of all wqj i values in the grid as can be seen from the mathematical formulation given above two different objective functions are used in eq 5 the first objective function f 1 given in eq 6 is related to the maximization of the nash sutcliffe ns model efficiency which is calculated between wqj i and wqj i for i 1 2 3 m x m y note that f 1 has a possible range of 1 where a value of 1 means that the values of wqj i are the same as wqj i in each grid point a ns value equal or lower than zero indicates that the value of w q j is a better predictor than the model although f 1 1 is the most favorable case in terms of model performance it is not a feasible solution in terms of cost since it means that the number of wells is not reduced therefore the second objective function f 2 is defined to minimize the ratio between the number of active and number of existing monitoring wells in the watershed area ideally it should be a number much less than 1 it must be noted also that although both objective functions have a maximum value of 1 the nature of them are totally different therefore both functions are integrated in a single objective function i e network fitness by using a weighting coefficient of œâ note that the value of œâ is also used to adjust the relative importance of f 2 with respect to f 1 since the solution of the problem with different œâ values results in different optimum solutions thus a detailed analysis is conducted for different values of œâ to find a suitable balance between both objective functions after calculation of the network fitness values of z c c 1 2 3 n p for each candidate solution in the ga population the next step is the generation of the new population by means of the roulette wheel approach goldberg 1989 this approach is conducted by using a selection probability which is calculated based on z c values as follows 12 p c z c c 1 n p z c c 1 2 3 n p where p c is the selection probability for the candidate solution of c according to the selection procedure given in eq 12 the solutions with higher z c values have a higher chance of transferring their genetic information to the next generations in addition to this selection procedure the solution with the best network fitness value is directly transferred to the next generation by using the so called elitism rule goldberg 1989 after this process the candidate solutions in the new population are subjected to crossover based on a predefined crossover probability p cross the reason for applying this process is to create new well networks chromosomes for the next generation by combining two randomly selected networks from the current generation the value of p cross is generally high to avoid similar solutions in successive generations for example p cross 0 95 means that 95 of the possible monitoring networks in the current generation will undergo mixing of the monitoring wells on the other extreme if p cross 0 then the next generation will contain the exact same well networks it is demonstrated in other groundwater system optimization studies that solutions are insensitive to different value assignments of p cross between 0 50 and 1 00 e g fisher 2013 ayvaz and kentel 2015 the final step is the mutation process which is used to increase the population s diversity by restoring the lost or unexplored solutions hsiao and chang 2002 this process is controlled by means of the mutation probability p mut which is used to maintain genetic diversity in the population from one generation to the next and to prevent convergence on a sub optimal solution by randomly changing a bit value i e adding removing well to from current network the probability of p mut is typically selected as a low value to ensure that crossover is mainly responsible of the evolution high values increase the probability of unnecessarily modifying a good solution while preventing premature convergence as for p cross it is shown that the algorithm is relatively robust against incremental changes in the p mut for values of 0 05 0 25 fisher 2013 ayvaz and kentel 2015 after this process the first generation of the ga based optimization model is completed and the same processes are repeated until satisfying the user defined termination criterion the following ga parameter values are used for all solutions n p 50 p cross 0 95 p mut 0 05 and a maximum generation number of 2000 these values are assigned based on published literature values yang et al 2012 ayvaz and kentel 2015 luo et al 2016 and on trial and error runs before the actual optimization the optimization process is terminated when the following convergence criterion is satisfied or the specified maximum number of generations is reached whichever occurs first preferably the solution obtained at the maximum number of generations can also be accepted as optimum if the convergence criterion has already been satisfied at an earlier generation the convergence criterion is defined as the moving average of the relative improvement in the objective function value this criterion is satisfied when it equals zero for any generation during the optimization 13 1 l l 1 l z c l z c l 1 z c l 0 where z c l is the objective function value at the l th generation l is the order of the moving average i e the average of relative improvements seen in the last l generations l 100 is used in this study satisfying the convergence criterion means that the solution has remained unchanged and has not improved for the last consecutive 100 generations it should be noted that due to the elitism option in the ga it is impossible to obtain deteriorated solutions in consecutive generations fig 4 shows the flowchart of the proposed ga based optimization approach here it can be seen that all wells are assumed to be active at the start of the optimization process the reason for this is to start the global exploration process by using the same initial solution for each successive solution with different œâ values after activating all wells and generating the initial population groundwater quality information in the active wells are interpolated and the corresponding network fitness values are calculated for each candidate solution note that wqi values represent groundwater quality information and the point wqi observations are interpolated over the study area by using the inverse distance weighting idw method thereby wqi values are estimated for unmonitored locations of the aquifer in the idw method the power coefficient is taken equal to 2 to apply nonlinear interpolation on observed values as shown in eq 5 the proposed approach has two objectives and both of them are integrated into a single objective function by means of the weighting coefficient of œâ since different values of œâ each provide their own optimum solutions the model performance is evaluated by considering different œâ values this evaluation is conducted by considering two cases in terms of different œâ ranges in the first case the problem is consecutively solved for œâ 0 1 1 0 with a constant interval of 0 1 in the second case a wider range is considered and the problem is solved for œâ 0 01 1000 in which the interval between each solution is taken as one logarithmic cycle apart i e ratio between two consecutive œâ values is 10 note that a bit value of n b 618 is considered for each ga chromosome since each well in grb is represented with a ga bit as indicated previously a value of 1 in this representation means that the corresponding well is active and the wqi value in that location is used during interpolation similarly a bit value of 0 means that the corresponding well is not active and the associated wqi value is not used during interpolation after obtaining the optimization results for groundwater quality monitoring data of the first sampling period i e mar may 2013 the identified monitoring well networks are also verified by considering the wqi values which are calculated for the second sampling period i e mar may 2014 at this verification stage the ga based optimization approach is not executed instead wqi values at the corresponding well locations for the second monitoring period are interpolated and the spatial distribution of wqi values is compared with the interpolated wqi distribution that is determined using all available monitoring wells in grb 3 results and discussion in this section first identification results of the proposed ga based optimization approach are presented in terms of different monitoring well networks second verification of these identified well networks is conducted by using a different set of monitoring data 3 1 identification of the optimum monitoring well networks the proposed approach is executed for the first and second cases results are presented in this section as an example œâ 1 fig 5 shows the convergence plots for the first case fig 5 clearly shows that the ga based optimization model starts the search process from f 1 1 and f 2 1 this means that all monitoring wells are assumed to be active at the start of optimization in that case the initial value of the objective function z c is dependent on the value of œâ such that z c 0 is obtained for œâ 1 as the optimization proceeds the value of z c systematically increases depending on the changing values of f 1 and f 2 the convergence criterion defined in eq 13 is satisfied for all œâ values before the maximum number of generations is reached for better comparability solutions obtained after completing 2000 ga generations are considered as optimum solutions the identified results of the first case are summarized in table 1 for different œâ values for œâ 0 10 the final objective function value is obtained as 0 924 which corresponds to a ns model efficiency of 0 989 this result is obtained by using a reduced number of 405 wells and this corresponds to 65 5 of all the monitoring wells in the grb as the œâ coefficient is increased to 1 00 the objective function value also decreases from 0 924 to 0 510 and the same trend is also observed in the ns model efficiency which decreases from 0 989 to 0 916 this result is obtained by using 251 wells which correspond to only 40 6 of all the available monitoring wells in the grb when the identified results are evaluated in detail it can be concluded that values of z c and f 1 systematically decrease as the value of œâ increases from 0 10 to 1 however a different result is observed for f 2 such that it stabilizes at a constant value of 0 406 corresponding to Œ∑ 251 active wells for the solutions using 0 60 œâ 1 another interesting finding is that there is a decreasing trend in both z and f 1 although the value of f 2 remains constant for 0 60 œâ 1 this result indicates that different well locations are determined by the proposed approach for 0 60 œâ 1 although the number of wells is the same the solutions with 251 monitoring wells for 0 60 œâ 1 lead to the maximization of the objective function value which is a desired outcome any number lower than 251 wells yields an f 2 value that negatively influences the f 1 value for the same œâ range therefore the optimization process tends to keep the well number constant at 251 and consequently seeks for better well locations to further improve the final f 1 values as can be seen in fig 6 all the identified well locations cover the entire watershed homogeneously for each solution a comparison of well networks shown in fig 6 f j suggests that different spatial distributions of wells are determined by the proposed approach although the same number of wells Œ∑ 251 result from these solutions nevertheless these networks capture an equivalent information about groundwater quality wqi values this result is discussed in more detail in the following sections see table 3 an example interpolated map of groundwater quality as a result of network optimization using œâ 1 with superimposed locations of selected monitoring wells is shown in fig 7 it appears that the optimization process tends to select wells that are clustered at hotspots of groundwater pollution this is in particular evident in the south of the grb identified results for the second case that analyzes the influence of œâ for a wider parameter range are summarized in table 2 and as an example the convergence plots for the model execution for œâ 10 is depicted in fig 8 it can be seen in the convergence plots that the same trends are obtained as with those observed in the first case the optimization process starts by considering all the monitoring wells in the basin and reduces their number by performing ga evolution the main difference of this convergence profile from the one obtained in the first case is that this case yields a negative objective function value since œâ 10 is assigned in this model execution results given in table 2 show that the final objective function value of 0 991 is obtained for œâ 0 01 which corresponds to a ns model efficiency of 1 000 and active well number of Œ∑ 559 this result indicates that reducing the value of œâ to 0 01 improves the model identification performance since 90 5 of all the monitoring wells are used for this solution although the same active well numbers of Œ∑ 251 are obtained for the solutions between 0 60 œâ 1 in the first case the same behavior is not observed in the second case where a ten times increase of œâ leads to a decrease in the corresponding well numbers for each consecutive solution for example while 251 wells are identified for the solution of œâ 1 this number is reduced to 191 when the problem is solved with œâ 10 however if these two solutions are compared in terms of the ns model efficiency values the identification performance of the model significantly reduces from 0 916 to 0 655 furthermore the identified well locations are compared in fig 9 an example interpolated map of groundwater quality as a result of network optimization using œâ 10 with superimposed locations of selected monitoring wells is shown in fig 10 similar to the first case the optimization process tends to select more wells at hotspots of groundwater pollution in addition despite the reduced number of wells with œâ 10 the optimization process is successful in reflecting the interpolated wqi distribution with these hotspots furthermore it is demonstrated with the grb application example that œâ 1 yields the most balanced solution since performance indicators suggest that the trade off between cost and accuracy gets too biased towards accuracy for œâ values greater than 1 this selection implies that in the objective function monitoring accuracy of the basin represented with f 1 is treated equally important as the number of monitoring wells i e the cost which is represented with f 2 for œâ 1 the solutions become more biased towards cost this trade off between accuracy and cost is summarized in fig 11 further analysis of the optimization results may indicate other preferences for the selection of the œâ coefficient for instance œâ 0 1 appears to provide also a sensible solution in terms of the overall evaluation of performance indicators table 4 it can be argued that this choice leads to a monitoring network with less reduction 34 against 59 with œâ 1 however the performance indicators evaluated all together suggests that this choice could be better depending on which œâ coefficient is chosen the optimized monitoring networks provide groundwater quality from a different number of wells therefore it should be expected that each optimized network provides groundwater quality information from more or less polluted areas of the basin in table 3 the mean values of wqi observed at all monitoring wells and wells from the optimized network are compared this comparison is done for both sampling periods and also for three different choices of œâ for œâ 1 mean wqi values increase from 66 03 to 79 49 and 63 43 to 80 51 for the first and second sampling periods respectively similar changes are found for œâ 0 1 and œâ 0 6 3 2 verification of the identified optimum monitoring well networks verification ensures that the optimized monitoring network performs accurately with a different data set at this stage the ns model efficiencies of wqi spatial distributions for the first sampling period and the second sampling period are compared both spatial distributions are obtained using the optimized well network these comparisons are conducted for all œâ values results are given in figs 12 and 13 in terms of the ns model efficiency coefficients it is evident that lower ns model efficiency values are obtained during the verification stage since optimization process is not involved at this stage in terms of model performance moriasi et al 2007 reviewed different basin scale modeling studies and classified the performance ratings of ns as very good for 0 75 ns 1 00 good for 0 65 ns 0 75 satisfactory for 0 50 ns 0 65 and unsatisfactory for ns 0 50 if model results are evaluated in light of these classifications it can be concluded that the verification performance in the first case is evaluated as good for œâ 0 80 and 0 90 and very good for the remaining solutions of the first case for the second case while the verification performance is obtained as very good from œâ 0 01 to 1 these ratings are obtained as unsatisfactory for the solutions from œâ 10 to 1000 for further conclusiveness of the verification process different additional model performance indicators such as percent bias pbias root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r and standard deviation s are also evaluated details of these performance evaluation measures are given as follows 14 pbias i 1 m x m y wqj i wqj i i 1 m x m y wqj i 100 15 rmse 1 m x m y i 1 m x m y wqj i wqj i 2 16 r i 1 m x m y wqj i w q j wqj i w q j i 1 m x m y wqj i w q j 2 t 1 n t wqj i w q j 2 17 s 1 m x m y 1 i 1 m x m y wqj i w q j 2 where w q j is the mean of the calculated wqj i values in the field i 1 2 3 m x m y by using the measures given in eqs 14 16 the identified results are compared in tables 3 and 4 for the first and second cases respectively as can be seen from the results of the first case table 4 pbias values change between 2 00 œâ 0 70 and 5 15 œâ 0 40 for the optimization stage this range increases in the verification stage such that pbias values are obtained between 3 08 œâ 0 90 and 9 09 œâ 0 80 as for rmse values an increasing trend in the optimization stage can be observed such that the minimum and maximum rmse values are 4 64 œâ 0 10 and 13 05 œâ 1 00 in the verification stage larger rmse values are obtained compared to the optimization stage and rmse values vary for different solutions since the identified well networks are used directly without any further optimization the same behavior can also be observed in r values such that there is a monotonically decreasing trend in the optimization process while there are some small variations in the verification stage as the value of œâ increases when the results of the verification stage are evaluated for the second case table 5 it can be seen that variable pbias values are obtained again for both optimization and verification stages the final calculated pbias values change to between 0 19 œâ 100 and 13 29 œâ 10 for the optimization and change between 7 49 œâ 1000 and 7 04 œâ 1 for the verification stages unlike the first case a monotonically increasing rmse is observed as the value of œâ increases from 0 01 to 1000 for both optimization and verification stages similarly final values of r decrease as the value of œâ increases the reason of this difference may be associated with the considered parameter ranges of œâ in the first and the second case since a larger parameter range for œâ is considered in the second case the influence of the changing parameter value can be more clearly seen on the identified results when the results obtained for the optimization and verifications stages are evaluated in detail it can be concluded that the optimum groundwater quality monitoring network can be determined based on the initial selection of the weighting coefficient œâ all selections of œâ yield an optimum solution which is different for each selection of œâ with respect to number of wells monitoring cost and monitoring performance the selection of œâ is a matter of choice and depends on the specific goals of the case for example if lowering the monitoring cost is relatively more important for the specific case then œâ should be selected greater than 1 furthermore the model performance is also evaluated by comparing the verification results with the ones given in the literature santhi et al 2001 and van liew et al 2003 pointed out that the r values greater than 0 50 can be practically accepted for many hydrological studies moriasi et al 2007 reported that pbias values less than 10 are very good estimates comparison of the results given in tables 3 and 4 with these outcomes reveals that the optimization and verification performance of the proposed approach is acceptable for most of the œâ values used in this application in a different study singh et al 2004 stated that the cases where rmse value is smaller than half of the s can be classified as the solution with low error as can be seen this classification can be valid for almost all the solutions in table 3 except for the verification with œâ 0 90 and for solutions œâ 1 shown in table 4 4 conclusions and recommendations groundwater monitoring networks are usually designed considering a homogeneous distribution over the study area however this approach does not always result in an optimal distribution of monitoring wells since from some areas redundant information is collected while at the same time information may be missing for other areas therefore the optimization approach presented here offers a meaningful way to reduce potential redundancy in the monitoring network while the spatial information about groundwater quality is also considered the basic assumptions in our study are that a monitoring network currently exists at least one set of groundwater quality data has been collected and that the present monitoring network sufficiently represents the quality of the groundwater body therefore the optimization approach is devised only to reduce redundancy meaning that wells can only be inactivated in a network the wells that are inactive i e are eliminated in the optimization process are sampling points that provide information contributing less to the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality parameter by reducing the number of monitoring wells the cost of the monitoring is also reduced which is a desired outcome of the optimization the exclusion of wells from the monitoring sampling program should be temporary as long as regulations permit and should be preserved for the future because sub basin level studies may require the use of additional wells or if the presence of any pollutant puts the groundwater body at risk an operational monitoring program may be required to be established as it is for example obliged by the european water framework directive ec 2007 however at the same time the more wells are excluded from the network the more the coverage of the monitoring network gets narrowed the proposed approach takes both the cost and the coverage of the basin into account by formulating them in a single objective function in the proposed approach the relative importance of each objective is expressed using the weighting coefficient œâ it is found that the solution of the optimization is very dependent on the selection of œâ therefore a œâ value that results with the most balanced solution must be selected most balanced means that the trade off between cost and coverage is the most acceptable to avoid a subjective decision it is highly recommended to evaluate additional performance indicators besides ns coefficient such as rmse pbias and the regression coefficient it must be once more stressed that in these types of optimization methods a subjective decision should be avoided by using some sort of performance metrics in the decision making process if such performance metrics are used then other more sophisticated decision making systems such as latin hypercube sampling or other alternatives may not be necessary in a practical sense the use of these systems would make the entire optimization process more cumbersome and difficult in the actual application on a river basin depending on which œâ coefficient is chosen the optimized monitoring networks provide groundwater quality from a different number of wells in the practice of the optimization it may be desired that monitoring wells in more problematic areas i e where groundwater is more polluted should be selected therefore it is worthwhile to confirm if the selected wells in the optimized network reflect groundwater quality data from more polluted areas comparison of mean values of wqi observed in the optimized network with values from all monitoring wells shows that mean wqi is higher for the optimized network therefore it can be clearly concluded that the optimized network provides groundwater quality data from more polluted areas this conclusion can be considered as a significant advantage of the proposed optimization approach potential limitations may arise when a monitoring well is screened in a conduit channel system which can be observed in karst aquifers in such a case the well is exposed to preferential flow of contaminant flux that can cause large temporal variations in the contaminant concentration therefore data obtained from such a well can be unreliable and may be excluded from the optimization as a final recommendation the optimization of the monitoring network should be performed periodically since monitoring efficiency is expected to change as data from new wells become available a re evaluation of the optimized monitoring network considering the addition of new wells every few years may help determine the long term effectiveness of a groundwater quality monitoring program acknowledgments the authors are grateful to dr el√ßin kentel from middle east technical university for her suggestions

7198,management of groundwater requires a sufficient coverage of accurate groundwater quality data these data are usually collected from monitoring wells which are spatially distributed in the river basin or the groundwater body that is studied a minimum number of monitoring wells with an optimum spatial distribution is desired to ensure a cost effective observation of the groundwater body therefore the configuration of groundwater monitoring networks and the number of required wells becomes an important engineering optimization problem the goal of this study is to find an optimum monitoring network with the fewest wells that provides sufficient spatial coverage on groundwater quality with the presented method redundant wells in an already existing network are identified here a genetic algorithm ga based optimization approach is used in which each monitoring well in the watershed is represented with a binary ga bit to evaluate if the corresponding monitoring well will be selected for the network the proposed approach can solve the problem by simultaneously optimizing two conflicting objectives the first objective is the maximization of the match between the interpolated groundwater quality concentration distributions obtained using data from all available monitoring wells and the wells from the newly generated network the match is primarily evaluated using the nash sutcliffe ns model efficiency groundwater quality is represented by the water quality index wqi that aggregates several quality parameters the second objective deals with the minimization of the number of monitoring wells in the newly generated network by considering cost related constraints these two objectives are integrated in a single objective function where different combinations of both objectives are investigated by considering two cases the applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated for the groundwater monitoring network of the gediz river basin grb which is one of the most important river basins in turkey findings indicate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of monitoring wells with a relatively small deviation of the spatial distribution of the wqi values also the monitoring network is optimized such that sampling points are removed from less polluted areas and selected in areas with higher pollutant concentrations keywords groundwater quality monitoring network optimization genetic algorithm 1 introduction the planning and management of groundwater systems require appropriate monitoring of groundwater quantity and quality data obtained from this kind of monitoring is typically collected using monitoring well networks which may consist of more or less randomly distributed wells drilled in the studied aquifer system the number and spatial distribution of wells in a monitoring network are important considerations that can affect the outcome of groundwater quality characterization studies the selection of a groundwater monitoring network that is used for groundwater sampling depends on several site specific factors such as locations of already existing wells suitability of a well for groundwater sampling well configuration number and depth of screens accessibility distance between wells number of required groundwater samples and also available budget and time groundwater quality monitoring networks are designed using two general approaches the first is the hydrogeological approach where the design is based on qualitative and quantitative expert judgment of descriptive information by the hydrogeologist this approach is conventional and is commonly used in practice and does not involve any sophisticated methods the second approach is the statistical method where advanced geostatistical methods are used that can be based on simulation variance or probability loaiciga et al 1992 main variables in this method are hydraulic conductivity for the simulation based approach and groundwater quality indicators from monitoring wells in the variance based approach since groundwater quality monitoring in the conventional sense involves going to the site collecting groundwater samples in most cases transporting samples to the laboratory and conducting analyses in the laboratory it can easily become a costly task therefore the number of wells in a groundwater monitoring network must be optimized to facilitate cost efficiency however the optimum monitoring network is not necessarily the most cost effective when more monitoring wells are needed the optimum monitoring network provides groundwater quality data that represents the groundwater body with the least number of sampling wells finding the optimum network can be accomplished by configuring designing a new network or by reconfiguring redesigning an already existing network reconfiguring a network can pertain expanding or reducing a current network which results in either an increased or decreased number of monitoring wells respectively previous studies dealt with the optimization of groundwater monitoring well networks to identify the distribution of contaminant plumes e g chadalavada and datta 2008 kim and lee 2007 to identify unknown pollution sources e g jin et al 2014 bashi azghadi and kerachian 2010 datta et al 2009 to reduce redundancy and minimize cost e g guo et al 2011 dhar and datta 2010 baalousha 2010 wu et al 2005 methods used in these studies vary however most of them are based on nonlinear search and optimization methods used in combination with geostatistics chadalavada and datta 2008 flow and transport modeling wu et al 2005 reed et al 2000 or groundwater vulnerability mapping baalousha 2010 a more efficient network of monitoring wells may be established by evaluating the value of observations measured at each well and the degree to which observations are redundant and then removing low value or redundant wells from the observation network fisher 2013 the study presented in this article aims to find a monitoring network with the fewest wells that provides sufficient information on groundwater quality this goal is achieved by identifying the redundant wells in an already existing network by means of optimization groundwater related optimization problems have usually non continuous and non convex solution surfaces mckinney and lin 1994 sun 1994 for such problems traditional nonlinear optimization approaches may not result in global optimum solutions unless the optimization begins with a good initial solution arora 2004 therefore heuristic optimization approaches are usually preferred since they do not require any initial solutions currently there are many heuristic optimization approaches available which are mostly based on different natural phenomena in this study a genetic algorithm ga based optimization approach is used ga is an evolutionary optimization method which is based on the survival of the fittest observed in natural selection and genetics in the literature different versions of ga were proposed to solve different kinds of optimization problems most of these versions adopted the binary ga structure which is also used in this study here a possible network set of monitoring wells located in a watershed corresponds to a chromosome and each monitoring well in this network is represented by a binary bit that determines if that well will be selected for the network bit value 1 or not bit value 0 for each monitoring well network in the ga solution the fitness of the network is determined by interpolating the associated water quality data over the basin using the inverse distance to a power interpolation approach in the previous study by ayvaz and elci 2017 a similar approach for seeking the optimum groundwater monitoring network was presented by considering only electrical conductivity ec as the groundwater quality information used in the optimization process the study presented in this article is an extension of the study by ayvaz and elci 2017 instead of using a single groundwater quality parameters several parameters in the form of a water quality index wqi are taken into account for a more comprehensive evaluation of the monitoring network 2 materials and methods in this section first the calculation of the wqi values is presented second general information about study area grb and groundwater quality information collected from grb is provided third mathematical structure of the ga based optimization model is described 2 1 calculation of the water quality index wqi wqi is a composite indicator that aggregates the influence of several groundwater quality parameters the calculation method used in this study is based on the methodology used by tiwari and mishra 1985 out of 33 parameters that were analyzed in each groundwater sample those with a standard value in the turkish drinking water quality regulation moh 2005 are selected depending on its relative importance in the evaluation of the overall drinking water quality each of the parameters is assigned a weighting coefficient w j j 1 2 3 n where n is the number of selected groundwater quality parameters seventeen regulated water quality parameters n 17 are selected which are listed from most important w j 5 to least important w j 1 arsenic lead cadmium chromium nickel and aluminum w j 5 nitrate nitrite ammonium electrical conductivity and boron w j 4 iron and manganese w j 3 chloride and sulfate w j 2 sodium and fluoride w j 1 by using the weights for these water quality parameters the relative weight w j is calculated as follows 1 w j w j j 1 n w j j 1 2 3 n the concentration values for each parameter is then normalized based on the limit value provided by the drinking water standard moh 2005 the normalized concentration is referred to as the quality rating q j and is calculated as follows 2 q j c j s j 100 j 1 2 3 n where c j is the concentration of parameter j in the groundwater sample and s j is the drinking water standard for parameter j for each sample the sub index values si j for the j th parameter and then the water quality index value wqi are calculated using the following equations 3 s i j w j q j j 1 2 3 n 4 wqi j 1 n si j the lower the wqi values the better the overall water quality at the sampling location the resulting wqi values can be classified into categories for further interpretation with respect to the suitability for drinking purposes e g ≈üener et al 2017 wqi 50 excellent water 50 wqi 100 good water 100 wqi 200 poor water 200 wqi 300 very poor water wqi 300 unsuitable for drinking 2 2 study area as indicated previously the applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated by using the groundwater monitoring data collected from the gediz river basin grb which is located in western turkey grb has a drainage area of 17 146 km2 and receives on average a total of 617 mm precipitation annually based on long term meteorological records the agriculture sector is the most important water consumer in the grb hydrogeology of the grb is classified as 8 groundwater bodies consisting of different lithological units which are mainly sedimentary units such as clay sand and gravel karstic rocks such as limestones and marbles fractured volcanic rocks and other types of rocks such as sandstone shale schist and gneiss dsi 2014 a general location map of the grb is provided in fig 1 groundwater quality data set for the grb is obtained from dsi 2014 which is a report of a comprehensive hydrogeological study conducted in the grb during the mentioned study groundwater samples from selected 618 wells were collected in three sampling periods which represent wet and dry seasons of the year wet seasons mar may 2013 and mar may 2014 dry season sep nov 2013 all of these selected wells are located in different yet hydraulically connected groundwater bodies that are capable to supply a significant amount of water monitoring wells located in perched aquifers or isolated hydrogeological units were excluded and not used in this study for the demonstration of the proposed approach data sets for the wet sampling periods are selected which are referred to as first and second sampling period the first sampling period mar may 2013 data is used directly in the optimization process while the second sampling period mar may 2014 data is used for the verification of the optimized monitoring network in the study by dsi 2014 all groundwater samples were analyzed for more than 20 groundwater quality parameters for this study seventeen of these parameters are selected to calculate the wqi values for each sampling location these values are further used in the optimization of the monitoring network for each monitoring period spatial distributions of wqi values are given in fig 2 2 3 optimization model a ga based optimization approach is proposed in this study for seeking the optimum groundwater quality monitoring network in the classical version of ga decision variables are encoded as binary strings genes for a given search space sequential combinations of these genes generate chromosomes which correspond to possible monitoring networks i e candidate solutions the evolution starts from a population of completely random chromosomes and occurs in generations in each generation the fitness of the whole population is evaluated and multiple chromosomes are stochastically selected from the current population based on their fitness and modified using genetic operators such as crossover and mutation to form a new population the new population is then used in the next iteration generation of the algorithm davis 1991 by following this solution sequence the primary goal is to identify less effective monitoring wells in the proposed approach this task is conducted by considering the computational steps given below ayvaz and elci 2017 let n p be the number of candidate solutions in the ga population n b be the total number of monitoring wells in the field and i c c 1 2 3 n p be the c th candidate solution i e the newly obtained well network in the current generation of the ga population the solution of i c has a total of n b bits where each bit corresponds to a monitoring well such that a value of 1 means the corresponding monitoring well is selected whereas a value of 0 means the well is not selected in the network the first task is to generate the initial population which includes randomly generated n p n b bits as an example case fig 3 shows two randomly generated ga chromosomes and their corresponding well networks by considering n p 2 and n b 10 for a hypothetical watershed as shown in fig 3 the watershed area includes a total of n b 10 monitoring wells and 6 and 4 of them are selected for i 1 and i 2 respectively after the network is generated for each candidate solution the next task is to interpolate the water quality index value of wqi k at k th monitoring well k 1 2 3 n b the purpose of this process is to transpose the point observations at the selected well locations to an aerial distribution that represents the groundwater quality distribution over the entire watershed then the interpolated water quality index values coinciding with interpolation grid points inside the watershed area are used to calculate the network fitness value this procedure can be mathematically stated as follows 5 z c max f 1 œâ f 2 6 f 1 1 i 1 m x m y wqj i wqj i 2 i 1 m x m y wqj i w q j 2 f 1 1 7 f 2 Œ∑ n b subject to 8 wqj i wqi i if i th grid point is in the watershed 0 otherwise i 1 2 3 m x m y 9 wq i i wq i k Œ∑ m x m y i 1 2 3 m x m y k 1 2 3 n b 10 Œ∑ k 1 n b Œ∑ k 11 Œ∑ k 1 if k th monitoring well is active 0 otherwise k 1 2 3 n b where z c is the network fitness value for the c th candidate solution of ga population c 1 2 3 n p wqi k is the groundwater quality value at the k th monitoring well k 1 2 3 n b Œ∑ k is an integer variable which takes a value of 1 if k th monitoring well is selected otherwise it takes a value of 0 Œ∑ is the number of selected wells which is calculated by taking the sum of all Œ∑ k values k 1 2 3 n b wq i k Œ∑ m x m y is the interpolation model used to convert the point observations in the Œ∑ wells into a two dimensional surface in a m x m y domain where m x and m y are the number of grid points in x and y directions respectively wqi i is the interpolated water quality index value at the i th grid point i 1 2 3 m x m y wqj i is the water quality index value at the i th grid point i 1 2 3 m x m y using all available monitoring wells n b at the beginning of the optimization and w q j is the mean of all wqj i values in the grid as can be seen from the mathematical formulation given above two different objective functions are used in eq 5 the first objective function f 1 given in eq 6 is related to the maximization of the nash sutcliffe ns model efficiency which is calculated between wqj i and wqj i for i 1 2 3 m x m y note that f 1 has a possible range of 1 where a value of 1 means that the values of wqj i are the same as wqj i in each grid point a ns value equal or lower than zero indicates that the value of w q j is a better predictor than the model although f 1 1 is the most favorable case in terms of model performance it is not a feasible solution in terms of cost since it means that the number of wells is not reduced therefore the second objective function f 2 is defined to minimize the ratio between the number of active and number of existing monitoring wells in the watershed area ideally it should be a number much less than 1 it must be noted also that although both objective functions have a maximum value of 1 the nature of them are totally different therefore both functions are integrated in a single objective function i e network fitness by using a weighting coefficient of œâ note that the value of œâ is also used to adjust the relative importance of f 2 with respect to f 1 since the solution of the problem with different œâ values results in different optimum solutions thus a detailed analysis is conducted for different values of œâ to find a suitable balance between both objective functions after calculation of the network fitness values of z c c 1 2 3 n p for each candidate solution in the ga population the next step is the generation of the new population by means of the roulette wheel approach goldberg 1989 this approach is conducted by using a selection probability which is calculated based on z c values as follows 12 p c z c c 1 n p z c c 1 2 3 n p where p c is the selection probability for the candidate solution of c according to the selection procedure given in eq 12 the solutions with higher z c values have a higher chance of transferring their genetic information to the next generations in addition to this selection procedure the solution with the best network fitness value is directly transferred to the next generation by using the so called elitism rule goldberg 1989 after this process the candidate solutions in the new population are subjected to crossover based on a predefined crossover probability p cross the reason for applying this process is to create new well networks chromosomes for the next generation by combining two randomly selected networks from the current generation the value of p cross is generally high to avoid similar solutions in successive generations for example p cross 0 95 means that 95 of the possible monitoring networks in the current generation will undergo mixing of the monitoring wells on the other extreme if p cross 0 then the next generation will contain the exact same well networks it is demonstrated in other groundwater system optimization studies that solutions are insensitive to different value assignments of p cross between 0 50 and 1 00 e g fisher 2013 ayvaz and kentel 2015 the final step is the mutation process which is used to increase the population s diversity by restoring the lost or unexplored solutions hsiao and chang 2002 this process is controlled by means of the mutation probability p mut which is used to maintain genetic diversity in the population from one generation to the next and to prevent convergence on a sub optimal solution by randomly changing a bit value i e adding removing well to from current network the probability of p mut is typically selected as a low value to ensure that crossover is mainly responsible of the evolution high values increase the probability of unnecessarily modifying a good solution while preventing premature convergence as for p cross it is shown that the algorithm is relatively robust against incremental changes in the p mut for values of 0 05 0 25 fisher 2013 ayvaz and kentel 2015 after this process the first generation of the ga based optimization model is completed and the same processes are repeated until satisfying the user defined termination criterion the following ga parameter values are used for all solutions n p 50 p cross 0 95 p mut 0 05 and a maximum generation number of 2000 these values are assigned based on published literature values yang et al 2012 ayvaz and kentel 2015 luo et al 2016 and on trial and error runs before the actual optimization the optimization process is terminated when the following convergence criterion is satisfied or the specified maximum number of generations is reached whichever occurs first preferably the solution obtained at the maximum number of generations can also be accepted as optimum if the convergence criterion has already been satisfied at an earlier generation the convergence criterion is defined as the moving average of the relative improvement in the objective function value this criterion is satisfied when it equals zero for any generation during the optimization 13 1 l l 1 l z c l z c l 1 z c l 0 where z c l is the objective function value at the l th generation l is the order of the moving average i e the average of relative improvements seen in the last l generations l 100 is used in this study satisfying the convergence criterion means that the solution has remained unchanged and has not improved for the last consecutive 100 generations it should be noted that due to the elitism option in the ga it is impossible to obtain deteriorated solutions in consecutive generations fig 4 shows the flowchart of the proposed ga based optimization approach here it can be seen that all wells are assumed to be active at the start of the optimization process the reason for this is to start the global exploration process by using the same initial solution for each successive solution with different œâ values after activating all wells and generating the initial population groundwater quality information in the active wells are interpolated and the corresponding network fitness values are calculated for each candidate solution note that wqi values represent groundwater quality information and the point wqi observations are interpolated over the study area by using the inverse distance weighting idw method thereby wqi values are estimated for unmonitored locations of the aquifer in the idw method the power coefficient is taken equal to 2 to apply nonlinear interpolation on observed values as shown in eq 5 the proposed approach has two objectives and both of them are integrated into a single objective function by means of the weighting coefficient of œâ since different values of œâ each provide their own optimum solutions the model performance is evaluated by considering different œâ values this evaluation is conducted by considering two cases in terms of different œâ ranges in the first case the problem is consecutively solved for œâ 0 1 1 0 with a constant interval of 0 1 in the second case a wider range is considered and the problem is solved for œâ 0 01 1000 in which the interval between each solution is taken as one logarithmic cycle apart i e ratio between two consecutive œâ values is 10 note that a bit value of n b 618 is considered for each ga chromosome since each well in grb is represented with a ga bit as indicated previously a value of 1 in this representation means that the corresponding well is active and the wqi value in that location is used during interpolation similarly a bit value of 0 means that the corresponding well is not active and the associated wqi value is not used during interpolation after obtaining the optimization results for groundwater quality monitoring data of the first sampling period i e mar may 2013 the identified monitoring well networks are also verified by considering the wqi values which are calculated for the second sampling period i e mar may 2014 at this verification stage the ga based optimization approach is not executed instead wqi values at the corresponding well locations for the second monitoring period are interpolated and the spatial distribution of wqi values is compared with the interpolated wqi distribution that is determined using all available monitoring wells in grb 3 results and discussion in this section first identification results of the proposed ga based optimization approach are presented in terms of different monitoring well networks second verification of these identified well networks is conducted by using a different set of monitoring data 3 1 identification of the optimum monitoring well networks the proposed approach is executed for the first and second cases results are presented in this section as an example œâ 1 fig 5 shows the convergence plots for the first case fig 5 clearly shows that the ga based optimization model starts the search process from f 1 1 and f 2 1 this means that all monitoring wells are assumed to be active at the start of optimization in that case the initial value of the objective function z c is dependent on the value of œâ such that z c 0 is obtained for œâ 1 as the optimization proceeds the value of z c systematically increases depending on the changing values of f 1 and f 2 the convergence criterion defined in eq 13 is satisfied for all œâ values before the maximum number of generations is reached for better comparability solutions obtained after completing 2000 ga generations are considered as optimum solutions the identified results of the first case are summarized in table 1 for different œâ values for œâ 0 10 the final objective function value is obtained as 0 924 which corresponds to a ns model efficiency of 0 989 this result is obtained by using a reduced number of 405 wells and this corresponds to 65 5 of all the monitoring wells in the grb as the œâ coefficient is increased to 1 00 the objective function value also decreases from 0 924 to 0 510 and the same trend is also observed in the ns model efficiency which decreases from 0 989 to 0 916 this result is obtained by using 251 wells which correspond to only 40 6 of all the available monitoring wells in the grb when the identified results are evaluated in detail it can be concluded that values of z c and f 1 systematically decrease as the value of œâ increases from 0 10 to 1 however a different result is observed for f 2 such that it stabilizes at a constant value of 0 406 corresponding to Œ∑ 251 active wells for the solutions using 0 60 œâ 1 another interesting finding is that there is a decreasing trend in both z and f 1 although the value of f 2 remains constant for 0 60 œâ 1 this result indicates that different well locations are determined by the proposed approach for 0 60 œâ 1 although the number of wells is the same the solutions with 251 monitoring wells for 0 60 œâ 1 lead to the maximization of the objective function value which is a desired outcome any number lower than 251 wells yields an f 2 value that negatively influences the f 1 value for the same œâ range therefore the optimization process tends to keep the well number constant at 251 and consequently seeks for better well locations to further improve the final f 1 values as can be seen in fig 6 all the identified well locations cover the entire watershed homogeneously for each solution a comparison of well networks shown in fig 6 f j suggests that different spatial distributions of wells are determined by the proposed approach although the same number of wells Œ∑ 251 result from these solutions nevertheless these networks capture an equivalent information about groundwater quality wqi values this result is discussed in more detail in the following sections see table 3 an example interpolated map of groundwater quality as a result of network optimization using œâ 1 with superimposed locations of selected monitoring wells is shown in fig 7 it appears that the optimization process tends to select wells that are clustered at hotspots of groundwater pollution this is in particular evident in the south of the grb identified results for the second case that analyzes the influence of œâ for a wider parameter range are summarized in table 2 and as an example the convergence plots for the model execution for œâ 10 is depicted in fig 8 it can be seen in the convergence plots that the same trends are obtained as with those observed in the first case the optimization process starts by considering all the monitoring wells in the basin and reduces their number by performing ga evolution the main difference of this convergence profile from the one obtained in the first case is that this case yields a negative objective function value since œâ 10 is assigned in this model execution results given in table 2 show that the final objective function value of 0 991 is obtained for œâ 0 01 which corresponds to a ns model efficiency of 1 000 and active well number of Œ∑ 559 this result indicates that reducing the value of œâ to 0 01 improves the model identification performance since 90 5 of all the monitoring wells are used for this solution although the same active well numbers of Œ∑ 251 are obtained for the solutions between 0 60 œâ 1 in the first case the same behavior is not observed in the second case where a ten times increase of œâ leads to a decrease in the corresponding well numbers for each consecutive solution for example while 251 wells are identified for the solution of œâ 1 this number is reduced to 191 when the problem is solved with œâ 10 however if these two solutions are compared in terms of the ns model efficiency values the identification performance of the model significantly reduces from 0 916 to 0 655 furthermore the identified well locations are compared in fig 9 an example interpolated map of groundwater quality as a result of network optimization using œâ 10 with superimposed locations of selected monitoring wells is shown in fig 10 similar to the first case the optimization process tends to select more wells at hotspots of groundwater pollution in addition despite the reduced number of wells with œâ 10 the optimization process is successful in reflecting the interpolated wqi distribution with these hotspots furthermore it is demonstrated with the grb application example that œâ 1 yields the most balanced solution since performance indicators suggest that the trade off between cost and accuracy gets too biased towards accuracy for œâ values greater than 1 this selection implies that in the objective function monitoring accuracy of the basin represented with f 1 is treated equally important as the number of monitoring wells i e the cost which is represented with f 2 for œâ 1 the solutions become more biased towards cost this trade off between accuracy and cost is summarized in fig 11 further analysis of the optimization results may indicate other preferences for the selection of the œâ coefficient for instance œâ 0 1 appears to provide also a sensible solution in terms of the overall evaluation of performance indicators table 4 it can be argued that this choice leads to a monitoring network with less reduction 34 against 59 with œâ 1 however the performance indicators evaluated all together suggests that this choice could be better depending on which œâ coefficient is chosen the optimized monitoring networks provide groundwater quality from a different number of wells therefore it should be expected that each optimized network provides groundwater quality information from more or less polluted areas of the basin in table 3 the mean values of wqi observed at all monitoring wells and wells from the optimized network are compared this comparison is done for both sampling periods and also for three different choices of œâ for œâ 1 mean wqi values increase from 66 03 to 79 49 and 63 43 to 80 51 for the first and second sampling periods respectively similar changes are found for œâ 0 1 and œâ 0 6 3 2 verification of the identified optimum monitoring well networks verification ensures that the optimized monitoring network performs accurately with a different data set at this stage the ns model efficiencies of wqi spatial distributions for the first sampling period and the second sampling period are compared both spatial distributions are obtained using the optimized well network these comparisons are conducted for all œâ values results are given in figs 12 and 13 in terms of the ns model efficiency coefficients it is evident that lower ns model efficiency values are obtained during the verification stage since optimization process is not involved at this stage in terms of model performance moriasi et al 2007 reviewed different basin scale modeling studies and classified the performance ratings of ns as very good for 0 75 ns 1 00 good for 0 65 ns 0 75 satisfactory for 0 50 ns 0 65 and unsatisfactory for ns 0 50 if model results are evaluated in light of these classifications it can be concluded that the verification performance in the first case is evaluated as good for œâ 0 80 and 0 90 and very good for the remaining solutions of the first case for the second case while the verification performance is obtained as very good from œâ 0 01 to 1 these ratings are obtained as unsatisfactory for the solutions from œâ 10 to 1000 for further conclusiveness of the verification process different additional model performance indicators such as percent bias pbias root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r and standard deviation s are also evaluated details of these performance evaluation measures are given as follows 14 pbias i 1 m x m y wqj i wqj i i 1 m x m y wqj i 100 15 rmse 1 m x m y i 1 m x m y wqj i wqj i 2 16 r i 1 m x m y wqj i w q j wqj i w q j i 1 m x m y wqj i w q j 2 t 1 n t wqj i w q j 2 17 s 1 m x m y 1 i 1 m x m y wqj i w q j 2 where w q j is the mean of the calculated wqj i values in the field i 1 2 3 m x m y by using the measures given in eqs 14 16 the identified results are compared in tables 3 and 4 for the first and second cases respectively as can be seen from the results of the first case table 4 pbias values change between 2 00 œâ 0 70 and 5 15 œâ 0 40 for the optimization stage this range increases in the verification stage such that pbias values are obtained between 3 08 œâ 0 90 and 9 09 œâ 0 80 as for rmse values an increasing trend in the optimization stage can be observed such that the minimum and maximum rmse values are 4 64 œâ 0 10 and 13 05 œâ 1 00 in the verification stage larger rmse values are obtained compared to the optimization stage and rmse values vary for different solutions since the identified well networks are used directly without any further optimization the same behavior can also be observed in r values such that there is a monotonically decreasing trend in the optimization process while there are some small variations in the verification stage as the value of œâ increases when the results of the verification stage are evaluated for the second case table 5 it can be seen that variable pbias values are obtained again for both optimization and verification stages the final calculated pbias values change to between 0 19 œâ 100 and 13 29 œâ 10 for the optimization and change between 7 49 œâ 1000 and 7 04 œâ 1 for the verification stages unlike the first case a monotonically increasing rmse is observed as the value of œâ increases from 0 01 to 1000 for both optimization and verification stages similarly final values of r decrease as the value of œâ increases the reason of this difference may be associated with the considered parameter ranges of œâ in the first and the second case since a larger parameter range for œâ is considered in the second case the influence of the changing parameter value can be more clearly seen on the identified results when the results obtained for the optimization and verifications stages are evaluated in detail it can be concluded that the optimum groundwater quality monitoring network can be determined based on the initial selection of the weighting coefficient œâ all selections of œâ yield an optimum solution which is different for each selection of œâ with respect to number of wells monitoring cost and monitoring performance the selection of œâ is a matter of choice and depends on the specific goals of the case for example if lowering the monitoring cost is relatively more important for the specific case then œâ should be selected greater than 1 furthermore the model performance is also evaluated by comparing the verification results with the ones given in the literature santhi et al 2001 and van liew et al 2003 pointed out that the r values greater than 0 50 can be practically accepted for many hydrological studies moriasi et al 2007 reported that pbias values less than 10 are very good estimates comparison of the results given in tables 3 and 4 with these outcomes reveals that the optimization and verification performance of the proposed approach is acceptable for most of the œâ values used in this application in a different study singh et al 2004 stated that the cases where rmse value is smaller than half of the s can be classified as the solution with low error as can be seen this classification can be valid for almost all the solutions in table 3 except for the verification with œâ 0 90 and for solutions œâ 1 shown in table 4 4 conclusions and recommendations groundwater monitoring networks are usually designed considering a homogeneous distribution over the study area however this approach does not always result in an optimal distribution of monitoring wells since from some areas redundant information is collected while at the same time information may be missing for other areas therefore the optimization approach presented here offers a meaningful way to reduce potential redundancy in the monitoring network while the spatial information about groundwater quality is also considered the basic assumptions in our study are that a monitoring network currently exists at least one set of groundwater quality data has been collected and that the present monitoring network sufficiently represents the quality of the groundwater body therefore the optimization approach is devised only to reduce redundancy meaning that wells can only be inactivated in a network the wells that are inactive i e are eliminated in the optimization process are sampling points that provide information contributing less to the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality parameter by reducing the number of monitoring wells the cost of the monitoring is also reduced which is a desired outcome of the optimization the exclusion of wells from the monitoring sampling program should be temporary as long as regulations permit and should be preserved for the future because sub basin level studies may require the use of additional wells or if the presence of any pollutant puts the groundwater body at risk an operational monitoring program may be required to be established as it is for example obliged by the european water framework directive ec 2007 however at the same time the more wells are excluded from the network the more the coverage of the monitoring network gets narrowed the proposed approach takes both the cost and the coverage of the basin into account by formulating them in a single objective function in the proposed approach the relative importance of each objective is expressed using the weighting coefficient œâ it is found that the solution of the optimization is very dependent on the selection of œâ therefore a œâ value that results with the most balanced solution must be selected most balanced means that the trade off between cost and coverage is the most acceptable to avoid a subjective decision it is highly recommended to evaluate additional performance indicators besides ns coefficient such as rmse pbias and the regression coefficient it must be once more stressed that in these types of optimization methods a subjective decision should be avoided by using some sort of performance metrics in the decision making process if such performance metrics are used then other more sophisticated decision making systems such as latin hypercube sampling or other alternatives may not be necessary in a practical sense the use of these systems would make the entire optimization process more cumbersome and difficult in the actual application on a river basin depending on which œâ coefficient is chosen the optimized monitoring networks provide groundwater quality from a different number of wells in the practice of the optimization it may be desired that monitoring wells in more problematic areas i e where groundwater is more polluted should be selected therefore it is worthwhile to confirm if the selected wells in the optimized network reflect groundwater quality data from more polluted areas comparison of mean values of wqi observed in the optimized network with values from all monitoring wells shows that mean wqi is higher for the optimized network therefore it can be clearly concluded that the optimized network provides groundwater quality data from more polluted areas this conclusion can be considered as a significant advantage of the proposed optimization approach potential limitations may arise when a monitoring well is screened in a conduit channel system which can be observed in karst aquifers in such a case the well is exposed to preferential flow of contaminant flux that can cause large temporal variations in the contaminant concentration therefore data obtained from such a well can be unreliable and may be excluded from the optimization as a final recommendation the optimization of the monitoring network should be performed periodically since monitoring efficiency is expected to change as data from new wells become available a re evaluation of the optimized monitoring network considering the addition of new wells every few years may help determine the long term effectiveness of a groundwater quality monitoring program acknowledgments the authors are grateful to dr el√ßin kentel from middle east technical university for her suggestions

7199,increasing meteorological data availability and quality implies an adaptation of the interpolation methods for data combination in this paper we propose a new method to efficiently combine weather radar data with data from two heated rain gauge networks of different quality the two networks being non collocated no common location between the two networks pseudo cross variograms are used to compute the linear model of coregionalization for kriging computation this allows considering the two networks independently in a co kriging approach the methodology is applied to the upper rh√¥ne river basin an alpine catchment in switzerland with a complex topography and an area of about 5300 km2 the analysis explores the newly proposed regression co kriging approach in which two independent rain gauge networks are considered as primary and secondary kriging variables regression co kriging is compared to four other methods including the commonly applied inverse distance weighting method used as baseline scenario incorporation of additional networks located within and around the target region in the interpolation computation is also explored the results firstly demonstrate the added value of the radar information as compared to using only ground stations as compared to regression kriging using only the network of highest quality the regression co kriging method using both networks slightly increases the performance a key outcome of the study is that regression co kriging performs better than inverse distance weighting even for the data availability scenario when the radar network was providing lower quality radar data over the studied basin the results and discussion underline that combining meteorological information from different rain gauge networks with different equipments remains challenging for operational purposes future research in this field should in particular focus on additional pre processing of the radar data to account for example for areas of low visibility of the weather radars due to the topography keywords precipitation regression co kriging rain gauge weather radar spatial interpolation alpine catchment 1 introduction in switzerland severe flooding events in recent decades have increased the need for reliable forecasting systems to mitigate flood effects in 1999 the research project minerve jordan 2007a b jordan et al 2010 jordan et al 2012 garc√≠a hern√°ndez et al 2007 2009 garc√≠a hern√°ndez 2011a b b√©rod 2013 was initiated with the objective of developing a flood forecasting and management system for the upper rh√¥ne river basin upstream of lake geneva hingray et al 2010 foehn et al 2016 after the major flood of october 2000 in the canton of valais switzerland the need for such a system has increased and since 2013 a forecasting system is operational for the entire basin and used as a tool for decision making tasks garc√≠a hern√°ndez et al 2014 since the beginning of the forecasting system development enhancing the estimation of the spatial precipitation distribution has been identified as essential jordan 2007a garc√≠a hern√°ndez 2011a tobin 2012 indeed to accurately predict flooding induced by heavy precipitation it is crucial to estimate with good accuracy the causative precipitation sikorska and seibert 2018 two main data sources are usually considered rain gauges point observations and weather radars spatial information combining these two data types has been shown to produce improved precipitation estimates foehn et al 2016 sideris et al 2014a goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 jewell and gaussiat 2015 for flood forecasting and hydrological modelling in general rain gauges provide direct precipitation measurements which can be fairly accurate but point observations are heterogeneously distributed over the domain and typically do not cover the entire elevation range of alpine basins they are also subject to various sources of error and uncertainty villarini and krajewski 2010 cecinati et al 2017a such as wind induced measurement errors ne≈°por and sevruk 1999 evaporation and wetting errors upton and rahimi 2003 or heating related losses for heated tipping buckets savina et al 2012 in addition rain gauge values have to be considered to be spatially representative of their surrounding area which is a strong hypothesis in particular for short time scales ciach and krajewski 1999 villarini et al 2008 weather radars alternatively provide a better spatial coverage but require a relatively sophisticated post treatment of the signal back scattered by the precipitation particles and are subject to significant bias and many sources of error germann et al 2006 germann et al 2009 berne and krajewski 2013 radar estimates are in general well correlated both in space and time with rain gauge data particularly for long accumulation periods but this correlation tends to decrease for sub hourly accumulation periods sideris et al 2014a a wide range of precipitation interpolation methods has been proposed in the literature for rain gauge data interpolation or radar gauge combination from rather simplistic methods such as thiessen polygons thiessen 1911 or inverse distance weighting shepard 1968 to more sophisticated methods such as simple and multiple linear regressions di piazza et al 2011 copulas vogl et al 2012 and the wide range of geostatistical methods creutin et al 1988 univariate geostatistical methods e g simple or ordinary kriging generally tend to smooth the interpolated variable and therefore struggle to accurately reproduce spatial variability multivariate geostatistical methods use additional spatial information from either static e g elevation or dynamic e g weather radar covariates to improve the interpolation performance wagner et al 2012 different approaches of multivariate geostatistics applied to precipitations have been explored in the literature including kriging with external drift ked cantet 2017 co kriging goovaerts 2000 conditional merging ehret 2003 or bayesian kriging verdin et al 2015 ly et al 2013 propose a methods review for spatial interpolation of daily rainfall data for hydrological modelling at the catchment scale regarding possible covariates additional information only few studies really focused on multivariate interpolation of hourly precipitation over alpine catchments schiemann et al 2011 showed that applying ked to hourly rain gauges and radar data over entire switzerland performs better than interpolated rain gauge data or radar data alone for flatter areas haberlandt 2007 has shown over the elbe basin in germany that for hourly precipitation the most important additional information was the radar followed by daily precipitation observations of a denser network with lower temporal resolution and finally the elevation which was considered to play only a secondary role in the studied case goovaerts 2000 reported that incorporating elevation can improve spatial interpolation of monthly and yearly rainfall when applied to a basin in southern portugal ly et al 2011 analyzed the integration of elevation in ked and ordinary co kriging and concluded that it did not improve the interpolation accuracy for daily rainfall over a basin in belgium these observations tend to agree with b√°rdossy and pegram 2013 who found over three regions in germany that correlation between precipitation and topography increases with the length of time interval sikorska and seibert 2018 showed that radar based daily precipitation estimates adjusted to precipitation rates from ground stations provided better flood predictions as compared to using only rain gauges observations sideris et al 2014a proposed a methodology applied in switzerland in which rain gauges were combined with weather radar data using data from the time step of interpolation as well as from the preceding time step as secondary co kriged variable in a co kriging with external drift ced approach comparing their spatio temporal method with a classical ked approach they concluded that the skill scores were similar when considering an aggregation time of 60 min however for shorter aggregation periods 10 30 min ced resulted in higher performance values than ked this methodology is used for the computation of the combiprecip product meteoswiss 2014a the operational hourly spatialized precipitation product of the swiss federal office of meteorology and climatology meteoswiss numerical weather forecasts can also represent an alternative covariate tobin et al 2011 have applied ked for interpolation of precipitation and temperature in switzerland using i elevation and ii the cosmo7 weather forecast product of meteoswiss meteoswiss 2017 whereas temperature measurements were found to be strongly correlated with the closest cosmo7 grid point at an hourly time step good correlation between measurements and cosmo7 estimates was observed for precipitation only for cumulative data over the event tobin et al 2011 thus proposed to use an event averaged linear drift for precipitation interpolation compared to inverse distance weighting idw and ordinary kriging ok ked with elevation tended to produce the least biased estimation in their study in terms of error ok and both ked methods using elevation and the cosmo7 data had similar scores and outperformed idw however when looking only at stations above 1500 m asl ked with cosmo7 showed the highest error for their case study in switzerland covariates can also be processed before being used in combination with rain gauge data berndt et al 2014 showed that smoothing radar data both spatially with the adjacent cells or and temporally over several time steps improved the performance of merging rain gauges and radar data instead of always using the radar pixel containing a rain gauge sideris et al 2014b incorporated in the combiprecip product a convection control routine in which the coefficient of dispersion over the 25 pixels around the rain gauge pixel is computed when a certain threshold is exceeded the value of the pixel with the closest value to the rain gauge within the 25 pixels is used for the merging commercial microwave link networks have also been explored over the last decade as a supplementary source of precipitation data messer et al 2006 hydrological applications show a great potential of this approach in particular in poorly equipped areas smiatek et al 2017 besides providing a reliable radar rain gauge combination for the target region the objective of this paper is to assess in detail what gain can be expected from combining the most recent radar data for precipitation interpolation with rain gauge data from two ground based networks of different data quality this includes a comparison to the commonly used deterministic inverse distance weighting method applied to rain gauge data as baseline scenario another key question is the quality of the radar gauge combination methodology if applied to the data situation prevailing before the installation of a new weather radar covering the studied basin in 2014 using the data from the already existing other swiss weather radars such an application allows computing series over a longer time period which is required for hydrological modelling purposes finally the paper also aims at analyzing the effect of incorporating additional station networks located within and around the target region in the interpolation computation 2 study region and data 2 1 hydrological basin the studied area corresponds to the upper rh√¥ne river basin defined as the hydrological basin between the rh√¥ne glacier on the east and lake geneva on the west the area is 5351 km2 fig 1 and the elevation varies from 372 m asl at the outlet to 4 634 m asl on the top of the dufourspitze with a mean elevation of 2158 m asl fig s 1 in supplementary material the area above 3000 m asl represents 13 0 of the area whereas the part above 4000 m asl only covers 0 3 of the total area the glacierized area has been estimated to 569 2 km2 in 2010 fischer et al 2015 which corresponds to about 10 6 of the total area yearly precipitation intensities are spatially variable over the basin the yearly average over the period 1981 2010 is of 603 mm for the station sion sio at 482 m asl and located near the center of the basin fig 1 whereas the station at col du grand st bernard gsb on the south western border and situated at 2472 m asl reported an average of 2368 mm per year over the same period meteoswiss 2014b precipitation is observed all year long with a monthly average minimum and maximum of 35 mm april to 64 mm december for sio and 135 mm july to 248 mm november for gsb depending on the elevation the solid precipitation fraction can represent a significant proportion of the annual precipitation 2 2 rain gauges data within the basin several networks of rain gauges are available within the basin but only the two networks with heated rain gauges have been considered for this study in order to make the methodology applicable all year round the first one is the swissmetnet meteoswiss 2016a network of meteoswiss hereafter refereed as smn the smn data are based on reliable equipment and subject to a serious quality control musa et al 2003 on july 1st 2013 40 smn stations were operational within the basin this number had increased to 58 on march 1st 2017 which represents an average area per station of 92 km2 which makes it a particularly dense network as a comparison on the same date the swiss average was 168 km2 per station and values reported by other authors tend to be higher about 571 km2 per station in germany berndt et al 2014 or 135 km2 in the wallon region where goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 described the network as dense a complete list of used smn stations is given in tables s 1 and s 2 supp mat for the analysis all available stations have been considered in each event regardless whether the station was available or not for the other events this implies that the number of stations considered for the computation increases over the events between 2012 and 2017 table 1 lists the equipment used in the different networks meteoswiss 2015 and the number of stations the second network is composed of 23 stations of the private company meteogroup switzerland ag hereafter refereed as mg more stations of this network are available within the basin but data from only 23 stations were available for the present study which have been selected to supplement smn stations over uncovered areas a complete list of used mg stations is given in table s 3 supp mat combined with the smn stations the average area per station over the basin drops to 66 km2 the elevation range is 381 2472 m asl for the smn stations and 460 2347 m asl for the mg stations with median elevations of respectively 1537 and 1365 m asl the analysis of the data has shown a tendency of mg stations to report less precipitation than the smn stations with differences largely exceeding 20 for some hourly time steps similar observations had been made by meteoswiss when comparing their manual daily precipitation measurements with automatic observations from meteogroup stations j fisler meteoswiss personal communication january 9 2017 in the field intercomparison of rain intensity gauges realized by vuerich et al 2009 for the account of the world meteorological organization wmo all three concerned station types or their predecessor for the ott equipment had been tested lanza and vuerich 2009 the stations used by meteoswiss were evaluated as satisfactory lambrecht and very good ott whereas the stations installed by meteogroup davis were evaluated as insufficient based on these conclusions the smn stations have been defined for this study as being the primary network and the mg stations as the secondary network this distinction will be considered when using data from both networks it is worth mentioning here that neither the meteoswiss nor the meteogroup station data are corrected for undercatch of solid precipitation which is known to have an effect on solid precipitation intensity estimation in mountainous regions egli et al 2009 2 3 rain gauges data around the basin in addition to the presented two networks located within the basin 81 stations and their 12 stations located around the basin table 1 62 stations of networks located around the basin and equipped with heated rain gauges have been considered table 1 this additional information allows a better estimation at the border of the basin as well as a more correct estimation of the precipitation fields for example in the southern neigbhouring area this is important as more than half of the meteorological situations having produced more than 110 mm d of precipitation over 3 days in the upper valais since 1975 have originated from souths according to attinger and fallot 2003 as cited in tobin et al 2011 2 4 weather radar data meteoswiss has operated since 1995 three weather radars covering the entire national territory of switzerland meteoswiss 2016b modernized in 2011 and 2012 with new technologies meteoswiss 2012 in may 2014 a fourth installation has been inaugurated at the pointe de la plaine morte see fig 1 within the basin studied in here meteoswiss 2014c followed two years later by a fifth radar in the eastern part of switzerland meteoswiss 2016c fig s 2 supp mat the radar of pointe de la plaine morte is officially operational since june 2014 the two additional radars contributed to a better radar coverage of alpine regions germann et al 2015 the back scattered signal measured by the five dual polarization doppler c band radars gabella 2017 is transformed into rain rate estimates through several procedures described in germann et al 2006 radar precipitation estimates are generated every 5 min over a 1 km resolution raster based on a combination of the data of the available radars over switzeraland for the present study the hourly aggregated radar precipitation estimates product of meteoswiss is used classified into 256 categories the production routine of the product had been optimized by meteoswiss for the configuration with 3 weather radars in switzerland a new radar precipitation estimates product is generated by meteoswiss since february 2018 but no historical data are yet available meteoswiss personal communication march 7 2018 it is worth pointing out that the highly mountainous aspect of the studied basin implies an accuracy loss of the radar estimate as compared to flatlands erdin et al 2012 beam shielding by mountain ranges is certainly one of the major issues as discussed later in section 5 to reduce this effect a fixed adjustment map computed based on a long term comparison between weather radar estimation and rain gauge measurements is used by meteoswiss in the computation of their radar precipitation estimates product germann et al 2006 however this long term comparison based correction does not consider the data of the two newly installed radars positive effect on the basin of interest is therefore probably lower than for some other regions of switzerland ground echoes elimination also requires a proper pre treatment of the data in addition radar data suffer of bias issue by over or under shooting the precipitation this is why they are combined with rain gauges to properly adjust the precipitation field furthermore solid precipitation estimation is known to be more challenging than the liquid phase resulting in better detection performance in summer than in winter speirs et al 2017 whereas melting snow tends to enhance the back scattered signal germann et al 2006 2 5 events description the main analysis is carried out on four events that occurred over the period of data availability for the meteorological radar of pointe de la plaine morte 2014 2017 additionally two events in 2012 and 2013 corresponding to the highest peak flow in the basin over the 2008 2017 period as well as an event in july 2014 during which the radar of pointe de la plaine morte was temporary not operating are also considered to discuss the performance of the methodology before the installation of the radar of pointe de la plaine morte this is important as data over several years are necessary when using the interpolated data for hydrological model calibration the four events considered for the main analysis cover different seasons and were chosen for their high precipitation accumulation over the events the period for each event has been defined such as to start two hours before the first hour with at least four smn stations reporting at least 1 5 mm h and to stop two hours after the last hour respecting this condition interruptions of less than 12 h of the above mentioned condition were considered to be part of the same event the characteristics of the events are given in table 2 and presented hereafter listed in chronological order the median and maximum accumulation values are computed from the rain gauge values the snow line elevation has been estimated from archives of short term weather forecasts of meteoswiss in fact even if recent developments enable hydrometeor type analysis from radar data grazioli et al 2015 snow line elevations cannot yet be estimated directly from the radar data return periods are provided by meteoswiss 2016d from which only statistically robust results were considered peak discharges qmax and corresponding return periods of the events at the hydrometric stations of the federal office for the environment foen 2017a b in sion and in porte du scex at the outlet of the basin fig 1 are also indicated in table 2 and discussed hereafter where relevant all times are given in utc 1 2 5 1 events without pointe de la plaine morte data event a 1 7 2012 12 00 to 2 7 2012 16 00 the event of july 2012 mostly concerned the eastern part of the basin the overall precipitation was not particularly intense with a median accumulation over all the stations of 24 3 mm but with a snow line elevation reaching 3400 m asl most of the precipitation fell as rain this resulted in a peak discharge in the rh√¥ne at sion of 703 m3 s on 2 july foen 2017b corresponding to an estimated return period of 20 years according to foen 2017a event b 28 7 2013 21 00 to 29 7 2013 17 00 the event of july 2013 touched the entire basin with locally intense storms median accumulation of 39 3 mm the high snow line elevation situated at about 2600 m asl resulted in a high proportion of rainfall which led to a peak discharges of 708 m3 s in sion and 901 m3 s in porte du scex on 29 july foen 2017b the return period of the discharge in sion was estimated to 21 years foen 2017a event c 28 7 2014 11 00 to 29 7 2014 15 00 a westerly depression affected the entire basin and particularly its western part the median accumulation reached 45 5 mm over the event the snow line elevation varied between around 2500 and 3100 m asl compared to the events in 2012 and 2013 the intense precipitation was less concentrated in time probably partially explaining why the resulting flow in downstream rivers did not reach values as high as in 2012 and 2013 see table 2 the event has the particularity of having taken place after the entry into service of the radar of pointe de la plaine morte but with the mentioned radar not being in operation over the event temporary interruption this offers a station density close to the maximum density of 2017 with a radar data configuration corresponding to the one of before 2014 without the radar of pointe de la plaine morte which is interesting for analysis purposes 2 5 2 events including pointe de la plaine morte data event 1 4 11 2014 08 00 to 6 11 2014 04 00 an active westerly disturbance with polar air resulted in heavy precipitation mostly in the eastern part of the basin the median accumulation over the 44 h was 37 5 mm but station ulrichen fig 1 reported for example 96 2 mm over 16 h corresponding to a return period of 18 years according to meteoswiss 2016d the snow limit varied between 800 and 2000 m asl event 2 30 04 2015 22 00 to 4 5 2015 10 00 a heavy precipitation event coming from the west with air relatively mild and very humid reached switzerland with successive precipitation fronts the snow limit varied between 1800 and 2600 m asl the median accumulation was 96 2 mm for a maximum accumulation over the 84 h of 375 7 mm in station clusanfe in terms of return period the station bex fig 1 in the western part of the basin reported a rainfall accumulation of 100 9 mm over 3 days corresponding to a return period of 58 years other stations within the basin reported accumulation with return periods exceeding 10 years event 3 10 1 2016 07 00 to 13 1 2016 04 00 a series of disturbances reached switzerland from the west with heavy snowfalls on the alps exceeding in some places 100 cm of fresh snow over the 3 days the snow limit varied between 800 and 1400 m asl and the median liquid equivalent precipitation was 41 2 mm event 4 5 3 2017 15 00 to 7 3 2017 13 00 strong westerly winds resulted in successive fronts towards the swiss alps with a median precipitation of 34 mm the snow limit varied between 700 and 1400 m asl over the event thus a large fraction of the precipitation fell as snow 3 methodology the high spatial variability of precipitation implies the use of methods capable of analyzing and reproducing as reliably as possible the spatial pattern of the precipitation fields on one side the interpolation method should be efficient in combining the available rain gauge and radar data considering different networks of ground stations on the other side for being used operationally it should not imply long computational time and must work on an automatic basis 3 1 estimation methods five different estimation methods are compared within this work ranging from commonly used methods to the newly proposed one handling with two non collocated rain gauge networks of varying quality the first method is the so called inverse distance weighting method shepard 1968 hereafter referred to as idw currently used within the minerve forecasting system and therefore considered as the baseline scenario this method only uses the rain gauge data the second method considers directly the raw radar value over the entire basin the three other methods combine rain gauge and radar data by applying a multiplying coefficient to the radar raster based on a linear regression of the radar data on the rain gauge data to obtain a trend corrected radar residuals defined as the difference between the value observed at a rain gauge and the value of the containing pixel of the trend are then computed at each gauge location before being interpolated the way this interpolation is carried out differentiates the three last methods the first one is applying idw to the residuals whereas the two others are based on a kriging approach webster and oliver 2007 delhomme 1978 finally interpolated residuals are added to the trend to get the final product table 3 summarizes the five methods the implementation has been done on the r language and environment for statistical computing r core team 2016 for the three regression methods the methodology and nomenclature is partly based on sideris et al 2014a 3 1 1 inverse distance weighting idw the inverse distance weighting method shepard 1968 is a deterministic interpolation method ly et al 2013 in the sense that it does not exploits the statistical properties of the observation sample thus not providing a prediction error assessment in general the aim of interpolation is to estimate the precipitation depth p at an unsampled spatial location s 0 with coordinates x 0 y 0 using the available observation data at rain gauges see table 7 for variables list idw applies a linear combination of the observations within a research radius œÅ with a decreasing influence with increasing distance the rain gauge measurements vector over a period t is given by 1 g t g s 1 t g s 2 t g s n t where n is the number of available rain gauge measurements over the period t and s x y the spatial coordinate vector of a given point the estimated precipitation p s 0 t at a given location s 0 is then given by 2 p s 0 t g s i t if i d s 0 s i 0 i 1 n Œª i g s i t i 1 n Œª i else i 0 d s 0 s i œÅ s 0 d r 2 where 3 Œª i 1 d s 0 s i Œ≤ with d being the distance between the location of interpolation and the location of observation i Œ≤ a power coefficient œÅ the research radius and d the spatial domain r is the set of real numbers the normalization allows the sum of the weights to equal 1 3 1 2 radar value radar the radar value method consists in using directly the raw radar data as the precipitation estimation over the basin the quality of the raw radar product can thereby be investigated 3 1 3 regression inverse distance weighting ridw in the three remaining methods from the geostatistical interpolation methods the radar information is used to compute a trend of the precipitation field with a multiplicative coefficient it is worth noting here that merging rain gauge and radar data implies several hypotheses sideris et al 2014a firstly it is assumed that for both the rain gauges and the radar estimates the measured physical quantity is the precipitation depth over spatial blocks of a size equal to the spatial resolution of the radar 1 km2 this ignores the difference in spatial resolution in complex topographies like in the context of this study this can have implications due to the limited spatial representativeness of rain gauges secondly the precipitation estimates of the radar over a spatial block of 1 km2 is assumed to reflect the precipitation depth falling on the surface of the same block this presumes perfect vertical precipitation fluxes and no exchange with adjacent blocks which is not the case in reality in addition it must be noted that the precipitation depth estimates given by the radar can be affected by areas of invisibility due to shielding of the radar beam by mountain ranges this obviously also impacts the performance of the interpolation in addition to the rain gauge measurements vector g t defined in the idw method the radar precipitation estimates at rain gauge locations over the period t are considered 4 r t r s 1 t r s 2 t r s n t during the interpolation radar precipitation estimates at each interpolation point are also used in geostatistics a random process z s t can be modeled as the sum of a deterministic part m z s t corresponding to the average or trend component and a stochastic residual component s t which corresponds to local fluctuations of the trend so that 5 z s t m z s t s t s d r 2 t t r where s is the vector of spatial coordinates of a given point and t the temporal domain in the context of the present work eq 5 can be rewritten for the precipitation depth p over the entire domain as 6 p s t m p s t s t the trend m p s t for a spatial coordinates vector s is commonly modeled as a linear function of a smoothly varying external variable goovaerts 1997 in our case this external variable is the radar r s t 7 m p s t a t r s t where a t is a regression coefficient and r s t is the radar values vector at time t the coefficient a t is computed as the slope of a linear regression of all pairs of points composed of the gauge values on the y axis and the values of the containing radar pixel on the x axis a t is assumed to be constant spatially in the interest of robustness in other methods such as kriging with external drift ked the trend is computed using two regression parameters thereby adding also an intercept and often evaluated within the kriging estimation process itself e g in ked the choice of a unique parameter has been motivated by the wish of maintaining zero precipitation in the trend where there was no precipitation reported by the radar estimates to compute the residuals s t the trend m p s t is subtracted from the observed value at the station locations 8 s t g s t m p s t g s t a t r s t the residuals s t are then interpolated using the inverse distance weighting method to obtain the interpolated residuals ridw s 0 t at location s 0 the final estimate is obtained by adding the trend m p s 0 t to the interpolated residual 9 p ridw s 0 t m p s 0 t ridw s 0 t s 0 d r 2 fig 2 illustrates the different steps of the ridw method 3 1 4 regression kriging rk kriging is a family of interpolation methods in which the covariance between observations is used to define a linear combination of the observations for interpolation practically kriging methods consider the increasing dissimilarity between observations to characterize the spatial structure of the data one of the conditions to apply the elementary methods of kriging simple and ordinary kriging is to assume the random variable to be first order stationary the expected value is constant over the domain of interpolation this condition is hardly satisfied when working directly with rain gauge data as it might rain for example only in one part of the basin this non stationarity of the precipitation fields is here addressed by removing a trend based on the radar data so that simple or ordinary kriging can be applied to the computed residuals this is however an approximation as the non stationarity of the precipitation statistical properties cannot be fully captured by the radar data this approach is named regression kriging rk in the present paper according to the nomenclature in odeh et al 1995 other names have been proposed for similar approaches in the literature kriging combined with linear regression ahmed and de marsily 1987 kriging detrended data phillips et al 1992 kriging with a trend model goovaerts 1997 or residual kriging alsamamra et al 2009 hengl et al 2007 discussed the characteristics of regression kriging and applied the approach to three case studies rk is somewhat similar to kriging with external drift ked the difference being that the linear regression and the kriging interpolation is done in successive steps in rk and all at once in ked this choice of successive steps allows us to define a subset of stations for a the linear regression step b the variogram computation for the spatial interpolation of the residuals and c the interpolation of the residuals to explore for example a larger number of stations in the last step eqs 5 8 about trend and residuals computation remain valid for rk the covariance of the residuals at the locations of observation is given by the nxn covariance matrix c aa 10 c aa œÉ z 2 c 12 c 1 n c 21 œÉ z 2 c 2 n c n 2 c n 2 œÉ z 2 where each element c ij of the matrix is given by the covariance between the observation locations i and j and œÉ z 2 is the variance of the observations assuming a gaussian distribution of the residuals discussed later in section 3 3 and considering a constant zero mean and known variance we use simple kriging to spatialize the residuals considering the two conditions imposed by the kriging approach which are i an unbiased estimator and ii a minimal estimation variance the following equation is obtained webster and oliver 2007 11 c aa Œª c a where c a is the covariance vector between the locations of interpolation and the observation locations resolution of the system given in eq 11 provides the weights for the linear kriging predictor used to compute residual values at the interpolation location s 0 given by the linear combination of the observations 12 rk s 0 t i 1 n Œª i s t which is then added to the trend m p s 0 t to get the expected value of the precipitation depth 13 p rk s 0 t m p s 0 t rk s 0 t s 0 d r 2 interpolation of the residual is done using a global neighborhood that means all the points are used for the interpolation 3 1 5 regression co kriging rck based on the comparative analysis between the meteoswiss and meteogroup networks see section 2 the choice was made to explore a variant of regression kriging using co kriging and hereafter referred to as regression co kriging rck co kriging has the advantage of offering the possibility of considering more than one variable in the kriging interpolation thus the multivariate rck variant allows considering different vectors of rain gauges instead of having only one vector of observations vector g t of eq 1 is replaced by two vectors 14 g a t g s a 1 t g s a 2 t g s a n a t 15 g b t g s b 1 t g s b 2 t g s b n b t where the subscripts a and b refer to the primary a and secondary b networks and n a and n b are the number of available rain gauges in respectively the primary and the secondary networks over the period t similarly the radar precipitation estimates vector of eq 4 is replaced by two vectors 16 r a t r s a 1 t r s a 2 t r s a n a t 17 r b t r s b 1 t r s b 2 t r s b n b t statements about the trend and residuals computation of eqs 5 8 remain valid the residuals are computed with the two equations 18 a s a t g a s a t a a r a s a t 19 b s b t g b s b t a b r b s b t where a a and a b are the multiplicative coefficients for the primary and secondary variables computed with a linear regression of the radar data on the rain gauge data these two terms are the result of a linear regression computed for each of the corresponding subsets of data with respect to the corresponding radar data the consideration of two variables in rck instead of one modifies eq 11 as follows myers 1982 20 c aa c ab c ba c bb Œª a Œª b c a c b where c a and c b are the covariance vectors of residuals between the unmonitored locations and the locations with observations and c ab respectively c ba the cross covariance matrix between the primary and secondary variables respectively the secondary and primary variables consequently the estimator equation is given by 21 rck s 0 t i 1 n a Œª a i a s a t i 1 n b Œª b i b s b t before being added to the trend m p s 0 t 22 p rck s 0 t m p s 0 t rck s 0 t s 0 d r 2 3 2 variogram fitting for non collocated networks computation of the weights vector Œª of eq 11 as well as Œª a and Œª b of eq 20 requires an estimate of the covariance matrices instead of computing the covariance which is sensitive to sampling effects kriging generally uses the concept of semivariogram matheron 1971 which represents how the dissimilarity between pairs of points increases with increasing separation distance the semivariogram or simply variogram as called from now is defined for the univariate case and expressed in terms of precipitation residuals by 23 Œ≥ a h 1 2 n h i 1 n h s i s i h i 2 s i s i h i d r 2 h i h b 2 h b 2 where h is the distance lag between pairs of locations Œ≥ a h the variogram value for distance lag h b the bin size the width of the distance interval up to which point pairs are grouped for variogram computation h i the distance separing a given pair of points n h the number of considered pairs of observations separated by distance h a s i the residual value at location s i and s i h i the residual value at location s i h i pebesma 2014 in the case of regression kriging one variogram is computed with eq 23 for each time step of computation for the regression co kriging two direct variogams one for each variable and one cross variogram must be computed to define the so called linear model of coregionalization webster and oliver 2007 for the computation of the cross variogram eq 23 must be generalized to two variables identified by the subscript a and b 24 Œ≥ ab h 1 2 n h i 1 n h a s i a s i h i b s i b s i h i s i s i h i d r 2 h i h b 2 h b 2 where b s i is the residual value at location s i and b s i h i the residual value at location s i h i however eq 24 can be used only in case of collocated variables observations for both variables are available for a sufficient number of given points in the case of smn and mg stations this is not the case as stations are situated in different locations accordingly one needs to work with so called pseudo cross variograms in which pairs of both variables are considered as proposed by pebesma 2014 25 Œ≥ ab h 1 2 n h i 1 n h a s i b s i h i 2 s i s i h i d r 2 h i h b 2 h b 2 where Œ≥ ab h is the pseudo cross variogram value for distance lag h considering variables a and b the equivalence between variogram and covariance is defined for second order stationary processes for which the variogram is always bounded as follows webster and oliver 2007 26 Œ≥ h c 0 c h where Œ≥ h is the variogram value for a distance h c 0 is the covariance at h 0 and c h the covariance at distance h if the variogram is bounded by a sill the value of c 0 is equal to the total sill value in the present study the variogram models have been fitted using the package gstat pebesma and graeler 2017 within the software r r core team 2016 the empirical variogram has been fitted with a spherical variogram model schuurmans et al 2007 27 Œ≥ h 0 if h 0 k 0 k 3 h 2 Œ± h 3 2 Œ± 3 if 0 h Œ± k 0 k if h Œ± in which k 0 is the nugget value k the partial sill Œ± the range distance within which measures are considered correlated the implemented code explores different values of bin size until a valid variogram model can be fitted the routine also tries to obtain a low nugget to sill ratio by gradually increasing a success threshold 100 iterations are first attempted with a threshold value of 0 1 if none of the obtained valid models has a nugget to sill ratio lower than the threshold the threshold is increased by 0 1 until 0 9 with each time 100 iterations in case of failure with the highest threshold value the last valid variogram of previous time steps is considered anisotropy of the variogram different spatial variability in different directions has not been explored in this work this choice is justified by the use of the radar data in which spatial variability of the precipitation fields is assumed to be contained and therefore considered in the interpolation process 3 3 transformation precipitation is inherently heteroscedastic the variance is not constant over the domain and has a skewed distribution which is in contradiction with basic assumptions of classical geostatistics which assumes a gaussian distribution and stationarity of the mean and spatial covariance erdin et al 2012 therefore several methods have been explored in the literature to transform the data before their interpolation sideris et al 2014a erdin et al 2012 schuurmans et al 2007 and it has been shown that quantitative improvements is dependent on temporal and spatial variability cecinati et al 2017b the process of applying kriging to data transformed into a more gaussian distribution is generally named trans gaussian kriging in the case of the two methods employing kriging in this paper namely regression kriging rk and regression co kriging rck interpolation is not done directly on the precipitation observations but on the residuals see section 3 1 to which the gaussianity issue therefore applies a transformation is applied to both the rain gauge and the radar data to translate them into a more gaussian distribution with the objective of getting better gaussianity in the residuals in this paper we use for both rk 3 1 4 and rck 3 1 5 methods a square root transformation of the data sideris et al 2014a analysis of the residuals distribution has shown that this transformation tends to increase overall the gaussianity of the residuals even though the effect is somewhat limited and for few time steps even negative in analysing the effect of such data transformation on precipitation interpolation erdin et al 2012 reported only small effects of transformation for the point estimates but mentioned that transformation improved the reliability of the probabilistic estimates substantially the corresponding gain of introducing such transformation scheme is disscussed in section 4 2 2 the advantage of the square root transformation is the possibility of analytical back transformation of the mean and the variance sideris et al 2014a given by 28 e y 2 Œº y 2 œÉ y 2 and 29 var y 2 4 Œº y 2 œÉ y 2 2 œÉ y 4 where Œº y is the mean and œÉ y the standard deviation of the square root transformed kriging prediction at a certain location whereas e y 2 represents the expected value of the back transformed random variable or in other words the final prediction and var y 2 the related variance however eq 28 is composed of two positive terms both are squared values with the variance œÉ y 2 being positive and reaching the sample variance of the transformed residuals at estimation locations situated at a distance from the nearest observation higher than the variogram model range eq 27 thereby the back transformed estimation would never provide zero precipitation estimates apart from rain gauge locations where estimation variance is minimum in the work of sideris et al 2014a this problem is addressed by correcting the interpolated field and assigning zero precipitation to locations where the radar does not show any precipitation i sideris personal communication may 30 2017 the methodology proposed here overcomes this issue by weighting the variance term of eq 28 with the predicted precipitation 30 œÉ y 2 Œº y 2 œÑ œÉ y 2 where œÑ is a precipitation intensity threshold below which the variance is weighted and œÉ y 2 is the variance effectively added in eq 28 instead of œÉ y 2 which gives 31 e y 2 Œº y 2 œÉ y 2 where e y 2 represents the expected value of the back transformed random variable considering the modified estimation variance the value for œÑ has been fixed to 0 5 mm h after initial tests the impact of applying the transformation or not is discussed in section 4 2 2 3 4 skill scores and cross validation the performance analysis is based on the leave one out approach the precipitation is estimated at a rain gauge location using all observations except the one corresponding to the interpolation location the procedure is undertaken on an hourly basis for each location and for each of the methods the quality of the point estimates is then assessed over all locations for each time step using following skill scores 1 bias systematic errors are assessed with the bias indicator 32 bias t 10 log 10 i 1 n g i t i 1 n g i t where g i t refers to the estimated value for a given location and a given time step g i t to the observed value and n to the number of considered locations as a result of the logarithmic scale used in eq 32 the bias is expressed in decibel db for each event the overall bias is averaged over the entire period and the entire spatial extent the bias has been computed only for hourly time steps during which the mean precipitation over the meteoswiss stations was higher than 0 5 mm h this avoids values at the denominator close to 0 resulting in exaggeratedly high bias values 2 mad the median absolute deviation mad provides the median of the absolute value of the difference between estimated and observed values sideris et al 2014a 33 mad t median g i t g i t 3 rmse the root mean square error is the most common parameter used in verification goudenhoofdt

16 and Œæ 84 represent the 16 and the 84 percentiles of the cumulative error distribution function only pairs of points for which both estimated and observed values where higher than 0 5 mm h were considered for the computation of the scatter 3 5 methodology application for the idw method a value of 2 common default value is given to the power coefficient Œ≤ eq 3 and the research radius is fixed to 50 km for the methods including a regression of the radar data the regression has been computed only on stations located within the basin for the methods considering a single rain gauge network idw ridw and rk the primary variable smn data are considered for the rck method both primary smn and secondary mg variables data are used variograms fitting with an insufficient number of points can lead to ill defined variogram for the rk method a minimum of 5 stations with a precipitation of at least 0 5 mm h is set as condition for the rck method the condition is set to 5 stations exceeding the same precipitation threshold value for each variable when the condition is not satisfied the last previously computed valid variogram is used the condition being generally not satisfied at the beginning of an event an initial variogram must preliminarily be computed over an arbitrarily chosen time step during the event with sufficient stations exceeding the threshold in addition for both the rk and rck methods the model fitting has been constrained to a maximum range of 50 km this value has been defined based on visual variogram analysis and allows to constrain the model for experimental variograms that do not show a clear upper bound 4 results the five methods presented in section 3 and listed in table 5 have been applied to the four events presented in section 2 5 2 for all the five methods the interpolation has been computed over a grid with a resolution corresponding to the one of the raw radar data 1 km 2 per pixel for the cross validation the computation was based on the locations of the smn rain gauges within the basin even if more stations such as mg stations were used for the interpolation to ensure a constant comparison basis for all methods it is worth noting here that no direct comparison has been possible within this study with the combiprecip product of meteoswiss as no leave one out computation was possible on the delivered combiprecip product the performance of the different methods is first discussed based on the cross validation approach including a discussion of the performance before the installation of the new weather radar in 2014 results of the variogram fitting and the effect of data transformation are then presented the last section discusses the effect of additional networks 4 1 methods performance analysis in order to assess the performance of the different methods the presented performance indicators have been computed for the four events 1 to 4 table 2 for each performance indicator table 4 hourly values were averaged over each event results are given in fig 3 the cumulative volume over the events considering all the pixels located within the basin is also presented dashed line border the estimation method considering only raw radar data radar clearly shows the weakest performance particularly in terms of bias which confirms the need of bias correction of the raw radar data with a regression using rain gauges this observation is strengthened by the total volume that differs substantially from the other methods for part of the events overall the rck method provides the best performance this is the case for the mrte indicator for which the rck method provides the best value over all four events in terms of absolute bias rck outperforms for all the events the rk method but for some events other methods such as idw perform better than rck furthermore the results are not clear for all the indicators for example for event 1 rmse and scatter values are comparable for rck and idw it is worth to recall here that the station density within the basin is particularly high which allows idw to reach already good performances it must also be pointed out that idw has been applied with the default value of 2 for the exponent Œ≤ of eq 2 adjustment of this parameter could improve the performance of the idw method for a finer analysis fig 4 presents hourly values for the four performance indicators computed at each time step for the reference idw method and the rck method scatter is not shown here as it is computed directly over the events results for the bias show how reactive the indicator can be with a strong negative value for the rck method on 2 may 2015 at 16 00 however this corresponds to the beginning of the second front and only few stations already observed precipitation in which case one single important cross validation error can strongly affect the hourly indicator value it must also be noted that such single negative respectively positive values can compensate for an overall positive respectively negative bias value and lead to an improvement in the overall value this is one of the limitation of the bias indicator regarding the three other indicators all strictly positive by definition it is interesting to note the varying difference between the two methods over the three fronts whereas there is only a small gain of rck over idw over the first front it increases over the second and third front in particular for the mrte indicator when analyzing the different fronts it appears that over the third one only the north western part of the basin is covered by the precipitation fig 5 the gain of integrating the radar information is here clearly visible with the idw method not being able to reproduce the sharp gradient cutting the basin in two parts figs s 5 to s 10 supp mat show the same indicators for the 6 other events when analyzing the cross validation errors of event 1 it appeared that the station col du grand st bernard gsb resulted almost systematically over the entire event in high cross validation errors with both idw and rck methods not being able to correctly reproduce the observed precipitation despite using the radar information in the rck method when looking at the total precipitation over the event for both methods the gsb station is also very well visible at the south western corner of the basin fig 6 the high difference between the rain gauge values and the bias corrected radar data only at this station suggested to further investigate this particularity interestingly this station located at an elevation of 2472 m asl had already been pointed out in a precedent analysis erdin et al 2012 in which the station was reported to suffer of several known measurement problems shielding wind exposure and drifting snow and with a snow limit varying between 1000 and 2000 m asl over the event 1 the gsb station only measured solid precipitation to investigate the impact of the station over the global performance over the event the interpolation has been recomputed by totally excluding the gsb station fig 7 shows the result for the two methods both with and without considering the gsb station results show that all indicators are improved when removing the station in particular for rmse and mrte the difference is non negligible this example shows well how considering as truth the data from the rain gauges can lead to incoherence or errors in the interpolation result the analysis carried out over events 1 to 4 considered radar data including the new radar of pointe de la plaine morte in order to assess the quality of the swiss wide radar product over the studied basin before the installation of this new radar performances over the three events a b and c are presented in fig 8 the performance gain of rck over idw for the three events is higher than for events 1 to 4 this is probably partly explained by the number of rain gauges available over the three events only 28 and 40 smn stations for 2012 event a and 2013 event b whereas at least 52 stations were available for the events 1 to 4 the lower station density reduces the performance of idw and thereby increases the relative gain of rck over idw the performance of the rck method over the three analyzed events excluding pointe de la plaine morte radar data suggests that this method provides clearly better results than idw for the studied basin even before the installation of the new weather radar this is an important result in the perspective of computing precipitation fields for hydrological modelling with data requirement over relatively long time periods as it shows that even with an alpine topography like the one in the studied basin radar data seem to be usable even without a weather radar located within the basin 4 2 variogram and data transformation analysis performance of the variogram model fitting for the results presented in section 4 1 are presented hereafter before analyzing the effect of data transformation looking at the rck method 4 2 1 variogram fitting results good fitting of the variogram is essential to obtain a reliable interpolation the implemented solution resulted in few time steps 0 5 without valid variogram fitting this considers only the time steps with enough stations reporting sufficient precipitation as defined in section 3 5 the percentage of time steps with insufficient stations is considerably high 7 4 for the rk method and 31 7 for the rck method of the time steps over the four events 1 to 4 these time steps generally correspond to the lower intensity phase of the events for all these time steps both failure and insufficient stations the previously computed last valid variogram was used instead fig 9 shows four direct variograms for the rk method over event 3 the differences in bin size are well visible the fewer points are visible on a sample variogram the more points were grouped together and averaged to compute each point of the experimental variogram fig 10 gives an example of the linear model of coregionalization composed of two direct variograms smn and mg and one pseudo cross variogram smn vs mg all three fitted simultaneously the higher variability observed in the mg direct variogram tends to be a common behavior within this study this difference cannot be directly attributed to a difference in the quality of the mg sensors as these stations are also much less numerous with only 23 mg stations for 52 smn stations over the chosen event enhancing the issue of limited number of wet stations for the mg network in addition if most of the fitted models describe well the experimental variogram for some times steps a manual fitting would probably have led to more appropriate fittings 4 2 2 effect of data transformation the rck method has been applied to events 1 to 4 both with and without transformation fig 11 the bias is considerably improved for two of the four considered events when applying the discussed square root transformation eq 31 for the mrte a gain is observed for all events for the other indicators the difference is less important and more variable for example for the mad for which loss and gain are observed for the scatter the tendency is slightly negative probably due to the back transformation process these results are coherent with the conclusions of erdin et al 2012 who reported only small effects of the transformation on the point estimates but reported a higher reliability of the estimates when comparing each gauge measurement against the probability function of the corresponding cross validation probabilistic estimate further improvements in the transformation could be explored not only on the power coefficient of the transformation but also on the back transformation process based on the obtained results applying the proposed transformation is recommended 4 3 effect of additional networks in the results presented in section 4 1 the mg data have been used only in the rck method as secondary variable combination of smn and mg data as a unique set of data is discussed hereafter fig 12 presents the performance indicators for the idw ridw and rk methods each time considering first smn data only and then combining smn and mg data considering them together as one single variable table 6 results of rck using smn data as primary variable and mg as secondary variable are also presented for all indicators except the bias considering mg data directly with smn data as one single variable tended to improve the performance of the methods as compared to use only smn data which can be explained by the additional local information introduced by the mg stations performances were in some cases even slightly better than for rck in which both variables are considered separately however and as expected from the data analysis presented in section 2 study area and data this joint use of smn and mg data resulted in negative biases this effect is well visible in particular for events 3 and 4 fig 12 where values exceeded 0 6 db corresponding to a negative bias of about 13 consequently this bias issue suggests to consider both variables only with methods accounting for this deviation that means in the present case the rck method the present study also aimed at providing a preliminary analysis of integrating stations from surrounding areas this is justified by the need for accurate information in terms of precipitation estimates for real time hydro meteorological monitoring and forecasting fig 13 shows for a time step of event 2 the interpolation results of rck using only smn and mg data compared to the results obtained with integrating the data from all surroundings additional networks with the additional stations precipitation estimates are for example increased over the aosta region south of the studied basin see fig 13c for a more quantitative assessment fig 14 gives the corresponding performance indicators including different combinations of primary and secondary variables for the precipitation interpolation the additional data have however not been used for the linear regression computation nor for the variogram fitting this was motivated respectively to ensure an optimal radar regression over the studied basin and to reduce the risk of inconsistencies in the variogram model fitting sensitive to discrepancies in even only one or two stations potentially affecting the entire interpolation of a given time step the results show that adding additional networks has a limited effect bias tends to be the most reactive indicator even tough differences are small for the other indicators as well as for the total precipitated volume differences can be considered as limited and it is difficult to define if it is rather a gain or a loss in terms of performance for some time steps some stations of the additional networks reported no precipitation whereas the radar reported heavy precipitation suggesting some possible quality issues for operational purposes the quality of these additional networks should be further investigated 5 discussion the performance analysis used in this paper based on leave one out cross validation did not allow a direct comparison with outputs of previous works for example with the combiprecip product as described in sideris et al 2014a in fact the stations used in the cross validation evaluation are used in the computation of the product thus no comparison was possible however visual analysis of the interpolated precipitation fields revealed that the spatial patterns were very similar for a very large fraction of the time steps integration of the discussed interpolated precipitation fields into a hydrological model could allow a quantitative comparison between the products from a hydrological point of view furthermore the analysis was carried out over the set of recent most heavy precipitation events which were not evenly spread through all seasons with events 1 to 4 period 2014 2017 occurring from fall to spring and with events a to c period 2012 2014 only in summer this could have an impact on the analysis but should not modify the general conclusions from the comparison between methods the choice of performance indicators can also slightly modify the results of the analysis for example we decided to work with a bias indicator based on a ratio between estimated and observed values indicator also used by several other authors sideris et al 2014a goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 however alternative versions exist based for example on a differential bias cecinati et al 2017b less sensitive to small denominators two aspects of the presented precipitation interpolation deserve further discussion namely the integration of different rain gauge networks and remaining challenges due mainly to radar visibility regarding the integration of the data from the private meteogroup mg raingauges it is important to point out here that their added value is probably somewhat underestimated in the presented results in fact their contribution to the overall interpolation quality is analyzed only via cross validation applied to the meteoswiss smn stations this cross validation does probably not show a complete picture of the contribution brought by the mg stations as i the mg stations have been selected to complete the smn network in areas without smn stations and ii the mg stations contribute to the final interpolated precipitation field mostly in their immediate vicinity as expected including the radar data as external drift considerably improved the precipitation interpolation for all tested methods however any radar data set in a comparably complex area is highly likely to suffer from several quality issues such as radar beam shielding by mountain peaks located in close vicinity of the radars for our case study the mont bonvin 2994 m asl located two kilometers south east of the radar of pointe de la plaine morte 2926 m asl creates such a blind zone due to radar shielding in south eastern direction from the radar location visible in fig 15 in this area precipitation is highly likely to be underestimated by the radar this effect remains visible in the final estimation method retained here rck on the radar residuals with smn as primary and mg as secondary variable and is visible on fig 13 a similar effect can be seen on fig 6 b for a second radar the monte lema radar south east of the case study basin see fig s 2 in supp mat in fact before the installation of the new radar at pointe de la plaine morte such shielding beams were already common over the studied basin as illustrated in the supplementary material figs s 3 and s 4 the radar network configuration in terms of installed devices is supposed to not evolve in the near future the most promising directions to further improve precipitation interpolation under the current configuration are thus the following i better accounting for radar shielding effects the replacement by meteoswiss of their radar precipitation estimates product used for the present study by a new version optimized for the new network configuration with 5 weather radars will certainly contribute positively to this issue further investigations could e g consist in developing a raster of radar data quality based on the visibility of the weather radars or by analyzing the annual radar precipitation estimates such a method to account for radar quality should also consider temporal variations of the radar network configuration resulting from temporary inactivity of individual weather radars due e g to technical failures or scheduled maintenance ii improvement of the regression of the radar data on the rain gauge data e g by including a second coefficient in the linear regression eq 7 by developing a more local regression method that could account explicitly for summer convective precipitation or by integrating other covariates e g topography in addition latest developments in the field of hydrometeor type classification from radar data grazioli et al 2015 might open up new perspectives on precipitation radar data integration for mixed snow and rain events in the near future as well as higher quality radar precipitation estimates during snow fall a final point worth mentioning is the potential integration of secondary rain gauge networks composed of non heated stations that can only observe liquid precipitation such as the agrometeo network agroscope 2017 or the imis network slf 2017 to further increase the density of rain observation stations this is readily possible with the retained interpolation methodology and could potentially reduce the precipitation estimation error during rainfall events however 75 1 percent of the studied area lies above 1500 m asl where precipitation occurs regularly in the form of snow between november and march marty 2008 in addition with the high density of higher quality data already available it is not sure that this would improve the performance 6 conclusion this paper proposes a new method named regression co kriging for spatial interpolation of observed precipitation from two non collocated rain gauge networks of different quality with radar data compared to the precipitation fields routinely produced in real time by the swiss national meteorological service meteoswiss sideris et al 2014a based on the observed precipitation data from their swissmetnet smn network the final interpolation method retained here additionally integrates data from the network of the private company meteogroup switzerland ag mg the performance of the interpolated precipitation fields is assessed for four events over a swiss alpine region the upper rh√¥ne river basin using inverse distance weighting applied directly to the rain gauge observations as baseline scenario a series of well established precipitation interpolation methods are tested including methods that use i the radar data as an external drift to compute an overall precipitation trend and ii the rain gauge data to form local residuals that are spatially interpolated and added to the trend since the station locations of the two networks do not coincide the concept of pseudo cross variogram is employed to compute the linear model of coregionalization used for the co kriging interpolation the completed detailed tests demonstrated that regression co kriging using the smn data as primary variable and mg data as secondary variable to interpolate the local precipitation residuals provides the best performance for the study area the method even proved to clearly outperform the inverse distance weighting method for historical data availability scenarios before the radar network was completed and with lower rain gauge station density this result is important for hydrological applications where data over many years are required the gain introduced by the co kriging approach is demonstrated by showing a bias issue when considering both networks jointly linked to a difference in the networks quality regardless of the spatial scale data combination must therefore consider with care the quality of the sensors providing the data when elaborating a combination methodology the results of the analysis also showed that even with up to date modern weather radar equipments radar gauge combination in a complex topography such as the swiss alps requires a high level treatment of the data this is particularly true for reducing the artefacts due to beam shielding by the topography an interesting side result of this study is the fact that if a single rain gauge network smn stations is combined with radar data a kriging based residual interpolation does not clearly outperform a simple inverse distance weighting of the residuals this is probably explained at least partly by the relatively low number of rain gauges that report precipitation for some time steps over the considered domain which is often near the limit or even below the minimum required number to obtain robust variograms which is particularly limiting for rck where two variables need to meet this criterion overall the presented results underline the importance of analyzing in detail the evolving data situation to propose robust precipitation interpolation methods this not only holds for regions where the rain gauge and radar network is evolving any existing network might indeed suffer from device failures and ensuing missing data in general the detailed analysis of different rain gauge networks provided here including networks of neighbouring regions networks of different quality illustrates that integration of several networks for operational interpolation purposes is not straightforward since the available meteorological data quantity and quality is permanently increasing there is ample room for further studies on improving quantitative precipitation estimates for complex alpine environments based on our analysis the most promising research direction is certainly the pre processing of the radar data in particular to account for known beam shielding effects and

7199,increasing meteorological data availability and quality implies an adaptation of the interpolation methods for data combination in this paper we propose a new method to efficiently combine weather radar data with data from two heated rain gauge networks of different quality the two networks being non collocated no common location between the two networks pseudo cross variograms are used to compute the linear model of coregionalization for kriging computation this allows considering the two networks independently in a co kriging approach the methodology is applied to the upper rh√¥ne river basin an alpine catchment in switzerland with a complex topography and an area of about 5300 km2 the analysis explores the newly proposed regression co kriging approach in which two independent rain gauge networks are considered as primary and secondary kriging variables regression co kriging is compared to four other methods including the commonly applied inverse distance weighting method used as baseline scenario incorporation of additional networks located within and around the target region in the interpolation computation is also explored the results firstly demonstrate the added value of the radar information as compared to using only ground stations as compared to regression kriging using only the network of highest quality the regression co kriging method using both networks slightly increases the performance a key outcome of the study is that regression co kriging performs better than inverse distance weighting even for the data availability scenario when the radar network was providing lower quality radar data over the studied basin the results and discussion underline that combining meteorological information from different rain gauge networks with different equipments remains challenging for operational purposes future research in this field should in particular focus on additional pre processing of the radar data to account for example for areas of low visibility of the weather radars due to the topography keywords precipitation regression co kriging rain gauge weather radar spatial interpolation alpine catchment 1 introduction in switzerland severe flooding events in recent decades have increased the need for reliable forecasting systems to mitigate flood effects in 1999 the research project minerve jordan 2007a b jordan et al 2010 jordan et al 2012 garc√≠a hern√°ndez et al 2007 2009 garc√≠a hern√°ndez 2011a b b√©rod 2013 was initiated with the objective of developing a flood forecasting and management system for the upper rh√¥ne river basin upstream of lake geneva hingray et al 2010 foehn et al 2016 after the major flood of october 2000 in the canton of valais switzerland the need for such a system has increased and since 2013 a forecasting system is operational for the entire basin and used as a tool for decision making tasks garc√≠a hern√°ndez et al 2014 since the beginning of the forecasting system development enhancing the estimation of the spatial precipitation distribution has been identified as essential jordan 2007a garc√≠a hern√°ndez 2011a tobin 2012 indeed to accurately predict flooding induced by heavy precipitation it is crucial to estimate with good accuracy the causative precipitation sikorska and seibert 2018 two main data sources are usually considered rain gauges point observations and weather radars spatial information combining these two data types has been shown to produce improved precipitation estimates foehn et al 2016 sideris et al 2014a goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 jewell and gaussiat 2015 for flood forecasting and hydrological modelling in general rain gauges provide direct precipitation measurements which can be fairly accurate but point observations are heterogeneously distributed over the domain and typically do not cover the entire elevation range of alpine basins they are also subject to various sources of error and uncertainty villarini and krajewski 2010 cecinati et al 2017a such as wind induced measurement errors ne≈°por and sevruk 1999 evaporation and wetting errors upton and rahimi 2003 or heating related losses for heated tipping buckets savina et al 2012 in addition rain gauge values have to be considered to be spatially representative of their surrounding area which is a strong hypothesis in particular for short time scales ciach and krajewski 1999 villarini et al 2008 weather radars alternatively provide a better spatial coverage but require a relatively sophisticated post treatment of the signal back scattered by the precipitation particles and are subject to significant bias and many sources of error germann et al 2006 germann et al 2009 berne and krajewski 2013 radar estimates are in general well correlated both in space and time with rain gauge data particularly for long accumulation periods but this correlation tends to decrease for sub hourly accumulation periods sideris et al 2014a a wide range of precipitation interpolation methods has been proposed in the literature for rain gauge data interpolation or radar gauge combination from rather simplistic methods such as thiessen polygons thiessen 1911 or inverse distance weighting shepard 1968 to more sophisticated methods such as simple and multiple linear regressions di piazza et al 2011 copulas vogl et al 2012 and the wide range of geostatistical methods creutin et al 1988 univariate geostatistical methods e g simple or ordinary kriging generally tend to smooth the interpolated variable and therefore struggle to accurately reproduce spatial variability multivariate geostatistical methods use additional spatial information from either static e g elevation or dynamic e g weather radar covariates to improve the interpolation performance wagner et al 2012 different approaches of multivariate geostatistics applied to precipitations have been explored in the literature including kriging with external drift ked cantet 2017 co kriging goovaerts 2000 conditional merging ehret 2003 or bayesian kriging verdin et al 2015 ly et al 2013 propose a methods review for spatial interpolation of daily rainfall data for hydrological modelling at the catchment scale regarding possible covariates additional information only few studies really focused on multivariate interpolation of hourly precipitation over alpine catchments schiemann et al 2011 showed that applying ked to hourly rain gauges and radar data over entire switzerland performs better than interpolated rain gauge data or radar data alone for flatter areas haberlandt 2007 has shown over the elbe basin in germany that for hourly precipitation the most important additional information was the radar followed by daily precipitation observations of a denser network with lower temporal resolution and finally the elevation which was considered to play only a secondary role in the studied case goovaerts 2000 reported that incorporating elevation can improve spatial interpolation of monthly and yearly rainfall when applied to a basin in southern portugal ly et al 2011 analyzed the integration of elevation in ked and ordinary co kriging and concluded that it did not improve the interpolation accuracy for daily rainfall over a basin in belgium these observations tend to agree with b√°rdossy and pegram 2013 who found over three regions in germany that correlation between precipitation and topography increases with the length of time interval sikorska and seibert 2018 showed that radar based daily precipitation estimates adjusted to precipitation rates from ground stations provided better flood predictions as compared to using only rain gauges observations sideris et al 2014a proposed a methodology applied in switzerland in which rain gauges were combined with weather radar data using data from the time step of interpolation as well as from the preceding time step as secondary co kriged variable in a co kriging with external drift ced approach comparing their spatio temporal method with a classical ked approach they concluded that the skill scores were similar when considering an aggregation time of 60 min however for shorter aggregation periods 10 30 min ced resulted in higher performance values than ked this methodology is used for the computation of the combiprecip product meteoswiss 2014a the operational hourly spatialized precipitation product of the swiss federal office of meteorology and climatology meteoswiss numerical weather forecasts can also represent an alternative covariate tobin et al 2011 have applied ked for interpolation of precipitation and temperature in switzerland using i elevation and ii the cosmo7 weather forecast product of meteoswiss meteoswiss 2017 whereas temperature measurements were found to be strongly correlated with the closest cosmo7 grid point at an hourly time step good correlation between measurements and cosmo7 estimates was observed for precipitation only for cumulative data over the event tobin et al 2011 thus proposed to use an event averaged linear drift for precipitation interpolation compared to inverse distance weighting idw and ordinary kriging ok ked with elevation tended to produce the least biased estimation in their study in terms of error ok and both ked methods using elevation and the cosmo7 data had similar scores and outperformed idw however when looking only at stations above 1500 m asl ked with cosmo7 showed the highest error for their case study in switzerland covariates can also be processed before being used in combination with rain gauge data berndt et al 2014 showed that smoothing radar data both spatially with the adjacent cells or and temporally over several time steps improved the performance of merging rain gauges and radar data instead of always using the radar pixel containing a rain gauge sideris et al 2014b incorporated in the combiprecip product a convection control routine in which the coefficient of dispersion over the 25 pixels around the rain gauge pixel is computed when a certain threshold is exceeded the value of the pixel with the closest value to the rain gauge within the 25 pixels is used for the merging commercial microwave link networks have also been explored over the last decade as a supplementary source of precipitation data messer et al 2006 hydrological applications show a great potential of this approach in particular in poorly equipped areas smiatek et al 2017 besides providing a reliable radar rain gauge combination for the target region the objective of this paper is to assess in detail what gain can be expected from combining the most recent radar data for precipitation interpolation with rain gauge data from two ground based networks of different data quality this includes a comparison to the commonly used deterministic inverse distance weighting method applied to rain gauge data as baseline scenario another key question is the quality of the radar gauge combination methodology if applied to the data situation prevailing before the installation of a new weather radar covering the studied basin in 2014 using the data from the already existing other swiss weather radars such an application allows computing series over a longer time period which is required for hydrological modelling purposes finally the paper also aims at analyzing the effect of incorporating additional station networks located within and around the target region in the interpolation computation 2 study region and data 2 1 hydrological basin the studied area corresponds to the upper rh√¥ne river basin defined as the hydrological basin between the rh√¥ne glacier on the east and lake geneva on the west the area is 5351 km2 fig 1 and the elevation varies from 372 m asl at the outlet to 4 634 m asl on the top of the dufourspitze with a mean elevation of 2158 m asl fig s 1 in supplementary material the area above 3000 m asl represents 13 0 of the area whereas the part above 4000 m asl only covers 0 3 of the total area the glacierized area has been estimated to 569 2 km2 in 2010 fischer et al 2015 which corresponds to about 10 6 of the total area yearly precipitation intensities are spatially variable over the basin the yearly average over the period 1981 2010 is of 603 mm for the station sion sio at 482 m asl and located near the center of the basin fig 1 whereas the station at col du grand st bernard gsb on the south western border and situated at 2472 m asl reported an average of 2368 mm per year over the same period meteoswiss 2014b precipitation is observed all year long with a monthly average minimum and maximum of 35 mm april to 64 mm december for sio and 135 mm july to 248 mm november for gsb depending on the elevation the solid precipitation fraction can represent a significant proportion of the annual precipitation 2 2 rain gauges data within the basin several networks of rain gauges are available within the basin but only the two networks with heated rain gauges have been considered for this study in order to make the methodology applicable all year round the first one is the swissmetnet meteoswiss 2016a network of meteoswiss hereafter refereed as smn the smn data are based on reliable equipment and subject to a serious quality control musa et al 2003 on july 1st 2013 40 smn stations were operational within the basin this number had increased to 58 on march 1st 2017 which represents an average area per station of 92 km2 which makes it a particularly dense network as a comparison on the same date the swiss average was 168 km2 per station and values reported by other authors tend to be higher about 571 km2 per station in germany berndt et al 2014 or 135 km2 in the wallon region where goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 described the network as dense a complete list of used smn stations is given in tables s 1 and s 2 supp mat for the analysis all available stations have been considered in each event regardless whether the station was available or not for the other events this implies that the number of stations considered for the computation increases over the events between 2012 and 2017 table 1 lists the equipment used in the different networks meteoswiss 2015 and the number of stations the second network is composed of 23 stations of the private company meteogroup switzerland ag hereafter refereed as mg more stations of this network are available within the basin but data from only 23 stations were available for the present study which have been selected to supplement smn stations over uncovered areas a complete list of used mg stations is given in table s 3 supp mat combined with the smn stations the average area per station over the basin drops to 66 km2 the elevation range is 381 2472 m asl for the smn stations and 460 2347 m asl for the mg stations with median elevations of respectively 1537 and 1365 m asl the analysis of the data has shown a tendency of mg stations to report less precipitation than the smn stations with differences largely exceeding 20 for some hourly time steps similar observations had been made by meteoswiss when comparing their manual daily precipitation measurements with automatic observations from meteogroup stations j fisler meteoswiss personal communication january 9 2017 in the field intercomparison of rain intensity gauges realized by vuerich et al 2009 for the account of the world meteorological organization wmo all three concerned station types or their predecessor for the ott equipment had been tested lanza and vuerich 2009 the stations used by meteoswiss were evaluated as satisfactory lambrecht and very good ott whereas the stations installed by meteogroup davis were evaluated as insufficient based on these conclusions the smn stations have been defined for this study as being the primary network and the mg stations as the secondary network this distinction will be considered when using data from both networks it is worth mentioning here that neither the meteoswiss nor the meteogroup station data are corrected for undercatch of solid precipitation which is known to have an effect on solid precipitation intensity estimation in mountainous regions egli et al 2009 2 3 rain gauges data around the basin in addition to the presented two networks located within the basin 81 stations and their 12 stations located around the basin table 1 62 stations of networks located around the basin and equipped with heated rain gauges have been considered table 1 this additional information allows a better estimation at the border of the basin as well as a more correct estimation of the precipitation fields for example in the southern neigbhouring area this is important as more than half of the meteorological situations having produced more than 110 mm d of precipitation over 3 days in the upper valais since 1975 have originated from souths according to attinger and fallot 2003 as cited in tobin et al 2011 2 4 weather radar data meteoswiss has operated since 1995 three weather radars covering the entire national territory of switzerland meteoswiss 2016b modernized in 2011 and 2012 with new technologies meteoswiss 2012 in may 2014 a fourth installation has been inaugurated at the pointe de la plaine morte see fig 1 within the basin studied in here meteoswiss 2014c followed two years later by a fifth radar in the eastern part of switzerland meteoswiss 2016c fig s 2 supp mat the radar of pointe de la plaine morte is officially operational since june 2014 the two additional radars contributed to a better radar coverage of alpine regions germann et al 2015 the back scattered signal measured by the five dual polarization doppler c band radars gabella 2017 is transformed into rain rate estimates through several procedures described in germann et al 2006 radar precipitation estimates are generated every 5 min over a 1 km resolution raster based on a combination of the data of the available radars over switzeraland for the present study the hourly aggregated radar precipitation estimates product of meteoswiss is used classified into 256 categories the production routine of the product had been optimized by meteoswiss for the configuration with 3 weather radars in switzerland a new radar precipitation estimates product is generated by meteoswiss since february 2018 but no historical data are yet available meteoswiss personal communication march 7 2018 it is worth pointing out that the highly mountainous aspect of the studied basin implies an accuracy loss of the radar estimate as compared to flatlands erdin et al 2012 beam shielding by mountain ranges is certainly one of the major issues as discussed later in section 5 to reduce this effect a fixed adjustment map computed based on a long term comparison between weather radar estimation and rain gauge measurements is used by meteoswiss in the computation of their radar precipitation estimates product germann et al 2006 however this long term comparison based correction does not consider the data of the two newly installed radars positive effect on the basin of interest is therefore probably lower than for some other regions of switzerland ground echoes elimination also requires a proper pre treatment of the data in addition radar data suffer of bias issue by over or under shooting the precipitation this is why they are combined with rain gauges to properly adjust the precipitation field furthermore solid precipitation estimation is known to be more challenging than the liquid phase resulting in better detection performance in summer than in winter speirs et al 2017 whereas melting snow tends to enhance the back scattered signal germann et al 2006 2 5 events description the main analysis is carried out on four events that occurred over the period of data availability for the meteorological radar of pointe de la plaine morte 2014 2017 additionally two events in 2012 and 2013 corresponding to the highest peak flow in the basin over the 2008 2017 period as well as an event in july 2014 during which the radar of pointe de la plaine morte was temporary not operating are also considered to discuss the performance of the methodology before the installation of the radar of pointe de la plaine morte this is important as data over several years are necessary when using the interpolated data for hydrological model calibration the four events considered for the main analysis cover different seasons and were chosen for their high precipitation accumulation over the events the period for each event has been defined such as to start two hours before the first hour with at least four smn stations reporting at least 1 5 mm h and to stop two hours after the last hour respecting this condition interruptions of less than 12 h of the above mentioned condition were considered to be part of the same event the characteristics of the events are given in table 2 and presented hereafter listed in chronological order the median and maximum accumulation values are computed from the rain gauge values the snow line elevation has been estimated from archives of short term weather forecasts of meteoswiss in fact even if recent developments enable hydrometeor type analysis from radar data grazioli et al 2015 snow line elevations cannot yet be estimated directly from the radar data return periods are provided by meteoswiss 2016d from which only statistically robust results were considered peak discharges qmax and corresponding return periods of the events at the hydrometric stations of the federal office for the environment foen 2017a b in sion and in porte du scex at the outlet of the basin fig 1 are also indicated in table 2 and discussed hereafter where relevant all times are given in utc 1 2 5 1 events without pointe de la plaine morte data event a 1 7 2012 12 00 to 2 7 2012 16 00 the event of july 2012 mostly concerned the eastern part of the basin the overall precipitation was not particularly intense with a median accumulation over all the stations of 24 3 mm but with a snow line elevation reaching 3400 m asl most of the precipitation fell as rain this resulted in a peak discharge in the rh√¥ne at sion of 703 m3 s on 2 july foen 2017b corresponding to an estimated return period of 20 years according to foen 2017a event b 28 7 2013 21 00 to 29 7 2013 17 00 the event of july 2013 touched the entire basin with locally intense storms median accumulation of 39 3 mm the high snow line elevation situated at about 2600 m asl resulted in a high proportion of rainfall which led to a peak discharges of 708 m3 s in sion and 901 m3 s in porte du scex on 29 july foen 2017b the return period of the discharge in sion was estimated to 21 years foen 2017a event c 28 7 2014 11 00 to 29 7 2014 15 00 a westerly depression affected the entire basin and particularly its western part the median accumulation reached 45 5 mm over the event the snow line elevation varied between around 2500 and 3100 m asl compared to the events in 2012 and 2013 the intense precipitation was less concentrated in time probably partially explaining why the resulting flow in downstream rivers did not reach values as high as in 2012 and 2013 see table 2 the event has the particularity of having taken place after the entry into service of the radar of pointe de la plaine morte but with the mentioned radar not being in operation over the event temporary interruption this offers a station density close to the maximum density of 2017 with a radar data configuration corresponding to the one of before 2014 without the radar of pointe de la plaine morte which is interesting for analysis purposes 2 5 2 events including pointe de la plaine morte data event 1 4 11 2014 08 00 to 6 11 2014 04 00 an active westerly disturbance with polar air resulted in heavy precipitation mostly in the eastern part of the basin the median accumulation over the 44 h was 37 5 mm but station ulrichen fig 1 reported for example 96 2 mm over 16 h corresponding to a return period of 18 years according to meteoswiss 2016d the snow limit varied between 800 and 2000 m asl event 2 30 04 2015 22 00 to 4 5 2015 10 00 a heavy precipitation event coming from the west with air relatively mild and very humid reached switzerland with successive precipitation fronts the snow limit varied between 1800 and 2600 m asl the median accumulation was 96 2 mm for a maximum accumulation over the 84 h of 375 7 mm in station clusanfe in terms of return period the station bex fig 1 in the western part of the basin reported a rainfall accumulation of 100 9 mm over 3 days corresponding to a return period of 58 years other stations within the basin reported accumulation with return periods exceeding 10 years event 3 10 1 2016 07 00 to 13 1 2016 04 00 a series of disturbances reached switzerland from the west with heavy snowfalls on the alps exceeding in some places 100 cm of fresh snow over the 3 days the snow limit varied between 800 and 1400 m asl and the median liquid equivalent precipitation was 41 2 mm event 4 5 3 2017 15 00 to 7 3 2017 13 00 strong westerly winds resulted in successive fronts towards the swiss alps with a median precipitation of 34 mm the snow limit varied between 700 and 1400 m asl over the event thus a large fraction of the precipitation fell as snow 3 methodology the high spatial variability of precipitation implies the use of methods capable of analyzing and reproducing as reliably as possible the spatial pattern of the precipitation fields on one side the interpolation method should be efficient in combining the available rain gauge and radar data considering different networks of ground stations on the other side for being used operationally it should not imply long computational time and must work on an automatic basis 3 1 estimation methods five different estimation methods are compared within this work ranging from commonly used methods to the newly proposed one handling with two non collocated rain gauge networks of varying quality the first method is the so called inverse distance weighting method shepard 1968 hereafter referred to as idw currently used within the minerve forecasting system and therefore considered as the baseline scenario this method only uses the rain gauge data the second method considers directly the raw radar value over the entire basin the three other methods combine rain gauge and radar data by applying a multiplying coefficient to the radar raster based on a linear regression of the radar data on the rain gauge data to obtain a trend corrected radar residuals defined as the difference between the value observed at a rain gauge and the value of the containing pixel of the trend are then computed at each gauge location before being interpolated the way this interpolation is carried out differentiates the three last methods the first one is applying idw to the residuals whereas the two others are based on a kriging approach webster and oliver 2007 delhomme 1978 finally interpolated residuals are added to the trend to get the final product table 3 summarizes the five methods the implementation has been done on the r language and environment for statistical computing r core team 2016 for the three regression methods the methodology and nomenclature is partly based on sideris et al 2014a 3 1 1 inverse distance weighting idw the inverse distance weighting method shepard 1968 is a deterministic interpolation method ly et al 2013 in the sense that it does not exploits the statistical properties of the observation sample thus not providing a prediction error assessment in general the aim of interpolation is to estimate the precipitation depth p at an unsampled spatial location s 0 with coordinates x 0 y 0 using the available observation data at rain gauges see table 7 for variables list idw applies a linear combination of the observations within a research radius œÅ with a decreasing influence with increasing distance the rain gauge measurements vector over a period t is given by 1 g t g s 1 t g s 2 t g s n t where n is the number of available rain gauge measurements over the period t and s x y the spatial coordinate vector of a given point the estimated precipitation p s 0 t at a given location s 0 is then given by 2 p s 0 t g s i t if i d s 0 s i 0 i 1 n Œª i g s i t i 1 n Œª i else i 0 d s 0 s i œÅ s 0 d r 2 where 3 Œª i 1 d s 0 s i Œ≤ with d being the distance between the location of interpolation and the location of observation i Œ≤ a power coefficient œÅ the research radius and d the spatial domain r is the set of real numbers the normalization allows the sum of the weights to equal 1 3 1 2 radar value radar the radar value method consists in using directly the raw radar data as the precipitation estimation over the basin the quality of the raw radar product can thereby be investigated 3 1 3 regression inverse distance weighting ridw in the three remaining methods from the geostatistical interpolation methods the radar information is used to compute a trend of the precipitation field with a multiplicative coefficient it is worth noting here that merging rain gauge and radar data implies several hypotheses sideris et al 2014a firstly it is assumed that for both the rain gauges and the radar estimates the measured physical quantity is the precipitation depth over spatial blocks of a size equal to the spatial resolution of the radar 1 km2 this ignores the difference in spatial resolution in complex topographies like in the context of this study this can have implications due to the limited spatial representativeness of rain gauges secondly the precipitation estimates of the radar over a spatial block of 1 km2 is assumed to reflect the precipitation depth falling on the surface of the same block this presumes perfect vertical precipitation fluxes and no exchange with adjacent blocks which is not the case in reality in addition it must be noted that the precipitation depth estimates given by the radar can be affected by areas of invisibility due to shielding of the radar beam by mountain ranges this obviously also impacts the performance of the interpolation in addition to the rain gauge measurements vector g t defined in the idw method the radar precipitation estimates at rain gauge locations over the period t are considered 4 r t r s 1 t r s 2 t r s n t during the interpolation radar precipitation estimates at each interpolation point are also used in geostatistics a random process z s t can be modeled as the sum of a deterministic part m z s t corresponding to the average or trend component and a stochastic residual component s t which corresponds to local fluctuations of the trend so that 5 z s t m z s t s t s d r 2 t t r where s is the vector of spatial coordinates of a given point and t the temporal domain in the context of the present work eq 5 can be rewritten for the precipitation depth p over the entire domain as 6 p s t m p s t s t the trend m p s t for a spatial coordinates vector s is commonly modeled as a linear function of a smoothly varying external variable goovaerts 1997 in our case this external variable is the radar r s t 7 m p s t a t r s t where a t is a regression coefficient and r s t is the radar values vector at time t the coefficient a t is computed as the slope of a linear regression of all pairs of points composed of the gauge values on the y axis and the values of the containing radar pixel on the x axis a t is assumed to be constant spatially in the interest of robustness in other methods such as kriging with external drift ked the trend is computed using two regression parameters thereby adding also an intercept and often evaluated within the kriging estimation process itself e g in ked the choice of a unique parameter has been motivated by the wish of maintaining zero precipitation in the trend where there was no precipitation reported by the radar estimates to compute the residuals s t the trend m p s t is subtracted from the observed value at the station locations 8 s t g s t m p s t g s t a t r s t the residuals s t are then interpolated using the inverse distance weighting method to obtain the interpolated residuals ridw s 0 t at location s 0 the final estimate is obtained by adding the trend m p s 0 t to the interpolated residual 9 p ridw s 0 t m p s 0 t ridw s 0 t s 0 d r 2 fig 2 illustrates the different steps of the ridw method 3 1 4 regression kriging rk kriging is a family of interpolation methods in which the covariance between observations is used to define a linear combination of the observations for interpolation practically kriging methods consider the increasing dissimilarity between observations to characterize the spatial structure of the data one of the conditions to apply the elementary methods of kriging simple and ordinary kriging is to assume the random variable to be first order stationary the expected value is constant over the domain of interpolation this condition is hardly satisfied when working directly with rain gauge data as it might rain for example only in one part of the basin this non stationarity of the precipitation fields is here addressed by removing a trend based on the radar data so that simple or ordinary kriging can be applied to the computed residuals this is however an approximation as the non stationarity of the precipitation statistical properties cannot be fully captured by the radar data this approach is named regression kriging rk in the present paper according to the nomenclature in odeh et al 1995 other names have been proposed for similar approaches in the literature kriging combined with linear regression ahmed and de marsily 1987 kriging detrended data phillips et al 1992 kriging with a trend model goovaerts 1997 or residual kriging alsamamra et al 2009 hengl et al 2007 discussed the characteristics of regression kriging and applied the approach to three case studies rk is somewhat similar to kriging with external drift ked the difference being that the linear regression and the kriging interpolation is done in successive steps in rk and all at once in ked this choice of successive steps allows us to define a subset of stations for a the linear regression step b the variogram computation for the spatial interpolation of the residuals and c the interpolation of the residuals to explore for example a larger number of stations in the last step eqs 5 8 about trend and residuals computation remain valid for rk the covariance of the residuals at the locations of observation is given by the nxn covariance matrix c aa 10 c aa œÉ z 2 c 12 c 1 n c 21 œÉ z 2 c 2 n c n 2 c n 2 œÉ z 2 where each element c ij of the matrix is given by the covariance between the observation locations i and j and œÉ z 2 is the variance of the observations assuming a gaussian distribution of the residuals discussed later in section 3 3 and considering a constant zero mean and known variance we use simple kriging to spatialize the residuals considering the two conditions imposed by the kriging approach which are i an unbiased estimator and ii a minimal estimation variance the following equation is obtained webster and oliver 2007 11 c aa Œª c a where c a is the covariance vector between the locations of interpolation and the observation locations resolution of the system given in eq 11 provides the weights for the linear kriging predictor used to compute residual values at the interpolation location s 0 given by the linear combination of the observations 12 rk s 0 t i 1 n Œª i s t which is then added to the trend m p s 0 t to get the expected value of the precipitation depth 13 p rk s 0 t m p s 0 t rk s 0 t s 0 d r 2 interpolation of the residual is done using a global neighborhood that means all the points are used for the interpolation 3 1 5 regression co kriging rck based on the comparative analysis between the meteoswiss and meteogroup networks see section 2 the choice was made to explore a variant of regression kriging using co kriging and hereafter referred to as regression co kriging rck co kriging has the advantage of offering the possibility of considering more than one variable in the kriging interpolation thus the multivariate rck variant allows considering different vectors of rain gauges instead of having only one vector of observations vector g t of eq 1 is replaced by two vectors 14 g a t g s a 1 t g s a 2 t g s a n a t 15 g b t g s b 1 t g s b 2 t g s b n b t where the subscripts a and b refer to the primary a and secondary b networks and n a and n b are the number of available rain gauges in respectively the primary and the secondary networks over the period t similarly the radar precipitation estimates vector of eq 4 is replaced by two vectors 16 r a t r s a 1 t r s a 2 t r s a n a t 17 r b t r s b 1 t r s b 2 t r s b n b t statements about the trend and residuals computation of eqs 5 8 remain valid the residuals are computed with the two equations 18 a s a t g a s a t a a r a s a t 19 b s b t g b s b t a b r b s b t where a a and a b are the multiplicative coefficients for the primary and secondary variables computed with a linear regression of the radar data on the rain gauge data these two terms are the result of a linear regression computed for each of the corresponding subsets of data with respect to the corresponding radar data the consideration of two variables in rck instead of one modifies eq 11 as follows myers 1982 20 c aa c ab c ba c bb Œª a Œª b c a c b where c a and c b are the covariance vectors of residuals between the unmonitored locations and the locations with observations and c ab respectively c ba the cross covariance matrix between the primary and secondary variables respectively the secondary and primary variables consequently the estimator equation is given by 21 rck s 0 t i 1 n a Œª a i a s a t i 1 n b Œª b i b s b t before being added to the trend m p s 0 t 22 p rck s 0 t m p s 0 t rck s 0 t s 0 d r 2 3 2 variogram fitting for non collocated networks computation of the weights vector Œª of eq 11 as well as Œª a and Œª b of eq 20 requires an estimate of the covariance matrices instead of computing the covariance which is sensitive to sampling effects kriging generally uses the concept of semivariogram matheron 1971 which represents how the dissimilarity between pairs of points increases with increasing separation distance the semivariogram or simply variogram as called from now is defined for the univariate case and expressed in terms of precipitation residuals by 23 Œ≥ a h 1 2 n h i 1 n h s i s i h i 2 s i s i h i d r 2 h i h b 2 h b 2 where h is the distance lag between pairs of locations Œ≥ a h the variogram value for distance lag h b the bin size the width of the distance interval up to which point pairs are grouped for variogram computation h i the distance separing a given pair of points n h the number of considered pairs of observations separated by distance h a s i the residual value at location s i and s i h i the residual value at location s i h i pebesma 2014 in the case of regression kriging one variogram is computed with eq 23 for each time step of computation for the regression co kriging two direct variogams one for each variable and one cross variogram must be computed to define the so called linear model of coregionalization webster and oliver 2007 for the computation of the cross variogram eq 23 must be generalized to two variables identified by the subscript a and b 24 Œ≥ ab h 1 2 n h i 1 n h a s i a s i h i b s i b s i h i s i s i h i d r 2 h i h b 2 h b 2 where b s i is the residual value at location s i and b s i h i the residual value at location s i h i however eq 24 can be used only in case of collocated variables observations for both variables are available for a sufficient number of given points in the case of smn and mg stations this is not the case as stations are situated in different locations accordingly one needs to work with so called pseudo cross variograms in which pairs of both variables are considered as proposed by pebesma 2014 25 Œ≥ ab h 1 2 n h i 1 n h a s i b s i h i 2 s i s i h i d r 2 h i h b 2 h b 2 where Œ≥ ab h is the pseudo cross variogram value for distance lag h considering variables a and b the equivalence between variogram and covariance is defined for second order stationary processes for which the variogram is always bounded as follows webster and oliver 2007 26 Œ≥ h c 0 c h where Œ≥ h is the variogram value for a distance h c 0 is the covariance at h 0 and c h the covariance at distance h if the variogram is bounded by a sill the value of c 0 is equal to the total sill value in the present study the variogram models have been fitted using the package gstat pebesma and graeler 2017 within the software r r core team 2016 the empirical variogram has been fitted with a spherical variogram model schuurmans et al 2007 27 Œ≥ h 0 if h 0 k 0 k 3 h 2 Œ± h 3 2 Œ± 3 if 0 h Œ± k 0 k if h Œ± in which k 0 is the nugget value k the partial sill Œ± the range distance within which measures are considered correlated the implemented code explores different values of bin size until a valid variogram model can be fitted the routine also tries to obtain a low nugget to sill ratio by gradually increasing a success threshold 100 iterations are first attempted with a threshold value of 0 1 if none of the obtained valid models has a nugget to sill ratio lower than the threshold the threshold is increased by 0 1 until 0 9 with each time 100 iterations in case of failure with the highest threshold value the last valid variogram of previous time steps is considered anisotropy of the variogram different spatial variability in different directions has not been explored in this work this choice is justified by the use of the radar data in which spatial variability of the precipitation fields is assumed to be contained and therefore considered in the interpolation process 3 3 transformation precipitation is inherently heteroscedastic the variance is not constant over the domain and has a skewed distribution which is in contradiction with basic assumptions of classical geostatistics which assumes a gaussian distribution and stationarity of the mean and spatial covariance erdin et al 2012 therefore several methods have been explored in the literature to transform the data before their interpolation sideris et al 2014a erdin et al 2012 schuurmans et al 2007 and it has been shown that quantitative improvements is dependent on temporal and spatial variability cecinati et al 2017b the process of applying kriging to data transformed into a more gaussian distribution is generally named trans gaussian kriging in the case of the two methods employing kriging in this paper namely regression kriging rk and regression co kriging rck interpolation is not done directly on the precipitation observations but on the residuals see section 3 1 to which the gaussianity issue therefore applies a transformation is applied to both the rain gauge and the radar data to translate them into a more gaussian distribution with the objective of getting better gaussianity in the residuals in this paper we use for both rk 3 1 4 and rck 3 1 5 methods a square root transformation of the data sideris et al 2014a analysis of the residuals distribution has shown that this transformation tends to increase overall the gaussianity of the residuals even though the effect is somewhat limited and for few time steps even negative in analysing the effect of such data transformation on precipitation interpolation erdin et al 2012 reported only small effects of transformation for the point estimates but mentioned that transformation improved the reliability of the probabilistic estimates substantially the corresponding gain of introducing such transformation scheme is disscussed in section 4 2 2 the advantage of the square root transformation is the possibility of analytical back transformation of the mean and the variance sideris et al 2014a given by 28 e y 2 Œº y 2 œÉ y 2 and 29 var y 2 4 Œº y 2 œÉ y 2 2 œÉ y 4 where Œº y is the mean and œÉ y the standard deviation of the square root transformed kriging prediction at a certain location whereas e y 2 represents the expected value of the back transformed random variable or in other words the final prediction and var y 2 the related variance however eq 28 is composed of two positive terms both are squared values with the variance œÉ y 2 being positive and reaching the sample variance of the transformed residuals at estimation locations situated at a distance from the nearest observation higher than the variogram model range eq 27 thereby the back transformed estimation would never provide zero precipitation estimates apart from rain gauge locations where estimation variance is minimum in the work of sideris et al 2014a this problem is addressed by correcting the interpolated field and assigning zero precipitation to locations where the radar does not show any precipitation i sideris personal communication may 30 2017 the methodology proposed here overcomes this issue by weighting the variance term of eq 28 with the predicted precipitation 30 œÉ y 2 Œº y 2 œÑ œÉ y 2 where œÑ is a precipitation intensity threshold below which the variance is weighted and œÉ y 2 is the variance effectively added in eq 28 instead of œÉ y 2 which gives 31 e y 2 Œº y 2 œÉ y 2 where e y 2 represents the expected value of the back transformed random variable considering the modified estimation variance the value for œÑ has been fixed to 0 5 mm h after initial tests the impact of applying the transformation or not is discussed in section 4 2 2 3 4 skill scores and cross validation the performance analysis is based on the leave one out approach the precipitation is estimated at a rain gauge location using all observations except the one corresponding to the interpolation location the procedure is undertaken on an hourly basis for each location and for each of the methods the quality of the point estimates is then assessed over all locations for each time step using following skill scores 1 bias systematic errors are assessed with the bias indicator 32 bias t 10 log 10 i 1 n g i t i 1 n g i t where g i t refers to the estimated value for a given location and a given time step g i t to the observed value and n to the number of considered locations as a result of the logarithmic scale used in eq 32 the bias is expressed in decibel db for each event the overall bias is averaged over the entire period and the entire spatial extent the bias has been computed only for hourly time steps during which the mean precipitation over the meteoswiss stations was higher than 0 5 mm h this avoids values at the denominator close to 0 resulting in exaggeratedly high bias values 2 mad the median absolute deviation mad provides the median of the absolute value of the difference between estimated and observed values sideris et al 2014a 33 mad t median g i t g i t 3 rmse the root mean square error is the most common parameter used in verification goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 it represents the standard deviation of the differences between predicted and observed values 34 rmse t i 1 n g i t g i t 2 n 4 mrte the mean root transformed error erdin et al 2012 mitigates the dominant influence of errors at large precipitation amounts as compared to rmse 35 mrte t 1 n i 1 n g i t g i t 2 5 scatter the scatter is a measure of the spread of the ratio between estimated and measured values it is based on the cumulative error distribution function of these ratios expressed in decibel germann et al 2006 schiemann et al 2011 36 scatter 1 2 Œæ 84 Œæ 16 where Œæ 16 and Œæ 84 represent the 16 and the 84 percentiles of the cumulative error distribution function only pairs of points for which both estimated and observed values where higher than 0 5 mm h were considered for the computation of the scatter 3 5 methodology application for the idw method a value of 2 common default value is given to the power coefficient Œ≤ eq 3 and the research radius is fixed to 50 km for the methods including a regression of the radar data the regression has been computed only on stations located within the basin for the methods considering a single rain gauge network idw ridw and rk the primary variable smn data are considered for the rck method both primary smn and secondary mg variables data are used variograms fitting with an insufficient number of points can lead to ill defined variogram for the rk method a minimum of 5 stations with a precipitation of at least 0 5 mm h is set as condition for the rck method the condition is set to 5 stations exceeding the same precipitation threshold value for each variable when the condition is not satisfied the last previously computed valid variogram is used the condition being generally not satisfied at the beginning of an event an initial variogram must preliminarily be computed over an arbitrarily chosen time step during the event with sufficient stations exceeding the threshold in addition for both the rk and rck methods the model fitting has been constrained to a maximum range of 50 km this value has been defined based on visual variogram analysis and allows to constrain the model for experimental variograms that do not show a clear upper bound 4 results the five methods presented in section 3 and listed in table 5 have been applied to the four events presented in section 2 5 2 for all the five methods the interpolation has been computed over a grid with a resolution corresponding to the one of the raw radar data 1 km 2 per pixel for the cross validation the computation was based on the locations of the smn rain gauges within the basin even if more stations such as mg stations were used for the interpolation to ensure a constant comparison basis for all methods it is worth noting here that no direct comparison has been possible within this study with the combiprecip product of meteoswiss as no leave one out computation was possible on the delivered combiprecip product the performance of the different methods is first discussed based on the cross validation approach including a discussion of the performance before the installation of the new weather radar in 2014 results of the variogram fitting and the effect of data transformation are then presented the last section discusses the effect of additional networks 4 1 methods performance analysis in order to assess the performance of the different methods the presented performance indicators have been computed for the four events 1 to 4 table 2 for each performance indicator table 4 hourly values were averaged over each event results are given in fig 3 the cumulative volume over the events considering all the pixels located within the basin is also presented dashed line border the estimation method considering only raw radar data radar clearly shows the weakest performance particularly in terms of bias which confirms the need of bias correction of the raw radar data with a regression using rain gauges this observation is strengthened by the total volume that differs substantially from the other methods for part of the events overall the rck method provides the best performance this is the case for the mrte indicator for which the rck method provides the best value over all four events in terms of absolute bias rck outperforms for all the events the rk method but for some events other methods such as idw perform better than rck furthermore the results are not clear for all the indicators for example for event 1 rmse and scatter values are comparable for rck and idw it is worth to recall here that the station density within the basin is particularly high which allows idw to reach already good performances it must also be pointed out that idw has been applied with the default value of 2 for the exponent Œ≤ of eq 2 adjustment of this parameter could improve the performance of the idw method for a finer analysis fig 4 presents hourly values for the four performance indicators computed at each time step for the reference idw method and the rck method scatter is not shown here as it is computed directly over the events results for the bias show how reactive the indicator can be with a strong negative value for the rck method on 2 may 2015 at 16 00 however this corresponds to the beginning of the second front and only few stations already observed precipitation in which case one single important cross validation error can strongly affect the hourly indicator value it must also be noted that such single negative respectively positive values can compensate for an overall positive respectively negative bias value and lead to an improvement in the overall value this is one of the limitation of the bias indicator regarding the three other indicators all strictly positive by definition it is interesting to note the varying difference between the two methods over the three fronts whereas there is only a small gain of rck over idw over the first front it increases over the second and third front in particular for the mrte indicator when analyzing the different fronts it appears that over the third one only the north western part of the basin is covered by the precipitation fig 5 the gain of integrating the radar information is here clearly visible with the idw method not being able to reproduce the sharp gradient cutting the basin in two parts figs s 5 to s 10 supp mat show the same indicators for the 6 other events when analyzing the cross validation errors of event 1 it appeared that the station col du grand st bernard gsb resulted almost systematically over the entire event in high cross validation errors with both idw and rck methods not being able to correctly reproduce the observed precipitation despite using the radar information in the rck method when looking at the total precipitation over the event for both methods the gsb station is also very well visible at the south western corner of the basin fig 6 the high difference between the rain gauge values and the bias corrected radar data only at this station suggested to further investigate this particularity interestingly this station located at an elevation of 2472 m asl had already been pointed out in a precedent analysis erdin et al 2012 in which the station was reported to suffer of several known measurement problems shielding wind exposure and drifting snow and with a snow limit varying between 1000 and 2000 m asl over the event 1 the gsb station only measured solid precipitation to investigate the impact of the station over the global performance over the event the interpolation has been recomputed by totally excluding the gsb station fig 7 shows the result for the two methods both with and without considering the gsb station results show that all indicators are improved when removing the station in particular for rmse and mrte the difference is non negligible this example shows well how considering as truth the data from the rain gauges can lead to incoherence or errors in the interpolation result the analysis carried out over events 1 to 4 considered radar data including the new radar of pointe de la plaine morte in order to assess the quality of the swiss wide radar product over the studied basin before the installation of this new radar performances over the three events a b and c are presented in fig 8 the performance gain of rck over idw for the three events is higher than for events 1 to 4 this is probably partly explained by the number of rain gauges available over the three events only 28 and 40 smn stations for 2012 event a and 2013 event b whereas at least 52 stations were available for the events 1 to 4 the lower station density reduces the performance of idw and thereby increases the relative gain of rck over idw the performance of the rck method over the three analyzed events excluding pointe de la plaine morte radar data suggests that this method provides clearly better results than idw for the studied basin even before the installation of the new weather radar this is an important result in the perspective of computing precipitation fields for hydrological modelling with data requirement over relatively long time periods as it shows that even with an alpine topography like the one in the studied basin radar data seem to be usable even without a weather radar located within the basin 4 2 variogram and data transformation analysis performance of the variogram model fitting for the results presented in section 4 1 are presented hereafter before analyzing the effect of data transformation looking at the rck method 4 2 1 variogram fitting results good fitting of the variogram is essential to obtain a reliable interpolation the implemented solution resulted in few time steps 0 5 without valid variogram fitting this considers only the time steps with enough stations reporting sufficient precipitation as defined in section 3 5 the percentage of time steps with insufficient stations is considerably high 7 4 for the rk method and 31 7 for the rck method of the time steps over the four events 1 to 4 these time steps generally correspond to the lower intensity phase of the events for all these time steps both failure and insufficient stations the previously computed last valid variogram was used instead fig 9 shows four direct variograms for the rk method over event 3 the differences in bin size are well visible the fewer points are visible on a sample variogram the more points were grouped together and averaged to compute each point of the experimental variogram fig 10 gives an example of the linear model of coregionalization composed of two direct variograms smn and mg and one pseudo cross variogram smn vs mg all three fitted simultaneously the higher variability observed in the mg direct variogram tends to be a common behavior within this study this difference cannot be directly attributed to a difference in the quality of the mg sensors as these stations are also much less numerous with only 23 mg stations for 52 smn stations over the chosen event enhancing the issue of limited number of wet stations for the mg network in addition if most of the fitted models describe well the experimental variogram for some times steps a manual fitting would probably have led to more appropriate fittings 4 2 2 effect of data transformation the rck method has been applied to events 1 to 4 both with and without transformation fig 11 the bias is considerably improved for two of the four considered events when applying the discussed square root transformation eq 31 for the mrte a gain is observed for all events for the other indicators the difference is less important and more variable for example for the mad for which loss and gain are observed for the scatter the tendency is slightly negative probably due to the back transformation process these results are coherent with the conclusions of erdin et al 2012 who reported only small effects of the transformation on the point estimates but reported a higher reliability of the estimates when comparing each gauge measurement against the probability function of the corresponding cross validation probabilistic estimate further improvements in the transformation could be explored not only on the power coefficient of the transformation but also on the back transformation process based on the obtained results applying the proposed transformation is recommended 4 3 effect of additional networks in the results presented in section 4 1 the mg data have been used only in the rck method as secondary variable combination of smn and mg data as a unique set of data is discussed hereafter fig 12 presents the performance indicators for the idw ridw and rk methods each time considering first smn data only and then combining smn and mg data considering them together as one single variable table 6 results of rck using smn data as primary variable and mg as secondary variable are also presented for all indicators except the bias considering mg data directly with smn data as one single variable tended to improve the performance of the methods as compared to use only smn data which can be explained by the additional local information introduced by the mg stations performances were in some cases even slightly better than for rck in which both variables are considered separately however and as expected from the data analysis presented in section 2 study area and data this joint use of smn and mg data resulted in negative biases this effect is well visible in particular for events 3 and 4 fig 12 where values exceeded 0 6 db corresponding to a negative bias of about 13 consequently this bias issue suggests to consider both variables only with methods accounting for this deviation that means in the present case the rck method the present study also aimed at providing a preliminary analysis of integrating stations from surrounding areas this is justified by the need for accurate information in terms of precipitation estimates for real time hydro meteorological monitoring and forecasting fig 13 shows for a time step of event 2 the interpolation results of rck using only smn and mg data compared to the results obtained with integrating the data from all surroundings additional networks with the additional stations precipitation estimates are for example increased over the aosta region south of the studied basin see fig 13c for a more quantitative assessment fig 14 gives the corresponding performance indicators including different combinations of primary and secondary variables for the precipitation interpolation the additional data have however not been used for the linear regression computation nor for the variogram fitting this was motivated respectively to ensure an optimal radar regression over the studied basin and to reduce the risk of inconsistencies in the variogram model fitting sensitive to discrepancies in even only one or two stations potentially affecting the entire interpolation of a given time step the results show that adding additional networks has a limited effect bias tends to be the most reactive indicator even tough differences are small for the other indicators as well as for the total precipitated volume differences can be considered as limited and it is difficult to define if it is rather a gain or a loss in terms of performance for some time steps some stations of the additional networks reported no precipitation whereas the radar reported heavy precipitation suggesting some possible quality issues for operational purposes the quality of these additional networks should be further investigated 5 discussion the performance analysis used in this paper based on leave one out cross validation did not allow a direct comparison with outputs of previous works for example with the combiprecip product as described in sideris et al 2014a in fact the stations used in the cross validation evaluation are used in the computation of the product thus no comparison was possible however visual analysis of the interpolated precipitation fields revealed that the spatial patterns were very similar for a very large fraction of the time steps integration of the discussed interpolated precipitation fields into a hydrological model could allow a quantitative comparison between the products from a hydrological point of view furthermore the analysis was carried out over the set of recent most heavy precipitation events which were not evenly spread through all seasons with events 1 to 4 period 2014 2017 occurring from fall to spring and with events a to c period 2012 2014 only in summer this could have an impact on the analysis but should not modify the general conclusions from the comparison between methods the choice of performance indicators can also slightly modify the results of the analysis for example we decided to work with a bias indicator based on a ratio between estimated and observed values indicator also used by several other authors sideris et al 2014a goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 however alternative versions exist based for example on a differential bias cecinati et al 2017b less sensitive to small denominators two aspects of the presented precipitation interpolation deserve further discussion namely the integration of different rain gauge networks and remaining challenges due mainly to radar visibility regarding the integration of the data from the private meteogroup mg raingauges it is important to point out here that their added value is probably somewhat underestimated in the presented results in fact their contribution to the overall interpolation quality is analyzed only via cross validation applied to the meteoswiss smn stations this cross validation does probably not show a complete picture of the contribution brought by the mg stations as i the mg stations have been selected to complete the smn network in areas without smn stations and ii the mg stations contribute to the final interpolated precipitation field mostly in their immediate vicinity as expected including the radar data as external drift considerably improved the precipitation interpolation for all tested methods however any radar data set in a comparably complex area is highly likely to suffer from several quality issues such as radar beam shielding by mountain peaks located in close vicinity of the radars for our case study the mont bonvin 2994 m asl located two kilometers south east of the radar of pointe de la plaine morte 2926 m asl creates such a blind zone due to radar shielding in south eastern direction from the radar location visible in fig 15 in this area precipitation is highly likely to be underestimated by the radar this effect remains visible in the final estimation method retained here rck on the radar residuals with smn as primary and mg as secondary variable and is visible on fig 13 a similar effect can be seen on fig 6 b for a second radar the monte lema radar south east of the case study basin see fig s 2 in supp mat in fact before the installation of the new radar at pointe de la plaine morte such shielding beams were already common over the studied basin as illustrated in the supplementary material figs s 3 and s 4 the radar network configuration in terms of installed devices is supposed to not evolve in the near future the most promising directions to further improve precipitation interpolation under the current configuration are thus the following i better accounting for radar shielding effects the replacement by meteoswiss of their radar precipitation estimates product used for the present study by a new version optimized for the new network configuration with 5 weather radars will certainly contribute positively to this issue further investigations could e g consist in developing a raster of radar data quality based on the visibility of the weather radars or by analyzing the annual radar precipitation estimates such a method to account for radar quality should also consider temporal variations of the radar network configuration resulting from temporary inactivity of individual weather radars due e g to technical failures or scheduled maintenance ii improvement of the regression of the radar data on the rain gauge data e g by including a second coefficient in the linear regression eq 7 by developing a more local regression method that could account explicitly for summer convective precipitation or by integrating other covariates e g topography in addition latest developments in the field of hydrometeor type classification from radar data grazioli et al 2015 might open up new perspectives on precipitation radar data integration for mixed snow and rain events in the near future as well as higher quality radar precipitation estimates during snow fall a final point worth mentioning is the potential integration of secondary rain gauge networks composed of non heated stations that can only observe liquid precipitation such as the agrometeo network agroscope 2017 or the imis network slf 2017 to further increase the density of rain observation stations this is readily possible with the retained interpolation methodology and could potentially reduce the precipitation estimation error during rainfall events however 75 1 percent of the studied area lies above 1500 m asl where precipitation occurs regularly in the form of snow between november and march marty 2008 in addition with the high density of higher quality data already available it is not sure that this would improve the performance 6 conclusion this paper proposes a new method named regression co kriging for spatial interpolation of observed precipitation from two non collocated rain gauge networks of different quality with radar data compared to the precipitation fields routinely produced in real time by the swiss national meteorological service meteoswiss sideris et al 2014a based on the observed precipitation data from their swissmetnet smn network the final interpolation method retained here additionally integrates data from the network of the private company meteogroup switzerland ag mg the performance of the interpolated precipitation fields is assessed for four events over a swiss alpine region the upper rh√¥ne river basin using inverse distance weighting applied directly to the rain gauge observations as baseline scenario a series of well established precipitation interpolation methods are tested including methods that use i the radar data as an external drift to compute an overall precipitation trend and ii the rain gauge data to form local residuals that are spatially interpolated and added to the trend since the station locations of the two networks do not coincide the concept of pseudo cross variogram is employed to compute the linear model of coregionalization used for the co kriging interpolation the completed detailed tests demonstrated that regression co kriging using the smn data as primary variable and mg data as secondary variable to interpolate the local precipitation residuals provides the best performance for the study area the method even proved to clearly outperform the inverse distance weighting method for historical data availability scenarios before the radar network was completed and with lower rain gauge station density this result is important for hydrological applications where data over many years are required the gain introduced by the co kriging approach is demonstrated by showing a bias issue when considering both networks jointly linked to a difference in the networks quality regardless of the spatial scale data combination must therefore consider with care the quality of the sensors providing the data when elaborating a combination methodology the results of the analysis also showed that even with up to date modern weather radar equipments radar gauge combination in a complex topography such as the swiss alps requires a high level treatment of the data this is particularly true for reducing the artefacts due to beam shielding by the topography an interesting side result of this study is the fact that if a single rain gauge network smn stations is combined with radar data a kriging based residual interpolation does not clearly outperform a simple inverse distance weighting of the residuals this is probably explained at least partly by the relatively low number of rain gauges that report precipitation for some time steps over the considered domain which is often near the limit or even below the minimum required number to obtain robust variograms which is particularly limiting for rck where two variables need to meet this criterion overall the presented results underline the importance of analyzing in detail the evolving data situation to propose robust precipitation interpolation methods this not only holds for regions where the rain gauge and radar network is evolving any existing network might indeed suffer from device failures and ensuing missing data in general the detailed analysis of different rain gauge networks provided here including networks of neighbouring regions networks of different quality illustrates that integration of several networks for operational interpolation purposes is not straightforward since the available meteorological data quantity and quality is permanently increasing there is ample room for further studies on improving quantitative precipitation estimates for complex alpine environments based on our analysis the most promising research direction is certainly the pre processing of the radar data in particular to account for known beam shielding effects and
