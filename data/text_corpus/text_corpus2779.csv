significant stability and recyclability after five reaction cycles keywords magnetic nanocomposites photocatalytic degradation phosphomolybdic acid cibacron brilliant yellow 3g p airlift reactor 1 introduction in the recent years many organic substances from both industrial and human activities have caused serious health problems on living organisms and have become a major concern 1 2 textile industry is considered as one of the main source of extremely reactive and toxic azo dyes such as methylene blue mb methyl orange mo cibacron brilliant yellow 3g p 3 toxicity tests of these dyes showed that it causes several harmful effects on aquatic organisms even at low exposure concentrations 4 numerous effective remediation technologies have been developed for removal of azo dye cibacron brilliant yellow 3g p from wastewater 5 these remediation technologies include biodegradation fenton oxidation h2o2 oxidation and photocatalytic techniques 6 7 recently photocatalytic degradation process using heterogeneous photocatalyst is seems to be one of the hopeful technologies and has been effectively applied to reduce different organic contaminants due to its high degradation rate low toxicity low cost and relatively operate under moderate conditions 8 9 several nanocomposite materials have used as photocatalysts such as titanium dioxide 10 11 zeolite 12 13 copper oxides 14 15 nickel oxide 16 magnesium oxide 17 18 cds 19 pbs 20 and zn2sio4 21 based nanocomposites applications of metallic glasses were also developed as catalysts in wastewater treatment processes 22 25 over the past decade polyoxometalates poms have drawn more care as homogenous catalysts during synthesis of several organics and also for environmental remediation 26 poms are a class of discrete typically anionic made by collections of primary transition metal commonly mo w and v oxides of their low oxidation forms displaying a wide variety of assemblies and properties 27 generally there are two main groups of pom compounds heteropoly xxmmoy n and isopolyanions mmoy n 28 heteropolyanions xxmmoy n are heteroatoms with three main structures including anderson evans xm6o24 n kegging xm12o40 n and wells dawson x2m12o62 n 26 the electron acceptor properties ground state oxidant of the keggin form heteropolyanions and its uses in photocatalytic processes have been stated in many previous reports 12 13 in spite of these reported limitations of poms as photocatalysts there are specific drawbacks in their applications they consist of difficulty in separation and recycle of poms catalyst because of their homogeneous state and low efficiency compared with high surface area heterogeneous catalysts 31 32 immobilization of poms compounds onto porous supports may overcome these limitations 12 15 several supporting materials such as alumina and silica have shown high surface area in addition to their adsorptive and catalytic properties in environmental contamination treatment 34 between different metal oxide nanoparticles alumina has attracted attention because of its applicability in catalytic processes 35 alumina based nanocomposites such as alumina swcnt 18 19 aluminum metal oxide nanocomposites 20 21 and alumina go 22 23 have been developed and reported furthermore to increase the photocatalytic performance of the magnetic photocatalysts the influence of an in between layer of silica or alumina between the magnetic core and the external active photocatalyst shell such as zno and tio2 on the activity of the magnetic photocatalysts has been investigated and show that the existence of these middle layers can improve the performance and stability of the photocatalyst 42 43 also silica or alumina middle layers not only prevent the magnetic core from photodegradation but also prevent the undesirable movement of charge transporters from the active photocatalyst shell to the magnetic core which will decreases the photocatalyst activity 44 45 in this study magnetic core

for 30 min 2 4 photocatalytic activity assessment the photocatalytic activity of the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo magnetic nanocomposite was investigated through the degradation of cby dye under uv irradiation 360 nm in an airlift photocatalytic reactor the three phase airlift reactor used in this work was an internal loop 0 816 l working volume composed from two concentric tubes made from acrylic inner tube of 22 cm long and 8 cm diameter and outer tube of 30 cm long and 12 cm diameter the air was sparged in the inner tube to be a riser while the region formed by concentric tubes is to be a downcomer cby aqueous solution is arisen in inner tube riser section and fallen in outer tube downcomer section to generate a liquid circulation due to air holdup difference between the two sections 8 w uv lamp tuv g8t5 lamp bulb tube philips was used as a visible light source and fixed inside a pyrex glass tube which immersed in the riser section inner tube the reaction temperature was fixed at room temperature by circulating water through a cooling jacket fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the photocatalytic airlift reactor used for degradation of cby dye for photocatalytic degradation process the desired amount of catalyst 0 5 3 g l was used in the airlift reactor containing aqueous solution of cby dye at different initial concentration 10 160 mg l in all experiment the riser section in the airlift reactor was sparged with air at prespecified flowrate from 0 1 to 0 4 lpm as an initial study the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo magnetic nanocomposites using 1 g l adsorbent dosage without uv light as well as the direct photolysis efficiency was investigated with time furthermore the photocatalytic activity of the fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples was studied by subjecting uv light in all these preliminary study 40 mg l initial concentration of the cby dye was used at each prespecified time interval 2 ml samples were taken from the airlift reactor using sampling syringe centrifuged and the concentration of cby dye in the solution was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer model perkin elmer lambda 35 us at a maximum wavelength of 404 nm the degree of mineralization was checked by measuring the total organic carbon toc using shimadzu 5050a vcbh toc analyzer the toc removal is calculated as follows 1 t o c r e m o v a l t o c o t o c t o c o 100 toco and toc represent the initial and the varied toc of cby dye respectively the effect of initial ph on the cby dye degradation was also studied for ph range from 4 to 11 under constant experimental conditions initial concentration of cby 40 mg l fe3o4 al2o3 pmo catalyst dose 1 g l and air flowrate 0 15 lpm the initial ph value was modified through adding 0 1 n hcl or naoh the continuous flow degradation adsorption efficiency of cby 3g p dye was carried out in the airlift reactor fed with dye solution at three different rate of 5 10 and 20 ml min of 40 mg l initial cby dye concentration using dosing pump 1 g l of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst dose was used in these runs 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization fig 2 displays the xrd patterns of fe3o4 mnps fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposites for the naked fe3o4 mnps fig 2a a notable diffraction peaks of fe2o3 shown at 2θ of 30 435 35 73 43 78 54 181 57 621 62 771 corresponding very well with 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes respectively of standard fe3o4 nps according to the jcpds card no 88 0315 48 three magnetic phases were observed in synthesized fe3o4 mnps maghemite γ fe2o3 phase was found at 2θ of 30 435 35 73 and 54 181 while magnetite phase was presence with high intensity peaks at 2θ of 35 73 43 78 54 181 and 57 621 after alumina coated the fe2o3 peaks in the fe3o4 al2o3 nanocomposite fig 2b bare looks weaker than the naked ones suggesting the efficiency of the coating process and it is obviously observed that the core shell fe3o4 al2o3 nanocomposite display xrd pattern like to that of naked fe3o4 mnps fig 2c shows the xrd patterns of the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite the peak intensity of fe3o4 al2o3 nanocomposite reduced after pmo immobilization the diffraction peaks of pmo in final fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite were not found indicating good dispersion of pmo species on the surface of fe3o4 al2o3 however the molecular structure of pmo was confirmed by edx test fig 3 to investigate the surface morphology and microstructure of the nano particles composites fe sem images were obtained fe sem of fe3o4 fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples is revealed in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3a that the fe3o4 mnps were spherical in shape with regular structure and a particle diameter of about 24 37 nm moreover the fe3o4 al2o3 core shell nanocomposite had an insignificant change in the morphology from bare fe3o4 mnps as revealed in fig 3b from the fe sem image of fig 3c the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite were synthesized homogeneously which showed the pmo was efficiently immobilized on the fe3o4 al2o3 surface with a little aggregation moreover fig 2d shows the tem image of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite which displays the core shell structure the contrast between the composition of the core and the shell materials are clearly displayed fig 3e shows the edx analysis of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo sample it is clear that iron aluminum phosphor and molybdenum peaks approve the existence of pmo and al2o3 shell and fe3o4 core in the final fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposites the oxygen peak yields from the al2o3 and fe3o4 species the magnetic hysteresis loops of fe3o4 mnps fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples were analyzed at room temperature as revealed in fig 4 the magnetic saturation ms values were 63 6 11 7 and 8 8 emu g for fe3o4 mnps fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo respectively the reduction in ms values in the order of fe3o4 mnps fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo may be attributed to the influence of the non magnetic volume to the total sample volume as observed in fig 4 the magnetization demagnetization loops were synchronized no hysteresis occurred and remanence and coercive field were zero the results show that all synthesized nanocomposites are supermagnetic the good magnetization of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo sample proposes its appropriateness for magnetic separation the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo sample can be simply separated by an external magnet and it can be efficiently re suspended in the liquid media once take away this magnet the specific surface area and average pore size of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite are revealed in fig 5 using bet method through n2 adsorptione desorption isotherms it is clear that the isotherm type is categorized as typical iv type based on the iupac sorting indicating a mesoporous structure good bet surface area 53 6 m2 g and total pore volume 0 231 cm3 g of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite was achieved the average pore size of was mainly focus on 10 5 nm which calculated by bjh technique the uv vis dr spectrum was performed to check the capability of the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst for production of electron hole pairs when exposed to radiation as presented in fig 6 which shows the uv vis dr spectrum of fe3o4 mnps fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples a wide band was detected for of fe3o4 mnps at wavelength range 320 760 nm which may be due to the effect octahedral fe3 49 the characteristic peak was detected about 370 nm of fe3o4 mnps 50 after coverage of fe3o4 mnps with al2o3 shell fe3o4 al2o3 the absorbance of fe3o4 core is not different largely the absorption boundaries of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo sample show red shift and this may due to the heteroconnection between fe3o4 al2o3 and pmo species of narrow bandgap consequently the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst show strong absorption in the visible light region of suggesting that the final photocatalyst produce further electron hole pairs when irradiated and hence it have improved photocatalytic activity notably after pmo immobilization onto the fe3o4 al2o3 the absorption edge was shifted to the region of visible light the kubelka munk relation eq 2 was applied to measure the optical bandgap energy eg of the fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples using the drs curves the notation in eq 2 are α h ν and a which represent the absorption coefficient plank constant incident light frequency and constant respectively the eg values of fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples were 2 65 and 2 22 ev respectively therefore the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo has slightly extended light absorption and lower eg compared with fe3o4 al2o3 sample 2 αhν a hν eg n 2 3 2 photocatalytic degradation activity 3 2 1 evaluation of adsorption photolysis and photocatalytic properties the adsorption photolysis and photocatalytic properties of pmo fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples were evaluated for cby dye removal from synthetic wastewater the experimental conditions were fixed as initial cby dye concentration 40 mg l catalyst dosage 1 g l in case of pmo 0 5 g l h2o2 cby molar ratio 0 2 if used initial ph 7 2 and air flowrate 0 15 lpm it can be observed from fig 7 that in the presence of fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo in the dark adsorption the dye degradation increased within 90 min and then stayed unchanged therefore the cby 3g p solution must stay 120 min in dark before uv lighting so as to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium the dye adsorption efficiencies were 25 and 22 8 for fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo respectively the existence of h2o2 oxidant in the photocatalytic degradation system was also studied in the case of uv light photolysis and uv h2o2 the photocatalytic degradation efficiency after 240 min was 1 8 and 6 respectively the presence of fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposites with uv irradiation the photocatalytic degradation efficiency after 300 min were 47 9 and 83 5 respectively which confirmed that both the photocatalysts and uv irradiation system were desired for the high degradation rate the loading of pmo onto the nanocomposite catalyst improved the rate of photocatalytic degradation of cby by 35 6 actually pmo immobilization considerably increases photocatalytic degradation rate since the pmo work as an efficient electron scavenger accepts and carrying generated electrons from the conduction band cb this henceforth decreases the recombination rate of electron hole and thus increases the photoelectric conversion efficiency of pmo decorated nanocomposite fe3o4 al2o3 pmo the mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of cby dye can be explained as follows the cb electrons ecb and vb holes hvb are photogenerated when fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst suspension was exposed to light energy higher than its bandgap energy the adsorbed hydroxyl ions and oxygen species of the nanocomposites act together with the cby dye by hydrogen bonds and degradation occur during the formation of o2 and oh species which degrade the cby dye 3 fe3o4 al2o3 pmo hv fe3o4 al2o3 pmo ecb hvb 4 ecb o2 o2 5 hvb h2o h oh 6 o2 h oh2 7 o2 h2o ho2 oh 8 oh2 h2o h2o2 oh 9 h2o2 2 oh 10 o2 oh cby dye co2 h2o with the great importance of immobilized pmo onto porous fe3o4 al2o3 for photocatalysis due to the simple magnetic solid separation still heterogeneous fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalysts can involve particular disadvantages such as leakage of the pmo species from the catalyst furthermore heterogeneous fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalysts may show inferior photocatalytic activity than their pure pmo mostly due to the resistance to mass transfer and the diffusion restriction on the pmo active locations these limitations can be overcome by selection the stabile immobilization approach such as adsorption ion exchange and substitution or even encapsulation with other porous material in a core shell structure 51 3 2 2 influence of the reaction parameters on cby degradation over fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst the optimum conditions for photocatalytic degradation of cby dye were investigated as photocatalyst dose initial dye concentration and initial ph the kinetic parameters and regression coefficients of cby dye degradation under different experimental conditions were determined using the langmuir hinshelwood l h model 52 the integral form of the l h equation is 11 t 1 k r k ln c o c c 0 c k r the second term of eq 1 is unimportant and can be ignored at low initial cby 3g p concentration 1 12 t k r k t k app ln c o c where t irradiation time co initial cby concentration and c cby concentration after time t r rate of cby degradation k equilibrium constant for the adsorption of cby on the photocatalyst kr limiting reaction rate constant at the maximum coverage and kapp reaction apparent rate constant 3 2 2 1 effect of initial cby dye concentration fig 8 a and b displays the degradation activity and mineralization in term of toc percent removal of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite at different initial concentration of cby dye from 10 to 160 mg l cby degradation efficiency is reduced with increasing initial concentration at specified conditions the experimental conditions were photocatalyst dosage 1 g l initial ph 7 2 and air flowrate 0 15 lpm more dye is degraded with decreasing initial concentration increasing the initial concentration of cby leads to more pollutant molecules to be absorbed on the surface of the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst and thus reducing the generated reactive oxidizing species because of overloading of the active sites 3 2 2 2 effect of photocatalyst dosage to avoid additional use of photocatalyst in the airlift reactor the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo dosage should be controlled the photocatalyst dosage is another significant parameter in the photocatalytic processes a set of experiments were conducted with changing the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst dosage from 0 5 to 3 g l as showed in fig 9 the cby dye degradation efficiency increased as the photocatalyst dosage increased from 0 5 to 2 g l it is obviously noted that the cby degradation efficiency increased from 72 0 to 87 5 as the photocatalyst dosage increased from 0 5 to 1 g l due to the existing more active sites on the surface of photocatalyst leading to absorb further photons from uv lamp enhancing the electrons transfer to the cb to oxidize cby dye 53 however increasing the photocatalyst dosage to 2 and 3 g l resulted in an unimportant enhancement of the degradation rate which is essentially attributed to the light aggregation and scatter effect resulted by the additional catalyst concentration 54 furthermore the agglomeration of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite may leads to decrease the required catalyst surface for absorption of photo thus 1 g l will be considered as the best photocatalyst dosage according to the degradation efficiency balance and cost aspects 3 2 2 3 effect of initial ph the initial ph of the contaminated effluents is an important operational parameter in the photocatalytic degradation systems since the ph impacts the charge on catalyst the positions of conductance and valence bands and the catalytic aggregate size 9 therefore the effect of initial ph was studied on the photocatalytic degradation of cby dye using fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst under visible light irradiation experimental conditions include initial cby concentration of 40 mg l photocatalyst dosage of 1 g l and air flowrate of 0 15 lpm as presented in fig 10 the photocatalytic degradation of cby worked considerably over the studied initial ph at 4 0 7 2 it can be detected that the degradation of cby activity by fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst at ph 4 0 is only 1 2 higher than at ph 7 2 after reaction time of 300 min thus ph about 7 2 is considered to be an optimum value in this work the effect of initial ph of the dye solution on the photocatalytic degradation activity of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst can be explained based on the fact that pmo species are excellent acidic catalyst which is stable at acidic conditions therefore low ph is satisfactory for the photocatalytic reaction additionally at low ph the cby is transformed into the quinoid form which is artlessly degraded 3 2 2 4 effect of air flowrate the effect of air flow on the cby dye degradation using fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst was investigated in the airlift photocatalytic reactor as shown in fig 11 the air flowrate was examined from 0 3 to 2 lpm whereas the other conditions fixed initial cby concentration of 40 mg l initial ph of 7 2 and photocatalyst dosage of 1 g l and irradiation time of 240 min were fixed liquid circulation velocities in the riser and downcomer sections of the airlift reactor were recorded at each air flowrate value using neutral buoyancy flow follower method as presented by ammar et al 55 as shown in fig 11 there is obviously an increase in the cby dye degradation efficiency from 83 to 90 0 when increasing air flowrate from 0 3 to 1 5 lpm respectively however there is no significant increase in the cby dye degradation when the air flowrate is increase above 1 5 lpm increasing cby dye degradation efficiency when increasing air flowrate may be attributed to the high mixing accomplished in the reactor and therefore increasing the liquid circulation velocities fig 12 between the two sections when more air flow and therefore more bubbles is use in the reactor this may obscure the light from reaching the reaction content 3 2 3 recyclability of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst fig 13 displays cycle runs of cby dye degradation on fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite after each reaction cycle the used photocatalyst sample was separated from solution by external magnet washed with ethanol and water and reused for the next cycle the cby adsorption capability of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo 22 8 considerably decreased after five adsorption cycles 9 3 on the other hand the cby degradation efficiency after the five cycles was remained over 83 during the adsorption photocatalytic degradation even if some reduction in photocatalytic activity of cby degradation was observed after each reaction cycle fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite retained high reaction activity during the recycling progression for example the photocatalytic degradation was 87 5 for the first reaction cycle and 83 1 1 after the sixth reaction cycle returning only 4 4 cby reduction percent fig 13 therefore it can be considered that the magnetic fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst is tremendously stable easily recyclable and it can be used in treatment of dye contaminated wastewater moreover xrd and uv vis drs tests of the fresh and recycled after five reaction cycles fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst were performed as shown in fig 14 the xrd and uv vis drs results of the reused fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst displayed no obvious variation compared with the fresh one suggesting very good stability of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo catalyst under visible light treatment 3 2 4 comparison with recent works the analyses for comparison with the current studies have been deliberated in table 2 comparisons analyses have been investigated according to the initial cby dye concentration irradiation time ph and degradation efficiency it was detected from table 2 that fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst is potential photocatalyst in comparison to other conventional stated in previous works 3 3 cby dye degradation adsorption in a continuous mode the cby degradation adsorption efficiency of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst in a continuous mode was examined using 1 g l photocatalyst dosage initial ph of 7 2 air flowrate of 1 lpm and a flow of 40 mg l initial dye concentration solution supplied at three different rate of 5 10 and 20 ml min the breakthrough curves of photocatalytic degradation efficiency of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite were shown in fig 15 under continuous flow for all flowrates the system reaches the steady state after 180 min from the startup high degradation rate was achieved at low flowrate in of higher residence time 4 conclusion in summary magnetic core shell nanocomposite of phosphomolybdic immobilized on magnetic alumina fe3o4 al2o3 pmo was successfully prepared the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo has relatively revealed good photocatalytic degradation efficiency of cby dye as an organic pollutant in a three phase airlift photocatalytic reactor under uv irradiation the photocatalytic

significant stability and recyclability after five reaction cycles keywords magnetic nanocomposites photocatalytic degradation phosphomolybdic acid cibacron brilliant yellow 3g p airlift reactor 1 introduction in the recent years many organic substances from both industrial and human activities have caused serious health problems on living organisms and have become a major concern 1 2 textile industry is considered as one of the main source of extremely reactive and toxic azo dyes such as methylene blue mb methyl orange mo cibacron brilliant yellow 3g p 3 toxicity tests of these dyes showed that it causes several harmful effects on aquatic organisms even at low exposure concentrations 4 numerous effective remediation technologies have been developed for removal of azo dye cibacron brilliant yellow 3g p from wastewater 5 these remediation technologies include biodegradation fenton oxidation h2o2 oxidation and photocatalytic techniques 6 7 recently photocatalytic degradation process using heterogeneous photocatalyst is seems to be one of the hopeful technologies and has been effectively applied to reduce different organic contaminants due to its high degradation rate low toxicity low cost and relatively operate under moderate conditions 8 9 several nanocomposite materials have used as photocatalysts such as titanium dioxide 10 11 zeolite 12 13 copper oxides 14 15 nickel oxide 16 magnesium oxide 17 18 cds 19 pbs 20 and zn2sio4 21 based nanocomposites applications of metallic glasses were also developed as catalysts in wastewater treatment processes 22 25 over the past decade polyoxometalates poms have drawn more care as homogenous catalysts during synthesis of several organics and also for environmental remediation 26 poms are a class of discrete typically

groups of pom compounds heteropoly xxmmoy n and isopolyanions mmoy n 28 heteropolyanions xxmmoy n are heteroatoms with three main structures including anderson evans xm6o24 n kegging xm12o40 n and wells dawson x2m12o62 n 26 the electron acceptor properties ground state oxidant of the keggin form heteropolyanions and its uses in photocatalytic processes have been stated in many previous reports 12 13 in spite of these reported limitations of poms as photocatalysts there are specific drawbacks in their applications they consist of difficulty in separation and recycle of poms catalyst because of their homogeneous state and low efficiency compared with high surface area heterogeneous catalysts 31 32 immobilization of poms compounds onto porous supports may overcome these limitations 12 15 several supporting materials such as alumina and silica have shown high surface area in addition to their adsorptive and catalytic properties in environmental contamination treatment 34 between different metal oxide nanoparticles alumina has attracted attention because of its applicability in catalytic processes 35 alumina based nanocomposites such as alumina swcnt 18 19 aluminum metal oxide nanocomposites 20 21 and alumina go 22 23 have been developed and reported furthermore to increase the photocatalytic performance of the magnetic photocatalysts the influence of an in between layer of silica or alumina between the magnetic core and the external active photocatalyst shell such as zno and tio2 on the activity of the magnetic photocatalysts has been investigated and show that the existence of these middle layers can improve the performance and stability of the photocatalyst 42 43 also silica or alumina middle layers not only prevent the magnetic core from photodegradation but also prevent the undesirable movement of charge transporters from the active photocatalyst shell to the magnetic core which will decreases the photocatalyst activity 44 45 in this study magnetic core

for 30 min 2 4 photocatalytic activity assessment the photocatalytic activity of the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo magnetic nanocomposite was investigated through the degradation of cby dye under uv irradiation 360 nm in an airlift photocatalytic reactor the three phase airlift reactor used in this work was an internal loop 0 816 l working volume composed from two concentric tubes made from acrylic inner tube of 22 cm long and 8 cm diameter and outer tube of 30 cm long and 12 cm diameter the air was sparged in the inner tube to be a riser while the region formed by concentric tubes is to be a downcomer cby aqueous solution is arisen in inner tube riser section and fallen in outer tube downcomer section to generate a liquid circulation due to air holdup difference between the two sections 8 w uv lamp tuv g8t5 lamp bulb tube philips was used as a visible light source and fixed inside a pyrex glass tube which immersed in the riser section inner tube the reaction temperature was fixed at room temperature by circulating water through a cooling jacket fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the photocatalytic airlift reactor used for degradation of cby dye for photocatalytic degradation process the desired amount of catalyst 0 5 3 g l was used in the airlift reactor containing aqueous solution of cby dye at different initial concentration 10 160 mg l in all experiment the riser section in the airlift reactor was sparged with air at prespecified flowrate from 0 1 to 0 4 lpm as an initial study the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo magnetic nanocomposites using 1 g l adsorbent dosage without uv light as well as the direct photolysis efficiency was investigated with time furthermore the photocatalytic activity of the fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples was studied by subjecting uv light in all these preliminary study 40 mg l initial concentration of the cby dye was used at each prespecified time interval 2 ml samples were taken from the airlift reactor using sampling syringe centrifuged and the concentration of cby dye in the solution was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer model perkin elmer lambda 35 us at a maximum wavelength of 404 nm the degree of mineralization was checked by measuring the total organic carbon toc using shimadzu 5050a vcbh toc analyzer the toc removal is calculated as follows 1 t o c r e m o v a l t o c o t o c t o c o 100 toco and toc represent the initial and the varied toc of cby dye respectively the effect of initial ph on the cby dye degradation was also studied for ph range from 4 to 11 under constant experimental conditions initial concentration of cby 40 mg l fe3o4 al2o3 pmo catalyst dose 1 g l and air flowrate 0 15 lpm the initial ph value was modified through adding 0 1 n hcl or naoh the continuous flow degradation adsorption efficiency of cby 3g p dye was carried out in the airlift reactor fed with dye solution at three different rate of 5 10 and 20 ml min of 40 mg l initial cby dye concentration using dosing pump 1 g l of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst dose was used in these runs 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization fig 2 displays the xrd patterns of fe3o4 mnps fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposites for the naked fe3o4 mnps fig 2a a notable diffraction peaks of fe2o3 shown at 2θ of 30 435 35 73 43 78 54 181 57 621 62 771 corresponding very well with 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes respectively of standard fe3o4 nps according to the jcpds card no 88 0315 48 three magnetic phases were observed in synthesized fe3o4 mnps maghemite γ fe2o3 phase was found at 2θ of 30 435 35 73 and 54 181 while magnetite phase was presence with high intensity peaks at 2θ of 35 73 43 78 54 181 and 57 621 after alumina coated the fe2o3 peaks in the fe3o4 al2o3 nanocomposite fig 2b bare looks weaker than the naked ones suggesting the efficiency of the coating process and it is obviously observed that the core shell fe3o4 al2o3 nanocomposite display xrd pattern like to that of naked fe3o4 mnps fig 2c shows the xrd patterns of the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite the peak intensity of fe3o4 al2o3 nanocomposite reduced after pmo immobilization the diffraction peaks of pmo in final fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite were not found indicating good dispersion of pmo species on the surface of fe3o4 al2o3 however the molecular structure of pmo was confirmed by edx test fig 3 to investigate the surface morphology and microstructure of the nano particles composites fe sem images were obtained fe sem of fe3o4 fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples is revealed in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3a that the fe3o4 mnps were spherical in shape with regular structure and a particle diameter of about 24 37 nm moreover the fe3o4 al2o3 core shell nanocomposite had an insignificant change in the morphology from bare fe3o4 mnps as revealed in fig 3b from the fe sem image of fig 3c the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite were synthesized homogeneously which showed the pmo was efficiently immobilized on the fe3o4 al2o3 surface with a little aggregation moreover fig 2d shows the tem image of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite which displays the core shell structure the contrast between the composition of the core and the shell materials are clearly displayed fig 3e shows the edx analysis of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo sample it is clear that iron aluminum phosphor and molybdenum peaks approve the existence of pmo and al2o3 shell and fe3o4 core in the final fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposites the oxygen peak yields from the al2o3 and fe3o4 species the magnetic hysteresis loops of fe3o4 mnps fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples were analyzed at room temperature as revealed in fig 4 the magnetic saturation ms values were 63 6 11 7 and 8 8 emu g for fe3o4 mnps fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo respectively the reduction in ms values in the order of fe3o4 mnps fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo may be attributed to the influence of the non magnetic volume to the total sample volume as observed in fig 4 the magnetization demagnetization loops were synchronized no hysteresis occurred and remanence and coercive field were zero the results show that all synthesized nanocomposites are supermagnetic the good magnetization of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo sample proposes its appropriateness for magnetic separation the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo sample can be simply separated by an external magnet and it can be efficiently re suspended in the liquid media once take away this magnet the specific surface area and average pore size of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite are revealed in fig 5 using bet method through n2 adsorptione desorption isotherms it is clear that the isotherm type is categorized as typical iv type based on the iupac sorting indicating a mesoporous structure good bet surface area 53 6 m2 g and total pore volume 0 231 cm3 g of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite was achieved the average pore size of was mainly focus on 10 5 nm which calculated by bjh technique the uv vis dr spectrum was performed to check the capability of the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst for production of electron hole pairs when exposed to radiation as presented in fig 6 which shows the uv vis dr spectrum of fe3o4 mnps fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples a wide band was detected for of fe3o4 mnps at wavelength range 320 760 nm which may be due to the effect octahedral fe3 49 the characteristic peak was detected about 370 nm of fe3o4 mnps 50 after coverage of fe3o4 mnps with al2o3 shell fe3o4 al2o3 the absorbance of fe3o4 core is not different largely the absorption boundaries of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo sample show red shift and this may due to the heteroconnection between fe3o4 al2o3 and pmo species of narrow bandgap consequently the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst show strong absorption in the visible light region of suggesting that the final photocatalyst produce further electron hole pairs when irradiated and hence it have improved photocatalytic activity notably after pmo immobilization onto the fe3o4 al2o3 the absorption edge was shifted to the region of visible light the kubelka munk relation eq 2 was applied to measure the optical bandgap energy eg of the fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples using the drs curves the notation in eq 2 are α h ν and a which represent the absorption coefficient plank constant incident light frequency and constant respectively the eg values of fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples were 2 65 and 2 22 ev respectively therefore the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo has slightly extended light absorption and lower eg compared with fe3o4 al2o3 sample 2 αhν a hν eg n 2 3 2 photocatalytic degradation activity 3 2 1 evaluation of adsorption photolysis and photocatalytic properties the adsorption photolysis and photocatalytic properties of pmo fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo samples were evaluated for cby dye removal from synthetic wastewater the experimental conditions were fixed as initial cby dye concentration 40 mg l catalyst dosage 1 g l in case of pmo 0 5 g l h2o2 cby molar ratio 0 2 if used initial ph 7 2 and air flowrate 0 15 lpm it can be observed from fig 7 that in the presence of fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo in the dark adsorption the dye degradation increased within 90 min and then stayed unchanged therefore the cby 3g p solution must stay 120 min in dark before uv lighting so as to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium the dye adsorption efficiencies were 25 and 22 8 for fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo respectively the existence of h2o2 oxidant in the photocatalytic degradation system was also studied in the case of uv light photolysis and uv h2o2 the photocatalytic degradation efficiency after 240 min was 1 8 and 6 respectively the presence of fe3o4 al2o3 and fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposites with uv irradiation the photocatalytic degradation efficiency after 300 min were 47 9 and 83 5 respectively which confirmed that both the photocatalysts and uv irradiation system were desired for the high degradation rate the loading of pmo onto the nanocomposite catalyst improved the rate of photocatalytic degradation of cby by 35 6 actually pmo immobilization considerably increases photocatalytic degradation rate since the pmo work as an efficient electron scavenger accepts and carrying generated electrons from the conduction band cb this henceforth decreases the recombination rate of electron hole and thus increases the photoelectric conversion efficiency of pmo decorated nanocomposite fe3o4 al2o3 pmo the mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of cby dye can be explained as follows the cb electrons ecb and vb holes hvb are photogenerated when fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst suspension was exposed to light energy higher than its bandgap energy the adsorbed hydroxyl ions and oxygen species of the nanocomposites act together with the cby dye by hydrogen bonds and degradation occur during the formation of o2 and oh species which degrade the cby dye 3 fe3o4 al2o3 pmo hv fe3o4 al2o3 pmo ecb hvb 4 ecb o2 o2 5 hvb h2o h oh 6 o2 h oh2 7 o2 h2o ho2 oh 8 oh2 h2o h2o2 oh 9 h2o2 2 oh 10 o2 oh cby dye co2 h2o with the great importance of immobilized pmo onto porous fe3o4 al2o3 for photocatalysis due to the simple magnetic solid separation still heterogeneous fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalysts can involve particular disadvantages such as leakage of the pmo species from the catalyst furthermore heterogeneous fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalysts may show inferior photocatalytic activity than their pure pmo mostly due to the resistance to mass transfer and the diffusion restriction on the pmo active locations these limitations can be overcome by selection the stabile immobilization approach such as adsorption ion exchange and substitution or even encapsulation with other porous material in a core shell structure 51 3 2 2 influence of the reaction parameters on cby degradation over fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst the optimum conditions for photocatalytic degradation of cby dye were investigated as photocatalyst dose initial dye concentration and initial ph the kinetic parameters and regression coefficients of cby dye degradation under different experimental conditions were determined using the langmuir hinshelwood l h model 52 the integral form of the l h equation is 11 t 1 k r k ln c o c c 0 c k r the second term of eq 1 is unimportant and can be ignored at low initial cby 3g p concentration 1 12 t k r k t k app ln c o c where t irradiation time co initial cby concentration and c cby concentration after time t r rate of cby degradation k equilibrium constant for the adsorption of cby on the photocatalyst kr limiting reaction rate constant at the maximum coverage and kapp reaction apparent rate constant 3 2 2 1 effect of initial cby dye concentration fig 8 a and b displays the degradation activity and mineralization in term of toc percent removal of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite at different initial concentration of cby dye from 10 to 160 mg l cby degradation efficiency is reduced with increasing initial concentration at specified conditions the experimental conditions were photocatalyst dosage 1 g l initial ph 7 2 and air flowrate 0 15 lpm more dye is degraded with decreasing initial concentration increasing the initial concentration of cby leads to more pollutant molecules to be absorbed on the surface of the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst and thus reducing the generated reactive oxidizing species because of overloading of the active sites 3 2 2 2 effect of photocatalyst dosage to avoid additional use of photocatalyst in the airlift reactor the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo dosage should be controlled the photocatalyst dosage is another significant parameter in the photocatalytic processes a set of experiments were conducted with changing the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst dosage from 0 5 to 3 g l as showed in fig 9 the cby dye degradation efficiency increased as the photocatalyst dosage increased from 0 5 to 2 g l it is obviously noted that the cby degradation efficiency increased from 72 0 to 87 5 as the photocatalyst dosage increased from 0 5 to 1 g l due to the existing more active sites on the surface of photocatalyst leading to absorb further photons from uv lamp enhancing the electrons transfer to the cb to oxidize cby dye 53 however increasing the photocatalyst dosage to 2 and 3 g l resulted in an unimportant enhancement of the degradation rate which is essentially attributed to the light aggregation and scatter effect resulted by the additional catalyst concentration 54 furthermore the agglomeration of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite may leads to decrease the required catalyst surface for absorption of photo thus 1 g l will be considered as the best photocatalyst dosage according to the degradation efficiency balance and cost aspects 3 2 2 3 effect of initial ph the initial ph of the contaminated effluents is an important operational parameter in the photocatalytic degradation systems since the ph impacts the charge on catalyst the positions of conductance and valence bands and the catalytic aggregate size 9 therefore the effect of initial ph was studied on the photocatalytic degradation of cby dye using fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst under visible light irradiation experimental conditions include initial cby concentration of 40 mg l photocatalyst dosage of 1 g l and air flowrate of 0 15 lpm as presented in fig 10 the photocatalytic degradation of cby worked considerably over the studied initial ph at 4 0 7 2 it can be detected that the degradation of cby activity by fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst at ph 4 0 is only 1 2 higher than at ph 7 2 after reaction time of 300 min thus ph about 7 2 is considered to be an optimum value in this work the effect of initial ph of the dye solution on the photocatalytic degradation activity of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst can be explained based on the fact that pmo species are excellent acidic catalyst which is stable at acidic conditions therefore low ph is satisfactory for the photocatalytic reaction additionally at low ph the cby is transformed into the quinoid form which is artlessly degraded 3 2 2 4 effect of air flowrate the effect of air flow on the cby dye degradation using fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst was investigated in the airlift photocatalytic reactor as shown in fig 11 the air flowrate was examined from 0 3 to 2 lpm whereas the other conditions fixed initial cby concentration of 40 mg l initial ph of 7 2 and photocatalyst dosage of 1 g l and irradiation time of 240 min were fixed liquid circulation velocities in the riser and downcomer sections of the airlift reactor were recorded at each air flowrate value using neutral buoyancy flow follower method as presented by ammar et al 55 as shown in fig 11 there is obviously an increase in the cby dye degradation efficiency from 83 to 90 0 when increasing air flowrate from 0 3 to 1 5 lpm respectively however there is no significant increase in the cby dye degradation when the air flowrate is increase above 1 5 lpm increasing cby dye degradation efficiency when increasing air flowrate may be attributed to the high mixing accomplished in the reactor and therefore increasing the liquid circulation velocities fig 12 between the two sections when more air flow and therefore more bubbles is use in the reactor this may obscure the light from reaching the reaction content 3 2 3 recyclability of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst fig 13 displays cycle runs of cby dye degradation on fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite after each reaction cycle the used photocatalyst sample was separated from solution by external magnet washed with ethanol and water and reused for the next cycle the cby adsorption capability of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo 22 8 considerably decreased after five adsorption cycles 9 3 on the other hand the cby degradation efficiency after the five cycles was remained over 83 during the adsorption photocatalytic degradation even if some reduction in photocatalytic activity of cby degradation was observed after each reaction cycle fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite retained high reaction activity during the recycling progression for example the photocatalytic degradation was 87 5 for the first reaction cycle and 83 1 1 after the sixth reaction cycle returning only 4 4 cby reduction percent fig 13 therefore it can be considered that the magnetic fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst is tremendously stable easily recyclable and it can be used in treatment of dye contaminated wastewater moreover xrd and uv vis drs tests of the fresh and recycled after five reaction cycles fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst were performed as shown in fig 14 the xrd and uv vis drs results of the reused fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst displayed no obvious variation compared with the fresh one suggesting very good stability of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo catalyst under visible light treatment 3 2 4 comparison with recent works the analyses for comparison with the current studies have been deliberated in table 2 comparisons analyses have been investigated according to the initial cby dye concentration irradiation time ph and degradation efficiency it was detected from table 2 that fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst is potential photocatalyst in comparison to other conventional stated in previous works 3 3 cby dye degradation adsorption in a continuous mode the cby degradation adsorption efficiency of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo photocatalyst in a continuous mode was examined using 1 g l photocatalyst dosage initial ph of 7 2 air flowrate of 1 lpm and a flow of 40 mg l initial dye concentration solution supplied at three different rate of 5 10 and 20 ml min the breakthrough curves of photocatalytic degradation efficiency of fe3o4 al2o3 pmo nanocomposite were shown in fig 15 under continuous flow for all flowrates the system reaches the steady state after 180 min from the startup high degradation rate was achieved at low flowrate in of higher residence time 4 conclusion in summary magnetic core shell nanocomposite of phosphomolybdic immobilized on magnetic alumina fe3o4 al2o3 pmo was successfully prepared the fe3o4 al2o3 pmo has relatively revealed good photocatalytic degradation efficiency of cby dye as an organic pollutant in a three phase airlift photocatalytic reactor under uv irradiation the photocatalytic degradation efficiency was considerably affected by cby dye concentration photocatalyst dosage and initial ph declaration of competing interest the authors whose names are listed immediately below

aquatic system is considered as a severe environmental problem due to their high toxicity at low concentration non biodegradability and significant assemblage in biotic component 1 4 several points and non point sources like domestic sewage industrial wastewater tannery effluent are responsible for the contamination of natural freshwater 5 10 lead pb nickel ni copper cu and zinc zn ions are among major heavy metals which are found in untreated wastewater 11 release of untreated wastewater in freshwater channels or streams had lead to several epidemic problems to the human civilization 11 12 according to indian standards is 10500 for drinkable water specifications acceptable limit for heavy metals like lead pb is 0 01 mg l nickel ni is 0 02 mg l copper cu is 0 05 mg l and zinc zn is 5 mg l is 10500 respectively 145 thus to compile with the mentioned limits treatment of unprocessed wastewater becomes a topmost priorities for the industries heavy metal contaminated industrial wastewater could be treated using some implicit techniques like surface adsorption 13 14 chemical precipitation 15 gradient electrophoresis 16 and forward phase osmosis 1 2 among these surface adsorption of heavy metals is considered as an economic and efficient operational technique which could be applied for wastewater management 3 adsorption involves adhesion of molecules onto a surface of an adsorbent by covalent or non covalent interactions 17 18 adsorbent materials like clay 19 biomass 3 activated natural carbon 20 and bio composites 21 had shown their effectivity for the management of contaminants in the wastewater however due to their less efficiency low adsorption capacity and lack of large scale availability these materials limit their utility in industrial scale

for the iron complex salt and generates io nps green synthesized nanoparticles achieve higher stability in an aqueous system due to co precipitation or deposition of the proteinaceous and bioactive component onto the exterior surface of the io nps 34 among different biotic components fungal species are considered as an efficient microbial entity for the synthesis of nanoparticles due to their

formation of io nps 70 the visual changes in optical properties might had happened due to ionic oscillation of surface plasmon resonance spr of the nanoparticles 29 30 71 fig 3a the synthesis of io nps involves biologically induced mineralization bim where secondary metabolites and extracellular enzymes released by the fungi stsp25 acted as a reductant for the ions or compounds in the solution which in turn leads to mineralization 72 extracellular enzyme nitrilase or nitrogen reductase might have played a pivotal role in the fabrication of io nps 34 73 data recorded from particle size and zeta analyser showed the particles are in a range between 40 100 nm as shown in fig 3c i and the zeta potential value of 30 6 mv as depicted in fig 3c ii these findings might indicate that the nanoparticles have good stability in the aqueous phase 74 75 the stability of the nanoparticles might have occurred do the deposition of extracellular fungal components which was confirmed through ftir analysis ftir spectrometric analysis of the freeze dried nanoparticles fig 3b showed peaks at 560 cm 1 and 670 cm 1 confirming the oscillation for fe o fe band 30 76 the high intensified peak in the region of 1064 cm 1 and 1249 cm 1 attributed to c o c stretching band and ch3 bend vibrations respectively 77 78 peaks in the wavenumber region 1547 cm 1 1654 cm 1 and 1721 cm 1 resulted from amide i and ii bands thus confirming the deposition of extracellular fungal molecules like enzyme proteins 79 etc the presence of characteristic stretch peak from 3300 3400 cm 1 attributed to oh stretching and coo stretching vibrations band confirming the formation of iron oxides during the lyophilisation and presence of protein molecules on the synthesized nanoparticles 29 30 80 ftir analysis with the zeta potential data might suggest an involvement of bio molecules as a capping component for the io nps which provides stability to the nanoparticles and when placed in the aqueous

different sizes of particles obtained during tem analysis complements the fesem analysis poly dispersive index pdi calculated for the synthesized nanoparticle was coined to be 0 04 which infers the monodisperse nature of the nanoparticle 29 30 elemental composition of the nanoparticles was determined from the edx spectrum of the lyophilised samples fig 3e and 4e the high intensified signal of elemental iron fe at the spectral position of 1 as well as 7 kev might suggest the occurrence of surface plasma resonance spr of fe nanocrystals 81 the io nps was composed of 37 71 carbon 46 12 oxygen 3 63 platinum 0 28 sulphur 0 27 chlorine and 11 9 iron signals of elemental platinum observed in fesem edx analysis is due to the use of platinum for coating the nanoparticles while the observed signals of carbon might be due to the use of carbon tape as a binder and presence of extracellular bioactive compounds on the synthesized nanoparticles however in tem edx analysis io nps composed of 26 92 oxygen 65 89 iron and 7 19 copper the signals of elemental copper as well as carbon had occurred due to utilization of copper grid which was coated with carbon and the presence of extracellular bioactive compounds the distinct peak for elemental oxygen confirms the oxide o2 nature of the nanoparticles however different peaks for metals and non metals like mn k cl and s were obtained during the analysis these peaks for mn k cl and s indicate the embedment of bioactive molecules with nanoparticles 31 82 the crystalline structure of nanoparticles as depicted from xrd fig 5 a showed distinctive x ray diffraction xrd peaks in the region 012 104 110 113 024 116 122 214 300 which were found to be identically matched with the rhombohedral configuration of jcpds no 24 0072 which indicates the formed nanoparticle to be hematite fe2o3 in nature the nanoparticles contained lattice constants a equals to 5 0356 å and c equals to 13 7489 å the distinctive peaks at different 2θ position from 20 to 70 indicated crystal structure of the nanoparticles 29 30 the broadened peak full width at half maximum as obtained during the xrd analysis confirms the particles were nanoscale in range the scherrer formula for the particle size analysis d 0 9 γ β c o s θ showed the size of the nanoparticles at 2 θ 21 44 was 82 43 nm approximately these findings were found to be consistent with the tem results thus confirming the nanometer and oxide nature of the nanoparticles magnetic measurement of the io nps was considered from 6 t to 6 t fig 5b and the temperature dependent magnetization for the nanoparticles was carried out in zfc and fc mode the graphs in fig 5b and fig 5c showed the m h curves generated for the nanoparticles at 20 k 50 k 150 k and 300 k respectively s shaped hysteresis loop was observed for the temperature 20 k 300 k which showed the ferromagnetic nature of the io nps with saturation magnetization of ms 33 003 emu g at 300 k 83 84 these findings might suggest the ferromagnetism nature of the nanoparticles at room temperature which makes it an effective material which could be reluctantly separated from an aqueous matrix just by inducing a magnetic force it addition it could be observed that magnetic saturation ms coercivity hc decreases as the temperature increase from 20 k 300 k which revels the typical ferromagnetism in the io nps fig 5d shows mt measurement of zfc fc in presence of the magnetic force of 0 05 t it was evident that fc and zfc curves followed a similar trend and showed a sharp rise in the susceptibility till 30 k and thereafter it increases sharply it could be noted from the graph that both the curves are mostly separated for the whole range of temperature which infers that curie temperature of the sample exceeds 300 k 84 4 3 role of physical and chemical factors on the adsorption of metal ions 4 3 1 ph ph is one of the important chemical characteristics which governs the adsorption of heavy metals onto the io nps in an aqueous matrix the ph dependent heavy metals removal was observed for different adsorbent like amorphous iron oxyhydroxide 85 goethite 86 sodium tetraborate modified kaolinite clay 87 in our study ph 2 8 of the solution was varied for the batch adsorption of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii the heavy metal concentration of 10 mg l and io nps concentration of 1 g l was kept constant for all the experimental procedure results revealed from the ph studies indicated a gradual increase in the adsorption capacity in the io nps from ph 2 6 thereafter the adsorption capacity decreases gradually when ph increases to 8 this phenomenon might attribute to the fact that in an aqueous system external surface of the iron oxide fe2o3 nanoparticle always covered with feoh group 50 88 89 this hydroxyl group of iron protonates when ph phpzc giving rise to the surface charge feoh2 and deprotonates when ph phpzc giving rise to the surface charge feo 89 90 in our study the phpzc value for the io nps was found to be 3 48 at ph greater then phpzc fig 6 a the surface charge of the io nps was negative which favours the adsorption of cationic heavy metal ions 91 92 optimum ph for the maximum removal of heavy metal was found to be 6 for our study which is greater than 3 48 thus favouring the adsorption of positively charged pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii ions onto the negatively charged io nps at ph 2 fig 6b lowest amount of heavy metal was adsorbed which might be due to the protonation of the active site thus leading to the generation of feoh2 on the surface of the io nps which electrostatically repulse the cations 50 51 93 enhancing the ph from 2 increases the deprotonation of feoh group this phenomenon escalates the overall electrostatic attractive force between cationic heavy metals and io nps also the overall reduction in the repulsive force between cationic heavy metal ions and feoh2 52 increases the adsorption of the heavy metals as ph rises our study complements the findings of ebrahim et al 94 which indicated maximum adsorption of heavy metals could be observed at ph 6 two way anova and tukey s multiple comparisons validated our findings with p value less than 0 0001 the removal of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii were observed as 92 06 2 09 90 66 1 91 88 97 2 23 and 87 06 2 35 respectively at ph 6 however when ph of the solution was further increased to 8 there is a significant p 0 0001 decreases in the adsorption of heavy metals was observed this decrease in the adsorption capacity of the io nps might have occurred due to the development of pb oh 2 zn oh 2 cu oh 2 and ni oh 2 complex 95 96 hence removal of the heavy metals beyond ph 6 introduces uncertainty in the experiment due to the formation of metal hydroxides for this particular reason ph 6 was kept constant throughout the batch studies 4 3 2 adsorbent io nps concentration io nps charging concentration of 0 2 g l to 1 g l were studied for the exclusion of metal ions in the aqueous matrix a reaction set of 0 05 l of 10 mg l concentration of metal ions was maintained for each charging concentration of io nps for 120 min it was observed that the exclusion of heavy metallic ions significantly increases with successive increase in the concentration of io nps p 0 0001 two way anova and tukey s multiple comparisons test 97 49 1 00 of pb ii 96 32 1 64 of ni ii 92 12 1 56 of cu ii and 90 15 1 53 of zn ii was removed from the synthetic wastewater solution at 1 g l loading concentration of io nps fig 6d the exclusion of heavy metals was observed to be most proficient at the highest charging concentration suggesting that with increasing nanoparticle concentration active sites on the nanoparticles increases which might lead to effective adsorption of heavy metals 97 it was also observed that heavy metals were adsorbed rapidly till 90 min of the reaction time further increasing the till 120 min time didn t altered the removal each metal ions this incident might happen due to impregnation of active locus of io nps by the finite amount of applied heavy metals 98 further increasing the metal concentration might shift the equilibrium time of the reaction mixture 4 3 3 temperature the effectiveness of the nanoparticles for the sorption of metal ions greatly depends on temperature in our study the rate of adsorption for metal ions was studied from 293 to 313 k it was observed that the potentiality of the nanoparticles for the adsorption significantly increases with temperature p 0 0001 two way anova and tukey s multiple comparisons test the effective increase in the adsorption potentiality in the io nps from 87 12 0 39 92 06 0 97 for pb ii 76 07 0 76 96 66 1 41 for ni ii ions 60 07 0 19 83 35 0 89 for cu ii and 75 06 0 93 91 06 0 98 for zn ii was observed for the temperature range of 293 313 k fig 6c this phenomenon might have occurred due to increase in the diffusion rate for the metallic ions into the interior pores as well as on the exterior surface of the magnetic nanoparticles 99 100 as diffusion is an endothermic process thus adsorption increases with increasing temperature 100 another possible interpretation considers that pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii ions are well hydrated in an aqueous matrix normally this hydration shell prevents the adsorption process at a lower temperature 101 increasing the temperature provides endothermic energy which removes the hydration shell from the metal ions thus facilitating the process of adsorption 102 similar types of studies were reported by chen and wang 101 chang et al 103 and sheng et al 102 rise in temperature also enhances the total pore volume and porosity of the io nps which eventually increases the number of active attachment sites on nanoparticles 99 100 104 the above results were supported by the various thermodynamic analyses which shedes light on the detailed mechanism of adsorption at the higher temperature 4 4 effect of hno3 on desorption of heavy metal and the reusability study on io nps reusability of the nanoparticle validates the effectivity of the nanosorbent for the removal of heavy metals and in the previous section it was indicated that adsorption of heavy metals was found highly dependent on the ph of the solution hence lowering the ph would favours the desorption of heavy metals therefore in our study 1 10 mm of hno3 was used to desorbed heavy metals from the io nps experimental results from the desorption studies revealed that 10 mm solution of hno3 acts significantly p 0 0001 two way anova and tukey s multiple comparisons test in desorbing 98 97 0 81 for pb ii 96 65 1 00 for ni ii 90 12 0 89 for cu ii and 92 13 0 90 for zn ii fig 7 a ions from io nps it was noted that a gradual increase in the concentration of hno3 facilitates greater amount of desorption the possible mechanism for the desorption was proposed by zhou and haynes 105 and lata et al 106 according to which the process follows three steps i low ph favours desorption of metal cations as adsorption of metal ions and precipitation of metal hydroxides occurs at higher ph ii strong competition between metal and h ions at lower ph displaces the metallic ion in the desorbing solution which iii lowers the adsorption capacity of the io nps hence the result suggests that adsorption of heavy metals onto io nps is reversible and the bonding between the nanosorbent and the metal ion was weak the finding also suggests that a very low amount of acid is suitable for the desorption which increases its potentiality for the recovery of heavy metals from wastewater further increasing the ph might have results into the accumulation of h ions in the solution which increases the electrostatic repulsion between h and cationic heavy metal ions thus inhibiting heavy meal desorption 107 108 it was also observed that during the change in ph no residual fe was detected by icp oes which indicates that dissolution of iron oxide nanoparticles was not an issue for the desorption of heavy metals five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles fig 7b were performed for a better understanding of reusability potentiality of the adsorbent it was evident from fig 7b that after 3rd cycle there is a considerable decline in the efficiency of the io nps p 0 0001 two way anova and tukey s multiple comparisons test therefore it might be hypothesized that green nanoparticles possibly be considered as an efficient sustainable and eco friendly adsorbent for heavy metals 4 5 adsorption isothermic study four adsorption isotherm process which includes i langmuir isotherm ii temkin isotherm iii freundlich isotherm and iv d r isotherm model was considered for evaluating the adsorption process table 1 each model shaded light onto the mechanistic insight of the adsorption process in 293 313 k temperature the correlation coefficient and model constants are produced in table 1 the langmuir model of isotherm predicts the utmost monolayer adsorption capability for the nanoparticles and also determines the favourability of the model 109 the r2 was was found to be in a range between 0 948 0 979 for pb ii 0 907 0 946 for ni ii 0 758 0 843 for cu ii and 0 922 0 975 for zn ii p 0 05 determined from ce heavy metals qe vs ce heavy metals plot the trend of r2 towards unity indicated the monolayer sorption of metal ions onto the limited active adsorption site of the io nps the dimensionless separating factor rl was evaluated from eq 6 110 7 r l 1 1 b l a n g m u i r c 0 the c0 is the preliminary concentration for the metal ions the rl for the experimental data was found to be in a range between 0 01 0 10 for pb ii 0 05 0 13 for ni ii 0 18 0 31 for cu ii and 0 05 0 18 for zn ii at 293 313 k indicating the process of adsorption was favourable for adsorption 111 freundlich isotherm constant n f freundlich was evaluated from the inclination of ln qe vs ln ce heavy metals regressed plot and was found to be greater than 1 for all the metal ions in all ranges of temperature our study complements the findings of taha et al 112 boparai et al 56 and saha et al 113 which indicate the higher affinity among io nps and heavy metal particles which highly favours the chemisorptions of metallic ions onto the facade of the nanoparticles in this study both the constants of the temkin isotherm model i e kt temkin and bt temkin was evaluated from the intercept and inclination of qe and ln ce heavy metals graph the model constant kt temkin at 293 303 and 313 k was found to be 3 292 3 900 and 4 660 for pb ii 2 688 2 982 and 4 718 for ni ii 2 406 2 519 and 2 798 for cu ii 4 416 3 205 and 3 847 l mg for zn ii respectively table 1 the evaluated values of kt temkin indicate considerable interaction between heavy metals and nanoparticles 114 while temkin constant bt temkin was found to be 3 025 2 412 and 1 943 for pb ii 4 385 3 574 and 1 798 for ni ii 6 158 5 184 and 3 923 for cu ii 2 689 3 185 and 2 427 for zn ii at 293 k 303 k and 313 k respectively indicating minor fluctuation in the heating energy of adsorption at different temperature 114 the high correlation coefficient r2 of 0 944 for pb ii 0 860 for ni ii 0 941 for cu ii 0 929 for zn ii p 0 05 indicated the chemisorption nature of the adsorption process 56 115 the d r isotherm constant factor qs d r estimated from the linearized model of ln qe vs ε2 plot and was not found consistent with the langmuir constant qe the correlation coefficient for d r model was established to be 0 624 for pb ii 0 415 for ni ii 0 501 for cu ii 0 573 for zn p 0 05 which shows its value to be minimum in comparison to other thermodynamic models hence from the comparative isotherm results it could be asserted that the adsorption of metallic ions on io nps is chemically driven process rather than the physical process 56 finally it could be concluded that the adsorption involves attachment of metal ions onto the monolayer surface of the nanoparticles bearing finite adsorptive active sites 4 6 adsorption kinetic study a comparative kinetic study was considered for four kinetic models like i pseudo 1st order kinetic model ii pseudo 2nd order kinetic model iii intraparticle diffusion kinetic model and iv elovich kinetic model between 293 313 k temperature the equilibrium of the reaction was achieved at 120 min the adsorption capacity of the io nps does not change significantly beyond the equilibrium time the r2 and the values of the kinetic constant for each model are depicted in table 2 from the comparative analysis it could be observed that the adsorption follows a pseudo 2nd order kinetics r2 value for the pseudo 2nd order kinetic model was in between 0 991 0 995 for pb ii 0 991 0 995 for ni ii 0 993 0 998 for cu ii and 0 981 0 992 for zn ii at 293 313 k p 0 05 the highest correlation coefficients value in comparison to other models indicated strong electrostatic interactions between heavy metals and mycosynthesized nanoparticles 109 the capacity of the io nps during saturation of the reaction from the pseudo 2nd order kinetics was determined to be 10 309 mg g for pb ii 12 19 mg g for ni ii 13 699 mg g for cu ii and 10 753 for zn ii respectively the regression graph between t qt vs t has shown excellent accordance between predicted and investigational values of adsorption capacity the activation energy ea was determined from the rate constant form k2 psudo 2nd pseudo 2nd order kinetics it could be observed that ea for adsorption of metal ions was greater than or equal to 21 kj mol which might recommend the chemical nature for the sorption of metal ions on nanoparticles 116 a kinetic study for adsorption provides insight regarding the mechanism behind the adsorption of heavy metals onto io nps it also helps in understanding the rate limiting step for the adsorption as per chingombe et al 117 adsorption follows three steps i surface diffusion of the adsorbate in a solution towards the exterior surface of the adsorbent ii intraparticle diffusion where adsorbate molecules diffuse towards the interior portion of the adsorbent iii adsorption of the adsorbate in the interior active site of the nanosorbent since adsorption occurs very rapidly it could be assumed that the process does not affect the total kinetics of the system 56 overall the rate of the reaction might also be controlled by surface or intraparticle diffusion the weber morris interparticle diffusion model is considered for the determination of rate limiting step of the adsorption process 118 119 intraparticle diffusion coefficients k diff idk and constant c idc was determined from qt vs t1 2 plot for all the metal ions at different temperature the k diff idk was found to be increasing gradually for each temperature which indicated the rise in the adsorbent capacity for the io nps 120 in this present work the linearized plot for the intraparticle diffusion did not pass through the origin which indicated that intraparticle diffusion of heavy metals into the io nps was not the rate limiting step for present adsorption study 56 60 61 this finding might suggest surface adsorption and interparticle diffusion might play conjugatively for the adsorption of heavy metals on nanoparticles 121 the value for the intercept c idk was found to be increasing with temperature increases the random motion of the heavy metals which eventually enhances their surface diffusion onto the io nps 122 our study complements the results reported by taqvi et al 118 wu et al 119 boparai et al 56 and lasheen et al 123 4 7 process thermodynamics thermodynamic parameter provides an extensive interpretation regarding the process of adsorption at different temperature 213 313 k which has been arranged in table 3 it was found that δg value was ranged between 4 643 to 6 376 kj mol for pb ii 1 500 to 5 626 kj mol for ni ii 0 994 to 4 191 kj mol for cu ii and 2 684 to 6 039 kj mol for zn ii at the temperature range of 213 313 k δg 0 indicated spontaneity of the adsorption process it was also observed that δg value was decreasing with temperature which indicated the favourability of the adsorption process at the higher temperature 28 65 109 the enthalpy δh value for the pb ii ni ii cu ii zn ii was found to be 20 668 kj mol 58 588 kj mol 68 698 kj mol 46 417kj mol respectively the positive value for the δh states the presence of strong chemical bond between heavy metal ions and io nps and indicated endothermic nature of the reaction 27 56 124 the entropy δs was found to be 86 133 j k mol 203 943 j k mol 248 256 j k mol 167 360 j k mol for pb ii ni ii cu ii zn ii respectively the positive and high value of δs indicates that the metals ions are spontaneously adsorbed on the solid exterior interface of the nanoparticles 17 18 125 hence from the thermodynamic study it might be concluded that the cations are strongly spontaneously and endothermically adsorbed onto the io nps and the reactions favour high temperature these findings were found to be consistent with the study observed in adsorption isotherm and kinetic study 4 8 analysis of central composite design ccd the results from the batch adsorption study were considered for the ccd design in rsm interface which is produced supplementary table ii as removal percentage of metallic ions by io nps the f value for the quadratic model generated in the ccd platform to remove metal ions i e pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii was 3003 93 6185 19 1084 18 and 10219 76 respectively supplementary table iv the high f value suggested that the hypothesized quadratic polynomial model was very much significantly adequate p 0 0001 and each expression for the quadratic polynomial derivative factors showed significance bearing the confidence level of 95 the values for the lack of fit in the analysed data was found to be 0 01 which depicts that the generated model was appropriate for the experimental data supplementary table v the derivative coefficient of regression r2 0 9998 0 9999 0 9993 and 0 9999 adjusted r2 0 9995 0 9998 0 9987 0 9999 and predicted r2 0 9979 0 9989 0 9926 and 0 9994 at significance level p 0 05 was found for pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii adsorption suggesting suitability of the quadratic polynomial module for prediction of adsorption process among cubic linear and two factor interaction modules supplementary table vi r2 value closer to unity validates the accuracy of the model the convenient agreement between predicted and adjusted r2 also signifies the compatibility of the model with the experimental data and there are 0 01 chance that model f value occurs due to noise 126 127 the adequate adeq precision for the adsorption process was found to be 261 330 374 514 158 888 and 487 444 for pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii respectively which was far too higher than 4 which indicates the adequacy of the model 128 the coefficient of variation value less than 1 20 indicates the precision of the model the model follows the following quadratic equations eq 7 8 9 and 10 which consist of 15 coefficients 8 pb removal 85 94 13 11 a 6 84 b 13 74 c 2 48 d 2 08 a b 6 47 a c 0 84 a d 0 91 b c 0 36 b d 1 74 c d 9 91 a 2 6 36 b 2 12 54 c 2 3 97 d 2 9 ni

stipulate positive influences on the adsorption of heavy metals whereas ab ac ad bc cd a2 c2 negatively affects the adsorption potentiality of the heavy metals 129 it is also worth noticing that variables a and d bear the highest coefficient with it which indicates the stupendous impact of io nps dosages and ph on the adsorption of heavy metals as per the data obtained from anova analysis of response surface quadratic model supplementary table iv the variables are showing statistical significance of p value prob f less than 0 05 which indicates that all the linear and quadratic effect of io nps concentration g l temperature c ph heavy metal concentration g l had a significant effect on the removal of heavy metals from the aqueous matrix figs 8 11 reveal the 3d contour plots of the inter parameters interaction guiding the exclusion of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii by io nps respectively the result shows a strong similarity between the predicted and experimental datasets the study reveals 1 g l concentration of io nps in experimental conditions 35 1 c temperature ph 6 and 9 66 mg l amount of metal ions was able to remove 98 0037 96 4502 92 1984 and 93 9913 of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii respectively the significant interactions among parameters like ph adsorbent dosages and temperature p 0 0001 in rsm platform are depicted below 4 8 1 effect in the variation of ph and io nps dose on the removal of heavy metals fig 8a 9a 10a and 11a indicate the relationship between variations of ph and io nps doses on the removal of heavy metals from the 3d contour plot it could be illustrated that the removal of heavy metals by io nps significantly increases with increasing ph and io nps p 0 0001 dose till ph 6 after which the steady decline in adsorption could be observed this phenomenon might have occurred due to the development of hydroxides of metals ions which precipitates in the solution and doesn t get adsorbed on the nanoparticles thus reducing the availability of free metal ions around the io nps 87 hence overall removal of the heavy metal decreases 4 8 2 effect in variation in ph and temperature on removal of heavy metals the exclusion of metal ions significantly rises with the increasing ph and the temperature of the system at 40 c till ph 6 figs 8b 9b 10b and 11b the rise in temperature causes the increases in total pore volume and porosity of the io nps this might raise the number of active docking sites on the io nps which overall increases the adsorption of heavy metals 99 100 104 but increasing the ph further from 6 results in precipitation of heavy metals due to its hydroxide formations thus available heavy metal concentration around the io nps decreases hence although at the higher temperature the porosity of the nanoparticles increases but due to non availability of heavy metals overall adsorption process decreases significantly p 0 0001 4 8 3 effect in variation in io nps and heavy metal concentration the removal metal ions for the interaction of io nps and initial heavy metal concentration indicated adsorption of metallic ions increases with increasing concentration of io nps figs 8c 9c 10c and 11c with the increase in io nps concentration overall active surface of the adsorbing material increases thus the incoming different concentration of heavy metal ions significantly p 0 0001 get adsorbed onto the nanoparticles 130 4 9 optimization of central composite design ccd by desirability factor df predicted vs actual plot normal plot box cox and studentised residual plot are important in diagnosing the suitability of mathematical model and to judge the residual normality low p value p 0 0001 from the f test indicated high significance for the second order equation in our study the relationship shown in predicted vs actual plot supplementary fig 1 elucidates a good correlation between predicted vs actual experimental data the presence of points near to the straight line in the normal plot supplementary fig 2 indicated the normal distribution of the errors having zero mean and a constant term this validates the adequacy of the model 131 the box cox plot supplementary fig 3 of power transformation showed current lambda values lies very close proximity to best lambda values which confirms that experimental data does not need any transformation in addition to these studentised residual plot supplementary fig 4 indicated the random distribution of the residual around 3 00 and demonstrate independently normal distribution pattern of the residues the analysis of all these plots proves the accuracy of the predicted and experimental data for the removal of each heavy metal ions the of deviation for the predicted and experimental data was found to be 0 31 0 31 0 80 0 21 for pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii removal respectively which showed precise and ccurate linear variations among the data 3 according to dettinger s desirability function the optimal experimental condition was 1 g l concentration of io nps 35 1 c temperature ph 6 and 9 66 mg l concentration of initial heavy metals under these experimental conditions 98 0037 96 4502 92 1984 and 93 9913 of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii were removed respectively by io nps 4 10 examination of ann modelling ann is an important simulation platform which inspired from neural networking arrangement of the human brain where different information is processed by a different set of neural network governed by a supreme functional deity 132 133 the topography of the ann network generally consists of three nodes input hidden and output nodes 133 in our study the input node consists of experimental variables like ph temp initial metallic ion concentration and nanosorbent dosages the hidden layer comprises poslin and purelin transfer functions which evaluate the interaction between input and output data the input data undergoes a training phase where the model process the data according to their weights and generates a suitable output after it got transformed using the transfer function 134 mean squared error mse was applied as a performance function which helped in determining the optimum number of hidden nodes necessary for proper evaluation of the model therefore 4 input layers 10 hidden layers and 1 output layer was selected for ann topological analysis validation of constructed ann model was assessed by testing the predicted value of the model with the experimental values the regressed graphical plot coined from the neural trained network bearing maximum r2 values was shown in supplementary file the r2 values for pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii were established to be 0 98992 0 99703 0 98641 0 98883 respectively supplementary fig 5 the higher value of r2 establishes the suitability of levenberg marquardt backpropagation trainlm adapted learning function bundled in purelin as well as poslin algorithmic transfer functions as the optimum interface for optimization of heavy metal adsorption on nanoparticles the comparative analysis for the predictive data of the rsm and ann establishes ann to be a better tool of optimization for the concerned process the rsm and ann provide a better platform for understanding the process of adsorption due to its applicability in a different set of significant experimental condition it helps in analysing multi interacting factors which provides an optimizing condition which could be replicated in industrial sectors for better utilization of nanoparticles in wastewater management 4 11 comparative analysis with the contemporary literature during adsorption variables involved in a reaction plays a crucial role in determining the effectivity of an adsorbent in this study few important optimum reaction parameters like temperature k ph adsorbent dose mg l initial concentration of metal ions mg l and contact time min were considered against which maximum adsorption capacity mg g was compared in table 4 for each adsorbent isotherm and kinetic models are also presented for enhancing our understanding regarding the nature of the reaction from previously reported studies 135 137 it could be observed that nanocomposite had better adsorbing capacity than our study when compared exclusively mycosynthesized io nps had shown better removal potentiality at a low dosage of adsorbent when compared with chemically synthesized magnetite nanoparticles 138 magnetite nanosphere 139 and nanostructured cedar leaf ash 51 and had shown similar response of removal capacity when compared with other nanomaterials 140 biosorbent 141 and bio nanosorbent 142 hence from this study it might be concluded that high availability of nano surface area makes mycosynthesized nanoparticle an effective efficient and sustainable nanosorbent which could be harnessed to purify hefty amount of heavy metal contaminant from wastewater 5 conclusions the present study focuses on the utilization of novel green technology for the fabrication of io nps from manglicolous fungi which was further applied for the removal pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii from the wastewater extracellular enzyme matrix of aspergillus tubingensis isolated from rhizospheric sediment samples of avicennia officinalis acted as a reductant for the aqueous solution of fe no3 3 which resulted in the synthesis of io nps mycosynthesized nanoparticles were monodispersed spherical crystalline in nature of size ranging between 73 05 15 47 nm elemental and xrd analysis had revelled the hematite fe2o3 crystalline nature of the nanoparticle which exhibited ferromagnetic characteristics in aqueous matrix nanoparticles had shown stability due to deposition of extracellular fungal bio molecules onto them initially one factor at a time approach was employed for batch study which had revelled that l of 90 of the heavy metals from aqueous interface were significantly p 0 0001 adsorbed on 1 g l concentration of io nps in 313 k temperature at ph 6 which was confirmed through two way anova analysis and tukey s multiple comparisons test the batch study results were further complimented using multiple factors at a time chemometric approach where rsm and ann were used for the sustainable optimization of the adsorption process and according to dettinger s desirability function the optimal experimental condition was 1 g l concentration of io nps 35 1 c 308 1 k temperature ph 6 and 9 66 mg l concentration of initial heavy metals under these conditions 98 0037 96 4502 92 1984 and 93 9913 of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii were significantly p 0 0001 removed by io nps respectively reusability studies have elucidated the multiple uses of io nps renders it as a sustainable eco friendly cost effective and benign material for effluent treatment io nps had shown high regeneration capability upto five adsorption desorption cycle further adsorptive dynamics involving thermodynamic and kinetic studies provided insight into the adsorption process the adsorption of heavy metal ions followed a monolayer settlement of the heavy metals onto the io nps which was governed by electrostatic attraction and formation of different ionic covalent non covalent and van der waal s forces the rate limiting step for the adsorption was found to surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion the reaction dynamics of the adsorption followed spontaneous chemisorptions of the heavy metals which progresses endothermically the adsorption process was guided by the langmuir isotherm module and pseudo second order kinetics the capacity of adsorption for pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii by nanoparticles was 9 206 mg g 9 666 mg g 8 335 mg g and 9 106 mg g respectively further study is necessary for understanding the detailed reaction mechanism and the applicability of io nps in real wastewater hence it might be concluded that mycosynthesis of io nps opens a novel avenue for the generation of green sustainable

13896,in our study novel mycosynthesis of ferromagnetic monodispersed spherical crystalline iron oxide nanoparticles io nps of 73 05 15 47 nm were biofabricated using manglicolous fungi aspergillus tubingensis stsp 25 isolated from rhizospheric sediment samples of avicennia officinalis which was sustainably utilised for the removal of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii from wastewater the elemental and xrd characterisation had shown fe2o3 hematite nature of the io nps which were aqua stable due to deposition of extracellular fungal bio molecules onto them initial batch adsorption studies revealed that at ph 6 in 313 k temp 1 g l of io nps could able to remove 90 of heavy metals from the aqueous matrix this was further confirmed through muti factor chemometric approach which involved rsm and ann module rsm and ann analysis inferred that 98 0037 of pb ii 96 4502 of ni ii 92 1984 of cu ii and 93 9913 of zn ii ions were adsorbed from 9 66 mg l of heavy metals on 1 g l concentration of io nps in 308 25 k temperature at ph 6 adsorptive dynamics indicated the process of adsorption was kinetically spontaneous and thermodynamically it followed endothermic reaction where metallic ions got chemisorbed on the monolayer interface of io nps the overall process followed the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics the adsorbing potentiality of io nps for pb ii ni ii cu ii

3 63 platinum 0 28 sulphur 0 27 chlorine and 11 9 iron signals of elemental platinum observed in fesem edx analysis is due to the use of platinum for coating the nanoparticles while the observed signals of carbon might be due to the use of carbon tape as a binder and presence of extracellular bioactive compounds on the synthesized nanoparticles however in tem edx analysis io nps composed of 26 92 oxygen 65 89 iron and 7 19 copper the signals of elemental copper as well as carbon had occurred due to utilization of copper grid which was coated with carbon and the presence of extracellular bioactive compounds the distinct peak for elemental oxygen confirms the oxide o2 nature of the nanoparticles however different peaks for metals and non metals like mn k cl and s were obtained during

hysteresis loop was observed for the temperature 20 k 300 k which showed the ferromagnetic nature of the io nps with saturation magnetization of ms 33 003 emu g at 300 k 83 84 these findings might suggest the ferromagnetism nature of the nanoparticles at room temperature which makes it an effective material which could be reluctantly separated from an aqueous matrix just by inducing a magnetic force it addition it could be observed that magnetic saturation ms coercivity hc decreases as the temperature increase from 20 k 300 k which revels the typical ferromagnetism in the io nps fig 5d shows mt measurement of zfc fc in presence of the magnetic force of 0 05 t it was evident that fc and zfc curves followed a similar trend and showed a sharp rise in the susceptibility till 30 k and thereafter it increases sharply it could be noted from the graph that both the curves are mostly separated for the whole range of temperature which infers that curie temperature of the sample exceeds 300 k 84 4 3 role of physical and chemical factors on the adsorption of metal ions 4 3 1 ph ph is one of the important chemical characteristics which governs the adsorption of heavy metals onto the io nps in an aqueous matrix the ph dependent heavy metals removal was observed for different adsorbent like amorphous iron oxyhydroxide 85 goethite 86 sodium tetraborate modified kaolinite clay 87 in our study ph 2 8 of the solution was varied for the batch adsorption of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii the heavy metal concentration of 10 mg l and io nps concentration of 1 g l was kept constant for all the experimental procedure results revealed from the ph studies indicated a gradual increase in the adsorption capacity in the io nps from ph 2 6 thereafter the adsorption capacity decreases gradually when ph increases to 8 this phenomenon might attribute to the fact that in an aqueous system external surface of the iron oxide fe2o3 nanoparticle always covered with feoh group 50 88 89 this hydroxyl group of iron protonates when ph phpzc giving rise to the surface charge feoh2 and deprotonates when ph phpzc giving rise to the surface charge feo 89 90 in our study the phpzc value for the io nps was found to be 3 48 at ph greater then phpzc fig 6 a the surface charge of the io nps was negative which favours the adsorption of cationic heavy metal ions 91 92 optimum ph for the maximum removal of heavy metal was found to be 6 for our study which is greater than 3 48 thus favouring the adsorption of positively charged pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii ions onto the negatively charged io nps at ph 2 fig 6b lowest amount of heavy metal was adsorbed which might be due to the protonation of the active site thus leading to the generation of feoh2 on the surface of the io nps which electrostatically repulse the cations 50 51 93 enhancing the ph from 2 increases the deprotonation of feoh group this phenomenon escalates the overall electrostatic attractive force between cationic heavy metals and io nps also the overall reduction in the repulsive force between cationic heavy metal ions and feoh2 52 increases the adsorption of the heavy metals as ph rises our study complements the findings of ebrahim et al 94 which indicated maximum adsorption of heavy metals could be observed at ph 6 two way anova and tukey s multiple comparisons validated our findings with p value less than 0 0001 the removal of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii were observed as 92 06 2 09 90 66 1 91 88 97 2 23 and 87 06 2 35 respectively at ph 6 however when ph of the solution was further increased to 8 there is a significant p 0 0001 decreases in the adsorption of heavy metals was observed this decrease in the adsorption capacity of the io nps might have occurred due to the development of pb oh 2 zn oh 2 cu oh 2 and ni oh 2 complex 95 96 hence removal of the heavy metals beyond ph 6 introduces uncertainty in the experiment due to the formation of metal hydroxides for this particular reason ph 6 was kept constant throughout the batch studies 4 3 2 adsorbent io nps concentration io nps charging concentration of 0 2 g l to 1 g l were studied for the exclusion of metal ions in the aqueous matrix a reaction set of 0 05 l of 10 mg l concentration of metal ions was maintained for each charging concentration of io nps for 120 min it was observed that the exclusion of heavy metallic ions significantly increases with successive increase in the concentration of io nps p 0 0001 two way anova and tukey s multiple comparisons test 97 49 1 00 of pb ii 96 32 1 64 of ni ii 92 12 1 56 of cu ii and 90 15 1 53 of zn ii was removed from the synthetic wastewater solution at 1 g l loading concentration of io nps fig 6d the exclusion of heavy metals was observed to be most proficient at the highest charging concentration suggesting that with increasing nanoparticle concentration active sites on the nanoparticles increases which might lead to effective adsorption of heavy metals 97 it was also observed that heavy metals were adsorbed rapidly till 90 min of the reaction time further increasing the till 120 min time didn t altered the removal each metal ions this incident might happen due to impregnation of active locus of io nps by the finite amount of applied heavy metals 98 further increasing the metal concentration might shift the equilibrium time of the reaction mixture 4 3 3 temperature the effectiveness of the nanoparticles for the sorption of metal ions greatly depends on temperature in our study the rate of adsorption for metal ions was studied from 293 to 313 k it was observed that the potentiality of the nanoparticles for the adsorption significantly increases with temperature p 0 0001 two way anova and tukey s multiple comparisons test the effective increase in the adsorption potentiality in the io nps from 87 12 0 39 92 06 0 97 for pb ii 76 07 0 76 96 66 1 41 for ni ii ions 60 07 0 19 83 35 0 89 for cu ii and 75 06 0 93 91 06 0 98 for zn ii was observed for the temperature range of 293 313 k fig 6c this phenomenon might have occurred due to increase in the diffusion rate for the metallic ions into the interior pores as well as on the exterior surface of the magnetic nanoparticles 99 100 as diffusion is an endothermic process thus adsorption increases with increasing temperature 100 another possible interpretation considers that pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii ions are well hydrated in an aqueous matrix normally this hydration shell prevents the adsorption process at a lower temperature 101 increasing the temperature provides endothermic energy which removes the hydration shell from the metal ions thus facilitating the process of adsorption 102 similar types of studies were reported by chen and wang 101 chang et al 103 and sheng et al 102 rise in temperature also enhances the total pore volume and porosity of the io nps which eventually increases the number of active attachment sites on nanoparticles 99 100 104 the above results were supported by the various thermodynamic analyses which shedes light on the detailed mechanism of adsorption at the higher temperature 4 4 effect of hno3 on desorption of heavy metal and the reusability study on io nps reusability of the nanoparticle validates the effectivity of the nanosorbent for the removal of heavy metals and in the previous section it was indicated that adsorption of heavy metals was found highly dependent on the ph of the solution hence lowering the ph would favours the desorption of heavy metals therefore in our study 1 10 mm of hno3 was used to desorbed heavy metals from the io nps experimental results from the desorption studies revealed that 10 mm solution of hno3 acts significantly p 0 0001 two way anova and tukey s multiple comparisons test in desorbing 98 97 0 81 for pb ii 96 65 1 00 for ni ii 90 12 0 89 for cu ii and 92 13 0 90 for zn ii fig 7 a ions from io nps it was noted that a gradual increase in the concentration of hno3 facilitates greater amount of desorption the possible mechanism for the desorption was proposed by zhou and haynes 105 and lata et al 106 according to which the process follows three steps i low ph favours desorption of metal cations as adsorption of metal ions and precipitation of metal hydroxides occurs at higher ph ii strong competition between metal and h ions at lower ph displaces the metallic ion in the desorbing solution which iii lowers the adsorption capacity of the io nps hence the result suggests that adsorption of heavy metals onto io nps is reversible and the bonding between the nanosorbent and the metal ion was weak the finding also suggests that a very low amount of acid is suitable for the desorption which increases its potentiality for the recovery of heavy metals from wastewater further increasing the ph might have results into the accumulation of h ions in the solution which increases the electrostatic repulsion between h and cationic heavy metal ions thus inhibiting heavy meal desorption 107 108 it was also observed that during the change in ph no residual fe was detected by icp oes which indicates that dissolution of iron oxide nanoparticles was not an issue for the desorption of heavy metals five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles fig 7b were performed for a better understanding of reusability potentiality of the adsorbent it was evident from fig 7b that after 3rd cycle there is a considerable decline in the efficiency of the io nps p 0 0001 two way anova and tukey s multiple comparisons test therefore it might be hypothesized that green nanoparticles possibly be considered as an efficient sustainable and eco friendly adsorbent for heavy metals 4 5 adsorption isothermic study four adsorption isotherm process which includes i langmuir isotherm ii temkin isotherm iii freundlich isotherm and iv d r isotherm model was considered for evaluating the adsorption process table 1 each model shaded light onto the mechanistic insight of the adsorption process in 293 313 k temperature the correlation coefficient and model constants are produced in table 1 the langmuir model of isotherm predicts the utmost monolayer adsorption capability for the nanoparticles and also determines the favourability of the model 109 the r2 was was found to be in a range between 0 948 0 979 for pb ii 0 907 0 946 for ni ii 0 758 0 843 for cu ii and 0 922 0 975 for zn ii p 0 05 determined from ce heavy metals qe vs ce heavy metals plot the trend of r2 towards unity indicated the monolayer sorption of metal ions onto the limited active adsorption site of the io nps the dimensionless separating factor rl was evaluated from eq 6 110 7 r l 1 1 b l a n g m u i r c 0 the c0 is the preliminary concentration for the metal ions the rl for the experimental data was found to be in a range between 0 01 0 10 for pb ii 0 05 0 13 for ni ii 0 18 0 31 for cu ii and 0 05 0 18 for zn ii at 293 313 k indicating the process of adsorption was favourable for adsorption 111 freundlich isotherm constant n f freundlich was evaluated from the inclination of ln qe vs ln ce heavy metals regressed plot and was found to be greater than 1 for all the metal ions in all ranges of temperature our study complements the findings of taha et al 112 boparai et al 56 and saha et al 113 which indicate the higher affinity among io nps and heavy metal particles which highly favours the chemisorptions of metallic ions onto the facade of the nanoparticles in this study both the constants of the temkin isotherm model i e kt temkin and bt temkin was evaluated from the intercept and inclination of qe and ln ce heavy metals graph the model constant kt temkin at 293 303 and 313 k was found to be 3 292 3 900 and 4 660 for pb ii 2 688 2 982 and 4 718 for ni ii 2 406 2 519 and 2 798 for cu ii 4 416 3 205 and 3 847 l mg for zn ii respectively table 1 the evaluated values of kt temkin indicate considerable interaction between heavy metals and nanoparticles 114 while temkin constant bt temkin was found to be 3 025 2 412 and 1 943 for pb ii 4 385 3 574 and 1 798 for ni ii 6 158 5 184 and 3 923 for cu ii 2 689 3 185 and 2 427 for zn ii at 293 k 303 k and 313 k respectively indicating minor fluctuation in the heating energy of adsorption at different temperature 114 the high correlation coefficient r2 of 0 944 for pb ii 0 860 for ni ii 0 941 for cu ii 0 929 for zn ii p 0 05 indicated the chemisorption nature of the adsorption process 56 115 the d r isotherm constant factor qs d r estimated from the linearized model of ln qe vs ε2 plot and was not found consistent with the langmuir constant qe the correlation coefficient for d r model was established to be 0 624 for pb ii 0 415 for ni ii 0 501 for cu ii 0 573 for zn p 0 05 which shows its value to be minimum in comparison to other thermodynamic models hence from the comparative isotherm results it could be asserted that the adsorption of metallic ions on io nps is chemically driven process rather than the physical process 56 finally it could be concluded that the adsorption involves attachment of metal ions onto the monolayer surface of the nanoparticles bearing finite adsorptive active sites 4 6 adsorption kinetic study a comparative kinetic study was considered for four kinetic models like i pseudo 1st order kinetic model ii pseudo 2nd order kinetic model iii intraparticle diffusion kinetic model and iv elovich kinetic model between 293 313 k temperature the equilibrium of the reaction was achieved at 120 min the adsorption capacity of the io nps does not change significantly beyond the equilibrium time the r2 and the values of the kinetic constant for each model are depicted in table 2 from the comparative analysis it could be observed that the adsorption follows a pseudo 2nd order kinetics r2 value for the pseudo 2nd order kinetic model was in between 0 991 0 995 for pb ii 0 991 0 995 for ni ii 0 993 0 998 for cu ii and 0 981 0 992 for zn ii at 293 313 k p 0 05 the highest correlation coefficients value in comparison to other models indicated strong electrostatic interactions between heavy metals and mycosynthesized nanoparticles 109 the capacity of the io nps during saturation of the reaction from the pseudo 2nd order kinetics was determined to be 10 309 mg g for pb ii 12 19 mg g for ni ii 13 699 mg g for cu ii and 10 753 for zn ii respectively the regression graph between t qt vs t has shown excellent accordance between predicted and investigational values of adsorption capacity the activation energy ea was determined from the rate constant form k2 psudo 2nd pseudo 2nd order kinetics it could be observed that ea for adsorption of metal ions was greater than or equal to 21 kj mol which might recommend the chemical nature for the sorption of metal ions on nanoparticles 116 a kinetic study for adsorption provides insight regarding the mechanism behind the adsorption of heavy metals onto io nps it also helps in understanding the rate limiting step for the adsorption as per chingombe et al 117 adsorption follows three steps i surface diffusion of the adsorbate in a solution towards the exterior surface of the adsorbent ii intraparticle diffusion where adsorbate molecules diffuse towards the interior portion of the adsorbent iii adsorption of the adsorbate in the interior active site of the nanosorbent since adsorption occurs very rapidly it could be assumed that the process does not affect the total kinetics of the system 56 overall the rate of the reaction might also be controlled by surface or intraparticle diffusion the weber morris interparticle diffusion model is considered for the determination of rate limiting step of the adsorption process 118 119 intraparticle diffusion coefficients k diff idk and constant c idc was determined from qt vs t1 2 plot for all the metal ions at different temperature the k diff idk was found to be increasing gradually for each temperature which indicated the rise in the adsorbent capacity for the io nps 120 in this present work the linearized plot for the intraparticle diffusion did not pass through the origin which indicated that intraparticle diffusion of heavy metals into the io nps was not the rate limiting step for present adsorption study 56 60 61 this finding might suggest surface adsorption and interparticle diffusion might play conjugatively for the adsorption of heavy metals on nanoparticles 121 the value for the intercept c idk was found to be increasing with temperature increases the random motion of the heavy metals which eventually enhances their surface diffusion onto the io nps 122 our study complements the results reported by taqvi et al 118 wu et al 119 boparai et al 56 and lasheen et al 123 4 7 process thermodynamics thermodynamic parameter provides an extensive interpretation regarding the process of adsorption at different temperature 213 313 k which has been arranged in table 3 it was found that δg value was ranged between 4 643 to 6 376 kj mol for pb ii 1 500 to 5 626 kj mol for ni ii 0 994 to 4 191 kj mol for cu ii and 2 684 to 6 039 kj mol for zn ii at the temperature range of 213 313 k δg 0 indicated spontaneity of the adsorption process it was also observed that δg value was decreasing with temperature which indicated the favourability of the adsorption process at the higher temperature 28 65 109 the enthalpy δh value for the pb ii ni ii cu ii zn ii was found to be 20 668 kj mol 58 588 kj mol 68 698 kj mol 46 417kj mol respectively the positive value for the δh states the presence of strong chemical bond between heavy metal ions and io nps and indicated endothermic nature of the reaction 27 56 124 the entropy δs was found to be 86 133 j k mol 203 943 j k mol 248 256 j k mol 167 360 j k mol for pb ii ni ii cu ii zn ii respectively the positive and high value of δs indicates that the metals ions are spontaneously adsorbed on the solid exterior interface of the nanoparticles 17 18 125 hence from the thermodynamic study it might be concluded that the cations are strongly spontaneously and endothermically adsorbed onto the io nps and the reactions favour high temperature these findings were found to be consistent with the study observed in adsorption isotherm and kinetic study 4 8 analysis of central composite design ccd the results from the batch adsorption study were considered for the ccd design in rsm interface which is produced supplementary table ii as removal percentage of metallic ions by io nps the f value for the quadratic model generated in the ccd platform to remove metal ions i e pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii was 3003 93 6185 19 1084 18 and 10219 76 respectively supplementary table iv the high f value suggested that the hypothesized quadratic polynomial model was very much significantly adequate p 0 0001 and each expression for the quadratic polynomial derivative factors showed significance bearing the confidence level of 95 the values for the lack of fit in the analysed data was found to be 0 01 which depicts that the generated model was appropriate for the experimental data supplementary table v the derivative coefficient of regression r2 0 9998 0 9999 0 9993 and 0 9999 adjusted r2 0 9995 0 9998 0 9987 0 9999 and predicted r2 0 9979 0 9989 0 9926 and 0 9994 at significance level p 0 05 was found for pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii adsorption suggesting suitability of the quadratic polynomial module for prediction of adsorption process among cubic linear and two factor interaction modules supplementary table vi r2 value closer to unity validates the accuracy of the model the convenient agreement between predicted and adjusted r2 also signifies the compatibility of the model with the experimental data and there are 0 01 chance that model f value occurs due to noise 126 127 the adequate adeq precision for the adsorption process was found to be 261 330 374 514 158 888 and 487 444 for pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii respectively which was far too higher than 4 which indicates the adequacy of the model 128 the coefficient of variation value less than 1 20 indicates the precision of the model the model follows the following quadratic equations eq 7 8 9 and 10 which consist of 15 coefficients 8 pb removal 85 94 13 11 a 6 84 b 13 74 c 2 48 d 2 08 a b 6 47 a c 0 84 a d 0 91 b c 0 36 b d 1 74 c d 9 91 a 2 6 36 b 2 12 54 c 2 3 97 d 2 9 ni

stipulate positive influences on the adsorption of heavy metals whereas ab ac ad bc cd a2 c2 negatively affects the adsorption potentiality of the heavy metals 129 it is also worth noticing that variables a and d bear the highest coefficient with it which indicates the stupendous impact of io nps dosages and ph on the adsorption of heavy metals as per the data obtained from anova analysis of response surface quadratic model supplementary table iv the variables are showing statistical significance of p value prob f less than 0 05 which indicates that all the linear and quadratic effect of io nps concentration g l temperature c ph heavy metal concentration g l had a significant effect on the removal of heavy metals from the aqueous matrix figs 8 11 reveal the 3d contour plots of the inter parameters interaction guiding the exclusion of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii by io nps respectively the result shows a strong similarity between the predicted and experimental datasets the study reveals 1 g l concentration of io nps in experimental conditions 35 1 c temperature ph 6 and 9 66 mg l amount of metal ions was able to remove 98 0037 96 4502 92 1984 and 93 9913 of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii respectively the significant interactions among parameters like ph adsorbent dosages and temperature p 0 0001 in rsm platform are depicted below 4 8 1 effect in the variation of ph and io nps dose on the removal of heavy metals fig 8a 9a 10a and 11a indicate the relationship between variations of ph and io nps doses on the removal of heavy metals from the 3d contour plot it could be illustrated that the removal of heavy metals by io nps significantly increases with increasing ph and io nps p 0 0001 dose till ph 6 after which the steady decline in adsorption could be observed this phenomenon might have occurred due to the development of hydroxides of metals ions which precipitates in the solution and doesn t get adsorbed on the nanoparticles thus reducing the availability of free metal ions around the io nps 87 hence overall removal of the heavy metal decreases 4 8 2 effect in variation in ph and temperature on removal of heavy metals the exclusion of metal ions significantly rises with the increasing ph and the temperature of the system at 40 c till ph 6 figs 8b 9b 10b and 11b the rise in temperature causes the increases in total pore volume and porosity of the io nps this might raise the number of active docking sites on the io nps which overall increases the adsorption of heavy metals 99 100 104 but increasing the ph further from 6 results in precipitation of heavy metals due to its hydroxide formations thus available heavy metal concentration around the io nps decreases hence although at the higher temperature the porosity of the nanoparticles increases but due to non availability of heavy metals overall adsorption process decreases significantly p 0 0001 4 8 3 effect in variation in io nps and heavy metal concentration the removal metal ions for the interaction of io nps and initial heavy metal concentration indicated adsorption of metallic ions increases with increasing concentration of io nps figs 8c 9c 10c and 11c with the increase in io nps concentration overall active surface of the adsorbing material increases thus the incoming different concentration of heavy metal ions significantly p 0 0001 get adsorbed onto the nanoparticles 130 4 9 optimization of central composite design ccd by desirability factor df predicted vs actual plot normal plot box cox and studentised residual plot are important in diagnosing the suitability of mathematical model and to judge the residual normality low p value p 0 0001 from the f test indicated high significance for the second order equation in our study the relationship shown in predicted vs actual plot supplementary fig 1 elucidates a good correlation between predicted vs actual experimental data the presence of points near to the straight line in the normal plot supplementary fig 2 indicated the normal distribution of the errors having zero mean and a constant term this validates the adequacy of the model 131 the box cox plot supplementary fig 3 of power transformation showed current lambda values lies very close proximity to best lambda values which confirms that experimental data does not need any transformation in addition to these studentised residual plot supplementary fig 4 indicated the random distribution of the residual around 3 00 and demonstrate independently normal distribution pattern of the residues the analysis of all these plots proves the accuracy of the predicted and experimental data for the removal of each heavy metal ions the of deviation for the predicted and experimental data was found to be 0 31 0 31 0 80 0 21 for pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii removal respectively which showed precise and ccurate linear variations among the data 3 according to dettinger s desirability function the optimal experimental condition was 1 g l concentration of io nps 35 1 c temperature ph 6 and 9 66 mg l concentration of initial heavy metals under these experimental conditions 98 0037 96 4502 92 1984 and 93 9913 of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii were removed respectively by io nps 4 10 examination of ann modelling ann is an important simulation platform which inspired from neural networking arrangement of the human brain where different information is processed by a different set of neural network governed by a supreme functional deity 132 133 the topography of the ann network generally consists of three nodes input hidden and output nodes 133 in our study the input node consists of experimental variables like ph temp initial metallic ion concentration and nanosorbent dosages the hidden layer comprises poslin and purelin transfer functions which evaluate the interaction between input and output data the input data undergoes a training phase where the model process the data according to their weights and generates a suitable output after it got transformed using the transfer function 134 mean squared error mse was applied as a performance function which helped in determining the optimum number of hidden nodes necessary for proper evaluation of the model therefore 4 input layers 10 hidden layers and 1 output layer was selected for ann topological analysis validation of constructed ann model was assessed by testing the predicted value of the model with the experimental values the regressed graphical plot coined from the neural trained network bearing maximum r2 values was shown in supplementary file the r2 values for pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii were established to be 0 98992 0 99703 0 98641 0 98883 respectively supplementary fig 5 the higher value of r2 establishes the suitability of levenberg marquardt backpropagation trainlm adapted learning function bundled in purelin as well as poslin algorithmic transfer functions as the optimum interface for optimization of heavy metal adsorption on nanoparticles the comparative analysis for the predictive data of the rsm and ann establishes ann to be a better tool of optimization for the concerned process the rsm and ann provide a better platform for understanding the process of adsorption due to its applicability in a different set of significant experimental condition it helps in analysing multi interacting factors which provides an optimizing condition which could be replicated in industrial sectors for better utilization of nanoparticles in wastewater management 4 11 comparative analysis with the contemporary literature during adsorption variables involved in a reaction plays a crucial role in determining the effectivity of an adsorbent in this study few important optimum reaction parameters like temperature k ph adsorbent dose mg l initial concentration of metal ions mg l and contact time min were considered against which maximum adsorption capacity mg g was compared in table 4 for each adsorbent isotherm and kinetic models are also presented for enhancing our understanding regarding the nature of the reaction from previously reported studies 135 137 it could be observed that nanocomposite had better adsorbing capacity than our study when compared exclusively mycosynthesized io nps had shown better removal potentiality at a low dosage of adsorbent when compared with chemically synthesized magnetite nanoparticles 138 magnetite nanosphere 139 and nanostructured cedar leaf ash 51 and had shown similar response of removal capacity when compared with other nanomaterials 140 biosorbent 141 and bio nanosorbent 142 hence from this study it might be concluded that high availability of nano surface area makes mycosynthesized nanoparticle an effective efficient and sustainable nanosorbent which could be harnessed to purify hefty amount of heavy metal contaminant from wastewater 5 conclusions the present study focuses on the utilization of novel green technology for the fabrication of io nps from manglicolous fungi which was further applied for the removal pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii from the wastewater extracellular enzyme matrix of aspergillus tubingensis isolated from rhizospheric sediment samples of avicennia officinalis acted as a reductant for the aqueous solution of fe no3 3 which resulted in the synthesis of io nps mycosynthesized nanoparticles were monodispersed spherical crystalline in nature of size ranging between 73 05 15 47 nm elemental and xrd analysis had revelled the hematite fe2o3 crystalline nature of the nanoparticle which exhibited ferromagnetic characteristics in aqueous matrix nanoparticles had shown stability due to deposition of extracellular fungal bio molecules onto them initially one factor at a time approach was employed for batch study which had revelled that l of 90 of the heavy metals from aqueous interface were significantly p 0 0001 adsorbed on 1 g l concentration of io nps in 313 k temperature at ph 6 which was confirmed through two way anova analysis and tukey s multiple comparisons test the batch study results were further complimented using multiple factors at a time chemometric approach where rsm and ann were used for the sustainable optimization of the adsorption process and according to dettinger s desirability function the optimal experimental condition was 1 g l concentration of io nps 35 1 c 308 1 k temperature ph 6 and 9 66 mg l concentration of initial heavy metals under these conditions 98 0037 96 4502 92 1984 and 93 9913 of pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii were significantly p 0 0001 removed by io nps respectively reusability studies have elucidated the multiple uses of io nps renders it as a sustainable eco friendly cost effective and benign material for effluent treatment io nps had shown high regeneration capability upto five adsorption desorption cycle further adsorptive dynamics involving thermodynamic and kinetic studies provided insight into the adsorption process the adsorption of heavy metal ions followed a monolayer settlement of the heavy metals onto the io nps which was governed by electrostatic attraction and formation of different ionic covalent non covalent and van der waal s forces the rate limiting step for the adsorption was found to surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion the reaction dynamics of the adsorption followed spontaneous chemisorptions of the heavy metals which progresses endothermically the adsorption process was guided by the langmuir isotherm module and pseudo second order kinetics the capacity of adsorption for pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii by nanoparticles was 9 206 mg g 9 666 mg g 8 335 mg g and 9 106 mg g respectively further study is necessary for understanding the detailed reaction mechanism and the applicability of io nps in real wastewater hence it might be concluded that mycosynthesis of io nps opens a novel avenue for the generation of green sustainable

energy dispersive x ray microanalysis edx porosity and swelling were performed for the prepared membranes the morphological investigation showed well dispersion of the algal micro particles and the high pore density of the mixed membrane compared to the blank one ca only the effect of different parameters that affecting the adsorption process as sargassum dentifolium embedding ratio ph contact time and metal ions concentrations were optimized in order to get the highest removal efficiencies followed by full factorial design experiment the adsorption results showed the maximum removal efficiencies of the ca s membrane for 100 mg l 1 of both cd2 and zn2 were 95 9 and 82 79 with dose 1 5 g l 1 and 2 g l 1 respectively the adsorption isotherm kinetics and regeneration studies were displayed in order to determine the nature of the reaction and re usability of the membrane the adsorption process was related to freundlich isotherm that describes the multilayer and heterogeneous adsorption of molecules to the adsorbent surface and the pseudo first order kinetic was the most represent kinetic model for the adsorption process factorial experiments displayed that time ph and interaction between time and ph were the most significant factors in the adsorption process this study proposed a new generation of adsorptive mixed matrix membranes based on the cellulose acetate and the algal micro particles keywords sargassum dentifolium cellulose acetate mixed matrix membrane ecofriendly adsorption heavy metals removal 1 introduction recently the level of heavy metals in aquatic systems is an important indicator of the health of the aquatic system s ecological environment due to their toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation 1 cadmium cd and zinc zn are widely present in the environment they are highly ecotoxic and can migrate from irrigation water to food crops and can accumulate in soil and human body an accumulation of cd and zn into human body can cause health problems as induce kidney bone damages and chronic toxicities 2 the main pathways for cd and zn entering the environment are through mining metallurgical activities and disposal of wastewater therefore heavy metals removal became an important issues for the economic side and the public health protection especially with sustainable economically and environmentally safe process 3 the fundamental treatment strategies that utilized for heavy metals discharging were chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane filtration electrolytic methods and reverse osmosis 4 10 however different limitations for such methods were related to high cost generating sludge and limited at low concentrations as a result searching for new applicable techniques such as adsorptive membranes became a great interest different materials such as cellulose derivatives biopolymers raw agricultural wastes biological biomasses and synthetic polymer sources were used as adsorbent biosorbent agents 11 13 algae as a type of biological biomasses was used as biosorbent materials in both living and non living forms 14 15 they were distinguished as eco friendly biomasses with low cost for the removal of pollutants from waste water 16 21 moreover increasing the active surface area of these biosorbent materials is playing an important role in the adsorption proficiency and applicability appling these algal biomass on a large scale may have a problematic issue due to the cost of harvesting these particles after the removal process 12 also decrease the adsorption capacity due to their agglomeration and their van der waals interactions so easy processing of the adsorption process in 3rs removal recovery and reuse and more efficient adsorbent were expected from the mixed matrix membrane in order to counter such constraints impregnating nano or micro adsorbents into porous host materials like polymeric membrane is a promising solution 22 polymer is another appropriate material that can be used in adsorption and removal process in this respect polymer can be easily shaped in different forms as beads fibers and flat membranes with controlled morphology and porosity 23 for applying the polymers in the adsorption process they should be firstly functionalized chemically via grafting and chemical oxidation or physically via combination of functional ingredients as well designed nanoparticles inorganic metal organic framework organic and microbial reactive materials 24 28 cellulose acetate ca is a natural polymer like a carbohydrate polymers consisted of repeating units called polysaccharides ca is a safe material it has good chemical and thermal stability however ca membrane is limited for low ph and high temperature can destroy the ca structure so the ca membrane performance can be enhanced by embeding with other polymers nanoparticles or porous materials 29 so combination between the polymer substances and microparticles algal biomass in the form of membrane is a promising idea for enhancing the removal process in consequence in this study non living algal biomass sargassum dentifolium was used in micro size as an adsorbent materials within the cellulose acetate polymer ca forming the ca s mixed matrix membrane the ca s membrane was used for cd 2 and zn 2 ions removal some preliminary experiments followed by full factorial design experiment were used in order to optimize the removal process via optimizing the parameters ph time embedded algae percent and metal ions conc some characterization analysis viz ft ir sem edx porosity and swelling were displayed kinetics and isotherms were analyzed to explain the nature of the reaction regeneration and re usability studies were performed in order to examine the performance of the membrane for multiple uses for the cd 2 and zn 2 ions removal process 2 experimental 2 1 materials cellulose acetate 40 acetyl content as a polymer matrix and polyethylene glycol peg mwt 600 were purchased from aldrich zinc acetate and cadmium nitrate were obtained from merck furthermore all the chemicals acetone ethanol hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide and sodium chloride were supplied from el nasr company egypt additionally marine macro algae sargassum dentifolium was collected from ras gharb red sea egypt washed dried and grinded to micro size in order to increase their surface area 2 2 preparation of mixed matrix membrane mixed matrix membranes of cellulose acetate sargassum dentifolium ca s were constructed via the phase separation technique 30 the polymer was firstly dissolved in acetone solvent keeping the solid content at 20 wt peg 5 was added to the ca solution as pore former due to peg is hydrophilic and water soluble material which during coagulation process it leached out onto the water leaving pores on the membrane matrix and resulted in increase the porosity of the membrane and hence increase the surface area required for adsorption process 31 the grinded macro algae were added to the ca solution with various ratios 5 10 and 20 the polymeric matrix was sonicated for 1 h to obtain a good dispersion the obtained polymer solution was casted on a glass plate using a casting knife with thickness of 250 μm the glass plate with the casted solution was then immersed in water for occurring instantaneous phase inversion between solvent and water in the coagulation bath 32 two forms of the membranes were obtained cellulose acetate ca b as a blank and cellulose acetate sargassum dentifolium ca s 2 3 membrane characterization 2 3 1 attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir the functional groups of the cab and cas membranes were determined via attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared art ftir shimadzu 8400 japan spectrophotometer in range of 400 and 4000 cm 1 2 3 2 scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray microanalysis edx the morphology of the membranes surface and the cross sections were examined using high resolution scanning electron microscope sem quanta feg 250 esem connected to energy dispersive x ray microanalysis edx before investigation the dried membranes were sputtered coated with gold by s150a sputter coater edwards 2 3 3 swelling characteristics the membranes swelling test were performed by immersion the three pieces of each membrane 5 5 cm2 in distilled water for overnight at room temperature after that the membranes wet weights were measured then dried in an oven at 60 c till their weights become constant 33 the swelling behavior w s was assessed using the following equation 1 w s w w e t w d r y w d r y where wwet and wdry are the weights of wet and dried membranes respectively 2 3 4 porosity measurements the porosity of the ca and the ca s

the water density 0 998 g cm3 a in cm2 is the membranes area and h is the membranes thickness cm 2 4 preparation of cd2 and zn2 metal ions solutions stock solutions of 1000 mg l 1 of the standardized cd2 and zn2 ions solutions were prepared by dissolving the cd2 and zn2 salts in double distilled water the stock solutions were diluted to the required experimental concentration in a batch adsorption experiment 2 5 adsorption and optimization studies batch adsorption experiments were carried out by add of the prepared membranes in cd2 and zn2 ions at the experimental conditions of 120 min in 100 ml solution containing 100 mg l 1 ions concentrations using a horizontal bench shaker orbitek teqip act eq 454 at 200 rpm a constant time interval was taken and analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer aas perkin elmer analyst 100 at 228 8 nm and 213 9 nm for cd2 and zn2 respectively 36 37 to determine the metal ions concentrations the removal efficiencies of cd2 and zn2 metal ions by were calculated as follows 3 r e m o v a l e f f e c i e n c y c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 and ce are initial and equilibrium final concentrations mgl 1 of the metal solutions respectively in order to study the effect of the embedded algal s ratios on the membrane efficiency through the cd 2 and zn 2 metal ions sorption process screening experiment was implemented for the prepared membranes the experiments were performed at room temp ph 5 5 100 mg l 1 metal ions concentration by using different doses of both membranes 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 g l 1 for cd2 and zn2 metal ions after that some experiment for the following variables embedded sargassum dentifolium percent ph contact time and heavy metals concentration were studied all the previous experiments were performed for both cd2 and zn2 metal ions those preliminary experiments were implemented in order to easy determine the levels of the full factorial design experiment one replicate 23 full factorial design experiment 8 runs for both cd2 and zn2 removal was displayed and the used levels design matrix were recorded in table s 1a b and table s 2a b respectively the results were assessed using minitab 18 and main effects interaction effects pareto chart normal probability plot response optimizer contour and surface plot were interpreted 2 6 adsorption isotherms four types of isotherms langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r were used through this study in order to determine the relationship between the metals sorption capacity and the metals concentration 38 39 the isotherms were applied for both the ca b and the ca s membrane embedded with 20 sargassum dentifolium to demonstrate the surface properties and the affinity of the biosorbent materials furthermore the isotherm s data is used to compare the biosorption capacities for both the ca b and the ca s membranes the isotherm models were represented by the following linearized equations 2 6 1 langmuir isotherm 4 ce qe ce qmax 1 bqmax where qe q e is the amount of heavy metals sorbed per unit mass onto the prepared membarnes at equilibrium mgg 1 qmax is maximum adsorption capacity at complete monolayer coverage mgg 1 b is the langmuir constant mgl 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration of heavy metals in the solution mgl 1 2 6 2 freundlich isotherm 5 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mgg 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration of heavy metals in the solution mgl 1 k f and n represents are the freundlich constants which expressed the adsorption limit and adsorption density respectively 2 6 3 temkin isotherm the temkin isotherm 40 was estimated by the next equations 6 q e r t b t l n a t r t b t l n c e 7 q e b l n a t b l n c e 8 b r t b t where q e is the quantity of adsorbed metals at equilibrium r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature at 298 k b t mgl 1 is the isotherm temkin constant and a t lg 1 is constant at equilibrium binding 2 6 4 dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm 41 was frequently performed to explain the adsorption mechanism and to evaluate the porosity properties of the adsorbent the direct equation of d r isotherm is calculated by eq 9 9 l n q e l n q e k a d s ε 2 where qe mgg 1 is the hypotheticalv saturation limit kads is the dubinin radushkevich constant that identified with the mean free energy of adsorption per mole of adsorbate jmol 1 and ε is the polanyi potential identified with equilibrium and determined by eq 10 10 ε r t l n 1 1 c e 2 7 kinetics data analysis the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were applied to evaluate the adsorption kinetics of cd2 zn2 for pseudo first order model the straight type of the lagergren s pseudo first order equation was calculated as follows 11 l n q e q t l n q e k 1 t where q t and q e are the measure of metal ions adsorbed at time t and equilibrium mol g 1 respectively k1 min 1 is the rate constant for this model that was determined from the slope of the direct plot of l n q e q t versus t 42 43 the rate of pseudo second order model is depending on the quantity of pollutants on the surface of the sorbent and their amount sorbed at an equilibrium rendering to the ho the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e is relative to components such as temperature initial concentration and the trend of solute sorbent interactions the linear equation for the ho model can be expressed as follows 12 t q t t q e 1 k 2 q e 2 where k2 is the rate constant of sorption for this model g mol 1 min 1 q e and q t are the quantities of adsorbed metal ions at equilibrium and at time t mol g 1 respectively 2 8 regeneration studies the regeneration studies for the mixed matrix membranes were carried out using 0 1 n hcl after the adsorption of cd 2 and zn 2 metal ions on the ca s membrane the membrane was separated and soaked in 0 1 n hcl for 1 h followed by washing several times with distilled water till the ph reach neutrality the adsorption and regeneration process were repeated 5 cycles and the regeneration percentage was calculated 3 results and discussions 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir it was noticed from fig 1 that cab membrane showed strong peaks at 3323 which attributed to oh stretching group furthermore the peak at 2885 cm 1 related to ch2 stretching 1363 and 1414 cm 1 corresponding to ch2 bending and the peak at 1640 cm 1 attributed to cc vibration peak at 1744 cm 1 related to carbonyl co stretching of acetyl group of the acetates and that at 1012 cm 1 related to co stretching for cas membrane the peak that was observed at 2920 cm 1 related to ch3 asymmetric stretching and this peak was overlapped with ch2 stretching at 2885 cm 1 the peak of carbonyl band was shifted to 1735 cm 1 and co shifted to 1008 cm 1 and oh to 3320 cm 1 which may be indicate the formation of hydrogen bonding between the polymer and algal biomass meanwhile the brown algae sargassum micro particle demonstrated the characteristic absorption at 820 cm 1 which is a region of particular importance indicating the presence of the sulfated polysaccharide 44 3 1 2 scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray microanalysis edx fig 2 displayed the morphology of membrane surfaces and cross sections of the blank ca and the ca s 20 membranes the ca b membrane surface stated smooth structure with relatively no pores and the ca s 20 membrane surface had a lot of pores that distributed along the membrane surface with a uniform distribution of the micro algae particles in the polymer matrix fig 2a and b the cross section of the ca and ca s 20 membranes were shown in fig 2c and d the ca b membrane represented a smooth texture with like sponge structure and the macro voids shape were absent furthermore the cross section of the ca s 20 at high magnification showed porous sub layer with presence of highly macro void structure and the dense top layer nearly disappeared compared to the ca b membrane because higher embedding ratio of hydrophilic sargassum dentifolium micro particles that led to higher water diffusion rate during coagulation in the water bath then the exchange has occurred between solvent and water so the membranes with thin surface layer large pores and macrovoids in support layer were obtained 32 also the highest porosity of the ca s membranes compared with the ca b that owed to the micro particle size distribution of brown algae sargassum as observed in fig 3 a the edx result demonstrated that the chemical composition of the ca s membranes before and after metals biosorption were completely different and the presence of signals cd2 and zn2 zones in ca s membrane after adsorption confirm the obvious biosorption of cd2 and zn2 biosorption as shown in fig 3b 3 1 3 swelling and porosity behavior of the membranes table s 3 displayed the swelling and the porosity of the ca b and ca s membrane with different ratios of the algal micro particles the swelling was largely increased by increasing the sargassum dentifolium content within the membrane matrix the swelling was increased from 89 of the ca blank to 155 of the ca s membrane that contain 20 algal micro particles also the porosity of the membranes showed an enhancement by increasing the algal particles compared to the ca b these results owed to the hydrophilic surface uniform desperation for algal content and the macro void formation through the ca s membrane the increase of the membrane porosity resulted from the enlargement of wet membrane hydrophilicity with higher algal content which cause instantaneous phase demixing between solvent acetone and non solvent water during membrane fabrication 45 which in turn increase the pores and voids within the membrane matrix 3 2 adsorption experiments 3 2 1 screening experiment the primary experiment was achieved in order to differentiate between the cab and the cas mixed matrix membranes with algal biomass 5 10 20 for cd2 and zn2 ions the experiment showed that the most efficient membrane was the ca s 20 membrane several studies on biosorption of sargassum were performed and revealed their proficiency to the chemical components which comprise carbohydrate protein lipids and phenolic compounds 46 these components contain several reactive functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl amino and sulfonyl groups which responsible for the adsorption process 47 these former studies demonstrated the enhancement in heavy metals adsorption by the incorporation of this algal biomass into the polymer matrix so this membrane was selected for the next optimization experiments as a most potent membrane to estimate the optimum solid to liquid ratio adsorbent to metal volume different doses of the membrane were studied and the removal efficiencies for cd 2 and zn2 metal ions was plotted in fig 4 by increasing adsorbent weight of the ca s mixed matrix membrane from 0 5 to 2 g l 1 for cd2 and 0 5 to 2 5 g l 1 for zn2 the removal efficiency raised and reached around 96 and 83 for cd2 and zn2 respectively whereas the cd 2 and zn2 metal ions removal efficiencies in the state of the cab membrane were nearly 45 and 35 for both cd 2 and zn2 respectively this result attributed to increase the active sites and the functional groups that further chelate the metal ions from the polluted water meanwhile over weight dose of the cas membrane at 2 g l 1 and 2 5 g l 1 exhibited no effect on the cd 2 and zn2 removal respectively with steady state efficiency this result related to the saturation state that was reached in the sorption equilibrium between the active sites and the metal ions which did not allow any further adsorption of the metal ions to the active sites 48 therefore 1 5 g l 1 and 2 g l 1 ca s weight doses were chosen for further adsorption tests 3 2 2 optimization results the variables parameters were optimized through two optimization s steps ofat experiments that were followed by 23 full factorial design experiments the experiments were performed for both of cd 2 and zn 2 metal ions and the results were interpreted as follows 3 2 2 1 ofat 3 2 2 1 1 effect of adsorption time the impact of contact time on cd 2 and zn2 metal ions removal by the ca s membrane was investigated by variety of time intervals 0 120 min table s 4 demonstrated that the removal rates of cd2 and zn2 ions increased by increasing time to 90 min for cd 2 where it achieved 96 for zn 2 ions the removal efficiency reached 83 within 120 min contact time 3 2 2 1 2 effect of ph table s 4 showed that cd 2 and zn2 metal ions removal by the ca s membrane decreased by decreasing ph value from ph 5 5 to 3 5 ph of medium is the most vital variable that affect metal ions uptake as at low ph hydronium ions are more with high concentration than the adsorbed particles therefore it had a slight ability for adsorption meanwhile with raising ph values hydronium ions are diminished and the outcome was more adsorption capacity for cd2 and zn2 ions from solution 49 51 subsequently ph5 5 was chosen for all further experiments 3 2 2 1 3 effect of embedded sargassum dentifolium ratio the effect of embedded ratio of sargassum dentifolium 5 20 with the ca on the metal ions removal was studied table s 4 stated that by increasing sargassum dentifolium ratio to 20 the removal of cd2 and zn2 was increased and reached the highest percent so ca s membrane with 20 sargassum dentifolium was chosen as the ideal ratio 3 2 2 1 4 effect of cd2 and zn2 concentration on the removal data represented in table s 4 revealed that the removal efficiencies of cd2 and zn2 ions reduced by increasing the concentration from 50 100 mg l 1 for instance the cd2 removal efficiency stated 99 at a concentration of 50 mg l 1 and decreased to 95 6 at 100 mg l 1 on the other hand zn2 removal efficiency was 95 at 50 mg l 1 which reduced to 84 at 100 mg l 1 basically as the initial concentration raised the adsorbed amount increased with slightly change in removal rate 25 this indicates that the adsorption rate significantly decreased with the increasing heavy metals concentration this result was related to the saturation of binding sites on the algal biosorbent at higher metal concentration the obtained results were agreed with other previously reported studies 52 53 3 2 2 2 full factorial design 3 2 2 2 1 the main effects in this study three effects were studied ph time and metal ions concentration cd2 and zn2 to show their main and interaction effects on the removal efficiency fig 5 a b demonstrated the main effects of cd2 and zn2 removal by using the mixed matrix ca s membrane as a biosorbent material table s 5a displayed that ph and time had significant effects on the cd2 removal efficiency furthermore fig 5a demonstrated that time and ph were affected positively on the removal efficiency of cd2 while initial cd conc had a negative effect on the adsorption this can be attributed to the increase in the removal efficiency as the change of the lines from the low to the high levels for both of ph and time the main effects were studied for zn2 removal and the efficiency removal have a similar pattern like cd2 adsorption see table s 5b fig 5b on the other hand the zn2 concentration affected negatively on the removal where the efficiency decreased from the low to the high levels of the factor 3 2 2 2 2 interaction effects the interaction effects of the previous factors on the cd2 and zn2 removal by using ca s membrane were studied table s 5a stated that the interaction between ph and time was the only significant interaction that affected the cd2 removal efficiency and it was not effctive interaction due to the non parallel lines that observed in fig 6 a nevertheless table s 5b demonstrated that ph and time and time and zn2 concentrations were significant interactions however the interaction between time and zn2 concentration was the only effective interaction on the zn2 removal efficiency due to the parallel lines presented in fig 6b furthermore it was observed that the high level of ph the high level of time and the low level of zn2 concentration achieved the highest zn2 removal efficiency see fig 6b on the other fig 6a showed that the high level of time and low level of ph achieved highest cd2 removal efficiency 3 2 2 2 3 pareto chart fig 7 a b assumed that at 95 confidence of intervals and sixteen degree of freedom the t value was 4 30 and 12 7 for both cd2 and zn2 removal efficiency respectively by using the ca s membrane fig 7a represented the pareto chart of cd2 removal efficiency where all the factors that exceeded the reference line of the t value were the significant factors accordingly time b ph a and interaction between time and ph ab were the significant effects and time b represented the most significant factor on the other hand fig 7b represented zn2 removal efficiency pareto chart where the figure suggested that time b ph a interaction between time and ph ab zn2 concentration c and finally interaction between time and zn2 concentration ac were significant effects results of pareto chart supported the previous result obtained by the main and the interaction effects 3 2 2 2 4 normal probability plot the normal probability was necessary to know the normal distribution of the data fig s 1 a b expressed the normal distribution plot of the cd2 and zn2 removal efficiency by using the ca s membrane the points that located near the plotted line were normally distributed and far points expressed the real factors that affected the metal removal efficiency fig s 1a showed that time b was a real factor and the most effective factor on the cd2 removal efficiency followed by ph a and the interaction between time and ph ab whereas the zn2 removal efficiency normal probability plot fig s 1b demonstrated that time b was the most effective factor on the zn2 removal efficiency followed by ph a interaction between time and ph ab zn2 concentration c and interaction between time and zn2 concentration bc 3 2 2 2 5 response optimizer the response optimizer was aimed to predict the optimium conditions that achieve the highest removal fig s 2a demonstrated the optimum conditions for the biosorption process of cd2 by using the ca s membrane it was suggested that ph 5 5 and time 120 min and cd2 concentration 100 mg l 1 achieved 96 removal efficiency with a degree of desirability equal to one on the other hand the response optimizer of the biosorption process of zn2 removal efficiency using sargassum dentifolium was 84 removal efficiency at ph 5 5 120 min and 100 mg l 1 zn2 concentration with 0 999 degree of desirability 3 2 2 2 6 contour plot the best interaction effect in the cd2 biosorption state fig s 3a was ph and time at a fixed cd2 concentration of 250 mg l 1 and the cd2 removal efficiency of 60 80 was achieved at time 120 min and ph 5 5 whereas in the state of the zn2 biosorption process at a fixed zn2 concentration of 200 mg l 1and the removal efficiency of 60 70 was achieved at time 120 min and ph 5 5 see fig s 3b 3 2 2 2 7 surface plot the surface plot a three dimensions plot in which a fitting of the removal efficiency response was investigated by studying the interaction of two variables effects when the other variables were constant in this study the best two variable interaction was selected to show the effect of them on the cd2 and zn2 removal efficiency by using ca s membrane fig s 4a showed the surface plot of ca s membrane in case of cd2 biosorption at fixed cd concentration 250 mg l 1 removal efficiency was nearly 75 at ph 5 5 and time 120 min concerning to zn2 biosorption at 200 mg l 1 zn2 concentration the removal efficiency around 75 was achieved also at ph 5 5 and time 120 min see fig s 4b 3 3 adsorption isotherms the adsorption data that was given by different concentrations of the cd2 and zn2 ions were investigated using different isotherm models of langmuir freundlich temkin and d r models as follow 3 3 1 langmuir and freundlich application of these adsorption isotherms for the cd2 and zn2 ions removal using the mixed matrix membrane of the ca s was figured out in fig s 5a b and the adsorption parameters were reported in table 1 the most finding data in the langmuir isotherm was the adsorption capacities that exhibited the maximum values of qmax 75 7 and 75 2 mg g 1 for the cd2 and zn2 ions respectively that indicate the presence of monolayer and a favourable sorption regarding the linear regression r2 freundlich isotherm was the most decent model for the adsorption of cd2 and zn2 the freundlich isotherm is a type of isotherm in which the degree of adsorbate inclusion is viewed as a multilayer procedure on a heterogeneous surface and the quantity of adsorbed solute per unit mass of adsorbent increased step by step 54 for instance every adsorbate particle was involved as a single site and stayed at such site until it was desorbed moreover it was noticed the bigger estimation of n which can be attributed to more grounded connection between the adsorbate and the adsorbent since n value identified with adsorption power at a specific temperature 55 which confirms preferred sorption with adsorption intensity value are 1 8 and 3 9 for cd2 and zn2 ions respectively where if n lies between one and ten this indicates a favorable sorption process 3 3 2 temkin isotherm in view of the graphical plot of qe versus ln ce of temkin isotherm the slope and the intercept can be determined and the temkin energy constants can be obtained b is a constant identified with the adsorption heat j mol 1 this isotherm consists a factor that explicitly taking into the account of adsorbent adsorbate interactions the result displayed a better relationship of the temkin isotherm at 1 44 l g 1 b 17 5 j mol 1 which is an indication of the heat of sorption indicating a physical adsorption with r2 value estimated as 0 9778 and 0 9751 for the cd2 and zn2 respectively see fig s 6a 3 3 3 dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm by plotting ln qe versus ε 2 a straight line formed with a slope equal kads and intercept equal ln qe the qe mg g 1 and kads mol2 kj2 values were determined and the mean free energy e 0 52 and 0 45kj mol for cd2 and zn2 respectively indicating a physiosorption process and the r2 0 9892 and 0 9901 for cd2 and zn2 respectively higher than that of temkin so it demonstrated a great fitting to this isotherm model as introduced in fig s 6b the consequences of this work ensured that of the four adsorption isotherm the r2 value of the freundlich isotherm was the highest and the most applicable type that can be used to describe the metal adsorption process by the ca s membrane 3 4 kinetics data analysis kinetics data analysis were intended to evaluate the adsorption rate of the mixed matrix membrane ca s for the cd2 and zn2 metal ions as hazards pollutants inconsequence the mechanism of adsorption processes can be determined by rate constants adsorbed quantities at equilibrium qe the pseudo first order pseudo 1st or pseudo second order pseudo 2nd models give the most noteworthy adsorption since suitable reaction order for the adsorption experiment was given with dependency on the relationship coefficients r2 42 43 fig s 7a b and table 2 stated that the ca s membranes in all cases were highly exhibited by the pseudo 1st order model due to the r2 values were higher and qe experimental was closer to the calculated than those corresponding for the pseudo 2nd order model therefore the adsorption of the cd2 and zn2 by the ca s membrane was the best described by the pseudo 1st order model 42 3 5 brunauer emmett teller bet analysis as adsorbents the specific surface area plays a significant role for adsorption efficiencies so the bet was determined bet is an analysis that is applied to indicate the sample surface area and confirm the structural properties of the membrane an increase in bet and pore size distribution values were detected for ca s membranes compared to the ca b membranes a bet values were 331 8 m2 g and 27 5 m2 g and pore size distribution values were 36 nm and 5 5 nm for ca s and ca b membranes respectively as presented in fig s8 this confirms that the higher is the specific surface area of the ca s membrane the more contact between the heavy metals molecules and the adsorption active sites and hence removal enhancement 3 6 adsorption mechanism of zn and cd on ca s mix matrix membranes the cas mix matrix membranes were characterized by bet surface area and pore size distribution which were 331 8 m2 g 1 and 36 nm respectively the surface of cas mix matrix membranes characterized with the presence of coo and so4 as shown from the atr ir spectra and it is indicated that the electronegativity turns lower for coo groups which attract electropositive metal ions where the average zeta potential value for the embeded sargassum dentifolium was 18 5 mv so the mechanism of adsorption is attributed to the electrostatic attraction physic sorption between cas mix matrix membranes and zn cd ions 56 since former studies indicated the enhancement in heavy metals adsorption by embedding algal biomass into the polymer matrix the highest proficiency revealed to promising components which are carbohydrate protein lipids and phenolic compounds that contain various reactive functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl amino and sulfonyl groups which responsible for the adsorption process 46 47 in our work the removal percent of heavy metals was completely done by adsorption process where by using filtration process there is another way that indicates the rejection of heavy metal salts on membrane surface under applied pressure the filtration process depend mainly on the membrane surface pore size and sieving effect or and diffusion of contamination through the membrane our investigations for the prepared membrane indicated the high pore size on the membrane surface that will allow the heavy metal that have relatively small size to pass through the membrane under filtration system so we used the adsorption rather the filtration technique 57 3 7 regeneration study fig s9 showed the performance of the ca s membrane for the removing process of cd2 and zn2 ions before and after regeneration study for more than one cycle of adsorption desorption process after the batch adsorption experiment the prepared mixed matrix membrane was subjected to desorption process to regenerate its adsorption capacity a solution containing 0 1 m hcl was used to regenerate the membrane and the desorption process applied five cycles once the adsorption process was finished the membrane was regenerated with 0 1 m hcl solution the regeneration process was studied using 100 mg l 1 of the cd2 and zn2 solution at the initial concentration it was found that the ca s membrane was capable to reduce the heavy metals concentration with 99 9 and 95 for cd2 and zn2 solutions respectively the recovery rate was determined based on the final concentration of the cd2 and zn2 ions in the aqueous solution the high recovery rate of the ca s membrane indicated that with five cycles it can be used for cd2 and zn2 ions removal process therefore it was experienced that the ca s membrane was able to be re covered and re used with high efficiency without losing its function as adsorbent in membrane matrix for five cycles 4 conclusion in this study mixed matrix membrane incorporated with micro particles of marine macroalgal species sargassum dentifolium ca s membranes was successfully prepared and examined for cd2 and zn2 metal ions removal results displayed that the ca s achieved higher removal efficiencies 95 9 and 82 79 for cd2 and zn2 respectively than the ca blank membrane where it recorded removal efficiencies of 45 and 35 for both cd 2 and zn2 respectively after that the optimization process was displayed to the selected ca s membrane through some preliminary experiments that were followed by 23 one replicate full factorial design experiments furthermore it was observed that this result was in a good agreement with the predicted value response optimizer value that were stated the removal efficiencies for cd2 and zn2 of 95 6 and 82 7 at the same conditions with degree of accuracy 1 and 0 99 respectively freundlich isotherm and pseudo 1st order kinetics were more applicable for the data analysis which assumed the multilayer heterogeneous nature of the adsorption reaction the ca s membrane is sustainable economically and environmentally approach and applicable for five cycles with high removal efficiency for both cd2 and zn2 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related

displayed in order to determine the nature of the reaction and re usability of the membrane the adsorption process was related to freundlich isotherm that describes the multilayer and heterogeneous adsorption of molecules to the adsorbent surface and the pseudo first order kinetic was the most represent kinetic model for the adsorption process factorial experiments displayed that time ph and interaction between time and ph were the most significant factors in the adsorption process this study proposed a new generation of adsorptive mixed matrix membranes based on the cellulose acetate and the algal micro particles keywords sargassum dentifolium cellulose acetate mixed matrix membrane ecofriendly adsorption heavy metals removal 1 introduction recently the level of heavy metals in aquatic systems is an important indicator of the health of the aquatic system s ecological environment due to their toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation 1 cadmium cd and zinc zn are widely present in the environment they are highly ecotoxic and can migrate from irrigation water to food crops and can accumulate in soil and human body an accumulation of cd and zn into human body can cause health problems as induce kidney bone damages and chronic toxicities 2 the main pathways for cd and zn entering the environment are through mining metallurgical activities and disposal of wastewater therefore heavy metals removal became an important issues for the economic side and the public health protection especially with sustainable economically and environmentally safe process 3 the fundamental treatment strategies that utilized for heavy metals discharging were chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane filtration electrolytic methods and reverse osmosis 4 10 however different limitations for such methods were related to high cost generating sludge and limited at low concentrations as a result searching for new applicable techniques such as adsorptive membranes became a great interest different materials such as cellulose derivatives biopolymers raw agricultural wastes biological biomasses and synthetic polymer sources were used as adsorbent biosorbent agents 11 13 algae as a type of biological biomasses was used as biosorbent materials in both living and non living forms 14 15 they were distinguished as eco friendly biomasses with low cost for the removal of pollutants from waste water 16 21 moreover increasing the active surface area of these biosorbent materials is playing an important role in the adsorption proficiency and applicability appling these algal biomass on a large scale may have a problematic issue due to the cost of harvesting these particles after the removal process 12 also decrease the adsorption capacity due to their agglomeration and their van der waals interactions so easy processing of the adsorption process in 3rs removal recovery and reuse and more efficient adsorbent were expected from the mixed matrix membrane in order to counter such constraints impregnating nano or micro adsorbents into porous host materials like polymeric membrane is a promising solution 22 polymer is another appropriate material that can be used in adsorption and removal process in this respect polymer can be easily shaped in different forms as beads fibers and flat membranes with controlled morphology and porosity 23 for applying the polymers in the adsorption process they should be firstly functionalized chemically via grafting and chemical oxidation or physically via combination of functional ingredients as well designed nanoparticles inorganic metal organic framework organic and microbial reactive materials 24 28 cellulose acetate ca is a natural polymer like a carbohydrate polymers consisted of repeating units called polysaccharides ca is a safe material it has good chemical and thermal stability however ca membrane is limited for low ph and high temperature can destroy the ca structure so the ca membrane performance can be enhanced by embeding with other polymers nanoparticles or porous materials 29 so combination between the polymer substances and microparticles algal biomass in the form of membrane is a promising idea for enhancing the removal process in consequence in this study non living algal biomass sargassum dentifolium was used in micro size as an adsorbent materials within the cellulose acetate polymer ca forming the ca s mixed matrix membrane the ca s membrane was used for cd 2 and zn 2 ions removal some preliminary experiments followed by full factorial design experiment were used in order to optimize the removal process via optimizing the parameters ph time embedded algae percent and metal ions conc some characterization analysis viz ft ir sem edx porosity and swelling were displayed kinetics and isotherms were analyzed to explain the nature of the reaction regeneration and re usability studies were performed in order to examine the performance of the membrane for multiple uses for the cd 2 and zn 2 ions removal process 2 experimental 2 1 materials cellulose acetate 40 acetyl content as a polymer matrix and polyethylene glycol peg mwt 600 were purchased from aldrich zinc acetate and cadmium nitrate were obtained from merck furthermore all the chemicals acetone ethanol hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide and sodium chloride were supplied from el nasr company egypt additionally marine macro algae sargassum dentifolium was collected from ras gharb red sea egypt washed dried and grinded to micro size in order to increase their surface area 2 2 preparation of mixed matrix membrane mixed matrix membranes of cellulose acetate sargassum dentifolium ca s were constructed via the phase separation technique 30 the polymer was firstly dissolved in acetone solvent keeping the solid content at 20 wt peg 5 was added to the ca solution as pore former due to peg is hydrophilic and water soluble material which during coagulation process it leached out onto the water leaving pores on the membrane matrix and resulted in increase the porosity of the membrane and hence increase the surface area required for adsorption process 31 the grinded macro algae were added to the ca solution with various ratios 5 10 and 20 the polymeric matrix was sonicated for 1 h to obtain a good dispersion the obtained polymer solution was casted on a glass plate using a casting knife with thickness of 250 μm the glass plate with the casted solution was then immersed in water for occurring instantaneous phase inversion between solvent and water in the coagulation bath 32 two forms of the membranes were obtained cellulose acetate ca b as a blank and cellulose acetate sargassum dentifolium ca s 2 3 membrane characterization 2 3 1 attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir the functional groups of the cab and cas membranes were determined via attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared art ftir shimadzu 8400 japan spectrophotometer in range of 400 and 4000 cm 1 2 3 2 scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray microanalysis edx the morphology of the membranes surface and the cross sections were examined using high resolution scanning electron microscope sem quanta feg 250 esem connected to energy dispersive x ray microanalysis edx before investigation the dried membranes were sputtered coated with gold by s150a sputter coater edwards 2 3 3 swelling characteristics the membranes swelling test were performed by immersion the three pieces of each membrane 5 5 cm2 in distilled water for overnight at room temperature after that the membranes wet weights were measured then dried in an oven at 60 c till their weights become constant 33 the swelling behavior w s was assessed using the following equation 1 w s w w e t w d r y w d r y where wwet and wdry are the weights of wet and dried membranes respectively 2 3 4 porosity measurements the porosity of the ca and the ca s membranes were estimated depending on their dry wet weight s technique 34 35 the porosity of the membranes was assessed as follows 2 ε w w e t w d r y d a h 100 where ε is the membrane porosity d is the water density 0 998 g cm3 a in cm2 is the membranes area and h is the membranes thickness cm 2 4 preparation of cd2 and zn2 metal ions solutions stock solutions of 1000 mg l 1 of the standardized cd2 and zn2 ions solutions were prepared by dissolving the cd2 and zn2 salts in double distilled water the stock solutions were diluted to the required experimental concentration in a batch adsorption experiment 2 5 adsorption and optimization studies batch adsorption experiments were carried out by add of the prepared membranes in cd2 and zn2 ions at the experimental conditions of 120 min in 100 ml solution containing 100 mg l 1 ions concentrations using a horizontal bench shaker orbitek teqip act eq 454 at 200 rpm a constant time interval was taken and analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer aas perkin elmer analyst 100 at 228 8 nm and 213 9 nm for cd2 and zn2 respectively 36 37 to determine the metal ions concentrations the removal efficiencies of cd2 and zn2 metal ions by were calculated as follows 3 r e m o v a l e f f e c i e n c y c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 and ce are initial and equilibrium final concentrations mgl 1 of the metal solutions respectively in order to study the effect of the embedded algal s ratios on the membrane efficiency through the cd 2 and zn 2 metal ions sorption process screening experiment was implemented for the prepared membranes the experiments were performed at room temp ph 5 5 100 mg l 1 metal ions concentration by using different doses of both membranes 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 g l 1 for cd2 and zn2 metal ions after that some experiment for the following variables embedded sargassum dentifolium percent ph contact time and heavy metals concentration were studied all the previous experiments were performed for both cd2 and zn2 metal ions those preliminary experiments were implemented in order to easy determine the levels of the full factorial design experiment one replicate 23 full factorial design experiment 8 runs for both cd2 and zn2 removal was displayed and the used levels design matrix were recorded in table s 1a b and table s 2a b respectively the results were assessed using minitab 18 and main effects interaction effects pareto chart normal probability plot response optimizer contour and surface plot were interpreted 2 6 adsorption isotherms four types of isotherms langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r were used through this study in order to determine the relationship between the metals sorption capacity and the metals concentration 38 39 the isotherms were applied for both the ca b and the ca s membrane embedded with 20 sargassum dentifolium to demonstrate the surface properties and the affinity of the biosorbent materials furthermore the isotherm s data is used to compare the biosorption capacities for both the ca b and the ca s membranes the isotherm models were represented by the following linearized equations 2 6 1 langmuir isotherm 4 ce qe ce qmax 1 bqmax where qe q e is the amount of heavy metals sorbed per unit mass onto the prepared membarnes at equilibrium mgg 1 qmax is maximum adsorption capacity at complete monolayer coverage mgg 1 b is the langmuir constant mgl 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration of heavy metals in the solution mgl 1 2 6 2 freundlich isotherm 5 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mgg 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration of heavy metals in the solution mgl 1 k f and n represents are the freundlich constants which expressed the adsorption limit and adsorption density respectively 2 6 3 temkin isotherm the temkin isotherm 40 was estimated by the next equations 6 q e r t b t l n a t r t b t l n c e 7 q e b l n a t b l n c e 8 b r t b t where q e is the quantity of adsorbed metals at equilibrium r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature at 298 k b t mgl 1 is the isotherm temkin constant and a t lg 1 is constant at equilibrium binding 2 6 4 dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm 41 was frequently performed to explain the adsorption mechanism and to evaluate the porosity properties of the adsorbent the direct equation of d r isotherm is calculated by eq 9 9 l n q e l n q e k a d s ε 2 where qe mgg 1 is the hypotheticalv saturation limit kads is the dubinin radushkevich constant that identified with the mean free energy of adsorption per mole of adsorbate jmol 1 and ε is the polanyi potential identified with equilibrium and determined by eq 10 10 ε r t l n 1 1 c e 2 7 kinetics data analysis the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were applied to evaluate the adsorption kinetics of cd2 zn2 for pseudo first order model the straight type of the lagergren s pseudo first order equation was calculated as follows 11 l n q e q t l n q e k 1 t where q t and q e are the measure of metal ions adsorbed at time t and equilibrium mol g 1 respectively k1 min 1 is the rate constant for this model that was determined from the slope of the direct plot of l n q e q t versus t 42 43 the rate of pseudo second order model is depending on the quantity of pollutants on the surface of the sorbent and their amount sorbed at an equilibrium rendering to the ho the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e is relative to components such as temperature initial concentration and the trend of solute sorbent interactions the linear equation for the ho model can be expressed as follows 12 t q t t q e 1 k 2 q e 2 where k2 is the rate constant of sorption for this model g mol 1 min 1 q e and q t are the quantities of adsorbed metal ions at equilibrium and at time t mol g 1 respectively 2 8 regeneration studies the regeneration studies for the mixed matrix membranes were carried out using 0 1 n hcl after the adsorption of cd 2 and zn 2 metal ions on the ca s membrane the membrane was separated and soaked in 0 1 n hcl for 1 h followed by washing several times with distilled water till the ph reach neutrality the adsorption and regeneration process were repeated 5 cycles and the regeneration percentage was calculated 3 results and discussions 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir it was noticed from fig 1 that cab membrane showed strong peaks at 3323 which attributed to oh stretching group furthermore the peak at 2885 cm 1 related to ch2 stretching 1363 and 1414 cm 1 corresponding to ch2 bending and the peak at 1640 cm 1 attributed to cc vibration peak at 1744 cm 1 related to carbonyl co stretching of acetyl group of the acetates and that at 1012 cm 1 related to co stretching for cas membrane the peak that was observed at 2920 cm 1 related to ch3 asymmetric stretching and this peak was overlapped with ch2 stretching at 2885 cm 1 the peak of carbonyl band was shifted to 1735 cm 1 and co shifted to 1008 cm 1 and oh to 3320 cm 1 which may be indicate the formation of hydrogen bonding between the polymer and algal biomass meanwhile the brown algae sargassum micro particle demonstrated the characteristic absorption at 820 cm 1 which is a region of particular importance indicating the presence of the sulfated polysaccharide 44 3 1 2 scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray microanalysis edx fig 2 displayed the morphology of membrane surfaces and cross sections of the blank ca and the ca s 20 membranes the ca b membrane surface stated smooth structure with relatively no pores and the ca s 20 membrane surface had a lot of pores that distributed along the membrane surface with a uniform distribution of the micro algae particles in the polymer matrix fig 2a and b the cross section of the ca and ca s 20 membranes were shown in fig 2c and d the ca b membrane represented a smooth texture with like sponge structure and the macro voids shape were absent furthermore the cross section of the ca s 20 at high magnification showed porous sub layer with presence of highly macro void structure and the dense top layer nearly disappeared compared to the ca b membrane because higher embedding ratio of hydrophilic sargassum dentifolium micro particles that led to higher water diffusion rate during coagulation in the water bath then the exchange has occurred between solvent and water so the membranes with thin surface layer large pores and macrovoids in support layer were obtained 32 also the highest porosity of the ca s membranes compared with the ca b that owed to the micro particle size distribution of brown algae sargassum as observed in fig 3 a the edx result demonstrated that the chemical composition of the ca s membranes before and after metals biosorption were completely different and the presence of signals cd2 and zn2 zones in ca s membrane after adsorption confirm the obvious biosorption of cd2 and zn2 biosorption as shown in fig 3b 3 1 3 swelling and porosity behavior of the membranes table s 3 displayed the swelling and the porosity of the ca b and ca s membrane with different ratios of the algal micro particles the swelling was largely increased by increasing the sargassum dentifolium content within the membrane matrix the swelling was increased from 89 of the ca blank to 155 of the ca s membrane that contain 20 algal micro particles also the porosity of the membranes showed an enhancement by increasing the algal particles compared to the ca b these results owed to the hydrophilic surface uniform desperation for algal content and the macro void formation through the ca s membrane the increase of the membrane porosity resulted from the enlargement of wet membrane hydrophilicity with higher algal content which cause instantaneous phase demixing between solvent acetone and non solvent water during membrane fabrication 45 which in turn increase the pores and voids within the membrane matrix 3 2 adsorption experiments 3 2 1 screening experiment the primary experiment was achieved in order to differentiate between the cab and the cas mixed matrix membranes with algal biomass 5 10 20 for cd2 and zn2 ions the experiment showed that the most efficient membrane was the ca s 20 membrane several studies on biosorption of sargassum were performed and revealed their proficiency to the chemical components which comprise carbohydrate protein lipids and phenolic compounds 46 these components contain several reactive functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl amino and sulfonyl groups which responsible for the adsorption process 47 these former studies demonstrated the enhancement in heavy metals adsorption by the incorporation of this algal biomass into the polymer matrix so this membrane was selected for the next optimization experiments as a most potent membrane to estimate the optimum solid to liquid ratio adsorbent to metal volume different doses of the membrane were studied and the removal efficiencies for cd 2 and zn2 metal ions was plotted in fig 4 by increasing adsorbent weight of the ca s mixed matrix membrane from 0 5 to 2 g l 1 for cd2 and 0 5 to 2 5 g l 1 for zn2 the removal efficiency raised and reached around 96 and 83 for cd2 and zn2 respectively whereas the cd 2 and zn2 metal ions removal efficiencies in the state of the cab membrane were nearly 45 and 35 for both cd 2 and zn2 respectively this result attributed to increase the active sites and the functional groups that further chelate the metal ions from the polluted water meanwhile over weight dose of the cas membrane at 2 g l 1 and 2 5 g l 1 exhibited no effect on the cd 2 and zn2 removal respectively with steady state efficiency this result related to the saturation state that was reached in the sorption equilibrium between the active sites and the metal ions which did not allow any further adsorption of the metal ions to the active sites 48 therefore 1 5 g l 1 and 2 g l 1 ca s weight doses were chosen for further adsorption tests 3 2 2 optimization results the variables parameters were optimized through two optimization s steps ofat experiments that were followed by 23 full factorial design experiments the experiments were performed for both of cd 2 and zn 2 metal ions and the results were interpreted as follows 3 2 2 1 ofat 3 2 2 1 1 effect of adsorption time the impact of contact time on cd 2 and zn2 metal ions removal by the ca s membrane was investigated by variety of time intervals 0 120 min table s 4 demonstrated that the removal rates of cd2 and zn2 ions increased by increasing time to 90 min for cd 2 where it achieved 96 for zn 2 ions the removal efficiency reached 83 within 120 min contact time 3 2 2 1 2 effect of ph table s 4 showed that cd 2 and zn2 metal ions removal by the ca s membrane decreased by decreasing ph value from ph 5 5 to 3 5 ph of medium is the most vital variable that affect metal ions uptake as at low ph hydronium ions are more with high concentration than the adsorbed particles therefore it had a slight ability for adsorption meanwhile with raising ph values hydronium ions are diminished and the outcome was more adsorption capacity for cd2 and zn2 ions from solution 49 51 subsequently ph5 5 was chosen for all further experiments 3 2 2 1 3 effect of embedded sargassum dentifolium ratio the effect of embedded ratio of sargassum dentifolium 5 20 with the ca on the metal ions removal was studied table s 4 stated that by increasing sargassum dentifolium ratio to 20 the removal of cd2 and zn2 was increased and reached the highest percent so ca s membrane with 20 sargassum dentifolium was chosen as the ideal ratio 3 2 2 1 4 effect of cd2 and zn2 concentration on the removal data represented in table s 4 revealed that the removal efficiencies of cd2 and zn2 ions reduced by increasing the concentration from 50 100 mg l 1 for instance the cd2 removal efficiency stated 99 at a concentration of 50 mg l 1 and decreased to 95 6 at 100 mg l 1 on the other hand zn2 removal efficiency was 95 at 50 mg l 1 which reduced to 84 at 100 mg l 1 basically as the initial concentration raised the adsorbed amount increased with slightly change in removal rate 25 this indicates that the adsorption rate significantly decreased with the increasing heavy metals concentration this result was related to the saturation of binding sites on the algal biosorbent at higher metal concentration the obtained results were agreed with other previously reported studies 52 53 3 2 2 2 full factorial design 3 2 2 2 1 the main effects in this study three effects were studied ph time and metal ions concentration cd2 and zn2 to show their main and interaction effects on the removal efficiency fig 5 a b demonstrated the main effects of cd2 and zn2 removal by using the mixed matrix ca s membrane as a biosorbent material table s 5a displayed that ph and time had significant effects on the cd2 removal efficiency furthermore fig 5a demonstrated that time and ph were affected positively on the removal efficiency of cd2 while initial cd conc had a negative effect on the adsorption this can be attributed to the increase in the removal efficiency as the change of the lines from the low to the high levels for both of ph and time the main effects were studied for zn2 removal and the efficiency removal have a similar pattern like cd2 adsorption see table s 5b fig 5b on the other hand the zn2 concentration affected negatively on the removal where the efficiency decreased from the low to the high levels of the factor 3 2 2 2 2 interaction effects the interaction effects of the previous factors on the cd2 and zn2 removal by using ca s membrane were studied table s 5a stated that the interaction between ph and time was the only significant interaction that affected the cd2 removal efficiency and it was not effctive interaction due to the non parallel lines that observed in fig 6 a nevertheless table s 5b demonstrated that ph and time and time and zn2 concentrations were significant interactions however the interaction between time and zn2 concentration was the only effective interaction on the zn2 removal efficiency due to the parallel lines presented in fig 6b furthermore it was observed that the high level of ph the high level of time and the low level of zn2 concentration achieved the highest zn2 removal efficiency see fig 6b on the other fig 6a showed that the high level of time and low level of ph achieved highest cd2 removal efficiency 3 2 2 2 3 pareto chart fig 7 a b assumed that at 95 confidence of intervals and sixteen degree of freedom the t value was 4 30 and 12 7 for both cd2 and zn2 removal efficiency respectively by using the ca s membrane fig 7a represented the pareto chart of cd2 removal efficiency where all the factors that exceeded the reference line of the t value were the significant factors accordingly time b ph a and interaction between time and ph ab were the significant effects and time b represented the most significant factor on the other hand fig 7b represented zn2 removal efficiency pareto chart where the figure suggested that time b ph a interaction between time and ph ab zn2 concentration c and finally interaction between time and zn2 concentration ac were significant effects results of pareto chart supported the previous result obtained by the main and the interaction effects 3 2 2 2 4 normal probability plot the normal probability was necessary to know the normal distribution of the data fig s 1 a b expressed the normal distribution plot of the cd2 and zn2 removal efficiency by using the ca s membrane the points that located near the plotted line were normally distributed and far points expressed the real factors that affected the metal removal efficiency fig s 1a showed that time b was a real factor and the most effective factor on the cd2 removal efficiency followed by ph a and the interaction between time and ph ab whereas the zn2 removal efficiency normal probability plot fig s 1b demonstrated that time b was the most effective factor on the zn2 removal efficiency followed by ph a interaction between time and ph ab zn2 concentration c and interaction between time and zn2 concentration bc 3 2 2 2 5 response optimizer the response optimizer was aimed to predict the optimium conditions that achieve the highest removal fig s 2a demonstrated the optimum conditions for the biosorption process of cd2 by using the ca s membrane it was suggested that ph 5 5 and time 120 min and cd2 concentration 100 mg l 1 achieved 96 removal efficiency with a degree of desirability equal to one on the other hand the response optimizer of the biosorption process of zn2 removal efficiency using sargassum dentifolium was 84 removal efficiency at ph 5 5 120 min and 100 mg l 1 zn2 concentration with 0 999 degree of desirability 3 2 2 2 6 contour plot the best interaction effect in the cd2 biosorption state fig s 3a was ph and time at a fixed cd2 concentration of 250 mg l 1 and the cd2 removal efficiency of 60 80 was achieved at time 120 min and ph 5 5 whereas in the state of the zn2 biosorption process at a fixed zn2 concentration of 200 mg l 1and the removal efficiency of 60 70 was achieved at time 120 min and ph 5 5 see fig s 3b 3 2 2 2 7 surface plot the surface plot a three dimensions plot in which a fitting of the removal efficiency response was investigated by studying the interaction of two variables effects when the other variables were constant in this study the best two variable interaction was selected to show the effect of them on the cd2 and zn2 removal efficiency by using ca s membrane fig s 4a showed the surface plot of ca s membrane in case of cd2 biosorption at fixed cd concentration 250 mg l 1 removal efficiency was nearly 75 at ph 5 5 and time 120 min concerning to zn2 biosorption at 200 mg l 1 zn2 concentration the removal efficiency around 75 was achieved also at ph 5 5 and time 120 min see fig s 4b 3 3 adsorption isotherms the adsorption data that was given by different concentrations of the cd2 and zn2 ions were investigated using different isotherm models of langmuir freundlich temkin and d r models as follow 3 3 1 langmuir and freundlich application of these adsorption isotherms for the cd2 and zn2 ions removal using the mixed matrix membrane of the ca s was figured out in fig s 5a b and the adsorption parameters were reported in table 1 the most finding data in the langmuir isotherm was the adsorption capacities that exhibited the maximum values of qmax 75 7 and 75 2 mg g 1 for the cd2 and zn2 ions respectively that indicate the presence of monolayer and a favourable sorption regarding the linear regression r2 freundlich isotherm was the most decent model for the adsorption of cd2 and zn2 the freundlich isotherm is a type of isotherm in which the degree of adsorbate inclusion is viewed as a multilayer procedure on a heterogeneous surface and the quantity of adsorbed solute per unit mass of adsorbent increased step by step 54 for instance every adsorbate particle was involved as a single site and stayed at such site until it was desorbed moreover it was noticed the bigger estimation of n which can be attributed to more grounded connection between the adsorbate and the adsorbent since n value identified with adsorption power at a specific temperature 55 which confirms preferred sorption with adsorption intensity value are 1 8 and 3 9 for cd2 and zn2 ions respectively where if n lies between one and ten this indicates a favorable sorption process 3 3 2 temkin isotherm in view of the graphical plot of qe versus ln ce of temkin isotherm the slope and the intercept can be determined and the temkin energy constants can be obtained b is a constant identified with the adsorption heat j mol 1 this isotherm consists a factor that explicitly taking into the account of adsorbent adsorbate interactions the result displayed a better relationship of the temkin isotherm at 1 44 l g 1 b 17 5 j mol 1 which is an indication of the heat of sorption indicating a physical adsorption with r2 value estimated as 0 9778 and 0 9751 for the cd2 and zn2 respectively see fig s 6a 3 3 3 dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm by plotting ln qe versus ε 2 a straight line formed with a slope equal kads and intercept equal ln qe the qe mg g 1 and kads mol2 kj2 values were determined and the mean free energy e 0 52 and 0 45kj mol for cd2 and zn2 respectively indicating a physiosorption process and the r2 0 9892 and 0 9901 for cd2 and zn2 respectively higher than that of temkin so it demonstrated a great fitting to this isotherm model as introduced in fig s 6b the consequences of this work ensured that of the four adsorption isotherm the r2 value of the freundlich isotherm was the highest and the most applicable type that can be used to describe the metal adsorption process by the ca s membrane 3 4 kinetics data analysis kinetics data analysis were intended to evaluate the adsorption rate of the mixed matrix membrane ca s for the cd2 and zn2 metal ions as hazards pollutants inconsequence the mechanism of adsorption processes can be determined by rate constants adsorbed quantities at equilibrium qe the pseudo first order pseudo 1st or pseudo second order pseudo 2nd models give the most noteworthy adsorption since suitable reaction order for the adsorption experiment was given with dependency on the relationship coefficients r2 42 43 fig s 7a b and table 2 stated that the ca s membranes in all cases were highly exhibited by the pseudo 1st order model due to the r2 values were higher and qe experimental was closer to the calculated than those corresponding for the pseudo 2nd order model therefore the adsorption of the cd2 and zn2 by the ca s membrane was the best described by the pseudo 1st order model 42 3 5 brunauer emmett teller bet analysis as adsorbents the specific surface area plays a significant role for adsorption efficiencies so the bet was determined bet is an analysis that is applied to indicate the sample surface area and confirm the structural properties of the membrane an increase in bet and pore size distribution values were detected for ca s membranes compared to the ca b membranes a bet values were 331 8 m2 g and 27 5 m2 g and pore size distribution values were 36 nm and 5 5 nm for ca s and ca b membranes respectively as presented in fig s8 this confirms that the higher is the specific surface area of the ca s membrane the more contact between the heavy metals molecules and the adsorption active sites and hence removal enhancement 3 6 adsorption mechanism of zn and cd on ca s mix matrix membranes the cas mix matrix membranes were characterized by bet surface area and pore size distribution which were 331 8 m2 g 1 and 36 nm respectively the surface of cas mix matrix membranes characterized with the presence of coo and so4 as shown from the atr ir spectra and it is indicated that the electronegativity turns lower for coo groups which attract electropositive metal ions where the average zeta potential value for the embeded sargassum dentifolium was 18 5 mv so the mechanism of adsorption is attributed to the electrostatic attraction physic sorption between cas mix matrix membranes and zn cd ions 56 since former studies indicated the enhancement in heavy metals adsorption by embedding algal biomass into the polymer matrix the highest proficiency revealed to promising components which are carbohydrate protein lipids and phenolic compounds that contain various reactive functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl amino and sulfonyl groups which responsible for the adsorption process 46 47 in our work the removal percent of heavy metals was completely done by adsorption process where by using filtration process there is another way that indicates the rejection of heavy metal salts on membrane surface under applied pressure the filtration process depend mainly on the membrane surface pore size and sieving effect or and diffusion of contamination through the membrane our investigations for the prepared membrane indicated the high pore size on the membrane surface that will allow the heavy metal that have relatively small size to pass through the membrane under filtration system so we used the adsorption rather the filtration technique 57 3 7 regeneration study fig s9 showed the performance of the ca s membrane for the removing process of cd2 and zn2 ions before and after regeneration study for more than one cycle of adsorption desorption process after the batch adsorption experiment the prepared mixed matrix membrane was subjected to desorption process to regenerate its adsorption capacity a solution containing 0 1 m hcl was used to regenerate the membrane and the desorption process applied five cycles once the adsorption process was finished the membrane was regenerated with 0 1 m hcl solution the regeneration process was studied using 100 mg l 1 of the cd2 and zn2 solution at the initial concentration it was found that the ca s membrane was capable to reduce the heavy metals concentration with 99 9 and 95 for cd2 and zn2 solutions respectively the recovery rate was determined based on the final concentration of the cd2 and zn2 ions in the aqueous solution the high recovery rate of the ca s membrane indicated that with five cycles it can be used for cd2 and zn2 ions removal process therefore it was experienced that the ca s membrane was able to be re covered and re used with high efficiency without losing its function as adsorbent in membrane matrix for five cycles 4 conclusion in this study mixed matrix membrane incorporated with micro particles of marine macroalgal species sargassum dentifolium ca s membranes was successfully prepared and examined for cd2 and zn2 metal ions removal results displayed that the ca s achieved higher removal efficiencies 95 9 and 82 79 for cd2 and zn2 respectively than the ca blank membrane where it recorded removal efficiencies of 45 and 35 for both cd 2 and zn2 respectively after that the optimization process was displayed to the selected ca s membrane through some preliminary experiments that were followed by

nanofibers and mechanically robust polyacrylonitrile pan nanofibers coated with dopamine dpa polyethyleneimine pei the dpa pei modification on the pan nanofibers has proven to be efficient and resulted in a more positively charged surface with improved hydrophilicity meanwhile the polyamide layer formed by the interfacial polymerization ip method was negatively charged on top of the fo membrane the interaction between surface charged membranes and positively charged draw solutes in the fo process has been investigated comprehensively the result showed that hydrophilicity and electrostatic repulsion could alleviate the fouling generated by organic ds while hydrophobicity and electrostatic attraction could magnify the fouling finally the positively charged ds was recycled by the positively charged pei nf membranes with a reasonably high special water flux and salt rejections therefore this study shows that the combination of the surface charged membranes and positively

including thermosensitive substance enrichment agricultural irrigation seawater desalination and wastewater reclamation 1 3 internal concentration polarization icp makes the actual osmotic pressure gradient lower than the bulk osmotic pressure gradient 4 to alleviate icp a high performance membrane should consist of a thin porous and less tortuous support layer on which the solute can migrate freely and a selective layer rejects the undesired solute 5 two crucial elements decide fo process performance a a high performance membrane and b a suitable draw solute 6 compared with conventional membranes fabricated by nonsolvent induced phase separation nips method ceramic supports fabricated by electrospinning are thinner more porous and with lower tortuosity 7 some studies have introduced some hydrophilic nanofibers pva and nylon 6 6 as supports to prepare tfcfo membranes 8 11 although such membranes showed good wettability and high fo performance the hydrophilic nanofibers readily swelled in water resulting in a poor mechanical stability of the membranes and thus severely limited their applications 8 10 to address the mechanical problem researchers have shifted their attention to hydrophobic nanofibers such as polysulfone psf poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf and polyimide pi 3 12 13 for examples a hydrophilic material nylon 6 6 was deposited onto pvdf nanofibers by mccutcheon s group this gentle method could improve surface hydrophilicity significantly without a reduction in mechanical strength 14 recently fabrication of hydrophobic hydrophilic interpenetrating network hh ipn has been adopted by researchers 8 11 15 in hh ipn the hydrophilic nanofibers in the support can increase effective porosity and enhance the water permeability of the resultant membranes while the hydrophobic nanofibers can provide the mechanical strength of the support meanwhile the selection of a suitable draw solution is essential to fo technology when further regeneration of the diluted ds is needed after fo process instead of nacl the most common ds recovered by reverse osmosis ro process other kinds of ds such as bivalent salts and organic compounds regenerated by nanofiltration nf process have received great attentions 16 17 sucrose 17 gluconate salts 18 and edta complexes 19 as ds have shown some advantages on similar water fluxes and much lower reverse salt flux rsf the nf regenerations also remain high rejection rates ranging from 96 to 98 however these large size organic ds may enter the porous support in fo mode resulting in severe fouling which leads to an undesirable decline in fo performance to date most study related to fo membranes have focused on improving the fouling resistance of the active layer and alleviating icp effect by the modification of the substrates while most studies about ds have paid attention to finding ds with low rsf and easy regeneration according to our current understanding limited efforts have been expended in investigating the electrostatic interaction between positively charged draw solutes and surface charged fo membranes performance 20 usually the charges of the tfc membrane surfaces are changed after modification some organic dss like some charged organic foulants have charge polarities that may also affect membrane performance therefore the investigation on electrostatic interaction between membranes and ds can help us to understand its roles in the fo process in this study a three layer composite fo membrane is designed to investigate the interaction with charged ds regenerated by nf process moreover the three layer composite membrane from top to bottom comprise the polyamide selective layer electrospun cellulose triacetate cta nanofibers and mechanically robust electrospun polyacrylonitrile pan nanofibers coated with dopamine dpa polyethyleneimine pei hydrophobic pan nanofibers provide excellent mechanical strength while hydrophilic cta nanofibers have poor mechanical strength but improved fo performance furthermore a chemical modification of dpa pei was introduced on the pan support to enhance its hydrophilicity and generate positive charges in addition the polyamide layer formed by ip was negatively charged on the top of the fo membrane as a result the two sides of tfc cta pan dpa pei membrane had different surface charges chitooligosaccharide cos a saccharide polymer containing a smaller number of monosaccharides than chitosan was adopted as ds the reasons to select cos as a ds were 1 cos is soluble in water which can produce a high osmotic pressure 2 cos is positively charged and has relatively large molecular weight which means it can be easily recycled by nf and its rsf can be negligible the fo performance of both the unmodified and modified membranes was investigated to explore how the interaction between surface charged membranes and positively charged draw solutes influences on fo performance lastly the positively charged cos were recycled by pei nf membranes with positive surface charges 2 experimental 2 1 materials polyacrylonitrile pan 500 kda was purchased from shanghai jinshan petroleum co ltd m phenylenediamine mpd

were prepared via electrospinning technique described in elsewhere 22 cta nanofibers were prepared by using the co solvent of nmp acetone system initially 6 0 wt of cta was dissolved in 1 1 nmp acetone system under room temperature for 8 h then the homogeneous cta solution was put into a 20 ml syringe and electrospun onto prepared pan nanofibers at 0 9 ml h 1 by a syringe pump tlwnt tl f6 through a stainless needle for 2 h the voltage potential and tip collector distance were 14 15 kv and 10 cm respectively the resultant membrane was named as cta pan nanofibers 2 3 preparation of the tfc cta pan membranes the separation layer was deposited on the composite nanofibers by conventional ip method aqueous solution containing 2 0 w v mpd and 0 1 w v sdbs was first poured onto the cta side of the composite nanofibers for 2 min however the excessive aqueous solution was removed in addition 0 10 w v tmc in n hexane was cast onto the cta pan nanofibers to react with the aqueous monomer for 2 min for the formation of a polyamide layer the subsequent posttreatment steps were taken for further polymerization of the polyamide structure and the membrane storage reported in our previous work 22 the resultant membrane was named as tfc cta pan membrane 2 4 deposition of dpa pei onto tfc cta pan membranes the deposition process is the modification of the published literature 23 first the bottom of the tfc cta pan membranes pan side was contacted with dpa pei solution ph 8 5 dpa 2 0 g l pei 2 0 g l 50 mm tris hcl buffer solution for 4 h subsequently the deposition side were rinsed by di water thoroughly then they were air dried in a vacuum oven and the resultant was named as tfc cta pan dpa pei membrane the whole preparation process and membrane names were illustrated schematically in fig 1 2 5 characterizations the surface morphologies and roughness of the membranes were observed by the scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 5600lv japan and atomic force microscopy afm veeco nanoscope iiia multimode usa respectively the average nanofiber diameters of the nanofibers were estimated by measuring 20 different fibers the detailed information of membrane

performance pwp a l m 2 h 1 bar 1 abbreviated as lmh bar 1 and salt rejection rs of the fo membranes were determined by a cross flow ro unit 4 bar both of pwp and rs can evaluate salt permeability b lmh of prepared tfc membrane 26 the electrolyte concentration was measured using an electric conductivity meter shanghai neici instrument company dds 11a china the feed cos concentration and the permeate cos concentration were obtained by the total organic carbon analyzer toc shimadzu model tocvpn japan the fo experiments were carried out in a fo unit with two solution chambers in both the al fs orientation the active layer faces the feed solution and the al ds orientation the active layer faces the draw solution as described elsewhere 25 two different types of solution 1 0 mol l m nacl and 100 g l cos were regarded as ds the fs was di water the osmotic water flux jv lmh and the rsf js g m 2 h 1 abbreviated as gmh were defined as the volume change of fs per square meter per hour and the concentration change of nacl and cos per square meter per hour respectively given the adverse effect of external concentration polarization ecp is inconsiderable when compared to icp the structural parameter s can be calculated by the eq 1 with the performance of the al ds orientation 21 1 s d s j w ln a π d r a w j w b a π f e e d b where ds is the diffusion coefficient of nacl jw is the osmotic water flux under the al ds πdraw and πfeed are the average osmotic pressure of the bulk ds and fs during the testing time respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane top surface and cross sectional morphology the surface morphology diameter distributions and pore size distributions of the nanofibers are shown in fig 2 the average nanofiber diameter of the pan nanofibers 407 32 nm is much larger than that of the cta nanofibers 177 48 nm therefore it is understandable that the average pore size of the pan nanofibers 666 33 nm is also larger than that of the cta nanofibers 511 45 nm different from the smooth surface of the pan nanofibers we can observe the modified pan nanofibers surface becomes rougher moreover the voids of the nanofibers almost remain intact after the modification process indicating that the dpa pei coating has little influence on the pore structures of the nanofibers the fig 3 shows the top surface cross sectional morphology of tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes respectively the rough ridge and valley structures are observed on the top of tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes which are the typical polyamide structures the afm results fig 4 also show that there is no distinct morphology difference between these two membranes 3 2 chemical compositions of the membranes fig 5 a shows the atr ftir spectra of the pan nanofibers the cta nanofibers the polyamide layer and the dpa pei coating the characteristic peak of pan at 2244 0 cm 1 belongs to the stretching vibrations of the nitrile groups cn 27 as for cta nanofibers spectra the intense band at 1749 2 cm 1 stretching vibration co of ester 1367 0 cm 1 symmetrical deformation ch3 1232 9 cm 1 and 1037 5 cm 1 stretching vibration co of ester are associated with ester in cta 28 29 unlike pan nanofibers and cta nanofibers a series of bands appear in the range of 1700 1500 cm 1 in the spectra of the nanofiber surface with dpa pei coating 30 the absorbance appears at 1663 0 cm 1 because of the cn groups between dpa and pei 31 the peaks at 1612 6 cm 1 and 1543 1 cm 1 are attributable to the cc stretching vibrations of the aromatic ring and the nh stretching vibrations 32 moreover the polyamide s spectra shows a significant increase in the intensity of the absorption band of 1661 0 cm 1 the amide carbonyl 1610 9 cm 1 the aromatic amide carbonyl and 1541 5 cm 1 the amide amine indicating that the polyamide has been successfully formed 33 in addition the surface element composition of the dpa pei coated membrane was also confirmed by xps fig 5 b the xps spectra display three peaks of c 1s n 1s and o 1s with element contents atomic of 67 81 11 58 and 19 75 respectively the theoretical n o ratio of dpa is 0 5 while it is 1 7 after the dpa pei coating due to the nh groups of pei and the cn groups between pei and dpa fig 6 3 3 zeta potentials water contact angles and mechanical property fig 7 presents the zeta potentials of the membranes under different ph values the zeta potential of the neat pan nanofibers is low indicating that few charges are contained on the surface the surface of the pan nanofibers after dpa pei coating is positively charged when solution ph 7 2 which verifies that the positive sites such as amine groups have been coated onto the surface 32 higher charge density of the substrate has been proved to be favorable for resisting positively charged draw solutes from fouling in the al fs orientation moreover the top surface zeta potential confirms the negatively charged surface of the polyamide side carboxyl groups and the positively charged surface of the pei nf membranes amine groups which is in agreement with the literatures 34 35 fig 8 shows that the initial water contact angles of the membranes and dynamic water contact angle on the dpa pei coating side the initial water contact angles of the nanofibers is 73 on the neat pan nanofibers side while the water contact angles of the cta nanofibers side is decreased to 54 as for the dpa pei coating side not only the initial water contact angles decline to 34 but also the water drop permeates through the membrane and reaches nearly 0 in just 2 s therefore the greatly improved surface wettability of nanofibers after modification can be associated with the hydrophilic nature of the dpa pei which ensures that all the pores are ready for water transport mechanical properties presented in table 2 also prove that the composite cta pan nanofibers could avoid the swelling condition and become an appropriate candidate for membrane substrates 3 4 fo membrane performance table 3 lists some intrinsic parameters and nacl osmotic flux performance of tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes generally there is no significant difference of transport parameters between tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes within the standard deviation considering the modification was done after the ip process the result can be ascribed to the uniform polyamide layers formed by the careful control of ip process which dominate membrane performance in ro process 36 in addition the modification did not change the substrate structures which proved in the sem images however the osmotic flux performances of two orientations improve after the modification due to less severe icp induced by the improved hydrophilicity of the substrate 14 the fact is that the difference between fo performance is more obvious than ro s also proves that the substrate is more important in fo performance than in ro s tables 1 and 4 summarize some physicochemical properties of the draw solution compared to nacl cos has a much larger mw indicating that the rsf can be negligible to prove our hypothesis the ro experiment was conducted to estimate the rejection to cos and fo experiment was used to measure the rsf of cos it turned out that both tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes had 99 rejections to cos and the existence of cos were hardly detected in the feed solution all these experiments reconfirm that the reverse cos fluxes have reached negligible values 10 mgmh compared to that of nacl around 6 10 gmh the zeta potentials of cos measured by zetasizer also proved that there are some positive charges on cos table 1 also reveals that the kinematic viscosity of the cos draw solution is higher than that of nacl and the diffusion coefficient of the cos draw solution is lower than that of nacl this indicating that icp effect caused by cos might be severer than nacl fig 9 shows the normalized water fluxes jw jw0 of tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes in the al ds the initial water fluxes of tfc cta pan 7 7 lmh and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes 8 2 lmh were higher than those 4 9 and 4 1 lmh respectively in the al fs because of the electrostatic attraction between cos and the polyamide layer cos draw solutes were not easily diluted by the icp effect however both membranes experienced a great flux reduction in the al ds at the early stage of experiment this may also be attributed to the electrostatic attraction that accelerates cos accumulation on the surface of the polyamide layer which acts like fouling layers and therefore increases the permeation resistance furthermore as the flow direction of osmotic water flux is opposite to that of the cos accumulation the osmotic water flux of tfc cta pan dpa pei is higher because of the back flush effect leading to a less water flux reduction of tfc cta pan dpa pei compared to that of tfc cta pan in the al ds according to fig 9 a in the al fs the initial water flux of tfc cta pan 4 9 lmh is a bit higher than that of tfc cta pan dpa pei 4 1 lmh due to the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged cos and the positively charged substrate modified by the dpa pei the osmotic pressure difference of tfc cta pan dpa pei might be slightly lower than that of tfc cta pan after 6 h testing time the normalized osmotic water flux of tfc cta pan decreased sharply to 70 1 while that of tfc cta pan dpa pei decreased only to 87 0 fig 9 b given that there was no draw solution replenishment during the 6 h fo test the diluted draw solution can account for the reduction portion of tfc cta pan dpa pei demonstrating the improved fouling resistance it is acknowledged that the interaction between membranes surface and foulants is the reason that membrane surface fouling occurs 20 35 in this study the presence of abundant amine groups and hydroxyl groups brought by the dpa pei coating can form hydrogen bond with water molecules contributing to significantly enhanced hydrophilicity of tfc cta pan dpa pei surface therefore the bonded water molecules form a thin hydration boundary barrier which restricts the adsorption of cos on tfc cta pan dpa pei surface and reduces the unfavorable interaction between the draw solution and tfc cta pan dpa pei surface 37 at the same time the positively charged cos are electrostatically repelled by the positively charged tfc cta pan dpa pei surface thus preventing cos from attaching easily to tfc cta pan dpa pei bottom surface and mitigate the fouling phenomenon 38 thus the aforementioned two factors the improved hydrophilicity and the electrostatic interaction have great effects upon fo performance based on the results discussed above the possible mechanisms of the interaction between the membranes and the draw solutes can be illustrated in fig 10 in the al ds the positively charged draw solutes have the electrostatic attraction with the negatively charged polyamide layer consequently the higher initial water flux and more severe fouling as followed are obtained in the al fs although the initial water flux of tfc cta pan dpa pei is a little lower than that of tfc cta pan the improved hydrophilicity of tfc cta pan dpa pei and the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged membrane surface and positively charged draw solutes can restrain the attachment of the draw solutes to the surface and mitigate the fouling degree physical washing was further conducted after the 6 h fo test to assess the fouling reversibility of tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei in fig 9 c both two membranes have relatively high normalized water flux 90 after washing which is consistent with fo characteristics of low fouling propensity 39 nevertheless flux recovery ratios of tfc cta pan dpa pei are still higher than those of tfc cta pan and approach nearly 100 indicating the fouling caused by cos on tfc cta pan dpa pei is almost reversible similarly the result that all flux recovery ratios of the al fs are higher than those of the al ds confirms that the presence of the electrostatic attraction between positive charged cos and the negative charged polyamide layer 3 5 draw solution regeneration considering its large mw and positive charge cos can be regenerated by the positively charged nf membranes the detailed information about the preparation and surface morphology of the nf membrane and the procedure of the ds reconcentration by nf is presented in the supporting information table 5 displays the pwp and different kinds of solute rejections for the lab made pei nf membranes notably the rejection of cos slightly decreased from 97 8 94 1 when cos concentration increased from 0 1 100 g l this can be explained by the fact that ecp occurred on the nf membrane surface leading to a higher cos concentration on the membrane surface than the bulk feed concentration 40 therefore more cos permeated through the nf membrane which resulted in a reduction in rejection the special water flux of 100 g l cos was 1 2 0 1 lmh bar in summary cos draw solution can be recovered by nf in view of its low external pressure and high solute rejection the comparison of other fabricated membranes and organic draw solutes are tabulated in table 6 the water flux of tfc cta pan dpa pei is relatively high and the rsf of cos is desirable with relatively low concentration compared to the other reported membranes and organic draw solutes the improved hydrophilic nature and the electrostatic interaction in this work especially under al fs mode with lower fouling degree have great effects upon fo performance generally the introduced utilization of surface charged membranes and draw solution will expand the view of the fo process 4 conclusion in this study the interaction between a surface charged film and a positively charged solute in the fo process was studied and the following conclusions were obtained 1 the three layer composite fo membrane was supported by the hydrophilic hydrophobic composite cta pan nanofibers hydrophilic cta nanofibers were the interlayer and hydrophobic pan nanofibers were placed at the bottom the dpa pei modification on the surface of pan nanofibers with good mechanical properties resulted in an improved surface hydrophilicity and more surface positive charges 2 the tfc cta pan dpa pei membrane with a negatively charged surface on the polyamide side and a positively charged surface on the dpa pei modification side has been fabricated while the positively charged organic cos has been applied as ds the result showed that hydrophilicity and electrostatic repulsion could alleviate the fouling generated by the organic ds while hydrophobicity and electrostatic attraction could aggravate the fouling 3 the positively charged pei nf membrane was used to recover the positively charged cos draw solutes showing a reasonably high pwp and salt rejection rate therefore the overall performance demonstrated that the combined use of surface charged membranes and positively charged cos draw solutes were feasible in fo process application declaration of competing interest the authors declare

the osmotic water flux under the al ds πdraw and πfeed are the average osmotic pressure of the bulk ds and fs during the testing time respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane top surface and cross sectional morphology the surface morphology diameter distributions and pore size distributions of the nanofibers are shown in fig 2 the average nanofiber diameter of the pan nanofibers 407 32 nm is much larger than that of the cta nanofibers 177 48 nm therefore it is understandable that the average pore size of the pan nanofibers 666 33 nm is also larger than that of the cta nanofibers 511 45 nm different from the smooth surface of the pan nanofibers we can observe the modified pan nanofibers surface becomes rougher moreover the voids of the nanofibers almost remain intact after the modification process indicating that the dpa pei coating has little influence on the pore structures of the nanofibers the fig 3 shows the top surface cross sectional morphology of tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes respectively the rough ridge and valley structures are observed on the top of tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes which are the typical polyamide structures the afm results fig 4 also show that there is no distinct morphology difference between these two membranes 3 2 chemical compositions of the membranes fig 5 a shows the atr ftir spectra of the pan nanofibers the cta nanofibers the polyamide layer and the dpa pei coating the characteristic peak of pan at 2244 0 cm 1 belongs to the stretching vibrations of the nitrile groups cn 27 as for cta nanofibers spectra the intense band at 1749 2 cm 1 stretching vibration co of ester 1367 0 cm 1 symmetrical deformation ch3 1232 9 cm 1 and 1037 5 cm 1 stretching vibration co of ester are associated with ester in cta 28 29 unlike pan nanofibers and cta nanofibers a series of bands appear in the range of 1700 1500 cm 1 in the spectra of the nanofiber surface with dpa pei coating 30 the absorbance appears at 1663 0 cm 1 because of the cn groups between dpa and pei 31 the peaks at 1612 6 cm 1 and 1543 1 cm 1 are attributable to the cc stretching vibrations of the aromatic ring and the nh stretching vibrations 32 moreover the polyamide s spectra shows a significant increase in the intensity of the absorption band of 1661 0 cm 1 the amide carbonyl 1610 9 cm 1 the aromatic amide carbonyl and 1541 5 cm 1 the amide amine indicating that the polyamide has been successfully formed 33 in addition the surface element composition of the dpa pei coated membrane was also confirmed by xps fig 5 b the xps spectra display three peaks of c 1s n 1s and o 1s with element contents atomic of 67 81 11 58 and 19 75 respectively the theoretical n o ratio of dpa is 0 5 while it is 1 7 after the dpa pei coating due to the nh groups of pei and the cn groups between pei and dpa fig 6 3 3 zeta potentials water contact angles and mechanical property fig 7 presents the zeta potentials of the membranes under different ph values the zeta potential of the neat pan nanofibers is low indicating that few charges are contained on the surface the surface of the pan nanofibers after dpa pei coating is positively charged when solution ph 7 2 which verifies that the positive sites such as amine groups have been coated onto the surface 32 higher charge density of the substrate has been proved to be favorable for resisting positively charged draw solutes from fouling in the al fs orientation moreover the top surface zeta potential confirms the negatively charged surface of the polyamide side carboxyl groups and the positively charged surface of the pei nf membranes amine groups which is in agreement with the literatures 34 35 fig 8 shows that the initial water contact angles of the membranes and dynamic water contact angle on the dpa pei coating side the initial water contact angles of the nanofibers is 73 on the neat pan nanofibers side while the water contact angles of the cta nanofibers side is decreased to 54 as for the dpa pei coating side not only the initial water contact angles decline to 34 but also the water drop permeates through the membrane and reaches nearly 0 in just 2 s therefore the greatly improved surface wettability of nanofibers after modification can be associated with the hydrophilic nature of the dpa pei which ensures that all the pores are ready for water transport mechanical properties presented in table 2 also prove that the composite cta pan nanofibers could avoid the swelling condition and become an appropriate candidate for membrane substrates 3 4 fo membrane performance table 3 lists some intrinsic parameters and nacl osmotic flux performance of tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes generally there is no significant difference of transport parameters between tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes within the standard deviation considering the modification was done after the ip process the result can be ascribed to the uniform polyamide layers formed by the careful control of ip process which dominate membrane performance in ro process 36 in addition the modification did not change the substrate structures which proved in the sem images however the osmotic flux performances of two orientations improve after the modification due to less severe icp induced by the improved hydrophilicity of the substrate 14 the fact is that the difference between fo performance is more obvious than ro s also proves that the substrate is more important in fo performance than in ro s tables 1 and 4 summarize some physicochemical properties of the draw solution compared to nacl cos has a much larger mw indicating that the rsf can be negligible to prove our hypothesis the ro experiment was conducted to estimate the rejection to cos and fo experiment was used to measure the rsf of cos it turned out that both tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes had 99 rejections to cos and the existence of cos were hardly detected in the feed solution all these experiments reconfirm that the reverse cos fluxes have reached negligible values 10 mgmh compared to that of nacl around 6 10 gmh the zeta potentials of cos measured by zetasizer also proved that there are some positive charges on cos table 1 also reveals that the kinematic viscosity of the cos draw solution is higher than that of nacl and the diffusion coefficient of the cos draw solution is lower than that of nacl this indicating that icp effect caused by cos might be severer than nacl fig 9 shows the normalized water fluxes jw jw0 of tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes in the al ds the initial water fluxes of tfc cta pan 7 7 lmh and tfc cta pan dpa pei membranes 8 2 lmh were higher than those 4 9 and 4 1 lmh respectively in the al fs because of the electrostatic attraction between cos and the polyamide layer cos draw solutes were not easily diluted by the icp effect however both membranes experienced a great flux reduction in the al ds at the early stage of experiment this may also be attributed to the electrostatic attraction that accelerates cos accumulation on the surface of the polyamide layer which acts like fouling layers and therefore increases the permeation resistance furthermore as the flow direction of osmotic water flux is opposite to that of the cos accumulation the osmotic water flux of tfc cta pan dpa pei is higher because of the back flush effect leading to a less water flux reduction of tfc cta pan dpa pei compared to that of tfc cta pan in the al ds according to fig 9 a in the al fs the initial water flux of tfc cta pan 4 9 lmh is a bit higher than that of tfc cta pan dpa pei 4 1 lmh due to the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged cos and the positively charged substrate modified by the dpa pei the osmotic pressure difference of tfc cta pan dpa pei might be slightly lower than that of tfc cta pan after 6 h testing time the normalized osmotic water flux of tfc cta pan decreased sharply to 70 1 while that of tfc cta pan dpa pei decreased only to 87 0 fig 9 b given that there was no draw solution replenishment during the 6 h fo test the diluted draw solution can account for the reduction portion of tfc cta pan dpa pei demonstrating the improved fouling resistance it is acknowledged that the interaction between membranes surface and foulants is the reason that membrane surface fouling occurs 20 35 in this study the presence of abundant amine groups and hydroxyl groups brought by the dpa pei coating can form hydrogen bond with water molecules contributing to significantly enhanced hydrophilicity of tfc cta pan dpa pei surface therefore the bonded water molecules form a thin hydration boundary barrier which restricts the adsorption of cos on tfc cta pan dpa pei surface and reduces the unfavorable interaction between the draw solution and tfc cta pan dpa pei surface 37 at the same time the positively charged cos are electrostatically repelled by the positively charged tfc cta pan dpa pei surface thus preventing cos from attaching easily to tfc cta pan dpa pei bottom surface and mitigate the fouling phenomenon 38 thus the aforementioned two factors the improved hydrophilicity and the electrostatic interaction have great effects upon fo performance based on the results discussed above the possible mechanisms of the interaction between the membranes and the draw solutes can be illustrated in fig 10 in the al ds the positively charged draw solutes have the electrostatic attraction with the negatively charged polyamide layer consequently the higher initial water flux and more severe fouling as followed are obtained in the al fs although the initial water flux of tfc cta pan dpa pei is a little lower than that of tfc cta pan the improved hydrophilicity of tfc cta pan dpa pei and the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged membrane surface and positively charged draw solutes can restrain the attachment of the draw solutes to the surface and mitigate the fouling degree physical washing was further conducted after the 6 h fo test to assess the fouling reversibility of tfc cta pan and tfc cta pan dpa pei in fig 9 c both two membranes have relatively high normalized water flux 90 after washing which is consistent with fo characteristics of low fouling propensity 39 nevertheless flux recovery ratios of tfc cta pan dpa pei are still higher than those of tfc cta pan and approach nearly 100 indicating the fouling caused by cos on tfc cta pan dpa pei is almost reversible similarly the result that all flux recovery ratios of the al fs are higher than those of the al ds confirms that the presence of the electrostatic attraction between positive charged cos and the negative charged polyamide layer 3 5 draw solution regeneration considering its large mw and positive charge cos can be regenerated by the positively charged nf membranes the detailed information about the preparation and surface morphology of the nf membrane and the procedure of the ds reconcentration by nf is presented in the supporting information table 5 displays the pwp and different kinds of solute rejections for the lab made pei nf membranes notably the rejection of cos slightly decreased from 97 8 94 1 when cos concentration increased from 0 1 100 g l this can be explained by the fact that ecp occurred on the nf membrane surface leading to a higher cos concentration on the membrane surface than the bulk feed concentration 40 therefore more cos permeated through the nf membrane which resulted in a reduction in rejection the special water flux of 100 g l cos was 1 2 0 1 lmh bar in summary cos draw solution can be recovered by nf in view of its low external pressure and high solute rejection the comparison of other fabricated membranes and organic draw solutes are tabulated in table 6 the water flux of tfc cta pan dpa pei is relatively high and the rsf of cos is desirable with relatively low concentration compared to the other reported membranes and organic draw solutes the improved hydrophilic nature and the electrostatic interaction in this work especially under al fs mode with lower fouling degree have great effects upon fo performance generally the introduced utilization of surface charged membranes and draw solution will expand the view of the fo process 4 conclusion in this study the interaction between a surface charged film and a positively charged solute in the fo process was studied and the following conclusions were obtained 1 the three layer composite fo membrane was supported by the hydrophilic hydrophobic composite cta pan nanofibers hydrophilic cta nanofibers were the interlayer and hydrophobic pan nanofibers were placed at the bottom the dpa pei modification on the surface of pan nanofibers with good mechanical properties resulted in an improved surface hydrophilicity and more surface positive charges 2 the tfc cta pan dpa pei membrane with a negatively charged surface on the polyamide side and a positively charged surface on the dpa pei modification side has been fabricated while the positively charged organic cos has been applied as ds the result showed that hydrophilicity and electrostatic repulsion could alleviate the fouling generated by the organic ds while hydrophobicity and electrostatic attraction could aggravate the fouling 3 the positively charged pei nf membrane was used to recover the positively charged cos draw solutes showing a reasonably high pwp and salt rejection rate therefore the overall performance demonstrated that the combined use of surface charged membranes and positively charged cos draw solutes were feasible in fo process application declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13899,reduced membrane rejection performance has been a big challenge for the membrane industry when dealing with concentrated complex feed solution in this study a robust mixed matrix membrane mmm of polyimide graphene oxide pi go was systematically fabricated and modified using highly hydrophilic ethylenediamine eda cross linker under control conditions and tested for the recovery of succinate from fermentation broth at increasing feed concentration the effects of membrane evaporation time 30 45 and 60 s and cross linking time 0 1 and 2 h were investigated for achieving a membrane with inherent physicochemical properties of high succinate rejection and separation factor the membrane was also tested for the recovery of succinate from by products solution containing acetate and formate at increasing succinate concentration from 10 to 50 g l the result shows a successful cross linking of pi go membrane using eda with improved hydrophilicity this is reflected in the reduced membrane contact angle and the increased membrane pure water flux to an average of 70 increase at increasing feed solution from 10 to 50 g l the results showed that the cross linking process reduced the dropped in succinate rejection from 33 for 1 h cross linking time to 7 for 2 h cross linking time compared to the non cross linked membrane of 73 dropped in succinate rejection at 2 h cross linking time 91 and 84 succinate rejections were obtained for 10 and 50 g l feed solutions respectively the improved succinate rejection was also reflected in the enhanced membrane selectivity performance however not much effect on succinate recovery was seen for the cross linked membrane fabricated at a different evaporation time this study herein introduces an alternative modification of cross linking process on polymeric membrane in dealing with the enduring problem of reduced membrane performances when elevated succinate concentration was utilised keywords graphene oxide polyimide cross linking membrane filtration succinate fermentation broth 1 introduction succinic acid 1 4 butanedioic acid a dicarboxylic acid with four carbon atoms is one of the 12 chemical building blocks it is of high importance as precursor for synthesising a variety of valuable chemical derivatives succinic acid has been widely used in the food production industry in various roles for example as a catalyst for food seasoning preparation as a flavouring enhancer for beverages and as a bread softening agent 1 traditionally succinic acid was chemically produced from petroleum however in 2004 the us department of energy identified the potential of commercialising the fermentation derived succinic acid 2 it attracted significant interest from the chemical industry worldwide and triggered the manufacturing of succinic acid via biological production from abundant biomass 3 4 unlike chemically produced succinic acid fermentation derived succinic acid has to undergo several steps of separation processes before the final product is obtained one of the separation technologies favoured due to its environment friendly feature is the nanofiltration nf membrane separation process nf recovery process allows minimal to no addition of any aggressive chemical and thus produces no problematic by products and toxic effluents 5 the nf membrane also offers a unique separation principle of selective transport of small ions and molecules based on steric effect size exclusion and electrostatic interaction donnan exclusion which is suitable for low succinic acids having a molecular weight of 118 09 g mol 6 7 in the fermentation process succinic acid could be as well produced in the form of succinate depending on the ph condition of the fermentation process various types of commercial nf membranes have been utilised in the past including polyamide based membrane 6 8 9 commercial poly vinyl alcohol membrane 8 ceramic membrane 10 and polyimide based membrane 11 all membranes have demonstrated high succinic acid succinate rejection of more than 75 performance but the studies focused only on a specific range of feed concentration and composition for example in the studies carried out by choi et al 2008 and sosa et al 2016 the recovery of succinic acid succinate was carried out from feeds of low product concentrations of below 10 g l 6 9 meanwhile in the studies carried out by kang and chang 2005 and khunnonkwao et al 2018 high product concentration of more than 30 g l was utilised but the by product concentrations were relatively low ratio of product by products is more than 5 8 12 these combinations of feed solution usually give reasonably high rejection and separation factor sf due to the diluted condition of the feed and the much lower concentration of the by products compared to the product respectively in contrast as concentrated feed or and low product by products ratio solution relatively high concentration of by products compared to the product were utilised membrane performance started to reduce this is because of the increasing concentration of counter ions ions with different charged compared to that of membrane along with the increasing concentration of feed the increase in counter ion could screen the membrane surface charge which eventually reduces the overall membrane rejection performance at increasing feed concentration 11 13 14 apart from that the presence of high concentration of by products in the feed also influences the solution viscosity density and or diffusivity the increase in viscosity of the solution could result in a reduced diffusion coefficient of the feed solution which is known as a back transport thus solutes tend to accumulate on the membrane surface decreasing the overall membrane rejection performance 15 as a result a typical reduction in flux membrane rejection and selectivity performances were mainly observed at increasing feed concentration this is an important note as to date succinic acid succinate production has been intensified with reported concentration of 4 9 up to 64 2 g l depending on the fermentation process parameters 16 therefore this study provides alternative to the commonly used commercial nf membranes in succinate recovery by developing a nf membrane that could not only achieve high product recovery and selectivity factor at low feed concentration but sustain the membrane rejection performances too as the product and by product concentrations in the feed increases the improvement in the membrane could consequently simplify and reduce the complexity of the downstream processes in this study polyimide graphene oxide pi go nf membrane was selected as a base membrane following on from the successful application of the membrane in concentrated salt removal in a previous study 17 in the initial study of pi membrane application in succinate recovery the membrane demonstrated 90 succinate rejection using simulated broth solution at a low concentration of 10 g l and an operating pressure of 30 bar however a reduction in rejection performance was observed at the elevated feed concentration 11 the membrane was then modified with go incorporation and a reduced reduction in na2so4 salt rejection was observed at increasing na2so4 feed solution this ionisation phenomenon was found to reduce membrane rigidity increase membrane amorphous structure and enhance the effective thickness of membrane thus sustaining membrane rejection performance even at the elevated feed concentration 17 the study reported that the pi go nf membrane demonstrated reasonably stable high salt rejection of 98 even when concentration of salt na2so4 was increased from 5 to 150 mm where a 16 reduction in rejection with pure pi membrane was observed 17 the successful application of pi go mmm in sustaining high na2so4 rejection even at the elevated salt concentration has led to the application of pi go mmm in a high concentration succinate recovery as presented in this study however in this study the further modification by cross linking process using highly hydrophilic cross linker ethylenediamine eda was carried out as cross linking process could prepare the membrane for long term application in concentrated product by product composition via the formation of strong covalent bonds between the polymer chains meanwhile the utilisation of eda ensures that reasonable membrane permeability could be sustained even after the cross linking process in this study cross linking modification method was opted to prepare a membrane for succinate recovery from concentrated feed solution 10 50 g l as well as for succinate solution with a low succinate by product ratio 2 1 the condition of feed solution was selected based on the possible compositions of organic acid salts present in fermentation broth with typical succinate production of 10 100 g l succinate in a mixture reported in previous studies 18 20 as chemical cross linking involves introduction of a strong covalent bonding between the polymer chains in the membrane substructure this method was found suitable to effectively render a membrane with low membrane swelling high resistance towards many solvents and high rejection and selectivity for the targeted compounds 21 23 three key factors governing the membrane flux rejection and selectivity performances at increasing feed solution have been investigated one of the key factors investigated is membrane evaporation time prior to phase inversion process to study the effect of membrane dense thin film on membrane performance time for membrane cross linking and concentration of product feed solution throughout the study eda was used as the cross linker because of its short chain and high hydrophilicity in nature thus minimum cross linking time could be applied all selected range of the variables were chosen based on previous studies that have been carried out on succinate production and recovery using membrane technology 6 24 25 finally the membrane was also tested for its fouling performance and rejection and selectivity of succinate from fermentation broth via the diafiltration mode process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyimide p84 aromatic polymer pi good fellow uk derived from dianhydrides and aromatic diisocyanates and n methyl 2 pyrrolidinone nmp 99 5 merck milipore as a solvent were utilised for membrane fabrication for the pi membrane modification via blending in house manufactured graphene oxide go from graphite aldrich was used other chemicals utilised to oxidise graphite to graphene oxide go were sulphuric acid h2so4 r m chemical phosphoric acid h3po4 r m chemical potassium permanganate kmno4 sigma aldrich and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 r m chemical the synthesis of go was carried out following the method by zaman et al 2018 17 for the membrane cross linking process eda 99 r m chemical was utilised while methanol merch milipore was used as a solvent to dilute the cross linker 2 2 fabrication of pi go mixed matrix membrane mmm an aliquot of 0 9 wt pi go mmm was prepared following on from the good performances obtained from the salt rejection reported in 17 this mmm possessed a mean pore size of 0 53 nm and 37 mv of surface zeta potential from the ionisation of carboxyl groups at the edges of the go nanosheets present in the mmm 17 thus in the preparation of the dope solution of this pi go mmm the go was initially dispersed in nmp by sonication for 1 h followed by the addition of pi polymer for ensuring that a well dispersed go is formed in the membrane matrix the dope solution was then stirred for 24 h at 60 c after which the mixture was sonicated for 30 min and kept at room temperature without stirring for degassing next the dope solution was cast using an automatic film applicator elcometer 4340 elcometer at 150 μm thickness the fabrication parameters of the mmm were selected based on previously reported studies 11 17 as for the effect of evaporation time of the mmm it was varied at 30 45 and 60 s upon immersion in ultrapure up water optimum evaporation time was achieved in the best mmm with specific dense thin layer properties which would highly influence its final performance then liquid liquid demixing mmm was left for 24 h followed by solvent exchange process which the mmm was transferred in 2 propanol 2 proh merck finally the mmm was air dried and stored in desiccator prior to use 2 3 treatment of pi go mmm with eda as a cross linker for the treatment of pi go mmm eda was first prepared at a concentration of 2 5 wt in methanol dry pi go membranes were then immersed in the 2 5 wt eda cross linker at different cross linking times 0 1 and 2 h after the allocated time the cross linked membrane was rinsed with methanol to remove excess cross linker and air dried this process was repeated for pi go membranes prepared at different membrane evaporation times 30 45 and 60 s the eda treatment of pi go mmm was carried out to introduce cross linking between pi chains to ensure membrane performance and structural stability for concentrated succinate recovery in long term applications 2 4 characterisations of eda cross linked pi go membrane 2 4 1 membrane physical and chemical properties the eda cross linked pi go membrane chemical structures were characterised using fourier transform infrared ft ir membranes were scanned with a nicolet 6700 spectrometer thermo fischer scientific equipped with an attenuated total reflectance atr under refection mode for this 4 cm 1 spectral resolutions were utilised and 16 scans with a scan time of 1 min were acquired for wavenumbers between 4000 and 600 cm 1 the resulting spectra were captured and converted into absorbance spectra for the surface wetting characteristics the characterisation was carried out for non and cross linked pi go membranes for which static contact angles ca measurement using a drop shape analysis dsa was employed droplets were imaged at their side views using a microscope lieca z16 apo wetzler germany with imaging capability at long depth of fields water droplets 3 μl were dispensed with a micropipette finnipipette thermo fisher scientific inc waltham usa onto an analysed membrane surface of 5 5 mm2 region eight separate measurements were then carried out and an average contact angle was calculated all images were captured with a high resolution ccd camera pco 1600 kelheim germany and processed the crystalline properties of non and cross linked pi go mmms were characterised using the x ray diffraction xrd technique mmm surfaces of 1 1 cm2 were analysed with a d8 advance x ray diffractometer bruker axs germany under cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm and detected using 1 d fast detector lynx eye the equipment was operated at 40 ma and 40 kv from 5 to 80 with a step size of 0 025 and exposure rate of 0 1 s per step gravimetric analysis was also carried out on the mmm to determine the membrane degree of membrane swelling before and after the cross linking process membrane was initially weighed before swelling and the weight was recorded as m0 the sample was then immersed in the succinate solution for 1 h after which it was removed and the surface water was quickly removed using a filter paper the sample was weighed on an electronic balance as m1 the procedure was repeated until the equilibrium of swelling was reached the swelling ratio mt was calculated using eq 1 1 m t m 1 m 0 m 0 2 4 2 membrane morphologies surface morphologies of the non and cross linked pi go nanosheets were examined with a field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem supra 55 v p zeiss under accelerating voltage of 5 kv samples were initially made electrically conductive using platinum sputter coater quorum q150rs uk all membranes were fractured in liquid nitrogen and mounted on aluminium stubs the cross section images of the membranes were captured at 300 and 10 000 magnifications 2 5 membrane separation performance 2 5 1 synthetic model solutions water and permeate flux of the membrane as well as salt rejection were evaluated using a dead end filtration cell hp4750 stirred cell with a filtration area of 0 00146 m2 purchased from sterlitech usa all work was carried out under an operating pressure of 30 bar 800 rpm stirring speed 25 c and 100 ml of feed volume parameters were selected based on a previous study 11 meanwhile the ph of all mixture solutions containing succinate product formate and acetate by products investigated was set at 7 where succinate was in a divalent form for maximum rejection performance and formate and acetate were in monovalent forms for the preparation of mixture solutions containing succinate formate and acetate the weights of the salts were initially measured using weighing balance the salts were then dissolved in deionised water di in a volumetric flask followed by the addition of the di water up to 1 l the mixture was stirred until all salts were completely dissolved succinate concentration in the mixture solution was varied at 10 30 and 50 g l with a product to by product ratio of 2 1 the ratio was set at constant throughout the study according to the commonly found organic acid salt mixture ratio in the fermentation broth the samples were measured every 10 min for 1 h the flux and rejection performance of the membrane were calculated based on eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 j δ v t a where j is the flux l m2 h v is the volume of the permeate l a is the effective area of the

membrane the separation factor sf of succinate relative to the by products was also calculated using eq 5 to investigate the membrane selectivity towards succinate the equation was expressed by the concentration ratio of the product in the permeate over the concentration ratio of the by product in the retentate feed an sf value higher than 1 indicated that the nf permeate was enriched with succinate low succinate selectivity on the other hand a value lower than 1 corresponded to an enriched retentate high succinate selectivity 26 4 s f c s u c c b y p r o d u c t s p e r m e a t e c s u

values of the membrane using eq 5 5 s f 1 r s u c 1 r b y p r o d u c t s where rsuc is the rejection value of succinate while rby products is the rejection value of by products 2 5 2 actual fermentation broth for the recovery of succinate from the actual fermentation broth performance of the membrane was investigated via diafiltration process for recovering as much succinate as possible and at the same time to remove the unwanted by products diafiltration process mode allows the concentration of samples and minimisation of sample loss and contamination three diafiltration steps were carried out at 30 bar and 800 rpm feed volume of 100 ml was used and kept constant for every refilling with pure water vcf 1 5 the samples were measured every 10 min for 100 min before they were refilled with pure water every experiment continued for 5 h the contribution of fouling to the performance of the membranes was also analysed after the filtration of the fermentation broth pure water was permeated through the membranes for 150 min at 30 bar the irreversible fouling rir and flux recovery ratio frr in of the membranes were determined using eqs 6 and 7 respectively 27 6 r i r j w j w

sunnyvale ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 eda cross linked pi go mmm characterization 3 1 1 chemical properties fig 1 a demonstrates the ft ir spectra of non cross linked pi go mmm and eda cross linked pi go mmm at different cross linking times of 0 1 and 2 h the non cross linked pi go mmm exhibited absorption peaks at 1779 cm 1 asymmetric stretch of co in the imide group 1721 cm 1 symmetric stretching of co in the imide group and 1335 cm 1 stretching of cn in the imide group 28 meanwhile for amide bands absorption peaks are referred to at 1650 cm 1 co and 1540 cm 1 cn stretching and cnh group dark blue and light blue areas are designated for both imide and amide bands respectively from blue coloured areas it can be clearly seen that the amide peaks become stronger in intensity while the imide peaks are decreasing which signifies that the cross linking has effectively occurred 28 the increase and reduction in intensity of imide and amide characteristic peaks respectively can be clearly seen with the longest cross linking time of 2 h this is due to more cross linking agent penetrating into the porous structure and thin skin layer of the pi go asymmetric mmm at increasing cross linking time for the reaction to take place 23 the replacement of imide with amide groups and the increase in amide intensity indicate an increase in membrane hydrophilicity because of the property of the highly water soluble polar compounds of amide c o nh2 29 the finite hydration number per functional group n h of ca 6 which implies the formation of hydrogen bonds between the polar groups and water molecules strongly suggests that amide is a truly hydrophilic compound compared to imide 29 an increase in the hydrophilicity of the pi go mmm via cross linking process is expected to increase the membrane permeability without compromising the mmm rejection performance towards succinate at increasing feed concentration 11 fig 1b was also plotted for determining the interactions of eda with the pi go mmm from fig 1 b it can be seen that the cross linking mainly occurred between the pi polymer chains rather than the incorporated go nanosheets this was indicated by the absorption peak at 3300 cm 1 that exhibits the stretching of hydroxyl groups oh thus after the cross linking of eda with pi go mmm this peak is still present as in the non cross linked pi go mmm the intact peak of hydroxyl group indicates that only minimum or no reaction between amine monomers and oxygen containing functional groups of go had occurred if the reaction occurred a decrease in the absorption peak of the hydroxyl group at 3300 cm 1 would be observed because of the condensation reaction between amine and hydroxyl groups generating cn covalent bonds 30 go is believed to have only formed hydrogen bonding interactions with the pi polymer as presented and discussed by the authors in 17 shifts in peaks from the hydrogen bonding interactions were observed between cn and co bonds of pi and surface group of go 17 the schematic diagram and proposed cross linking structure of eda cross linked pi go mmm were also presented in fig 2 the formation of strong covalent bonds between polymer chains is expected to increase the rigidity crystallinity of the membrane improving the membrane rejection performances towards succinate at elevated feed concentration which will be discussed in the following sections moreover based on the figure the increase in peak intensity at 3300 cm 1 observed with cross linking process may indicate the presence of eda in the pi go mmm as the increase in the peak may also be attributed to the nh group other than the oh group as discussed above 31 therefore this suggests the successful eda cross linking process between pi chains in the pi go membrane further supporting the discussion in the previous paragraph 3 1 2 membrane water affinity eda cross linked pi go mmm water affinity was investigated to explore the influence of eda cross linking on the membrane hydrophilicity in this study membranes at different evaporation times 30 45 and 60 s were cross linked using eda at different times of 0 1 and 2 h fig 3 shows that at 0 h cross linking time pure pi go mmm with increasing evaporation time from 30 to 60 s membrane contact angle increases from 68 95 to 74 40 this may be because of the increasing density of polymer at the membrane top layer at increasing evaporation times prior to immersion of the cast films in the water bath a more volatile solvent can evaporate from the surface of the cast film therefore the dry phase separated region with elevated polymer concentration at the top of the film increases resulting in a top layer having more concentrated polymer 32 it is important to note that the wettability of the membrane is also influenced by the membrane material as well as the membrane surface porosity and roughness 33 at similar composition and materials the increase in pi go mmm contact angle with evaporation time may be attributed to the decreased surface porosity this consequently leads to the reduction in membrane hydrophilicity as presented in fig 3 as the membrane was cross linked it shows a reduction in contact angle values with the increase in cross linking time regardless of its evaporation times of cast films prior to immersion in water bath this may be due to the increasing formation of amide groups that replaced the imide groups present on the membrane surface refer fig 2a since amide is more hydrophilic in nature than imide group the cross linked membrane shows a higher hydrophilicity property lower contact angle that could contribute to higher membrane water permeability 30 fig 3 also demonstrates that overall the contact angles of membranes at the shortest evaporation time of 30 s were the lowest regardless of the cross linking time which may be related to the concentration of the polymer on the membrane top layer as discussed in the previous paragraph membrane cast at the shortest evaporation time 30 s may possess the least concentrated top skin layer as reported in a previous study 32 this allows the cross linking agent to easily penetrate across the pi go mmm sub layer and induces more cross linking reaction across the membrane which results in the lowest contact angle values however as the membrane evaporation time increases to 45 and 60 s the contact angles obtained at increasing cross linking times were higher compared to that of the membrane fabricated with 30 s evaporation time fig 3 the reduction in membrane porosity with increasing membrane evaporation time may induce difficulties for the cross linking agent to penetrate across the membrane 34 therefore higher contact angle values were observed for the membranes 3 1 3 morphology of cross linked pi go mmm the effect of cross linking time on membrane morphology was also investigated as presented in fig 4 the figure shows the surface and cross sectional morphologies of pi go mmm 45 s evaporation time at different magnification sizes 3000 and 30 000 and cross linking times of 0 1 and 2 h from the morphological images significant changes on the surface of the membrane can be observed fig 4a c i for instance the membrane surface roughness has increased with increasing cross linking time the changes in the cross linked membrane surface morphologies are probably caused by the clusters of the attached cross linking molecules generated by the cross linking agents 35 the influence of surface roughness and solute rejection has been described as rapid valley clogging mechanism 36 this mechanism describes that increasing membrane surface roughness could increase the surface area of which solute could accumulate and interact consequently the enhancement in the effective surface area contributes to the increase in membrane rejection performances 36 nevertheless the observed changes further confirm the successful cross linking of pi go mmm with eda and are in agreement with previous studies 23 35 in addition fesem images also show that the cross linking took place not only on top of the membrane surface but also in the sub layer of the membrane fig 4 b c iii these figures demonstrate the presence of a dense top layer on top of the membrane surface however the thickness of the dense top layer was reduced with an increase in cross linking time from 1 to 2 h indicated by the red line gap in the images b and c iii at 2 h cross linking time the thickness of the top layer was not significantly visible at 30 000 magnification however an image with a higher magnification than 30 000 could not be produced by the fesem the observation is believed to be due to the two step process that usually occurs during membrane cross linking which are i the swelling of a membrane by methanol followed by ii the diffusion of cross linking molecules across the membrane structure at a short cross linking time there is a possibility of insufficient swelling of the membrane caused by methanol in the eda methanol mixture which could hinder the penetration of the cross linking agent into the membrane therefore most of the cross linking reactions may take place at the surface of the membrane resulting in a formation of a thicker thin dense layer 23 as shown in fig 4b than the layer shown in fig 4c the observation is also supported by the ftir spectra presented in fig 2 and the contact angle analysis tabulated in fig 3 from the ftir spectra an increase in cross linking time from 1 to 2 h has reduced the characteristic peak height of imide on the other hand the characteristic peak height of amide groups increased progressively this confirms that cross linking reaction had taken place across the membrane after 1 h cross linking time the contact angle also exhibits reducing values with increasing cross linking time validating the morphology of the membrane obtained nevertheless 1 h cross linking time is found sufficient to achieve a membrane with good stability in common solvents a simple solvent stability test performed on the membrane has found that no reduction in membrane weight was observed after soaking it in dmf for two weeks indicating its stability for non cross linked membrane the immersion of membrane in dmf resulted in dissolution after a few hours unlike the cross linked membrane in which the membrane was still intact even after two week immersion in the dmf solution 3 1 4 effect of cross linking time on d spacing of pi go mmmspacing of pi go mmm fig 5 shows the xrd diffraction patterns of pi go mmm at various cross linking times from 0 to 2 h the increase in cross linking time shifted the 2θ value to the right indicating a bigger diffraction angle than by the pure pi go mmm from the maximum 2θ value of the broad peaks the average inter chain distances d spacing values can be calculated using bragg s law d λ 2 sin θ although d spacing cannot be used as a true inter chain distance the changes of d spacing can be taken as an indicator of the amount of free volume available for the penetration of small molecules and diffusion across the membranes 37 therefore the smaller the inter chain distances the smaller the size of molecules that could penetrate across the membrane the inter chain distance ordered packing represents the interaction and distance between dianhydrides and diamines in the pi chemical structure as reported in previous studies 17 38 39 the pure pi go mmm without cross linking demonstrated d spacing values of 0 48 and 0 36 nm representing the peak of inter chain order packing and π π stacking respectively at 1 h cross linking time there is not much difference in the d spacing values compared to the non cross linked membrane however as the cross linking time increased to 2 h the d spacing values were seen to reduce at the respective value of 0 40 and 0 34 nm for inter chain order packing and π π stacking the reductions of the membrane d spacing values indicate that the membrane free volume has reduced free volume refers to the amount of space available for penetrating small molecules through membranes this may be resulted from the cross linking networking effect of eda molecules in between the polymer chains that increased the chain packing density a similar result was also reported in previous studies 30 37 from the characterisations of the eda cross linked pi go mmm the membrane demonstrated successful cross linking with the eda the changes in cross linking time and membrane evaporation time were seen positively affecting the overall properties of the membrane in terms of membrane hydrophilicity and membrane d spacing the reduced contact angle and d spacing from the cross linking process could benefit the recovery process of succinate from the fermentation broth by increasing the permeability of the membrane but still sustaining the membrane rejection performance 3 2 separation performance measurement generally the studies on membrane performances are investigated based on the product recovery rejection performance and or membrane productivity permeability pure water flux performance this study investigated the fabrication of eda cross linked pi go mmm focusing on the membrane performance on the recovery of succinate when increasing the concentration of feed solution from 10 to 50 g l and not on its productivity this is because of the perennial common problems of reducing membrane performances with increasing feed concentration nevertheless the study on the membrane permeability was also presented from the evaluation of pure water flux and its relationship with eda usage during membrane modification in terms of the mmm performance 3 2 1 pure water flux permeation pure water permeation of pi go mmm was calculated using eq 2 as shown in fig 6 the membrane pure water flux increases with cross linking time regardless of the evaporation time utilised during membrane fabrication the highest membrane pure water flux of 33 l m2 h was observed for the membrane with 2 h cross linking time and 30 s evaporation time the enhancement in pure water flux is because of the improvement in membrane contact angle from the replacement of imide by the high hydrophilic amide group fig 2 thus making the membrane more hydrophilic fig 3 from fig 6 it can also be found that when increasing membrane evaporation time from 45 to 60 s the resultant increase in cross linking time from 1 to 2 h has not affected the membrane pure water flux much unlike in the case of the membrane fabricated at 30 s evaporation time with the highest pure water flux being obtained at 33 l m2 h a similar result was also found for the contact angle values of the membranes fig 3 the unchanged trend observed indicates that membrane may have undergone optimum changes in membrane structure at 45 s evaporation time changes in membrane structure at above 45 s evaporation time were not significant to influence the membrane contact angle and subsequently membrane pure water flux even though improvement in the membrane pure water flux was observed the overall pure water flux was still low in the mmm compared to that in the commercial nf membranes which requires further investigation the low flux performance for the pi membrane may possibly be because of the general pi p84 membrane structure comprising compact chain packing 40 it was also observed that even though the presence of eda cross linker increases the membrane hydrophilicty based on the increase in membrane contact angle and its effect on the membrane productivity may not be as significant as the formation of amide linkage from the cross linking process that reduces the interstitial space between the polymer chains thus resulting in very low membrane flux performance 23 nonetheless the increase in hydrophilicity of membrane has benefited the rejection performance of the mmm 3 2 2 succinate recovery and selectivity following the results on the membrane permeation in section 3 2 1 only two significant parameters of membrane cross linking time and feed solution concentration were used to establish the recovery of succinate from the by products of formate and acetate the recovery of succinate was qualitatively determined based on the rejection percentage calculated using eq 3 meanwhile the selectivity of succinate over by products was qualitatively determined using eq 5 from the difference in rejections between the product and by products which denoted as separation factor sf the low value of sf near to 0 indicates a high selectivity of membrane towards succinate while sf near to 1 indicates low succinate selectivity 3 2 2 1 effect of cross linking time on succinate rejection and sf fig 7 shows the plot of succinate formate and acetate rejection percentage over 1 h filtration time for membrane cross linked at a 0 b 1 and c 2 h a membrane with 30 s evaporation time was utilised in this study recovering succinate from a mixture solution containing 30 g l succinate and 15 g l acetate and formate it can be observed from fig 7 a that the result obtained is as expected the rejection of succinate reduces significantly from 93 8 33 8 as filtration time progresses up to 1 h however when the membrane was cross linked with eda the reduction in succinate rejection for 1 h filtration time was minimised as presented in fig 7b 3 drop in succinate rejection and fig 7c 5 drop in succinate rejection 41 generally solute and water transport across a polymeric membrane depends on the water accessible open space in a membrane polymer structure which can be altered by a cross linking process 42 therefore the improvement in membrane performance in terms of minimisation of succinate rejection reduction fig 7 at increasing cross linking time can be said to be because of several changes in the membrane properties after the cross linking process with eda these include i the reduced interstitial space and ii the densification of the membrane from prolonging cross linking time when the membrane is cross linked the rigidity of the membrane polymer chains increases while the presence of percolated free volume for solute and water transport reduces 42 these changes in membrane structure induce higher stearic resistance for big molecules to pass through the membrane allowing only small molecules across the membrane it is important to note that at high concentration of feed the transfer of charged solute mainly depends on the steric hindrance effects rather than the electrostatic repulsions caused by the screening effect of the membrane surface charge the observation was also supported by the xrd analysis presented in fig 5 the results show that the increase in cross linking time has reduced the d spacing of the membrane indicating a more densified membrane proven by the fesem results fig 4 and a previous study 23 according to qiao and chung 2006 the cross linking process creates a hole filling and networking effect of the cross linker molecules in between the polymer chains that could increase the rigidity of the chain structure an increase in rigidity further raised the selectivity of water over salt as confirmed in by geise et al 2011 43 which consequently increased the rejection of the membrane similar results were also reported in previous studies 23 30 meanwhile it can also be observed that for the cross linked membrane a negative rejection was observed for formate and acetate this phenomenon of negative rejection for the monovalent anions can be explained based on the distribution coefficient theory proposed by kang and chang 2005 distribution coefficient is defined as the ratio of the concentration at the membrane phase and the bulk concentration which is mainly influenced by the concentration ratio between the mono and divalent ions co ions and the membrane surface charge as the concentration ratio increases and the membrane surface charge decreases a high distribution coefficient 1 of monovalent ion is obtained indicating that the concentration of monovalent ion is higher at the membrane phase compared to the bulk concentration which leads to the negative rejection 8 the high distribution coefficient of monovalent ions is believed to be the result of the monovalent ions replacing the divalent ions at the membrane phase because of the higher electro electrostatic repulsion of the higher charge divalent ion to keep the membrane phase electrically neutral this therefore results in the increase in monovalent ion concentration in the membrane phase compared to the bulk phase which explains the negative rejection of formate and acetate as observed in fig 7 9 44 however the negative rejection has not been observed for the non cross linked membrane which could be because of the reduced rejection performance of the membrane observed at the 1 h rejection period similarly the membrane also shows an increase in selectivity of succinate formate and succinate acetate reduced sf with increasing cross linking time this can be denoted by the large difference between rejection percentage of succinate and that of formate and acetate as presented in fig 7 the sf values of succinate formate and succinate acetate at 0 h cross linking time of 0 59 and 0 71 respectively reduced to 0 24 and 0 34 at 1 h cross linking time and further to 0 19 to 0 30 at 2 h cross linking time one of the reasons for the observed results could be the reduction in membrane swelling by which cross linking introduced limited solute accessible volume representing the available space for solute to pass through the membrane 45 fig 8 shows that the swelling of the membrane decreases with increasing cross linking time regardless of the membrane evaporation time a cross linking time of 2 h shows the highest reduction in swelling of around 1 0 70 and 0 69 g g respectively for 30 45 and 60 s membrane evaporation times refer fig 8 in general the cross linked membrane usually demonstrates a low water uptake because of the restriction in polymer chain movement from the reaction process between the cross linking agent and the membrane polymer the restriction of polymer chain movement during the filtration process of salt solution to accommodate the size of the divalent succinate ions in a cross linked membrane could sustain the membrane rejection and selectivity performances over time 46 however quantitative analysis on the size of succinate formate and acetate ions in relation to the membrane pore size was not performed in this study nevertheless based on the higher charge of the divalent succinate anions compared to that of monovalent formate and acetate anions succinate would still result in higher rejection and selectivity 47 48 according to shen et al 2016 besides the size of a solute ions their transport across a membrane also depends on the electrostatic interaction of the ion and water as some of water molecules need to be shed for allowing the ions to permeate across the membrane 42 therefore being a divalent anion water molecules bind more tightly to the succinate ions compared to that of monovalent formate and acetate making it hard to shed the hydrogen bonded water molecules to pass into and through the membrane 42 this phenomenon thus increases the membrane rejection and selectivity at increasing cross linking time because of the increased permeation restriction from the cross linking process the highest selectivity was obtained at 2 h cross linking time for all membranes fig 7c in contrast for a non cross linked membrane when a solution entered the membrane it was postulated that the polymer chains could move further apart increasing the overall volume of the membrane hung et al 2014 observed this phenomenon with go the spacing between go layers was seen expanding in the presence of 90 wt ethanol water solution because of the destroyed π π interactions resulting in reduced membrane selectivity for preventing the expansion in go layers cross linking to the go layers was introduced 30 therefore in summary the high rejection and selectivity of membrane can be said to be because of the restricted movement of the polymer chains as the pi go mmm has been cross linked with eda reduced d spacing property refer to xrd fig 5 and restricted movement of succinate ion caused by its strong ion water interaction compared to that of formate and aceate meanwhile for non cross linked membrane the sorbed water may have disrupted the polymer s crystallinity over time this resulted in a gradual increase in water sorption of the pi go mmm consequently a reduction in the rejection and selectivity of the membrane is observed as observed in a previous study 49 3 2 2 2 effect of feed concentration on succinate rejection overall for a non cross linked membrane 0 h cross linking time fig 9 a significant reduction in membrane performance was observed when the succinate concentration was increased from 10 to 50 g l the succinate rejection reduced by 73 from 89 to 24 with the increase in succinate concentration fig 9a this result has also affected the selectivity of membrane towards succinate indicated by the increase of sfs from 0 38 to 0 73 for succinate formate and from 0 47 to 0 80 for succinate acetate further suggesting a reduction in succinate selectivity table 1 interestingly as the membrane was cross linked at increasing time from 0 to 2 h the drop in reduction of succinate rejection was significantly reduced when the concentration of feed solution was increased from 10 to 50 g l at 1 h cross linking time the drop in reduction of succinate rejection was reduced from 73 to 33 in which 98 of succinate rejection was obtained at 10 g l and 66 of succinate rejection was obtained at 50 g l as the cross linking time was increased to 2 h a further drop in reduction of succinate rejection of 7 was observed in which 91 and 84 of succinate rejection were obtained at 10 and 50 g l solution respectively however for membrane selectivity no specific trend was observed nevertheless all membranes demonstrated improved selectivity and the sf reduced closer to 0 with increasing cross linking time regardless of the succinate concentration used in the mixture during filtration the phenomenon of only a slight drop in membrane rejection performance with increasing feed for cross linked membrane can be caused by the reduced d spacing in the membrane increased rigidity of membrane polymer chains and or reduced membrane water uptake swelling with increasing cross linking time 46 as discussed in detail in section 3 2 2 1 3 2 2 3 diafiltration of fermentation broth prior to the diafiltration process an analysis of the fermentation broth produced from the oil palm frond hydrolysate that was obtained from the collaborated research team of the university kebangsaan malaysia ukm malaysia was conducted 50 the broth was determined to consist of 35 g l succinate 7 g l formate and 9 g l acetate because malaysia is ranked as the second top producer of palm oil and generates abundant oil palm waste the utilisation of the waste for the production of succinic acid is believed to contribute to the sustainable production of bio succinic acid fig 10 shows the results of the diafiltration experiment it contains the volumetric flux and vcf profile using eda cross linked pi go mmm the figure reveals that the initial flux of the membrane is around 17 75 l m2 h which is two times lower than the pure water flux 33 l m2 h the lower initial flux could be due to the complex composition of the fermentation broth which generated high osmotic pressure during the filtration process this therefore reduces the mass transfer driving force as supported by sosa et al 2016 6 with time and at increasing vcf the flux continued to decrease until it reached a value of 12 l m2 h immediately upon refilling the cell with water the flux increased to a value of 20 05 l m2 h overall during the 300 minutes operation time vcf was found to be in the range of 1 1 7 with flux values above 12 29 l m2 h in this study the vcf indicates the extent of succinate concentration evaluation of the rejection of succinate formate and acetate was also conducted on the samples that were taken every 10 min during the experiments the obtained data is presented in fig 11 data revealed that the rejections of succinate took place in the range of 70 86 and continued to increase with time meanwhile the rejection of formate and acetate continued to decrease with time reaching close to 40 and 10 respectively the reduced rejection of formate and acetate indicates the low remaining levels of both carboxylates in the retentate overall it was observed that the membrane rejections tend to decrease with increasing vcf which is in agreement with findings from previous studies 6 8 the final sf of eda cross linked pi go mmm for succinate formate and succinate acetate was around 0 34 and 0 21 respectively compared to the experimental results obtained from model solutions 81 25 from model solution a comparable rejection performance was observed however the selectivity of succinate formate was slightly reduced when the broth was used as the feed this was observed from the higher sf obtained 0 34 sf from broth 0 17 sf from model solution the reduced selectivity of succinate formate may be due to higher formate initial concentration compared to that of acetate in the broth in the model solution similar initial concentrations of monovalent anions were used the difference in initial concentration of anions may have affected the interaction between the anions and the anions with the membrane matrix which also affected the mobility of the ions across the membrane 51 however further evaluation is required to understand the behaviour and interaction of divalent monovalent anions with varying concentrations in broth in addition to that tendency of membrane fouling was also examined after the filtration process of the fermentation broth this was done by evaluating the membrane using pure water recovery fig 11 b revealed that the membrane experienced an irreversible fouling rir of less than 4 and flux recovery ratio frr of nearly 96 which is a good indication of the membrane having relatively low fouling tendency the membrane fouling properties were calculated using eqs 5 and 6 4 conclusions the long term problem of reduced membrane performances at increasing feed concentration was successfully addressed by conducting eda cross linking of pi go mmm at various cross linking times and membrane evaporation times this was assessed at different feed concentrations the cross linking of pi go mmm using eda was a success which was confirmed by the ftir result from the conversion of amide into imide peaks and the intensification of the peaks with increasing cross linking time the cross linked membranes also exhibited remarkable improvement in membrane hydrophilicity which improved membrane water permeation and reduced membrane swelling and d spacing the cross linking of pi go mmm with eda also resulted in good membrane performances the reduction in succinate rejection at high feed concentration was successfully minimised the reduction in succinate rejection was reduced from 73 non cross linked mmm to 33 at 1 h cross linking time this was then further reduced to 7 at 2 h cross linking time when succinate concentration was increased from 10 to 50 g l the success of eda cross linking of pi go mmm was also reflected in the improved separation factor of succinate over formate and acetate further evaluation of the eda cross linked membrane using actual fermentation broth also demonstrated promising results the membrane exhibited high succinate rejection performance of up to 86 with sf of 0 34 for succinate formate and 0 21 for succinate acetate the membrane also shows fouling tendency with rir and frr of less than 4 and nearly 96 respectively to recapitulate the successful enhancement of membrane properties of improved separation and selectivity performance in succinate recovery from concentrated feed solutions allows for the cleaner production of succinate the improved membrane properties enable high succinate recovery consequently minimising recovery stages and intensifying the overall process the improved fouling property and solvent resistant property also result into an increase in membrane lifetime declaration of competing interest the authors

13899,reduced membrane rejection performance has been a big challenge for the membrane industry when dealing with concentrated complex feed solution in this study a robust mixed matrix membrane mmm of polyimide graphene oxide pi go was systematically fabricated and modified using highly hydrophilic ethylenediamine eda cross linker under control conditions and tested for the recovery of succinate from fermentation broth at increasing feed concentration the effects of membrane evaporation time 30 45 and 60 s and cross linking time 0 1 and 2 h were investigated for achieving a membrane with inherent physicochemical properties of high succinate rejection and separation factor the membrane was also tested for the recovery of succinate from by products solution containing acetate and formate at increasing succinate concentration from 10 to 50 g l the result shows a successful cross linking of pi go membrane using eda with improved hydrophilicity this is reflected in the reduced membrane contact angle and the increased membrane pure water flux to an average of 70 increase at increasing feed solution from 10 to 50 g l the results showed that the cross linking process reduced the dropped in succinate rejection from 33 for 1 h cross linking time to 7 for 2 h cross linking time compared to the non cross linked membrane of 73 dropped in succinate rejection at 2 h cross linking time 91 and 84 succinate rejections were obtained for 10 and 50 g l feed solutions respectively the improved succinate rejection was also reflected in the enhanced membrane selectivity performance however not much effect on succinate recovery was seen for the cross linked membrane fabricated at a different evaporation time this study herein introduces an alternative modification of cross linking process on polymeric membrane in dealing with the enduring problem of reduced membrane performances when elevated succinate concentration was utilised keywords graphene oxide polyimide cross linking membrane filtration succinate fermentation broth 1 introduction succinic acid 1 4 butanedioic acid a dicarboxylic acid with four carbon atoms is one of the 12 chemical building blocks it is of high importance as precursor for synthesising a variety of valuable chemical derivatives succinic acid has been widely used in the food production industry in various roles for example as a catalyst for food seasoning preparation as a flavouring enhancer for beverages and as a bread softening agent 1 traditionally succinic acid was chemically produced from petroleum however in 2004 the us department of energy identified the potential of commercialising the fermentation derived succinic acid 2 it attracted significant interest from the chemical industry worldwide and triggered the manufacturing of succinic acid via biological production from abundant biomass 3 4 unlike chemically produced succinic acid fermentation derived succinic acid has to undergo several steps of separation processes before the final product is obtained one of the separation technologies favoured due to its environment friendly feature is the nanofiltration nf membrane separation process nf recovery process allows minimal to no addition of any aggressive chemical and thus produces no problematic by products and toxic effluents 5 the nf membrane also offers a unique separation principle of selective transport of small ions and molecules based on steric effect size exclusion and electrostatic interaction donnan exclusion which is suitable for low succinic acids having a molecular weight of 118 09 g mol 6 7 in the fermentation process succinic acid could be as well produced in the form of succinate depending on the ph condition of the fermentation process various types of commercial nf membranes have been utilised in the past including polyamide based membrane 6 8 9 commercial poly vinyl alcohol membrane 8 ceramic membrane 10 and polyimide based membrane 11 all membranes have demonstrated high succinic acid succinate rejection of more than 75 performance but the studies focused only on a specific range of feed concentration and composition for example in the studies carried out by choi et al 2008 and sosa et al 2016 the recovery of succinic acid succinate was carried out from feeds of low product concentrations of below 10 g l 6 9 meanwhile in the studies carried out by kang and chang 2005 and khunnonkwao et al 2018 high product concentration of more than 30 g l was utilised but the by product concentrations were relatively low ratio of product by products is more than 5 8 12 these combinations of feed solution usually give reasonably high rejection and separation factor sf due to the diluted condition of the feed and the much lower concentration of the by products compared to the product respectively in contrast as concentrated feed or and low product by products ratio solution relatively high concentration of by products compared to the product were utilised membrane performance started to reduce this is because of the increasing concentration of counter ions ions with different charged compared to that of membrane along with the increasing concentration of feed the increase in counter ion could screen the membrane surface charge which eventually reduces the overall membrane rejection performance at increasing feed concentration 11 13 14 apart from that the presence of high concentration of by products in the feed also influences the solution viscosity density and or diffusivity the increase in viscosity of the solution could result in a reduced diffusion coefficient of the feed solution which is known as a back transport thus solutes tend to accumulate on the membrane surface decreasing the overall membrane rejection performance 15 as a result a typical reduction in flux membrane rejection and selectivity performances were mainly observed at increasing feed concentration this is an important note as to date succinic acid succinate production has been intensified with reported concentration of 4 9 up to 64 2 g l depending on the fermentation process parameters 16 therefore this study provides alternative to the commonly used commercial nf membranes in succinate recovery by developing a nf membrane that could not only achieve high product recovery and selectivity factor at low feed concentration but sustain the membrane rejection performances too as the product and by product concentrations in the feed increases the improvement in the membrane could consequently simplify and reduce the complexity of the downstream processes in this study polyimide graphene oxide pi go nf membrane was selected as a base membrane following on from the successful application of the membrane in concentrated salt removal in a previous study 17 in the initial study of pi membrane application in succinate recovery the membrane demonstrated 90 succinate rejection using simulated broth solution at a low concentration of 10 g l and an operating pressure of 30 bar however a reduction in rejection performance was observed at the elevated feed concentration 11 the membrane was then modified with go incorporation and a reduced reduction in na2so4 salt rejection was observed at increasing na2so4 feed solution this ionisation phenomenon was found to reduce membrane rigidity increase membrane amorphous structure and enhance the effective thickness of membrane thus sustaining membrane rejection performance even at the elevated feed concentration 17 the study reported that the pi go nf membrane demonstrated reasonably stable high salt rejection of 98 even when concentration of salt na2so4 was increased from 5 to 150 mm where a 16 reduction in rejection with pure pi membrane was observed 17 the successful application of pi go mmm in sustaining high na2so4 rejection even at the elevated salt concentration has led to the application of pi go mmm in a high concentration succinate recovery as presented in this study however in this study the further modification by cross linking process using highly hydrophilic cross linker ethylenediamine eda was carried out as cross linking process could prepare the membrane for long term application in concentrated product by product composition via the formation of strong covalent bonds between the polymer chains meanwhile the utilisation of eda ensures that reasonable membrane permeability could be sustained even after the cross linking process in this study cross linking modification method was opted to prepare a membrane for succinate recovery from concentrated feed solution 10 50 g l as well as for succinate solution with a low succinate by product ratio 2 1 the condition of feed solution was selected based on the possible compositions of organic acid salts present in fermentation broth with typical succinate production of 10 100 g l succinate in a mixture reported in previous studies 18 20 as chemical cross linking involves introduction of a strong covalent bonding between the polymer chains in the membrane substructure this method was found suitable to effectively render a membrane with low membrane swelling high resistance towards many solvents and high rejection and selectivity for the targeted compounds 21 23 three key factors governing the membrane flux rejection and selectivity performances at increasing feed solution have been investigated one of the key factors investigated is membrane evaporation time prior to phase inversion process to study the effect of membrane dense thin film on membrane performance time for membrane cross linking and concentration of product feed solution throughout the study eda was used as the cross linker because of its short chain and high hydrophilicity in nature thus minimum cross linking time could be applied all selected range of the variables were chosen based on previous studies that have been carried out on succinate production and recovery using membrane technology 6 24 25 finally the membrane was also tested for its fouling performance and rejection and selectivity of succinate from fermentation broth via the diafiltration mode process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyimide p84 aromatic polymer pi good fellow uk derived from dianhydrides and aromatic diisocyanates and n methyl 2 pyrrolidinone nmp 99 5 merck milipore as a solvent were utilised for membrane fabrication for the pi membrane modification via blending in house manufactured graphene oxide go from graphite aldrich

hydrogen peroxide h2o2 r m chemical the synthesis of go was carried out following the method by zaman et al 2018 17 for the membrane cross linking process eda 99 r m chemical was utilised while methanol merch milipore was used as a solvent to dilute the cross linker 2 2 fabrication of pi go mixed matrix membrane mmm an aliquot of 0 9 wt pi go mmm was prepared following on from the good performances obtained from the salt rejection reported in 17 this mmm possessed a mean pore size of 0 53 nm and 37 mv of surface zeta potential from the ionisation of carboxyl groups at the edges of the go nanosheets present in the mmm 17 thus in the preparation of the dope solution of this pi go mmm the go was initially dispersed in nmp by sonication for 1 h followed by the addition of pi polymer for ensuring that a well dispersed go is formed in the membrane matrix the dope solution was then stirred for 24 h at 60 c after which the mixture was sonicated for 30 min and kept at room temperature without stirring for degassing next the dope solution was cast using an automatic film applicator elcometer 4340 elcometer at 150 μm thickness the fabrication parameters of the mmm were selected based on previously reported studies 11 17 as for the effect of evaporation time of the mmm it was varied at 30 45 and 60 s upon immersion in ultrapure up water optimum evaporation time was achieved in the best mmm with specific dense thin layer properties which would highly influence its final performance then liquid liquid demixing mmm was left for 24 h followed by solvent exchange process which the mmm was transferred in 2 propanol 2 proh merck finally the mmm was air dried and stored in desiccator prior to use 2 3 treatment of pi go mmm with eda as a cross linker for the treatment of pi go mmm eda was first prepared at a concentration of 2 5 wt in methanol dry pi go membranes were then immersed in the 2 5 wt eda cross linker at different cross linking times 0 1 and 2 h after the allocated time the cross linked membrane was rinsed with methanol to remove excess cross linker and air dried this process was repeated for pi go membranes prepared at different membrane evaporation times 30 45 and 60 s the eda treatment of pi go mmm was carried out to introduce cross linking between pi chains to ensure membrane performance and structural stability for concentrated succinate recovery in long term applications 2 4 characterisations of eda cross linked pi go membrane 2 4 1 membrane physical and chemical properties the eda cross linked pi go membrane chemical structures were characterised using fourier transform infrared ft ir membranes were scanned with a nicolet 6700 spectrometer thermo fischer scientific equipped with an attenuated total reflectance atr under refection mode for this 4 cm 1 spectral resolutions were utilised and 16 scans with a scan time of 1 min were acquired for wavenumbers between 4000 and 600 cm 1 the resulting spectra were captured and converted into absorbance spectra for the surface wetting characteristics the characterisation was carried out for non and cross linked pi go membranes for which static contact angles ca measurement using a drop shape analysis dsa was employed droplets were imaged at their side views using a microscope lieca z16 apo wetzler germany with imaging capability at long depth of fields water droplets 3 μl were dispensed with a micropipette finnipipette thermo fisher scientific inc waltham usa onto an analysed membrane surface of 5 5 mm2 region eight separate measurements were then carried out and an average contact angle was calculated all images were captured with a high resolution ccd camera pco 1600 kelheim germany and processed the crystalline properties of non and cross linked pi go mmms were characterised using the x ray diffraction xrd technique mmm surfaces of 1 1 cm2 were analysed with a d8 advance x ray diffractometer bruker axs germany under cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm and detected using 1 d fast detector lynx eye the equipment was operated at 40 ma and 40 kv from 5 to 80 with a step size of 0 025 and exposure rate of 0 1 s per step gravimetric analysis was also carried out on the mmm to determine the membrane degree of membrane swelling before and after the cross linking process membrane was initially weighed before swelling and the weight was recorded as m0 the sample was then immersed in the succinate solution for 1 h after which it was removed and the surface water was quickly removed using a filter paper the sample was weighed on an electronic balance as m1 the procedure was repeated until the equilibrium of swelling was reached the swelling ratio mt was calculated using eq 1 1 m t m 1 m 0 m 0 2 4 2 membrane morphologies surface morphologies of the non and cross linked pi go nanosheets were examined with a field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem supra 55 v p zeiss under accelerating voltage of 5 kv samples were initially made electrically conductive using platinum sputter coater quorum q150rs uk all membranes were fractured in liquid nitrogen and mounted on aluminium stubs the cross section images of the membranes were captured at 300 and 10 000 magnifications 2 5 membrane separation performance 2 5 1 synthetic model solutions water and permeate flux of the membrane as well as salt rejection were evaluated using a dead end filtration cell hp4750 stirred cell with a filtration area of 0 00146 m2 purchased from sterlitech usa all work was carried out under an operating pressure of 30 bar 800 rpm stirring speed 25 c and 100 ml of feed volume parameters were selected based on a previous study 11 meanwhile the ph of all mixture solutions containing succinate product formate and acetate by products investigated was set at 7 where succinate was in a divalent form for maximum rejection performance and formate and acetate were in monovalent forms for the preparation of mixture solutions containing succinate formate and acetate the weights of the salts were initially measured using weighing balance the salts were then dissolved in deionised water di in a volumetric flask followed by the addition of the di water up to 1 l the mixture was stirred until all salts were completely dissolved succinate concentration in the mixture solution was varied at 10 30 and 50 g l with a product to by product ratio of 2 1 the ratio was set at constant throughout the study according to the commonly found organic acid salt mixture ratio in the fermentation broth the samples were measured every 10 min for 1 h the flux and rejection performance of the membrane were calculated based on eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 j δ v t a where j is the flux l m2 h v is the volume of the permeate l a is the effective area of the

membrane the separation factor sf of succinate relative to the by products was also calculated using eq 5 to investigate the membrane selectivity towards succinate the equation was expressed by the concentration ratio of the product in the permeate over the concentration ratio of the by product in the retentate feed an sf value higher than 1 indicated that the nf permeate was enriched with succinate low succinate selectivity on the other hand a value lower than 1 corresponded to an enriched retentate high succinate selectivity 26 4 s f c s u c c b y p r o d u c t s p e r m e a t e c s u

values of the membrane using eq 5 5 s f 1 r s u c 1 r b y p r o d u c t s where rsuc is the rejection value of succinate while rby products is the rejection value of by products 2 5 2 actual fermentation broth for the recovery of succinate from the actual fermentation broth performance of the membrane was investigated via diafiltration process for recovering as much succinate as possible and at the same time to remove the unwanted by products diafiltration process mode allows the concentration of samples and minimisation of sample loss and contamination three diafiltration steps were carried out at 30 bar and 800 rpm feed volume of 100 ml was used and kept constant for every refilling with pure water vcf 1 5 the samples were measured every 10 min for 100 min before they were refilled with pure water every experiment continued for 5 h the contribution of fouling to the performance of the membranes was also analysed after the filtration of the fermentation broth pure water was permeated through the membranes for 150 min at 30 bar the irreversible fouling rir and flux recovery ratio frr in of the membranes were determined using eqs 6 and 7 respectively 27 6 r i r j w j w

using an analytical grade of individual salts namely succinate formate and acetate the calibration curves and sample concentrations were determined by using chromeleon v 7 2 2 6686 software dionex sunnyvale ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 eda cross linked pi go mmm characterization 3 1 1 chemical properties fig 1 a demonstrates the ft ir spectra of non cross linked pi go mmm and eda cross linked pi go mmm at different cross linking times of 0 1 and 2 h the non cross linked pi go mmm exhibited absorption peaks at 1779 cm 1 asymmetric stretch of co in the imide group 1721 cm 1 symmetric stretching of co in the imide group and 1335 cm 1 stretching of cn in the imide group 28 meanwhile for amide bands absorption peaks are referred to at 1650 cm 1 co and 1540 cm 1 cn stretching and cnh group dark blue and light blue areas are designated for both imide and amide bands respectively from blue coloured areas it can be clearly seen that the amide peaks become stronger in intensity while the imide peaks are decreasing which signifies that the cross linking has effectively occurred 28 the increase and reduction in intensity of imide and amide characteristic peaks respectively can be clearly seen with the longest cross linking time of 2 h this is due to more cross linking agent penetrating into the porous structure and thin skin layer of the pi go asymmetric mmm at increasing cross linking time for the reaction to take place 23 the replacement of imide with amide groups and the increase in amide intensity indicate an increase in membrane hydrophilicity because of the property of the highly water soluble polar compounds of amide c o nh2 29 the finite hydration number per functional group n h of ca 6 which implies the formation of hydrogen bonds between the polar groups and water molecules strongly suggests that amide is a truly hydrophilic compound compared to imide 29 an increase in the hydrophilicity of the pi go mmm via cross linking process is expected to increase the membrane permeability without compromising the mmm rejection performance towards succinate at increasing feed concentration 11 fig 1b was also plotted for determining the interactions of eda with the pi go mmm from fig 1 b it can be seen that the cross linking mainly occurred between the pi polymer chains rather than the incorporated go nanosheets this was indicated by the absorption peak at 3300 cm 1 that exhibits the stretching of hydroxyl groups oh thus after the cross linking of eda with pi go mmm this peak is still present as in the non cross linked pi go mmm the intact peak of hydroxyl group indicates that only minimum or no reaction between amine monomers and oxygen containing functional groups of go had occurred if the reaction occurred a decrease in the absorption peak of the hydroxyl group at 3300 cm 1 would be observed because of the condensation reaction between amine and hydroxyl groups generating cn covalent bonds 30 go is believed to have only formed hydrogen bonding interactions with the pi polymer as presented and discussed by the authors in 17 shifts in peaks from the hydrogen bonding interactions were observed between cn and co bonds of pi and surface group of go 17 the schematic diagram and proposed cross linking structure of eda cross linked pi go mmm were also presented in fig 2 the formation of strong covalent bonds between polymer chains is expected to increase the rigidity crystallinity of the membrane improving the membrane rejection performances towards succinate at elevated feed concentration which will be discussed in the following sections moreover based on the figure the increase in peak intensity at 3300 cm 1 observed with cross linking process may indicate the presence of eda in the pi go mmm as the increase in the peak may also be attributed to the nh group other than the oh group as discussed above 31 therefore this suggests the successful eda cross linking process between pi chains in the pi go membrane further supporting the discussion in the previous paragraph 3 1 2 membrane water affinity eda cross linked pi go mmm water affinity was investigated to explore the influence of eda cross linking on the membrane hydrophilicity in this study membranes at different evaporation times 30 45 and 60 s were cross linked using eda at different times of 0 1 and 2 h fig 3 shows that at 0 h cross linking time pure pi go mmm with increasing evaporation time from 30 to 60 s membrane contact angle increases from 68 95 to 74 40 this may be because of the increasing density of polymer at the membrane top layer at increasing evaporation times prior to immersion of the cast films in the water bath a more volatile solvent can evaporate from the surface of the cast film therefore the dry phase separated region with elevated polymer concentration at the top of the film increases resulting in a top layer having more concentrated polymer 32 it is important to note that the wettability of the membrane is also influenced by the membrane material as well as the membrane surface porosity and roughness 33 at similar composition and materials the increase in pi go mmm contact angle with evaporation time may be attributed to the decreased surface porosity this consequently leads to the reduction in membrane hydrophilicity as presented in fig 3 as the membrane was cross linked it shows a reduction in contact angle values with the increase in cross linking time regardless of its evaporation times of cast films prior to immersion in water bath this may be due to the increasing formation of amide groups that replaced the imide groups present on the membrane surface refer fig 2a since amide is more hydrophilic in nature than imide group the cross linked membrane shows a higher hydrophilicity property lower contact angle that could contribute to higher membrane water permeability 30 fig 3 also demonstrates that overall the contact angles of membranes at the shortest evaporation time of 30 s were the lowest regardless of the cross linking time which may be related to the concentration of the polymer on the membrane top layer as discussed in the previous paragraph membrane cast at the shortest evaporation time 30 s may possess the least concentrated top skin layer as reported in a previous study 32 this allows the cross linking agent to easily penetrate across the pi go mmm sub layer and induces more cross linking reaction across the membrane which results in the lowest contact angle values however as the membrane evaporation time increases to 45 and 60 s the contact angles obtained at increasing cross linking times were higher compared to that of the membrane fabricated with 30 s evaporation time fig 3 the reduction in membrane porosity with increasing membrane evaporation time may induce difficulties for the cross linking agent to penetrate across the membrane 34 therefore higher contact angle values were observed for the membranes 3 1 3 morphology of cross linked pi go mmm the effect of cross linking time on membrane morphology was also investigated as presented in fig 4 the figure shows the surface and cross sectional morphologies of pi go mmm 45 s evaporation time at different magnification sizes 3000 and 30 000 and cross linking times of 0 1 and 2 h from the morphological images significant changes on the surface of the membrane can be observed fig 4a c i for instance the membrane surface roughness has increased with increasing cross linking time the changes in the cross linked membrane surface morphologies are probably caused by the clusters of the attached cross linking molecules generated by the cross linking agents 35 the influence of surface roughness and solute rejection has been described as rapid valley clogging mechanism 36 this mechanism describes that increasing membrane surface roughness could increase the surface area of which solute could accumulate and interact consequently the enhancement in the effective surface area contributes to the increase in membrane rejection performances 36 nevertheless the observed changes further confirm the successful cross linking of pi go mmm with eda and are in agreement with previous studies 23 35 in addition fesem images also show that the cross linking took place not only on top of the membrane surface but also in the sub layer of the membrane fig 4 b c iii these figures demonstrate the presence of a dense top layer on top of the membrane surface however the thickness of the dense top layer was reduced with an increase in cross linking time from 1 to 2 h indicated by the red line gap in the images b and c iii at 2 h cross linking time the thickness of the top layer was not significantly visible at 30 000 magnification however an image with a higher magnification than 30 000 could not be produced by the fesem the observation is believed to be due to the two step process that usually occurs during membrane cross linking which are i the swelling of a membrane by methanol followed by ii the diffusion of cross linking molecules across the membrane structure at a short cross linking time there is a possibility of insufficient swelling of the membrane caused by methanol in the eda methanol mixture which could hinder the penetration of the cross linking agent into the membrane therefore most of the cross linking reactions may take place at the surface of the membrane resulting in a formation of a thicker thin dense layer 23 as shown in fig 4b than the layer shown in fig 4c the observation is also supported by the ftir spectra presented in fig 2 and the contact angle analysis tabulated in fig 3 from the ftir spectra an increase in cross linking time from 1 to 2 h has reduced the characteristic peak height of imide on the other hand the characteristic peak height of amide groups increased progressively this confirms that cross linking reaction had taken place across the membrane after 1 h cross linking time the contact angle also exhibits reducing values with increasing cross linking time validating the morphology of the membrane obtained nevertheless 1 h cross linking time is found sufficient to achieve a membrane with good stability in common solvents a simple solvent stability test performed on the membrane has found that no reduction in membrane weight was observed after soaking it in dmf for two weeks indicating its stability for non cross linked membrane the immersion of membrane in dmf resulted in dissolution after a few hours unlike the cross linked membrane in which the membrane was still intact even after two week immersion in the dmf solution 3 1 4 effect of cross linking time on d spacing of pi go mmmspacing of pi go mmm fig 5 shows the xrd diffraction patterns of pi go mmm at various cross linking times from 0 to 2 h the increase in cross linking time shifted the 2θ value to the right indicating a bigger diffraction angle than by the pure pi go mmm from the maximum 2θ value of the broad peaks the average inter chain distances d spacing values can be calculated using bragg s law d λ 2 sin θ although d spacing cannot be used as a true inter chain distance the changes of d spacing can be taken as an indicator of the amount of free volume available for the penetration of small molecules and diffusion across the membranes 37 therefore the smaller the inter chain distances the smaller the size of molecules that could penetrate across the membrane the inter chain distance ordered packing represents the interaction and distance between dianhydrides and diamines in the pi chemical structure as reported in previous studies 17 38 39 the pure pi go mmm without cross linking demonstrated d spacing values of 0 48 and 0 36 nm representing the peak of inter chain order packing and π π stacking respectively at 1 h cross linking time there is not much difference in the d spacing values compared to the non cross linked membrane however as the cross linking time increased to 2 h the d spacing values were seen to reduce at the respective value of 0 40 and 0 34 nm for inter chain order packing and π π stacking the reductions of the membrane d spacing values indicate that the membrane free volume has reduced free volume refers to the amount of space available for penetrating small molecules through membranes this may be resulted from the cross linking networking effect of eda molecules in between the polymer chains that increased the chain packing density a similar result was also reported in previous studies 30 37 from the characterisations of the eda cross linked pi go mmm the membrane demonstrated successful cross linking with the eda the changes in cross linking time and membrane evaporation time were seen positively affecting the overall properties of the membrane in terms of membrane hydrophilicity and membrane d spacing the reduced contact angle and d spacing from the cross linking process could benefit the recovery process of succinate from the fermentation broth by increasing the permeability of the membrane but still sustaining the membrane rejection performance 3 2 separation performance measurement generally the studies on membrane performances are investigated based on the product recovery rejection performance and or membrane productivity permeability pure water flux performance this study investigated the fabrication of eda cross linked pi go mmm focusing on the membrane performance on the recovery of succinate when increasing the concentration of feed solution from 10 to 50 g l and not on its productivity this is because of the perennial common problems of reducing membrane performances with increasing feed concentration nevertheless the study on the membrane permeability was also presented from the evaluation of pure water flux and its relationship with eda usage during membrane modification in terms of the mmm performance 3 2 1 pure water flux permeation pure water permeation of pi go mmm was calculated using eq 2 as shown in fig 6 the membrane pure water flux increases with cross linking time regardless of the evaporation time utilised during membrane fabrication the highest membrane pure water flux of 33 l m2 h was observed for the membrane with 2 h cross linking time and 30 s evaporation time the enhancement in pure water flux is because of the improvement in membrane contact angle from the replacement of imide by the high hydrophilic amide group fig 2 thus making the membrane more hydrophilic fig 3 from fig 6 it can also be found that when increasing membrane evaporation time from 45 to 60 s the resultant increase in cross linking time from 1 to 2 h has not affected the membrane pure water flux much unlike in the case of the membrane fabricated at 30 s evaporation time with the highest pure water flux being obtained at 33 l m2 h a similar result was also found for the contact angle values of the membranes fig 3 the unchanged trend observed indicates that membrane may have undergone optimum changes in membrane structure at 45 s evaporation time changes in membrane structure at above 45 s evaporation time were not significant to influence the membrane contact angle and subsequently membrane pure water flux even though improvement in the membrane pure water flux was observed the overall pure water flux was still low in the mmm compared to that in the commercial nf membranes which requires further investigation the low flux performance for the pi membrane may possibly be because of the general pi p84 membrane structure comprising compact chain packing 40 it was also observed that even though the presence of eda cross linker increases the membrane hydrophilicty based on the increase in membrane contact angle and its effect on the membrane productivity may not be as significant as the formation of amide linkage from the cross linking process that reduces the interstitial space between the polymer chains thus resulting in very low membrane flux performance 23 nonetheless the increase in hydrophilicity of membrane has benefited the rejection performance of the mmm 3 2 2 succinate recovery and selectivity following the results on the membrane permeation in section 3 2 1 only two significant parameters of membrane cross linking time and feed solution concentration were used to establish the recovery of succinate from the by products of formate and acetate the recovery of succinate was qualitatively determined based on the rejection percentage calculated using eq 3 meanwhile the selectivity of succinate over by products was qualitatively determined using eq 5 from the difference in rejections between the product and by products which denoted as separation factor sf the low value of sf near to 0 indicates a high selectivity of membrane towards succinate while sf near to 1 indicates low succinate selectivity 3 2 2 1 effect of cross linking time on succinate rejection and sf fig 7 shows the plot of succinate formate and acetate rejection percentage over 1 h filtration time for membrane cross linked at a 0 b 1 and c 2 h a membrane with 30 s evaporation time was utilised in this study recovering succinate from a mixture solution containing 30 g l succinate and 15 g l acetate and formate it can be observed from fig 7 a that the result obtained is as expected the rejection of succinate reduces significantly from 93 8 33 8 as filtration time progresses up to 1 h however when the membrane was cross linked with eda the reduction in succinate rejection for 1 h filtration time was minimised as presented in fig 7b 3 drop in succinate rejection and fig 7c 5 drop in succinate rejection 41 generally solute and water transport across a polymeric membrane depends on the water accessible open space in a membrane polymer structure which can be altered by a cross linking process 42 therefore the improvement in membrane performance in terms of minimisation of succinate rejection reduction fig 7 at increasing cross linking time can be said to be because of several changes in the membrane properties after the cross linking process with eda these include i the reduced interstitial space and ii the densification of the membrane from prolonging cross linking time when the membrane is cross linked the rigidity of the membrane polymer chains increases while the presence of percolated free volume for solute and water transport reduces 42 these changes in membrane structure induce higher stearic resistance for big molecules to pass through the membrane allowing only small molecules across the membrane it is important to note that at high concentration of feed the transfer of charged solute mainly depends on the steric hindrance effects rather than the electrostatic repulsions caused by the screening effect of the membrane surface charge the observation was also supported by the xrd analysis presented in fig 5 the results show that the increase in cross linking time has reduced the d spacing of the membrane indicating a more densified membrane proven by the fesem results fig 4 and a previous study 23 according to qiao and chung 2006 the cross linking process creates a hole filling and networking effect of the cross linker molecules in between the polymer chains that could increase the rigidity of the chain structure an increase in rigidity further raised the selectivity of water over salt as confirmed in by geise et al 2011 43 which consequently increased the rejection of the membrane similar results were also reported in previous studies 23 30 meanwhile it can also be observed that for the cross linked membrane a negative rejection was observed for formate and acetate this phenomenon of negative rejection for the monovalent anions can be explained based on the distribution coefficient theory proposed by kang and chang 2005 distribution coefficient is defined as the ratio of the concentration at the membrane phase and the bulk concentration which is mainly influenced by the concentration ratio between the mono and divalent ions co ions and the membrane surface charge as the concentration ratio increases and the membrane surface charge decreases a high distribution coefficient 1 of monovalent ion is obtained indicating that the concentration of monovalent ion is higher at the membrane phase compared to the bulk concentration which leads to the negative rejection 8 the high distribution coefficient of monovalent ions is believed to be the result of the monovalent ions replacing the divalent ions at the membrane phase because of the higher electro electrostatic repulsion of the higher charge divalent ion to keep the membrane phase electrically neutral this therefore results in the increase in monovalent ion concentration in the membrane phase compared to the bulk phase which explains the negative rejection of formate and acetate as observed in fig 7 9 44 however the negative rejection has not been observed for the non cross linked membrane which could be because of the reduced rejection performance of the membrane observed at the 1 h rejection period similarly the membrane also shows an increase in selectivity of succinate formate and succinate acetate reduced sf with increasing cross linking time this can be denoted by the large difference between rejection percentage of succinate and that of formate and acetate as presented in fig 7 the sf values of succinate formate and succinate acetate at 0 h cross linking time of 0 59 and 0 71 respectively reduced to 0 24 and 0 34 at 1 h cross linking time and further to 0 19 to 0 30 at 2 h cross linking time one of the reasons for the observed results could be the reduction in membrane swelling by which cross linking introduced limited solute accessible volume representing the available space for solute to pass through the membrane 45 fig 8 shows that the swelling of the membrane decreases with increasing cross linking time regardless of the membrane evaporation time a cross linking time of 2 h shows the highest reduction in swelling of around 1 0 70 and 0 69 g g respectively for 30 45 and 60 s membrane evaporation times refer fig 8 in general the cross linked membrane usually demonstrates a low water uptake because of the restriction in polymer chain movement from the reaction process between the cross linking agent and the membrane polymer the restriction of polymer chain movement during the filtration process of salt solution to accommodate the size of the divalent succinate ions in a cross linked membrane could sustain the membrane rejection and selectivity performances over time 46 however quantitative analysis on the size of succinate formate and acetate ions in relation to the membrane pore size was not performed in this study nevertheless based on the higher charge of the divalent succinate anions compared to that of monovalent formate and acetate anions succinate would still result in higher rejection and selectivity 47 48 according to shen et al 2016 besides the size of a solute ions their transport across a membrane also depends on the electrostatic interaction of the ion and water as some of water molecules need to be shed for allowing the ions to permeate across the membrane 42 therefore being a divalent anion water molecules bind more tightly to the succinate ions compared to that of monovalent formate and acetate making it hard to shed the hydrogen bonded water molecules to pass into and through the membrane 42 this phenomenon thus increases the membrane rejection and selectivity at increasing cross linking time because of the increased permeation restriction from the cross linking process the highest selectivity was obtained at 2 h cross linking time for all membranes fig 7c in contrast for a non cross linked membrane when a solution entered the membrane it was postulated that the polymer chains could move further apart increasing the overall volume of the membrane hung et al 2014 observed this phenomenon with go the spacing between go layers was seen expanding in the presence of 90 wt ethanol water solution because of the destroyed π π interactions resulting in reduced membrane selectivity for preventing the expansion in go layers cross linking to the go layers was introduced 30 therefore in summary the high rejection and selectivity of membrane can be said to be because of the restricted movement of the polymer chains as the pi go mmm has been cross linked with eda reduced d spacing property refer to xrd fig 5 and restricted movement of succinate ion caused by its strong ion water interaction compared to that of formate and aceate meanwhile for non cross linked membrane the sorbed water may have disrupted the polymer s crystallinity over time this resulted in a gradual increase in water sorption of the pi go mmm consequently a reduction in the rejection and selectivity of the membrane is observed as observed in a previous study 49 3 2 2 2 effect of feed concentration on succinate rejection overall for a non cross linked membrane 0 h cross linking time fig 9 a significant reduction in membrane performance was observed when the succinate concentration was increased from 10 to 50 g l the succinate rejection reduced by 73 from 89 to 24 with the increase in succinate concentration fig 9a this result has also affected the selectivity of membrane towards succinate indicated by the increase of sfs from 0 38 to 0 73 for succinate formate and from 0 47 to 0 80 for succinate acetate further suggesting a reduction in succinate selectivity table 1 interestingly as the membrane was cross linked at increasing time from 0 to 2 h the drop in reduction of succinate rejection was significantly reduced when the concentration of feed solution was increased from 10 to 50 g l at 1 h cross linking time the drop in reduction of succinate rejection was reduced from 73 to 33 in which 98 of succinate rejection was obtained at 10 g l and 66 of succinate rejection was obtained at 50 g l as the cross linking time was increased to 2 h a further drop in reduction of succinate rejection of 7 was observed in which 91 and 84 of succinate rejection were obtained at 10 and 50 g l solution respectively however for membrane selectivity no specific trend was observed nevertheless all membranes demonstrated improved selectivity and the sf reduced closer to 0 with increasing cross linking time regardless of the succinate concentration used in the mixture during filtration the phenomenon of only a slight drop in membrane rejection performance with increasing feed for cross linked membrane can be caused by the reduced d spacing in the membrane increased rigidity of membrane polymer chains and or reduced membrane water uptake swelling with increasing cross linking time 46 as discussed in detail in section 3 2 2 1 3 2 2 3 diafiltration of fermentation broth prior to the diafiltration process an analysis of the fermentation broth produced from the oil palm frond hydrolysate that was obtained from the collaborated research team of the university kebangsaan malaysia ukm malaysia was conducted 50 the broth was determined to consist of 35 g l succinate 7 g l formate and 9 g l acetate because malaysia is ranked as the second top producer of palm oil and generates abundant oil palm waste the utilisation of the waste for the production of succinic acid is believed to contribute to the sustainable production of bio succinic acid fig 10 shows the results of the diafiltration experiment it contains the volumetric flux and vcf profile using eda cross linked pi go mmm the figure reveals that the initial flux of the membrane is around 17 75 l m2 h which is two times lower than the pure water flux 33 l m2 h the lower initial flux could be due to the complex composition of the fermentation broth which generated high osmotic pressure during the filtration process this therefore reduces the mass transfer driving force as supported by sosa et al 2016 6 with time and at increasing vcf the flux continued to decrease until it reached a value of 12 l m2 h immediately upon refilling the cell with water the flux increased to a value of 20 05 l m2 h overall during the 300 minutes operation time vcf was found to be in the range of 1 1 7 with flux values above 12 29 l m2 h in this study the vcf indicates the extent of succinate concentration evaluation of the rejection of succinate formate and acetate was also conducted on the samples that were taken every 10 min during the experiments the obtained data is presented in fig 11 data revealed that the rejections of succinate took place in the range of 70 86 and continued to increase with time meanwhile the rejection of formate and acetate continued to decrease with time reaching close to 40 and 10 respectively the reduced rejection of formate and acetate indicates the low remaining levels of both carboxylates in the retentate overall it was observed that the membrane rejections tend to decrease with increasing vcf which is in agreement with findings from previous studies 6 8 the final sf of eda cross linked pi go mmm for succinate formate and succinate acetate was around 0 34 and 0 21 respectively compared to the experimental results obtained from model solutions 81 25 from model solution a comparable rejection performance was observed however the selectivity of succinate formate was slightly reduced when the broth was used as the feed this was observed from the higher sf obtained 0 34 sf from broth 0 17 sf from model solution the reduced selectivity of succinate formate may be due to higher formate initial concentration compared to that of acetate in the broth in the model solution similar initial concentrations of monovalent anions were used the difference in initial concentration of anions may have affected the interaction between the anions and the anions with the membrane matrix which also affected the mobility of the ions across the membrane 51 however further evaluation is required to understand the behaviour and interaction of divalent monovalent anions with varying concentrations in broth in addition to that tendency of membrane fouling was also examined after the filtration process of the fermentation broth this was done by evaluating the membrane using pure water recovery fig 11 b revealed that the membrane experienced an irreversible fouling rir of less than 4 and flux recovery ratio frr of nearly 96 which is a good indication of the membrane having relatively low fouling tendency the membrane fouling properties were calculated using eqs 5 and 6 4 conclusions the long term problem of reduced membrane performances at increasing feed concentration was successfully addressed by conducting eda cross linking of pi go mmm at various cross linking times and membrane evaporation times this was assessed at different feed concentrations the cross linking of pi go mmm using eda was a success which was confirmed by the ftir result from the conversion of amide into imide peaks and the intensification of the peaks with increasing cross linking time the cross linked membranes also exhibited remarkable improvement in membrane hydrophilicity which improved membrane water permeation and reduced membrane swelling and d spacing the cross linking of pi go mmm with eda also resulted in good membrane performances the reduction in succinate rejection at high feed concentration was successfully minimised the reduction in succinate rejection was reduced from 73 non cross linked mmm to 33 at 1 h cross linking time this was then further reduced to 7 at 2 h cross linking time when succinate concentration was increased from 10 to 50 g l the success of eda cross linking of pi go mmm was also reflected in the improved separation factor of succinate over formate and acetate further evaluation of the eda cross linked membrane using actual fermentation broth also demonstrated promising results the membrane exhibited high succinate rejection performance of up to 86 with sf of 0 34 for succinate formate and 0 21 for succinate acetate the membrane also shows fouling tendency with rir and frr of less than 4 and nearly 96 respectively to recapitulate the successful enhancement of membrane properties of improved separation and selectivity performance in succinate recovery from concentrated feed solutions allows for the cleaner production of succinate the improved membrane properties enable high succinate recovery consequently minimising recovery stages and intensifying the overall process the improved fouling property and solvent resistant property also result into an increase in membrane lifetime declaration of competing interest the authors
