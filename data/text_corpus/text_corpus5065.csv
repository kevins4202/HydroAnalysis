25325,invasive species from the suez canal also named lessepsian species often have an ecological and financial impact on marine life fisheries human well being and health in the mediterranean sea among these the silver cheeked toad fish lagocephalus sceleratus gmelin 1789 has rapidly colonised the eastern mediterranean basin and is currently moving westwards this pufferfish has a highly opportunistic behaviour it attacks fish captured in nets and lines and seriously damages fishing gears and catch it is a highly toxic species with no immediate economic value for the mediterranean market although it currently represents 4 of the weight of the total artisanal catches consequently the possible effects on mediterranean fisheries and health require to enhance our understanding about the future geographical distribution of this pufferfish in the whole basin in this paper an overall habitat suitability map and an effective geographical spread map for l sceleratus at mediterranean scale are produced by using cloud computing based algorithms to merge seven machine learning approaches further the potential impact of the species is estimated for several mediterranean sea subdivisions the major fishing areas of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations the economic exclusive zones and the subdivisions of the general fisheries commission for the mediterranean sea our results suggest that without an intervention l sceleratus will continue its rapid spread and will likely have a high impact on fisheries the presented method is generic and can be applied to other invasive species it is based on an open science approach and all processes are freely available as web services keywords ecological niche modelling aquamaps artificial neural networks invasive species maximum entropy support vector machines lagocephalus sceleratus species distribution models 1 introduction the number of species in the mediterranean sea arriving through the suez canal also named lessepsian species continues to increase nader et al 2012 golani 2010 recent studies estimate that more than 5 of the marine species are non native and 13 5 are invasive including fish invertebrates and macrophytes galil 2009 zenetos 2010 fricke et al 2015 zenetos et al 2015 golani 2010 these invasive species shine et al 2000 settle in the new habitat increase in number and spread in the area potentially threatening native biological diversity galil et al 2015 coll et al 2010 and economy galil 2008 thus they require particular effort by supervising organisations in order to monitor and predict their spread among these species the silver cheeked toad fish lagocephalus sceleratus gmelin 1789 is of particular concern the first reliable records in the mediterranean sea date back to 2003 but the number of observations has rapidly grown so that it is considered one of the fastest expanding invasive species in the basin akyol et al 2005 peristeraki et al 2006 it owes its success to the high growth and reproduction rate the lack of natural predators the ability to exploit food resources and the capacity to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions yaglioglu et al 2011 it has a skin without scales with dark spots on top and lateral silver bands this species is common in the red sea belongs to the tetraodontidae family is extremely poisonous and can be lethal to humans if eaten due to high level of tetrodotoxin neurotoxin ttx present in several organs e g the liver and excreted from the skin as a repellent after swelling yaglioglu et al 2011 nader et al 2012 it usually prefers shallow waters and medium high water temperature which is correlated to faster ttx uptake thus climate change could be beneficial for this species particularly in the mediterranean sea nader et al 2012 scientific studies have estimated the potential impact of l sceleratus on economic and human health in the eastern mediterranean sea ünal et al 2015 2017 in this region this is now one of the most important species in biomass on posidonia oceanica meadows being a major problem to artisanal fisheries considering that it damages fishing gears e g nets and lines and predates heavily on local stocks of squids and octopuses kalogirou et al 2010 however these studies do not report definitive ecological and economic future impact assessments and usually involve more qualitative than quantitative predictions overall they indicate that the fish currently represents the 4 of the weight of the total artisanal catches nader et al 2012 and has already negatively impacted the economy of some mediterranean countries ünal et al 2017 also since 2003 several episodes of death and serious illness have been recorded after fish consumption since fishermen and other people usually cannot identify this relatively new species bentur et al 2008 kheifets et al 2012 this scenario calls for priority actions to prevent detect and possibly eradicate l sceleratus zenetos et al 2016 especially considering that the suez canal capacity is being enlarged searight 2016 and climate change is facilitating the invasion galil et al 2014 ices 2007 fao 2007 one approach could be to use selective fishing especially on big individuals and localised precautionary actions in those areas where the pufferfish will possibly move and settle in the next years ünal et al 2017 therefore a map of the ongoing invasion pattern could guide the development of preventive and corrective actions zenetos et al 2015 2016 and could also help filling a gap between research and management about this fish ünal et al 2015 in the past decade there has been a growing interest in the application of ecological niche models enms to predict the distribution of invasive species guisan et al 2014 different approaches have been used based on the evaluation of the niche differences between a species native region and the invaded region peterson 2003 barbosa et al 2012 leidenberger et al 2015 in some cases these approaches also take into account how climate change facilitates the species spread into the invaded region sax et al 2007 thuiller et al 2005 enms based approaches to invasive species modelling use a varied range of models including envelope based sutherst 2000 jeschke and strayer 2008 statistical ficetola et al 2007 bidegain et al 2015 and machine learning models peterson and robins 2003 most of these models estimate an association between a species presence and a number of environmental parameters and produce a probability distribution this is then projected onto a certain area over time to get a dynamic visualisation of the invasion mellin et al 2016 carlos júnior et al 2015 the most used enm in this context is the genetic algorithm for rule set production garp stockwell 1999 which uses a machine learning approach peterson and vieglais 2001 ganeshaiah et al 2003 sanchez flores et al 2008 underwood et al 2004 another widely used model is the maximum entropy presence only model ficetola et al 2007 west et al 2016 whereas presence absence models e g artificial neural networks kulhanek et al 2011 and support vector machines pouteau et al 2011 sadeghi et al 2012 are less frequent because of the scarcity of reliable absence data usually alternative enms based approaches have complementary features which capture different characteristics of a species invasion elith and graham 2009 thus it is common to compare or merge the output of different models in order to produce a final spread estimate castelar et al 2015 farashi and najafabadi 2015 padalia et al 2014 sobek swant et al 2012 most of the cited studies assume climate niche conservatism pearman et al 2008 peterson and vieglais 2001 i e the enm calculated using data from the species native environment is supposed to successfully predict invasion in exotic areas petitpierre et al 2012 strubbe et al 2013 castelar et al 2015 however other works have highlighted that the climatic niche may change during the invasion broennimann et al 2007 lauzeral et al 2011 which can overturn the conservatism assumption shabani and kumar 2015 further enms usually do not account for the effects of species interactions and possible geographical dispersal limitations thus the results of approaches purely based on enms should be interpreted and used with caution sax et al 2007 in this paper an approach is proposed to estimate the potential ecological niche and the potential geographical distribution of l sceleratus in the mediterranean sea its spread is predicted up to a stable distribution based on the algorithmic merge of the output of seven machine learning models that each estimate the potential niche or habitat suitability further an effective geographical distribution is estimated and a potential impact indicator is produced for different subdivisions of the mediterranean sea which include the major fishing areas of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao the economic exclusive zones attard 1987 and the general subdivisions of the general fisheries commission for the mediterranean sea the predictive value of the generated geographical distribution is assessed in a comparison with real observation records in the mediterranean sea and with a dynamic model that simulates the spread of the pufferfish over time our analysis follows an open science approach hey et al 2009 and all models are available as a service under a representational standard every step can be reproduced repeated and reused for other invasive species or with different ancillary data 2 material and methods in this section the used technology and data section 2 1 and the baseline models that constitute our method are described section 2 2 further our method to estimate the geographical reachability distribution of l sceleratus is presented sections 2 3 and 2 4 a dynamic model is also described section 2 5 which is used in section 3 as a reference to assess the performance of our method moreover the metrics used to calculate the models performance their mutual similarities and a risk indicator for the mediterranean sea are presented section 2 6 finally the generality of our method and its applicability to other invasive species is discussed section 2 7 2 1 technology and data 2 1 1 computational and data access platform our method requires the training of machine learning models with a large set of alternative parametrisations the goal is to find the optimal model i e the model with the best performance on a test set the experiment reported in this paper required to train 150 000 parametrisations which was very time consuming and computationally demanding to overcome this a cloud computing platform was used to train many alternative parametrisations of a given machine learning model at the same time in particular the gcube dataminer open source system 1 1 freely accessible and usable after registration at https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner coro et al 2017 was used for this big data processing and to interoperate with the services of the d4science distributed e infrastructure national research council of italy 2016 d4science facilitates data preparation and processing and fosters collaboration among scientists according to open science paradigms hey et al 2009 this set up includes assante et al 2016 i collaborative experimentation spaces where processes can be re executed and parametrised several times by others ii services for data sharing between users and iii application of standards for data and processes representation the dataminer represents and stores all the trained models and their respective parametrisations in a standard and exportable ontological format prov o lebo et al 2013 which summarises the set of input output data and metadata that enable any other authorised user to reproduce and repeat the experiment provenance of the computation all models are published in the d4science e infrastructure as open source and free to use web services under the web processing service standard of the open geospatial consortium wps schut and whiteside 2007 this maximises re usability because wps standardises the representation of input parameters and output through xml descriptions of their types and expected contents dataminer parallelises models training on a network of 100 machines choosing the best computational configuration among a range of powerful multi core virtual machines ubuntu 14 04 5 lts 86 64 with 16 virtual cpus 16 gb of random access memory 100 gb of disk and more lightweight virtual machines ubuntu 14 04 5 lts 86 64 with 2 virtual cpus 2 gb of random access memory 10 gb of disk apart from its high performance coro et al 2017 this platform was selected because we wanted our method to be used by other scientists possibly on other invasive species through the repeatability reproducibility and re usability of each step of our method 2 1 2 occurrence records occurrence records of l sceleratus were retrieved and harmonised through the species product discovery spd service of the d4science e infrastructure 2 2 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab species discovery candela et al 2015 from biodiversity data collections such as obis vanden berghe et al 2010 gbif lane and edwards 2007 and the catalogue of life wilson 2003 the spd attaches additional information to presence coordinates i e the ownership of the observation its source e g human observation specimen etc and a flag stating if the record underwent expert review this allows retrieving only data having good quality because they were checked by an expert spd produced a set of 284 expert reviewed records for l sceleratus from its native habitat environment fig 1 a locations in the mediterranean sea were excluded because this data set was used in model training and could not contain locations in the projection testing area the spd records for the mediterranean sea were combined with records collected from a manual literature review of published articles and grey literature fig 1b a total of 263 mediterranean records sometimes referring to several individuals was obtained where the first reliable records dated back to 2003 in order to build up our definitive distribution of l sceleratus 20 of these data were used whereas the remaining 80 were used to validate the model sections 2 2 and 3 this choice was due to the fact that we wanted to use the mediterranean observations to evaluate the performance of our models rather than to train the models in fact this approach makes the models less sensitive to prior information about the distribution of the species in the invaded region and it also makes our approach applicable to other species for which few observations are available in the invaded area 2 1 3 estimating absence locations some models used by our method require to estimate locations of habitat unsuitability of l sceleratus to this aim a dataminer process to estimate pseudo absence locations was used 3 3 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses transducerers absence generation from obis coro et al 2016a this process performs a statistical analysis on scientific survey data in the obis data collection grassle 2000 it accesses obis through rest apis and uses four input parameters i a time frame for the observations ii a spatial resolution for the estimated absence locations iii the geographical area where to estimate the absence locations and iv an observation frequency threshold this last parameter is used to retrieve all the surveys hosting species experts on the vessels who observed l sceleratus in specific locations with higher monthly frequency than this value in these surveys locations where the experts reported only other species than the target one are recorded by intersecting all the surveys trails pseudo absences are estimated as those locations i where no expert ever reported the target species presence ii whose distance is higher or equal to the spatial resolution parameter and iii that are non overlapping with presence locations at this resolution this process is reliable especially when a high number of survey data is available in the case of l sceleratus it estimated 184 absence locations in its known native range fig 1a 2 1 4 environmental data the biotic and abiotic characteristics possibly associated to the l sceleratus preferred habitat were not known a priori although suggestions about some parameters were found in scientific papers nader et al 2012 yaglioglu et al 2011 in such uncertainty scenarios the aquamaps consortium advises to use a set of 18 eco geographical environmental parameters table 1 whose combination is likely to be associated to species environmental preferences and thus to suitable habitat corsi et al 2000 these parameters include those indicated by literature studies for l sceleratus e g depth distance from land and water temperature etc further the aquamaps ecological niche model is constrained to this set of 18 features and is part of our method for these reasons all the environmental parameters listed in table 1 were taken into account the values of these parameters in the mediterranean sea were retrieved through the d4science geospatial catalogue 4 4 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab geo visualisation assante et al 2016 and belong to i the aquamaps consortium ii the copernicus marine environment monitoring service and iii the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa estimates for the same 18 parameters in 2050 were available too as produced by the aquamaps consortium using the echam model roeckner et al 1992 environmental data were attached to both the retrieved presence and pseudo absence locations of l sceleratus at 0 5 resolution which is the minimal resolution of all the models used by our method this operation was realised by means of the dataminer occurrence enrichment process 5 5 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses transducerers occurrence enrichment that associates environmental information to a number of locations producing a csv file containing an enriched data set 2 2 modelling 2 2 1 aquamaps the aquamaps ecological niche models kaschner et al 2006 estimate species habitat suitability under different environmental scenarios these presence only models incorporate scientific expert knowledge to account for known biases and limitations of marine species occurrence record data sets ready et al 2010 aquamaps includes two models to estimate the actual named native distribution of a species today 2017 and in 2050 and other two models to estimate potential habitat suitability in locations where the species has never been observed these models estimate species habitat at global scale with 0 5 resolution calculating the association between the observed locations and a predefined number of environmental variables table 1 this association is estimated by multiplying 18 envelope functions each traced on one environmental variable and by successively applying mechanistic assumptions in the form of rule based algorithms to produce a species presence probability distribution aquamaps is reliable if compared to other more complex approaches although its accuracy decreases when expert knowledge is missing ready et al 2010 the aquamaps native and potential algorithms for the 2050 scenarios use information about expected modifications in the global fao major fishing areas and in the overall change of the oceans water surface level these two processes rely on environmental variables estimations for 2050 under the ipcc sres a1b scenario nakicenovic and swart 2000 of a future of rapid global economic population and technological growth where the average surface temperature increases the ice concentration decreases and the salinity increases globally but decreases in some locations reyes 2015 an aquamaps potential habitat suitability model for l sceleratus in 2017 6 6 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses generators aquamaps suitable was trained using presence data in its native environment and the 18 environmental variables mentioned above and was projected on the mediterranean sea 2 2 2 artificial neural networks artificial neural networks anns are machine learning models made up of interconnected digital representations of neurons minsky 1963 these models have been used for long time in many domains patterson 1998 including ecological modelling lek and guégan 1999 olden et al 2004 lek et al 1996 gevrey et al 2003 because they allow to model non linear functions between an input vector of real numbers and an output vector of real numbers anns can also simulate automatic classifiers bishop 1995 that associate an input vector to one category among several in feed forward neural networks bebis and georgiopoulos 1994 the digital neurons of an ann are organised into layers where the first layer receives and processes the input vector directly and the last layer produces the output vector and intermediate layers are named hidden layers one layer is fully connected only to the next layer by means of weighted edges i e each neuron in one layer has edges only towards neurons in the next layer an ann can be trained to simulate a function on known data by means of a learning algorithm e g the backpropagation rumelhart et al 1986 the training algorithm adjusts the weights of the networks edges to produce expected output on the training data thereafter the ann is used with known input data that had not been included in the training set and the performance of the trained model is evaluated test session the number of hidden layers and neurons of the ann with the highest performance on the test set i e the best topology can be found by running the learning algorithm multiple times and by testing every topology more than once in order to avoid local minima issues özesmi et al 2006 one approach to find the best topology is the growing strategy bishop 1995 where neurons and layers are added as far as the error on the training set decreases down to a certain threshold which is empirically set to avoid overfitting of the ann to the training data although anns are powerful models one disadvantage in using them is that they do not provide the analytical form of the simulated function thus it is not possible to understand how the input variables are really combined within the network for the scopes of this paper an ann was trained 7 7 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses modellers feed forward ann on the same environmental features used by aquamaps extracted at the collected presence and absence records sets of the pufferfish in its native environment thus the ann had 18 input features one for each environmental parameter and one output neuron conceptually associated to a habitat suitability score ranging between 0 absence and 1 presence in the training phase of the ann the environmental features associated to the presence locations were used as positive cases on which the ann output was forced to output 1 whereas those associated to absence locations were used as negative cases with ann output forced to 0 topologies ranging between one and three hidden layers containing a variable number of neurons were explored using a growing strategy which required training 100 000 models the training and testing phases were based on a 80 train 20 test cross validation since data outside the mediterranean sea were used in this phase eventually the best model was identified as an ann containing one hidden layer with 100 neurons 2 2 3 maximum entropy maximum entropy maxent is a presence only machine learning model commonly used in ecological modelling phillips et al 2006 2004 phillips and dudik 2008 baldwin 2009 coro et al 2015 maxent approximates a probability density function defined on a vector space of environmental features with the constraint that this function is compliant with predefined mean values at presence locations and that the overall entropy of the probability distribution is maximum elith et al 2011 during the model s training phase maxent performs a relative maximisation of the entropy function h π x ln π x defined on the environmental features x at the provided presence locations with respect to the entropy function applied to the features of random points taken all over the area under study phillips et al 2006 presence points are taken as constraints during this maximisation and the model uses a linear combination of the features as π function where the coefficients of the combination are changed to reflect the influence of each variable in predicting the distribution of the species after the training phase these coefficients can be used to select the most influential environmental parameters given the known presence locations thus maxent can also be used to select the features that carry the highest quantity of information about the species according to the entropy maximisation process these features can be possibly used into other models to obtain new habitat projections coro et al 2015 one drawback of maxent is that it is very sensible to bias in the data thus its performance increases if the presence records are reliable elith and leathwick 2009 maxent was trained on the environmental features associated to the occurrence records of l sceleratus in its native environment 8 8 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses transducerers max ent niche modelling and was projected on the mediterranean sea afterwards the variables having highest association with the presence data of l sceleratus were identified and another maxent model was trained using only these variables in particular only variables with a coefficient value in the estimated π function higher than 5 of the maximum coefficient value were used in this model 2 2 4 support vector machines support vector machines svm boser et al 1992 a machine learning method also used in ecological modelling brown et al 1999 guo et al 2005 drake et al 2006 can be used to build a binary classifier vapnik 2013 schölkopf et al 1999 by projecting the input data onto a higher dimensional simpler features space through a kernel function and then by searching for a linear separation of this space in most of the applications this process consists in finding an optimal separation hyperplane that maximises the distance margin from the closest training instances support vectors thus training a svm usually requires maximising the margin by solving an optimisation problem constrained by linear relations these constraints may be relaxed allowing some classification error in order to avoid overfitting cristianini and shawe taylor 2000 svm can also be used to select the input features that carry the highest quantity of information for example through a leave one out lof process that records when the svm performance decreases during a cross validation assessment after one of the features is removed in turn chang and lin 2011 vilas et al 2014 three binary presence absence svm training processes based on a sequential minimal optimisation smo algorithm 9 9 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses transducerers support vector machines modelling chang and lin 2011 were executed on three different environmental features subsets associated to presence and absence locations of l sceleratus in its native range the first model used the complete set of 18 environmental features the second model used only the environmental variables selected by a leave one out process and the third model used the environmental features selected by the maxent process presented in the previous section the svm selected variables were not used to feed the other models because a lof selection process is usually beneficial only for a linear binary classifier all models were configured through pairwise coupling wu et al 2004 to give a continuous value between 0 absence and 1 presence in order to simulate a probability distribution a weighted svm training process suykens et al 2002 was used for each svm to account for imbalance between the number of absence and presence data and the environmental features were normalised between 0 and 1 as kernel function the gaussian radial basis function rbf was adopted because it is often used when the features space is large camps valls and bruzzone 2005 and uses a lower number of initialisation parameters gamma and c with respect to other kernels hsu et al 2003 using a 10 fold cross validation on our training set chang and lin 2011 gamma 22 and c 40 were found optimal values for these parameters the three binary svms were trained and consequently projected 10 10 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses transducerers support vector machines projector on the mediterranean sea 2 3 merging the habitat models the baseline enm models were merged together in order to take advantage of possible complementary indications about the species habitat distribution complementarity between these models was expected because they are complex by construction and their analytical forms are likely to be very different from each other due to the different training processes used and the involvement of random variables in order to obtain one overall merged probability distribution for the mediterranean sea at 0 5 resolution the normalised sum of the distributions was used i e p overall habitat x p aquamaps x p ann x p maxent x p maxent with me selected variables x p svm x p svm with me selected variables x p svm with svm lof variables x where p overall habitat x is the overall merged probability function of habitat suitability defined on the features domain x x normalised between 0 and 1 the involved distributions are those from the previous sections i e respectively aquamaps ann maxent maxent using maxent selected variables svm using all the environmental variables svm using maxent selected variables and svm using variables selected with the leave one out process the formula above gives the same weight to all models using the rationale that high suitability in a certain location could be due even just to one distribution estimating high probability there on the contrary using a multiplication between the functions would have led to very low or zero probability in most of the locations since there are only few locations where all models estimate non zero probability at the same time the resulting function represents the overall estimated habitat suitability of l sceleratus at 0 5 resolution in the mediterranean sea however a suitable habitat does not necessarily indicate a reachable habitat because of possible geographical survival and reproduction barriers thus the merged distribution needs to be converted into a more realistic geographical reachability map 2 4 estimating the actual geographical reachability distribution explicitly modelling all constraints that prevent l sceleratus to colonise suitable habitat is challenging our model starts by using real observations in the mediterranean sea as references it selects 20 of the species records in the mediterranean sea fig 1b as anchor points to trace several gaussian functions each centred on one recording site having maximum height equal to 1 and value decreasing with distance from the point the decrease rate of the functions depends on their widths and thus on their standard deviation one standard deviation was used for all the function and was set to the maximum distance between a 0 5 cell and all recording sites which was calculated to be 17 this means that also the farthest points in the mediterranean sea could be reached with a certain probability because these would have a gaussian value higher than 0 5 by construction in summary the gaussian functions represent a potential movement of the fish from one record site to another location and their decreasing trends simulate inertia to reach far locations possibly due to heterogeneous barriers finally the overall geographical reachability distribution was estimated by combining the gaussian functions and the overall habitat suitability distribution in particular each habitat suitability value at the 0 5 locations was multiplied by the value of a gaussian function centred on the closest record location providing the distance from this point as an argument to the function fig 3 p geographical distribution x p overall habitat x gaussian μ 0 σ 17 d where d min distance location x observations this distribution combines the species habitat suitability with the inertia in moving from real records it indicates high presence probability for a real observation only if also habitat suitability is high in that location indeed equal weight was given to gaussian functions and habitat suitability because they carry equally important information in fact a real observation refers to a sure event at certain time instant that could be even temporary or occurred by chance whereas habitat suitability indicates environmental conditions suited for the species to persist over time in that location further also locations far from these observations are allowed to have high presence probability if habitat suitability is high because locations as distant as the full width at half maximum of the gaussian function 1 177σ i e 20 have 0 5 value the resulting half degree distribution is referred to as the geographical reachability distribution 2 5 benchmark dynamic model the stability and the performance of the geographical reachability distribution was checked against an alternative model referred to as the dynamic distribution this model is more compliant with common approaches to invasive species modelling section 1 where the native habitat of a species is allowed to evolve in time up to a convergence status in particular an iterative process was created which goes through the following steps 1 produce a native habitat map according to a niche modelling algorithm 2 apply gaussian distance function weighting using a σ value representing the geographical extent that can be reached at each step of the dynamic evolution 3 apply a 0 5 cut off threshold to the geographical reachability distribution to produce new pseudo presence locations 4 produce and project a new niche model after adding the new pseudo presence locations to the training set 5 start a new cycle from point 2 6 end the process when the distribution does not change after four cycles this loop requires two parameters to be fixed before the start the niche modelling algorithm to use and the σ of the gaussian function to find the best combination of these parameters the accuracy of all the baseline models was calculated at the variation of σ on the 20 of the observation records in the mediterranean sea the combination of σ 2 and the svm using variables selected with the leave one out process provided the best parametrisation of the loop this σ value indicates that locations up to 2 35 equal to 1 177σ i e 200 km from the observations at one step can become new pseudo presence locations in the next step the dynamic model converges to a stable distribution after 26 steps 11 11 an animation representing this convergence process is available at http data d4science org wg1qtfhss1k2qy90wxe5nvnaznroruq4bk44y05nvwdhbwjqnstis0n6yz0 fig 4d each step of the loop could be interpreted as a time interval but it is not easy to establish how much time corresponds to a maximum movement of about 2 of l sceleratus however based on the average yearly distances between first observations in the mediterranean sea a 2 distance may correspond to the movement of the pufferfish in one year 2 6 agreement performance and impact measurements in order to numerically estimate the agreement between the trained models an automatic maps comparison process was used 12 12 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses evaluators maps comparison coro et al 2014 2016b which calculates the agreement between two maps at a time a 0 2 probability threshold was used on the maps to indicate when two models assessed together that a species was present or absent in a certain comparison location this threshold was selected as the one resulting in the highest coverage by all models of the 20 of the complete set of expert reviewed pufferfish mediterranean records section 2 1 2 thus the threshold represents a sensibly non zero probability of habitat suitability or presence the result of this maps comparison process is a matrix reporting pairwise agreement percentages in order to estimate the accuracies of the models 80 of the expert reviewed pufferfish mediterranean records were used in particular a model s accuracy was calculated as the percentage of records on which it reported sensibly non zero probability 0 2 finally an impact or risk indicator for a mediterranean area was calculated similar to other studies mcgeoch et al 2006 as the normalised density of sensibly non zero probability locations falling into the area 2 7 applicability to other species the presented method is in principle applicable to other invasive species in order to monitor their spread in any given region in fact our general process can be summarised in a number of steps that are independent of the selected species 1 retrieve presence data for the species in its native habitat 2 estimate absence locations for the species in its native habitat 3 enrich the presence absence data set with environmental variables information 4 train different habitat suitability models using the enriched data set as a training set 5 merge the models using a normalised sum of their projections on the invaded area 6 retrieve observation records in the invaded area 7 produce a geographical reachability distribution by multiplying the merged habitat model for a set of distance based gaussian functions each centred on the observations in the invaded area 8 assess the resulting model s performance with independent observations in the invaded area 9 project the model onto official subdivisions of the invaded area in order to estimate impact indicators this process is complex and requires access to species data computational facilities and storage of intermediate and final results thus it requires an e infrastructure oriented to open science that guarantees fast data retrieval direct feeding of models with data and fast estimation of the best models 3 results and discussion in this section the projections of the models developed for the pufferfish are presented the models performance is quantitatively assessed on known mediterranean records of the species and the discrepancies between the geographical reachability and the dynamic distributions are highlighted and checked against previous studies finally an impact indicator is reported for different subdivisions of the mediterranean sea 3 1 models projections the projection of the aquamaps model on the mediterranean sea predicts suitable habitat especially in coastal areas fig 2 a likewise in the ann model coastal proximity influences high habitat suitability but the resulting distribution is different from the aquamaps one due to a more complex combination of environmental variables in the neural network fig 2b the maxent model using all environmental variables estimates high suitability for the eastern mediterranean basin fig 2c the variables having highest association with the presence data according to maxent are reported in table 1 the maxent model trained only with these variables agrees with the previous maxent model about the habitat suitability of the eastern basin and additionally reports westwards suitability especially around the southern italian coasts fig 2d discrepancies between these two maxent models are visible off the libyan and turkey coasts and in the centre of the mediterranean sea the three svm models are different from each other the model trained with all environmental variable reports high suitability in the black sea fig 2e the model using environmental variables selected by a leave one out process table 1 estimates high suitability in a large part of the mediterranean sea except in the northern adriatic sea and in the southern france coasts fig 2f the model using the environmental variables selected by the maxent process estimates high suitability in greece and turkey coasts and in the western mediterranean coasts around the strait of gibraltar fig 2g it can be visually recognised that the trained baseline models predict high probability in complementary locations fig 2 this is confirmed by the calculation of the agreements between the models which never reaches 100 table 2 a since all the compared maps have complementary aspects it is not possible to select a priori one map instead of the other as definitive habitat estimation thus the production of a merged distribution representing the overall habitat suitability of l sceleratus in the mediterranean sea is justified this merged distribution indicates suitable habitat in most of the mediterranean sea except in some areas in the centre and in the western basin fig 4a the geographical reachability distribution presents complementary aspects with respect to the baseline habitat distributions fig 4b and table 2b another geographical reachability map was produced by training the model with environmental data projected in 2050 section 2 1 4 and by using currently known locations in the mediterranean sea to build gaussian functions the resulting distribution is very similar to the previous one fig 4c thus the first produced geographical reachability distribution represents a stable average scenario for l sceleratus the techniques used in our experiment mostly belong to the class of correlative approaches to niche modelling pearson 2012 and thus do not explicitly model the bio physiological characteristics of l sceleratus nevertheless an a posteriori statistical analysis was made across all models focussing on the 18 environmental variables values in the highest probability locations 0 8 this analysis helps inferring the environmental conditions the species prefers in particular it reveals that for all models the average surface temperature is around 19 0 2 and the average difference with sea bottom temperature is 5 average sea surface salinity is 34 5 0 3 psu except for aquamaps 38 0 03 psu and the average difference between sea surface salinity and sea bottom salinity is always around 2 primary production is averagely 530 g c m 2 yr 1 with high values 1100 g c m 2 yr 1 reached by few locations distance from land is always below 200 km with 80 km average for all models except for ann 32 km and aquamaps 31 km finally average water column depth is 1150 m except for ann 207 m and aquamaps 407 m however all models also include high probability locations in shallow waters down to 1 m and averagely deep waters up to 3000 m 3 2 performance evaluation accuracy was calculated for all models as described in section 2 6 table 3 the geographical reachability distribution gains the highest performance in predicting the mediterranean records 98 whereas the dynamic model reaches lower performance 83 all the baseline models have high performance on predicting observation records however a visual comparison fig 2 suggests that most of these models possibly overestimate the presence locations nevertheless there is useful information in this overestimation for example the svm distribution in fig 2f assigns non zero values to most of the mediterranean sea half degree locations and may seem uninformative but this distribution also includes a westward decreasing gradient which is crucial information when introduced in the merged model overall the percentages in tables 2 and 3 suggest that the geographical reachability distribution i is complementary to the other maps ii presents stability with respect to a 2050 scenario and iii has high performance at predicting real observations in the mediterranean sea 3 3 discrepancies evaluation the dynamic distribution has overall 83 agreement with the geographical reachability distribution and is generally similar to this distribution fig 4b and d however the overall performance of the dynamic model on known records in the mediterranean sea is lower and there are specific discrepancy areas highlighted in fig 4d that need further analysis overall unlike the geographical reachability distribution the dynamic distribution predicts species invasion also up to the continental edge where currently there are very few records çinar et al 2014 the geographical reachability distribution predicts medium to high occurrence probability 0 4 0 6 in eastern mediterranean e g aegean sea and cyprus sea southern ionian sea albanian coasts and southern tyrrhenian sea sicily tunisian and libyan coasts whereas it predicts the highest probability 0 8 in several coastal areas e g south turkey south greece and east libya indeed the highest abundance of l sceleratus has been recorded in the eastern mediterranean nader et al 2012 michailidis 2010 also in the southern tyrrhenian sea between malta and the tunisian coast more than 80 individuals have been reported in the last 5 years azzurro et al 2014b in the bosporus few records have been officially reported vacchi et al 2007 which agrees with the geographical reachability distribution on a possible future presence in this area despite the opposite indication by the dynamic distribution as for the italian coasts observations have been increasingly reported around sicily azzurro et al 2014a 2016 in the central tyrrhenian sea jribi et al 2012 and in the southern adriatic sea dulčić and dragičević 2014 nader et al 2012 still in agreement with the geographical reachability distribution on the contrary although both the compared distributions indicate lower invasion probability in the western mediterranean sea the fish has been observed very recently along the algerian and southern spanish coasts dailianis et al 2016 katsanevakis et al 2014 but it still early to assess a population establishment 3 4 impact indicators the impact indicator described in section 2 6 was calculated for the geographical reachability distribution after its projection onto three reference subdivision sets of the mediterranean sea corresponding to different ecological and economical criteria a coloured gradient was used to give direct visual understanding of the impact of the pufferfish on these areas a first indicator was calculated on the official major fishing areas in the mediterranean sea of the food and agriculture organisation of the united nations fao this indicator fig 5 a has a westward decreasing gradient and estimates low medium impact 0 2 0 6 in the tyrrhenian and ionian seas italian tunisian and libyan coasts and high impact 0 8 1 around the coasts of greece turkey lebanon and egypt a second indicator was calculated on the exclusive economic zones associated to the united nations convention on the law of the sea lowe 1990 which define the regions where a state has special rights for the exploration and use of marine resources although eezs are not accepted by several international organisations including fao they may give insight on how the mediterranean countries could be economically impacted by the l sceleratus invasion in particular fig 5b highly impacted areas are highlighted in the eastern mediterranean sea e g in greece and cyprus whose situation is already known to be alarming and in the south i e malta and tunisia finally a third indicator with higher resolution was calculated on the general subdivisions of the general fisheries commission for the mediterranean sea gsas these areas are commonly used to monitor and manage marine fishery resources in the mediterranean sea and can better highlight the impact of l sceleratus on smaller areas fig 5c again a westward decreasing gradient is observed and high impact zones are now highlighted in southern sicily in the ionian sea and in southern adriatic sea further impact in greece is reported to be higher in the aegean sea than in the ionic side 4 conclusions in this paper a method to estimate the spread of the silver cheeked toad fish l sceleratus in the mediterranean sea has been presented seven niche models based on machine learning algorithms were trained and merged together the method generates an overall geographical reachability distribution by means of a distance weighting process that takes real observations into account the reliability of this method has been assessed with respect to a reference dynamic model and mediterranean observation records of the pufferfish a risk estimate of the invasion has been reported as the density of non zero probability locations falling in different subdivisions of the mediterranean sea related to marine resources exploitation a general westward decreasing impact pattern has been highlighted but high risk zones have been predicted also in the middle and in the south of the mediterranean sea e g sicily malta and tunisia the overall depicted scenario is that l sceleratus is a great risk for fisheries and consequently on health security of many mediterranean countries in the near future further our estimated distribution foresees the invasion by the pufferfish of the bosporus which could enable it to spread in the black sea thus strategies such as selective fishing to decrease its population should be considered especially in the most likely future impacted areas in order to stem this spread and prevent severe economic damages in this context our maps can support these strategies and can also help fisheries researchers to advise managers and decision makers this experiment used an e infrastructure for every step of the method from data retrieval to models training and projection the e infrastructure enabled the authors in their collaboration and every step of the experiment has been made repeatable because it is published as a

folderid nk0ymhvvdwxcwvzhm00xck5qrgd2n3q1dnn6zk1yudnhrjjsmnavchzhshg1uxnocuzomelin0zutktycdfuqw finally the presented approach is general enough to be applied to other invasive fish acknowledgments

occurrence records of l sceleratus from the elnais project 
25325,invasive species from the suez canal also named lessepsian species often have an ecological and financial impact on marine life fisheries human well being and health in the mediterranean sea among these the silver cheeked toad fish lagocephalus sceleratus gmelin 1789 has rapidly colonised the eastern mediterranean basin and is currently moving westwards this pufferfish has a highly opportunistic behaviour it attacks fish captured in nets and lines and seriously damages fishing gears and catch it is a highly toxic species with no immediate economic value for the mediterranean market although it currently represents 4 of the weight of the total artisanal catches consequently the possible effects on mediterranean fisheries and health require to enhance our understanding about the future geographical distribution of this pufferfish in the whole basin in this paper an overall habitat suitability map and an effective geographical spread map for l sceleratus at mediterranean scale are produced by using cloud computing based algorithms to merge seven machine learning approaches further the potential impact of the species is estimated for several mediterranean sea subdivisions the major fishing areas of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations the economic exclusive zones and the subdivisions of the general fisheries commission for the mediterranean sea our results suggest that without an intervention l sceleratus will continue its rapid spread and will likely have a high impact on fisheries the presented method is generic and can be applied to other invasive species it is based on an open science approach and all processes are freely available as web services keywords ecological niche modelling aquamaps artificial neural networks invasive species maximum entropy support vector machines lagocephalus sceleratus species distribution models 1 introduction the number of species in the mediterranean sea arriving through the suez canal also named lessepsian species continues to increase nader et al 2012 golani 2010 recent studies estimate that more than 5 of the marine species are non native and 13 5 are invasive including fish invertebrates and macrophytes galil 2009 zenetos 2010 fricke et al 2015 zenetos et al 2015 golani 2010 these invasive species shine et al 2000 settle in the new habitat increase in number and spread in the area potentially threatening native biological diversity galil et al 2015 coll et al 2010 and economy galil 2008 thus they require particular effort by supervising organisations in order to monitor and predict their spread among these species the silver cheeked toad fish lagocephalus sceleratus gmelin 1789 is of particular concern the first reliable records in the mediterranean sea date back to 2003 but the number of observations has rapidly grown so that it is considered one of the fastest expanding invasive species in the basin akyol et al 2005 peristeraki et al 2006 it owes its success to the high growth and reproduction rate the lack of natural predators the ability to exploit food resources and the capacity to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions yaglioglu et al 2011 it has a skin without scales with dark spots on top and lateral silver bands this species is common in the red sea belongs to the tetraodontidae family is extremely poisonous and can be lethal to humans if eaten due to high level of tetrodotoxin neurotoxin ttx present in several organs e g the liver and excreted from the skin as a repellent after swelling yaglioglu et al 2011 nader et al 2012 it usually prefers shallow waters and medium high water temperature which is correlated to faster ttx uptake thus climate change could be beneficial for this species particularly in the mediterranean sea nader et al 2012 scientific studies have estimated the potential impact of l sceleratus on economic and human health in the eastern mediterranean sea ünal et al 2015 2017 in this region this is now one of the most important species in biomass on posidonia oceanica meadows being a major problem to artisanal fisheries considering that it damages fishing gears e g nets and lines and predates heavily on local stocks of squids and octopuses kalogirou et al 2010 however these studies do not report definitive ecological and economic future impact assessments and usually involve more qualitative than quantitative predictions overall they indicate that the fish currently represents the 4 of the weight of the total artisanal catches nader et al 2012 and has already negatively impacted the economy of some mediterranean countries ünal et al 2017 also since 2003 several episodes of death and serious illness have been recorded after fish consumption since fishermen and other people usually cannot identify this relatively new species bentur et al 2008 kheifets et al 2012 this scenario calls for priority actions to prevent detect and possibly eradicate l sceleratus zenetos et al 2016 especially considering that the suez canal capacity is being enlarged searight 2016 and climate change is facilitating the invasion galil et al 2014 ices 2007 fao 2007 one approach could be to use selective fishing especially on big individuals and localised precautionary actions in those areas where the pufferfish will possibly move and settle in the next years ünal et al 2017 therefore a map of the ongoing invasion pattern could guide the development of preventive and corrective actions zenetos et al 2015 2016 and could also help filling a gap between research and management about this fish ünal et al 2015 in the past decade there has been a growing interest in the application of ecological niche models enms to predict the distribution of invasive species guisan et al 2014 different approaches have been used based on the evaluation of the niche differences between a species native region and the invaded region peterson 2003 barbosa et al 2012 leidenberger et al 2015 in some cases these approaches also take into account how climate change facilitates the species spread into the invaded region sax et al 2007 thuiller et al 2005 enms based approaches to invasive species modelling use a varied range of models including envelope based sutherst 2000 jeschke and strayer 2008 statistical ficetola et al 2007 bidegain et al 2015 and machine learning models peterson and robins 2003 most of these models estimate an association between a species presence and a number of environmental parameters and produce a probability distribution this is then projected onto a certain area over time to get a dynamic visualisation of the invasion mellin et al 2016 carlos júnior et al 2015 the most used enm in this context is the genetic algorithm for rule set production garp stockwell 1999 which uses a machine learning approach peterson and vieglais 2001 ganeshaiah et al 2003 sanchez flores et al 2008 underwood et al 2004 another widely used model is the maximum entropy presence only model ficetola et al 2007 west et al 2016 whereas presence absence models e g artificial neural networks kulhanek et al 2011 and support vector machines pouteau et al 2011 sadeghi et al 2012 are less frequent because of the scarcity of reliable absence data usually alternative enms based approaches have complementary features which capture different characteristics of a species invasion elith and graham 2009 thus it is common to compare or merge the output of different models in order to produce a final spread estimate castelar et al 2015 farashi and najafabadi 2015 padalia et al 2014 sobek swant et al 2012 most of the cited studies assume climate niche conservatism pearman et al 2008 peterson and vieglais 2001 i e the enm calculated using data from the species native environment is supposed to successfully predict invasion in exotic areas petitpierre et al 2012 strubbe et al 2013 castelar et al 2015 however other works have highlighted that the climatic niche may change during the invasion broennimann et al 2007 lauzeral et al 2011 which can overturn the conservatism assumption shabani and kumar 2015 further enms usually do not account for the effects of species interactions and possible geographical dispersal limitations thus the results of approaches purely based on enms should be interpreted and used with caution sax et al 2007 in this paper an approach is proposed to estimate the potential ecological niche and the potential geographical distribution of l sceleratus in the mediterranean sea its spread is predicted up to a stable distribution based on the algorithmic merge of the output of seven machine learning models that each estimate the potential niche or habitat suitability further an effective geographical distribution is estimated and a potential impact indicator is produced for different subdivisions of the mediterranean sea which include the major fishing areas of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao the economic exclusive zones attard 1987 and the general subdivisions of the general fisheries commission for the mediterranean sea the predictive value of the generated geographical distribution is assessed in a comparison with real observation records in the mediterranean sea and with a dynamic model that simulates the spread of the pufferfish over time our analysis follows an open science approach hey et al 2009 and all models are available as a service under a representational standard every step can be reproduced repeated and reused for other invasive species or with different ancillary data 2 material and methods in this section the used technology and data section 2 1 and the baseline models that constitute our method are described section 2 2 further our method to estimate the geographical reachability distribution of l sceleratus is presented sections 2 3 and 2 4 a dynamic model is also described section 2 5 which is used in section 3 as a reference to assess the performance of our method moreover the metrics used to calculate the models performance their mutual similarities and a risk indicator for the mediterranean sea are presented section 2 6 finally the generality of our method and its applicability to other invasive species is discussed section 2 7 2 1 technology and data 2 1 1 computational and data access platform our method requires the training of machine learning models with a large set of alternative parametrisations the goal is to find the optimal model i e the model with the best performance on a test set the experiment reported in this paper required to train 150 000 parametrisations which was very time consuming and computationally demanding to overcome this a cloud computing platform was used to train many alternative parametrisations of a given machine learning model at the same time in particular the gcube dataminer open source system 1 1 freely accessible and usable after registration at https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner coro et al 2017 was used for this big data processing and to interoperate with the services of the d4science distributed e infrastructure national research council of italy 2016 d4science facilitates data preparation and processing and fosters collaboration among scientists according to open science paradigms hey et al 2009 this set up includes assante et al 2016 i collaborative experimentation spaces where processes can be re executed and parametrised several times by others ii services for data sharing between users and iii application of standards for data and processes representation the dataminer represents and stores all the trained models and their respective parametrisations in a standard and exportable ontological format prov o lebo et al 2013 which summarises the set of input output data and metadata that enable any other authorised user to reproduce and repeat the experiment provenance of the computation all models are published in the d4science e infrastructure as open source and free to use web services under the web processing service standard of the open geospatial consortium wps schut and whiteside 2007 this maximises re usability because wps standardises the representation of input parameters and output through xml descriptions of their types and expected contents dataminer parallelises models training on a network of 100 machines choosing the best computational configuration among a range of powerful multi core virtual machines ubuntu 14 04 5 lts 86 64 with 16

high performance coro et al 2017 this platform was selected because we wanted our method to be used by other scientists possibly on other invasive species through the repeatability reproducibility and re usability of each step of our method 2 1 2 occurrence records occurrence records of l sceleratus were retrieved and harmonised through the species product discovery spd service of the d4science e infrastructure 2 2 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab species discovery candela et al 2015 from biodiversity data collections such as obis vanden berghe et al 2010 gbif lane and edwards 2007 and the catalogue of life wilson 2003 the spd attaches additional information to presence coordinates i e the ownership of the observation its source e g human observation specimen etc and a flag stating if the record underwent expert review this allows retrieving only data having good quality because they were checked by an expert spd produced a set of 284 expert reviewed records for l sceleratus from its native habitat environment fig 1 a locations in the mediterranean sea were excluded because this data set was used in model training and could not contain locations in the projection testing area the spd records for the mediterranean sea were combined with records collected from a manual literature review of published articles and grey literature fig 1b a total of 263 mediterranean records sometimes referring to several individuals was obtained where the first reliable records dated back to 2003 in order to build up our definitive distribution of l sceleratus 20 of these data were used whereas the remaining 80 were used to validate the model sections 2 2 and 3 this choice was due to the fact that we wanted to use the mediterranean observations to evaluate the performance of our models rather than to train the models in fact this approach makes the models less sensitive to prior information about the distribution of the species in the invaded region and it also makes our approach applicable to other species for which few observations are available in the invaded area 2 1 3 estimating absence locations some models used by our method require to estimate locations of habitat unsuitability of l sceleratus to this aim a dataminer process to estimate pseudo absence locations was used 3 3 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses transducerers absence generation from obis coro et al 2016a this process performs a statistical analysis on scientific survey data in the obis data collection grassle 2000 it accesses obis through rest apis and uses four input parameters i a time frame for the observations ii a spatial resolution for the estimated absence locations iii the geographical area where to estimate the absence locations and iv an observation frequency threshold this last parameter is used to retrieve all the surveys hosting species experts on the vessels who observed l sceleratus in specific locations with higher monthly frequency than this value in these surveys locations where the experts reported only other species than the target one are recorded by intersecting all the surveys trails pseudo absences are estimated as those locations i where no expert ever reported the target species presence ii whose distance is higher or equal to the spatial resolution parameter and iii that are non overlapping with presence locations at this resolution this process is reliable especially when a high number of survey data is available in the case of l sceleratus it estimated 184 absence locations in its known native range fig 1a 2 1 4 environmental data the biotic and abiotic characteristics possibly associated to the l sceleratus preferred habitat were not known a priori although suggestions about some parameters were found in scientific papers nader et al 2012 yaglioglu et al 2011 in such uncertainty scenarios the aquamaps consortium advises to use a set of 18 eco geographical environmental parameters table 1 whose combination is likely to be associated to species environmental preferences and thus to suitable habitat corsi et al 2000 these parameters include those indicated by literature studies for l sceleratus e g depth distance from land and water temperature etc further the aquamaps ecological niche model is constrained to this set of 18 features and is part of our method for these reasons all the environmental parameters listed in table 1 were taken into account the values of these parameters in the mediterranean sea were retrieved through the d4science geospatial catalogue 4 4 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab geo visualisation assante et al 2016 and belong to i the aquamaps consortium ii the copernicus marine environment monitoring service and iii the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa estimates for the same 18 parameters in 2050 were available too as produced by the aquamaps consortium using the echam model roeckner et al 1992 environmental data were attached to both the retrieved presence and pseudo absence locations of l sceleratus at 0 5 resolution which is the minimal resolution of all the models used by our method this operation was realised by means of the dataminer occurrence enrichment process 5 5 https services

information to a number of locations producing a csv file containing an enriched data set 2 2 modelling 2 2 1 aquamaps the aquamaps ecological niche models kaschner et al 2006 estimate species habitat suitability under different environmental scenarios these presence only models incorporate scientific expert knowledge to account for known biases and limitations of marine species occurrence record data sets ready et al 2010 aquamaps includes two models to estimate the actual named native distribution of a species today 2017 and in 2050 and other two models to estimate potential habitat suitability in locations where the species has never been observed these models estimate species habitat at global scale with 0 5 resolution calculating the association between the observed locations and a predefined number of environmental variables table 1 this association is estimated by multiplying 18 envelope functions each traced on one environmental variable and by successively applying mechanistic assumptions in the form of rule based algorithms to produce a species presence probability distribution aquamaps is reliable if compared to other more complex approaches although its accuracy decreases when expert knowledge is missing ready et al 2010 the aquamaps native and potential algorithms for the 2050 scenarios use information about expected modifications in the global fao major fishing areas and in the overall change of the oceans water surface level these two processes rely on environmental variables estimations for 2050 under the ipcc sres a1b scenario nakicenovic

variables mentioned above and was projected on the mediterranean sea 2 2 2 artificial neural networks artificial neural networks anns are machine learning models made up of interconnected digital representations of neurons minsky 1963 these models have been used for long time in many domains patterson 1998 including ecological modelling lek and guégan 1999 olden et al 2004 lek et al 1996 gevrey et al 2003 because they allow to model non linear functions between an input vector of real numbers and an output vector of real numbers anns can also simulate automatic classifiers bishop 1995 that associate an input vector to one category among several in feed forward neural networks bebis and georgiopoulos 1994 the digital neurons of an ann are organised into layers where the first layer receives and processes the input vector directly and the last layer produces the output vector and intermediate layers are named hidden layers one layer is fully connected only to the next layer by means of weighted edges i e each neuron in one layer has edges only towards neurons in the next layer an ann can be trained to simulate a function on known data by means of a learning algorithm e g the backpropagation rumelhart et al 1986 the training algorithm adjusts the weights of the networks edges to produce expected output on the training data thereafter the ann is used with known input data that had not been included in the training set and the performance of the trained model is evaluated test session the number of hidden layers and neurons of the ann with the highest performance on the test set i e the best topology can be found by running the learning algorithm multiple times and by testing every topology more than once in order to avoid local minima issues özesmi et al 2006 one approach to find the best topology is the growing strategy bishop 1995 where neurons and layers are added as far as the error on the training set decreases down to a certain threshold which is empirically set to avoid overfitting of the ann to the training data although anns are powerful models one disadvantage in using them is that they do not provide the analytical form of the simulated function thus it is not possible to understand how the input variables are really combined within the network for the scopes of this paper an ann was trained 7 7 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses modellers feed forward ann on the same environmental features used by aquamaps extracted at the collected presence and absence records sets of the pufferfish in its native environment thus the ann had 18 input features one for each environmental parameter and one output neuron conceptually associated to a habitat suitability score ranging between 0 absence and 1 presence in the training phase of the ann the environmental features associated to the presence locations were used as positive cases on which the ann output was forced to output 1 whereas those associated to absence locations were used as negative cases with ann output forced to 0 topologies ranging between one and three hidden layers containing a variable number of neurons were explored using a growing strategy which required training 100 000 models the training and testing phases were based on a 80 train 20 test cross validation since data outside the mediterranean sea were used in this phase eventually the best model was identified as an ann containing one hidden layer with 100 neurons 2 2 3 maximum entropy maximum entropy maxent is a presence only machine learning model commonly used in ecological modelling phillips et al 2006 2004 phillips and dudik 2008 baldwin 2009 coro et al 2015 maxent approximates a probability density function defined on a vector space of environmental features with the constraint that this function is compliant with predefined mean values at presence locations and that the overall entropy of the probability distribution is maximum elith et al 2011 during the model s training phase maxent performs a relative maximisation of the entropy function h π x ln π x defined on the environmental features x at the provided presence locations with respect to the entropy function applied to the features of random points taken all over the area under study phillips et al 2006 presence points are taken as constraints during this maximisation and the model uses a linear combination of the features as π function where the coefficients of the combination are changed to reflect the influence of each variable in predicting the distribution of the species after the training phase these coefficients can be used to select the most influential environmental parameters given the known presence locations thus maxent can also be used to select the features that carry the highest quantity of information about the species according to the entropy maximisation process these features can be possibly used into other models to obtain new habitat projections coro et al 2015 one drawback of maxent is that it is very sensible to bias in the data thus its performance increases if the presence records are reliable elith and leathwick 2009 maxent was trained on the environmental features associated to the occurrence records of l sceleratus in its native environment 8 8 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses transducerers max ent niche modelling and was projected on the mediterranean sea afterwards the variables having highest association with the presence data of l sceleratus were identified and another maxent model was trained using only these variables in particular only variables with a coefficient value in the estimated π function higher than 5 of the maximum coefficient value were used in this model 2 2 4 support vector machines support vector machines svm boser et al 1992 a machine learning method also used in ecological modelling brown et al 1999 guo et al 2005 drake et al 2006 can be used to build a binary classifier vapnik 2013 schölkopf et al 1999 by projecting the input data onto a higher dimensional simpler features space through a kernel function and then by searching for a linear separation of this space in most of the applications this process consists in finding an optimal separation hyperplane that maximises the distance margin from the closest training instances support vectors thus training a svm usually requires maximising the margin by solving an optimisation problem constrained by linear relations these constraints may be relaxed allowing some classification error in order to avoid overfitting cristianini and shawe taylor 2000 svm can also be used to select the input features that carry the highest quantity of information for example through a leave one out lof process that records when the svm performance decreases during a cross validation assessment after one of the features is removed in turn chang and lin 2011 vilas et al 2014 three binary presence absence svm training processes based on a sequential minimal optimisation smo algorithm 9 9 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses transducerers support vector machines modelling chang and lin 2011 were executed on three different environmental features subsets associated to presence and absence locations of l sceleratus in its native range the first model used the complete set of 18 environmental features the second model used only the environmental variables selected by a leave one out process and the third model used the environmental features selected by the maxent process presented in the previous section the svm selected variables were not used to feed the other models because a lof selection process is usually beneficial only for a linear binary classifier all models were configured through pairwise coupling wu et al 2004 to give a continuous value between 0 absence and 1 presence in order to simulate a probability distribution a weighted svm training process suykens et al 2002 was used for each svm to account for imbalance between the number of absence and presence

the baseline enm models were merged together in order to take advantage of possible complementary indications about the species habitat distribution complementarity between these models was expected because they are complex by construction and their analytical forms are likely to be very different from each other due to the different training processes used and the involvement of random variables in order to obtain one overall merged probability distribution for the mediterranean sea at 0 5 resolution the normalised sum of the distributions was used i e p overall habitat x p aquamaps x p ann x p maxent x p maxent with me selected variables x p svm x p svm with me selected variables x p svm with svm lof variables x where p overall habitat x is the overall merged probability function of habitat suitability defined on the features domain x x normalised between 0 and 1 the involved distributions are those from the previous sections i e respectively aquamaps ann maxent maxent using maxent selected variables svm using all the environmental variables svm using maxent selected variables and svm using variables selected with the leave one out process the formula above gives the same weight to all models using the rationale that high suitability in a certain location could be due even just to one distribution estimating high probability there on the contrary using a multiplication between the functions would have led to very low or zero probability in most of the locations since there are only few locations where all models estimate non zero probability at the same time the resulting function represents the overall estimated habitat suitability of l sceleratus at 0 5 resolution in the mediterranean sea however a suitable habitat does not necessarily indicate a reachable habitat because of possible geographical survival and reproduction barriers thus the merged distribution needs to be converted into a more realistic geographical reachability map 2 4 estimating the actual geographical reachability distribution explicitly modelling all constraints that prevent l sceleratus to colonise suitable habitat is challenging our model starts by using real observations in the mediterranean sea as references it selects 20 of the species records in the mediterranean sea fig 1b as anchor points to trace several gaussian functions each centred on one recording site having maximum height equal to 1 and value decreasing with distance from the point the decrease rate of the functions depends on their widths and thus on their standard deviation one standard deviation was used for all the function and was set to the maximum distance between a 0 5 cell and all recording sites which was calculated to be 17 this means that also the farthest points in the mediterranean sea could be reached with a certain probability because these would have a gaussian value higher than 0 5 by construction in summary the gaussian functions represent a potential movement of the fish from one record site to another location and their decreasing trends simulate inertia to reach far locations possibly due to heterogeneous barriers finally the overall geographical reachability distribution was estimated by combining the gaussian functions and the overall habitat suitability distribution in particular each habitat suitability value at the 0 5 locations was multiplied by the value of a gaussian function centred on the closest record location providing the distance from this point as an argument to the function fig 3 p geographical distribution x p overall habitat x gaussian μ 0 σ 17 d where d min distance location x observations this distribution combines the species habitat suitability with the inertia in moving from real records it indicates high presence probability for a real observation only if also habitat suitability is high in that location indeed equal weight was given to gaussian functions and habitat suitability because they carry equally important information in fact a real observation refers to a sure event at certain time instant that could be even temporary or occurred by chance whereas habitat suitability indicates environmental conditions suited for the species to persist over time in that location further also locations far from these observations are allowed to have high presence probability if habitat suitability is high because locations as distant as the full width at half maximum of the gaussian function 1 177σ i e 20 have 0 5 value the resulting half degree distribution is referred to as the geographical reachability distribution 2 5 benchmark dynamic model the stability and the performance of the geographical reachability distribution was checked against an alternative model referred to as the dynamic distribution this model is more compliant with common approaches to invasive species modelling section 1 where the native habitat of a species is allowed to evolve in time up to a convergence status in particular an iterative process was created which goes through the following steps 1 produce a native habitat map according to a niche modelling algorithm 2 apply gaussian distance function weighting using a σ value representing the geographical extent that can be reached at each step of the dynamic evolution 3 apply a 0 5 cut off threshold to the geographical reachability distribution to produce new pseudo presence locations 4 produce and project a new niche model after adding the new pseudo presence locations to the training set 5 start a new cycle from point 2 6 end the process when the distribution does not change after four cycles this loop requires two parameters to be fixed before the start the niche modelling algorithm to use and the σ of the gaussian function to find the best combination of these parameters the accuracy of all the baseline models was calculated at the variation of σ on the 20 of the observation records in the mediterranean sea the combination of σ 2 and the svm using variables selected with the leave one out process provided the best parametrisation of the loop this σ value indicates that locations up to 2 35 equal to 1 177σ i e 200 km from the observations at one step can become new pseudo presence locations in the next step the dynamic model converges to a stable distribution after 26 steps 11 11 an animation representing this convergence process is available at http data d4science org wg1qtfhss1k2qy90wxe5nvnaznroruq4bk44y05nvwdhbwjqnstis0n6yz0 fig 4d each step of the loop could be interpreted as a time interval but it is not easy to establish how much time corresponds to a maximum movement of about 2 of l sceleratus however based on the average yearly distances between first observations in the mediterranean sea a 2 distance may correspond to the movement of the pufferfish in one year 2 6 agreement performance and impact measurements in order to numerically estimate the agreement between the trained models an automatic maps comparison process was used 12 12 https services d4science org group biodiversitylab data miner operatorid org gcube dataanalysis wps statisticalmanager synchserver mappedclasses evaluators maps comparison coro et al 2014 2016b which calculates the agreement between two maps at a time a 0 2 probability threshold was used on the maps to indicate when two models assessed together that a species was present or absent in a certain comparison location this threshold was selected as the one resulting in the highest coverage by all models of the 20 of the complete set of expert reviewed pufferfish mediterranean records section 2 1 2 thus the threshold represents a sensibly non zero probability of habitat suitability or presence the result of this maps comparison process is a matrix reporting pairwise agreement percentages in order to estimate the accuracies of the models 80 of the expert reviewed pufferfish mediterranean records were used in particular a model s accuracy was calculated as the percentage of records on which it reported sensibly non zero probability 0 2 finally an impact or risk indicator for a mediterranean area was calculated similar to other studies mcgeoch et al 2006 as the normalised density of sensibly non zero probability locations falling into the area 2 7 applicability to other species the presented method is in principle applicable to other invasive species in order to monitor their spread in any given region in fact our general process can be summarised in a number of steps that are independent of the selected species 1 retrieve presence data for the species in its native habitat 2 estimate absence locations for the species in its native habitat 3 enrich the presence absence data set with environmental variables information 4 train different habitat suitability models using the enriched data set as a training set 5 merge the models using a normalised sum of their projections on the invaded area 6 retrieve observation records in the invaded area 7 produce a geographical reachability distribution by multiplying the merged habitat model for a set of distance based gaussian functions each centred on the observations in the invaded area 8 assess the resulting model s performance with independent observations in the invaded area 9 project the model onto official subdivisions of the invaded area in order to estimate impact indicators this process is complex and requires access to species data computational facilities and storage of intermediate and final results thus it requires an e infrastructure oriented to open science that guarantees fast data retrieval direct feeding of models with data and fast estimation of the best models 3 results and discussion in this section the projections of the models developed for the pufferfish are presented the models performance is quantitatively assessed on known mediterranean records of the species and the discrepancies between the geographical reachability and the dynamic distributions are highlighted and checked against previous studies finally an impact indicator is reported for different subdivisions of the mediterranean sea 3 1 models projections the projection of the aquamaps model on the mediterranean sea predicts suitable habitat especially in coastal areas fig 2 a likewise in the ann model coastal proximity influences high habitat suitability but the resulting distribution is different from the aquamaps one due to a more complex combination of environmental variables in the neural network fig 2b the maxent model using all environmental variables estimates high suitability for the eastern mediterranean basin fig 2c the variables having highest association with the presence data according to maxent are reported in table 1 the maxent model trained only with these variables agrees with the previous maxent model about the habitat suitability of the eastern basin and additionally reports westwards suitability especially around the southern italian coasts fig 2d discrepancies between these two maxent models are visible off the libyan and turkey coasts and in the centre of the mediterranean sea the three svm models are different from each other the model trained with all environmental variable reports high suitability in the black sea fig 2e the model using environmental variables selected by a leave one out process table 1 estimates high suitability in a large part of the mediterranean sea except in the northern adriatic sea and in the southern france coasts fig 2f the model using the environmental variables selected by the maxent process estimates high suitability in greece and turkey coasts and in the western mediterranean coasts around the strait of gibraltar fig 2g it can be visually recognised that the trained baseline models predict high probability in complementary locations fig 2 this is confirmed by the calculation of the agreements between the models which never reaches 100 table 2 a since all the compared maps have complementary aspects it is not possible to select a priori one map instead of the other as definitive habitat estimation thus the production of a merged distribution representing the overall habitat suitability of l sceleratus in the mediterranean sea is justified this merged distribution indicates suitable habitat in most of the mediterranean sea except in some areas in the centre and in the western basin fig 4a the geographical reachability distribution presents complementary aspects with respect to the baseline habitat distributions fig 4b and table 2b another geographical reachability map was produced by training the model with environmental data projected in 2050 section 2 1 4 and by using currently known locations in the mediterranean sea to build gaussian functions the resulting distribution is very similar to the previous one fig 4c thus the first produced geographical reachability distribution represents a stable average scenario for l sceleratus the techniques used in our experiment mostly belong to the class of correlative approaches to niche modelling pearson 2012 and thus do not explicitly model the bio physiological characteristics of l sceleratus nevertheless an a posteriori statistical analysis was made across all models focussing on the 18 environmental variables values in the highest probability locations 0 8 this analysis helps inferring the environmental conditions the species prefers in particular it reveals that for all models the average surface temperature is around 19 0 2 and the average difference with sea bottom temperature is 5 average sea surface salinity is 34 5 0 3 psu except for aquamaps 38 0 03 psu and the average difference between sea surface salinity and sea bottom salinity is always around 2 primary production is averagely 530 g c m 2 yr 1 with high values 1100 g c m 2 yr 1 reached by few locations distance from land is always below 200 km with 80 km average for all models except for ann 32 km and aquamaps 31 km finally average water column depth is 1150 m except for ann 207 m and aquamaps 407 m however all models also include high probability locations in shallow waters down to 1 m and averagely deep waters up to 3000 m 3 2 performance evaluation accuracy was calculated for all models as described in section 2 6 table 3 the geographical reachability distribution gains the highest performance in predicting the mediterranean records 98 whereas the dynamic model reaches lower performance 83 all the baseline models have high performance on predicting observation records however a visual comparison fig 2 suggests that most of these models possibly overestimate the presence locations nevertheless there is useful information in this overestimation for example the svm distribution in fig 2f assigns non zero values to most of the mediterranean sea half degree locations and may seem uninformative but this distribution also includes a westward decreasing gradient which is crucial information when introduced in the merged model overall the percentages in tables 2 and 3 suggest that the geographical reachability distribution i is complementary to the other maps ii presents stability with respect to a 2050 scenario and iii has high performance at predicting real observations in the mediterranean sea 3 3 discrepancies evaluation the dynamic distribution has overall 83 agreement with the geographical reachability distribution and is generally similar to this distribution fig 4b and d however the overall performance of the dynamic model on known records in the mediterranean sea is lower and there are specific discrepancy areas highlighted in fig 4d that need further analysis overall unlike the geographical reachability distribution the dynamic distribution predicts species invasion also up to the continental edge where currently there are very few records çinar et al 2014 the geographical reachability distribution predicts medium to high occurrence probability 0 4 0 6 in eastern mediterranean e g aegean sea and cyprus sea southern ionian sea albanian coasts and southern tyrrhenian sea sicily tunisian and libyan coasts whereas it predicts the highest probability 0 8 in several coastal areas e g south turkey south greece and east libya indeed the highest abundance of l sceleratus has been recorded in the eastern mediterranean nader et al 2012 michailidis 2010 also in the southern tyrrhenian sea between malta and the tunisian coast more than 80 individuals have been reported in the last 5 years azzurro et al 2014b in the bosporus few records have been officially reported vacchi et al 2007 which agrees with the geographical reachability distribution on a possible future presence in this area despite the opposite indication by the dynamic distribution as for the italian coasts observations have been increasingly reported around sicily azzurro et al 2014a 2016 in the central tyrrhenian sea jribi et al 2012 and in the southern adriatic sea dulčić and dragičević 2014 nader et al 2012 still in agreement with the geographical reachability distribution on the contrary although both the compared distributions indicate lower invasion probability in the western mediterranean sea the fish has been observed very recently along the algerian and southern spanish coasts dailianis et al 2016 katsanevakis et al 2014 but it still early to assess a population establishment 3 4 impact indicators the impact indicator described in section 2 6 was calculated for the geographical reachability distribution after its projection onto three reference subdivision sets of the mediterranean sea corresponding to different ecological and economical criteria a coloured gradient was used to give direct visual understanding of the impact of the pufferfish on these areas a first indicator was calculated on the official major fishing areas in the mediterranean sea of the food and agriculture organisation of the united nations fao this indicator fig 5 a has a westward decreasing gradient and estimates low medium impact 0 2 0 6 in the tyrrhenian and ionian seas italian tunisian and libyan coasts and high impact 0 8 1 around the coasts of greece turkey lebanon and egypt a second indicator was calculated on the exclusive economic zones associated to the united nations convention on the law of the sea lowe 1990 which define the regions where a state has special rights for the exploration and use of marine resources although eezs are not accepted by several international organisations including fao they may give insight on how the mediterranean countries could be economically impacted by the l sceleratus invasion in particular fig 5b highly impacted areas are highlighted in the eastern mediterranean sea e g in greece and cyprus whose situation is already known to be alarming and in the south i e malta and tunisia finally a third indicator with higher resolution was calculated on the general subdivisions of the general fisheries commission for the mediterranean sea gsas these areas are commonly used to monitor and manage marine fishery resources in the mediterranean sea and can better highlight the impact of l sceleratus on smaller areas fig 5c again a westward decreasing gradient is observed and high impact zones are now highlighted in southern sicily in the ionian sea and in southern adriatic sea further impact in greece is reported to be higher in the aegean sea than in the ionic side 4 conclusions in this paper a method to estimate the spread of the silver cheeked toad fish l sceleratus in the mediterranean sea has been presented seven niche models based on machine learning algorithms were trained and merged together the method generates an overall geographical reachability distribution by means of a distance weighting process that takes real observations into account the reliability of this method has been assessed with respect to a reference dynamic model and mediterranean observation records of the pufferfish a risk estimate of the invasion has been reported as the density of non zero probability locations falling in different subdivisions of the mediterranean sea related to marine resources exploitation a general westward decreasing impact pattern has been highlighted but high risk zones have been predicted also in the middle and in the south of the mediterranean sea e g sicily malta and tunisia the overall depicted scenario is that l sceleratus is a great risk for fisheries and consequently on health security of many mediterranean countries in the near future further our estimated distribution foresees the invasion by the pufferfish of the bosporus which could enable it to spread in the black sea thus strategies such as selective fishing to decrease its population should be considered especially in the most likely future impacted areas in order to stem this spread and prevent severe economic damages in this context our maps can support these strategies and can also help fisheries researchers to advise managers and decision makers this experiment used an e infrastructure for every step of the method from data retrieval to models training and projection the e infrastructure enabled the authors in their collaboration and every step of the experiment has been made repeatable because it is published as a service under a standard representation wps and all the data processes and results are freely accessible on line 13 13 an ensemble is available at http data d4science org workspace explorer app

25326,the cultivation of bt maize genetically modified to be resistant to insect pests has led to intense scientific and political debate about its possible adverse impacts on biodiversity to better address this question we developed an individual based simulation model lepix lepix considers the temporal dynamics of maize pollen shedding and larval phenology and pollen deposition on host plants related to distance from the maize field in order to estimate mortality of lepidopteran larvae exposed to toxic bt pollen we employed a refined exposure analysis comparison to previous approaches using recent evidence on leaf pollen deposition and accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of pollen on leaves moreover we used a stochastic approach considering literature data on a minimum dataset for butterfly biology in combination with historic data on temporal pollen deposition to predict the coincidence between larval phenology and pollen deposition since conservation management actions may act at the level of the individual for protected species lepix as an individual based spatially explicit model is suited to assist both risk assessment and management measures based on threshold mortalities we tested our model using inachis io lepidoptera nymphalidae as butterfly species and the cultivation of insect resistant mon810 maize in accordance to predictions based on other models we identified mortality risks of i io larvae for the second larval generation an analysis of the sensitivity of input parameters stressed the importance of both the slope and the lc50 value of the dose response curve as well as the earliest day of larval hatching using different published data to characterize the dose response of mon810 pollen to i io we revealed consequences due to uncertainties in ecotoxicological parameters and thus highlight the importance of key biological parameters for reliable estimates of effects and decision making e g isolation distances in risk assessment keywords

sweet 2002 habitats adjacent to bt maize cultivation fields will be exposed to pollen containing bt proteins hofmann et al 2010 and off field effects have to be considered in the risk assessment maize flowering and the larval phenology of many butterfly species overlap therefore non target butterflies in europe are likely at risk lang et al 2015 musche et al 2009 schmitz et al 2003 traxler and gaugg 2005 this risk will depend on a variety of factors such as the degree of temporal overlap in phenologies amount of pollen to be expected on host plants toxin concentration in pollen and sensitivity of the non target species risk assessment prior to gmo authorization requires substantial data and analytical tools in 2009 the european food safety authority efsa deployed a first mathematical simulation model to predict the consequences of cultivation of bt maize on non target lepidoptera efsa 2009 perry et al 2010 this model has been developed further to take new aspects and data for the assessment into account efsa 2011a b 2012 2015 in addition holst et al 2013a b estimated the mortality of the peacock butterfly inachis io caused by bt maize in a simulation model of the butterfly s annual life cycle over laid with the phenology of maize pollen deposition on the leaves of the food plant urtica dioica however the model has not been used in the context of regulatory purposes and did not include spatial aspects such as the distance of larvae and host plants to the maize field here we present a new simulation model lepix 1 0 to estimate off field effects of bt maize cultivation on non target butterfly species our model is designed to simulate the temporal overlap of maize flowering and larval phenology pollen deposition on host plants depending on the distance to the maize field and the effect of bt pollen exposure on the mortality of butterfly larvae because we can obtain information on both individual larvae and populations lepix is especially suited to analyse effects on rare endangered and or protected lepidoptera as these may be protected on the level of the individuum and or population the exposure module of our model uses the so far most comprehensive set of field data from research projects dealing with maize pollen deposition which were initiated by the german federal agency for nature conservation in collaboration with german federal states to improve the assessment of bt maize exposure on non target organisms hofmann et al 2009 2011 2013 2014 2016 2 the lepix model at first we specify the purpose of the model section 2 1 and give a general overview of its structure section 2 2 1 before all submodels are described in detail section 2 2 2 2 1 purpose the simulation model lepix lepidoptera and ecotoxicology 1 0 is a tool to estimate mortality probabilities for non target insect species affected by bt maize dependent on the distance from the maize field the information obtained assists the risk assessment and risk management of genetically engineered plants that express bt proteins as insecticidal components 2 2 model description in principle lepix is a generic model that can be parametrized for any species or group of butterflies or moth and for any geographical location and for any gm crop variety as a case study we used the bt maize event mon810 and the non target species inachis io at two locations in germany bad hersfeld and rheinfelden where it is known to be univoltine and bivoltine respectively see section 3 2 2 1 general structure and design species protected under e g the german federal species protection regulations bundesartenschutzverordnung bartschv are protected not only as populations but also as individuals therefore a model for risk assessment of individuals is desirable and motivates an individual based approach grimm and railsback 2005 lepix is discrete in time and simulates a time period of one year with a time step of one day for each year both a specific temporal pattern of pollen shedding during the flowering period and mean daily temperatures are randomly chosen from historical field data these temporal patterns serve as input data for the simulation of butterfly phenology and exposure the daily development of larvae depends on the sums of daily temperatures weather the risk of mortality per day depends on the amount of pollen one single larva is exposed to daily the quantitative exposure is not equal for all larvae therefore we included spatial variation of the deposition on host plants according to the data of hofmann et al 2016 this leads to an individual pollen exposure for each larva in the model the lepix model simulates the development and exposure of 1000 larvae during one year this simulation was repeated 1000 times with different randomly chosen temporal patterns for flowering periods pollen shedding and daily temperatures weather in the following we refer to these 1000 simulated populations as 1000 simulation runs and denote the ensemble of the 1000 simulated populations as one scenario i e for one fixed model parameter setting the distances between the maize field and the location of maize pollen deposition were taken into account by using long term monitoring data of fields which were cultivated under common agricultural conditions hofmann et al 2014 in this way the lepix model is in substance spatially implicit i e the exact positions of the larvae in space or on the host plants are not considered the lepix model consists of five modules fig 1 the weather module provides the daily temperatures of one year and passes this information to the individual module where the individual larval periods are simulated the pollen deposition module provides the amount of bt maize pollen on the host plant leaves at any distance from the maize field and for each day of the year the exposure module simulates the relevant exposure to pollen of each larva the individual exposure rates finally result in the individual risks of mortality mortality module in the lepix model the individuals do not interact and no reproduction or resource limitation is considered stochasticity plays a major role in all sub models for details see section 2 2 2 especially the start of the larval stage and the daily variation in consumed pollen are drawn from probability distributions which also stochastically affect individual traits e g the development time of a larva the model is implemented in c following a purely object orientated approach and agent based modelling design patterns grimm and railsback 2005 using r for statistical post process analysis r core team 2016 2 2 2 sub models in detail weather module the weather module provides the mean daily temperature t t for a day of year t in the run of one year for the two example study sites rheinfelden baden württemberg germany and bad hersfeld hesse germany we used series of daily temperature measurements provided by the german weather service dwd for the years 1961 2010 for each simulation run one specific series of measurements over the period of one year was randomly chosen i e for one simulation run the 1000 individuals considered experienced the same daily temperatures these daily temperatures t t determine the development time of one larva by means of a degree days approach as described in the individual model below individual module the individual model considers the phenology of butterfly larvae in this module both the day of occurrence and the duration of the larval period from hatching until pupation are determined for each larva this module uses as input data a start date for the hatching of a larva from an egg t 0 l denoted by an id code l and the daily temperature series t t from the weather module t 0 l is drawn for each larva individually from a beta distribution where the range of the distribution i e the possible earliest and latest days for hatching is obtained from published phenology data based on field observations for the species considered if multiple butterfly generations occur per year in the corresponding location the module considers multiple hatching periods in the following the earliest day of hatching of a generation is denoted by th begin the duration of larval period δt l of larva l is calculated from the weather data and the simple degree days approach baskerville and emin 1969 i e the daily non negative differences between temperature t t and a given threshold temperature t min are accumulated until a limit degree days temperature t dd larva is reached in recursive form this reads as t a c c u m t t a c c u m t 1 max t t t min 0 f o r t t 0 l a n d t a c c u m t 0 l m a x t t 0 l t min 0 the day t where t a c c u m t exceeds t dd larva is assumed to set the day of individual pupation thus the larval period of an individual l has the length of δt l t t 0 l the length of the individual pupal period δt p is calculated analogously to the larval period with the same temperature threshold t min but with a different limit degree days temperature t dd pupa in summary this module defines the following state variables for each butterfly larva time of hatching t 0 l duration of larval period δt l and duration of its pupal period δt p the end of the larval instar is t end l t 0 l δt l and the emergence of imagines is at t end p t 0 l δt l δt p deposition module maize pollen deposition was derived from a large dataset hofmann et al 2014 obtained by standardized technical sampling pmf mass filter standardized via vdi 4330 3 and cen ts 16817 1 covering 10 years and different locations mostly in germany but also including sites in belgium and switzerland each of the 214 sampling points used in hofmann et al 2014 represents the integrated pollen deposition for one sampling point over the entire flowering period and thus approximates the total amount of pollen deposited at this location all these data reflect the common maize cultivation practices in germany which also should be expected if bt maize is commercialized the deposition module simulates the maize pollen flow during the flowering period and the deposition of maize pollen on host plants for each day t and for different distances d from a maize field the host plant used in our case was nettle urtica dioica l the amount of pollen was transformed to the amount of pollen accumulated on host plants i e nettles leaves by calibrating pmf data to field data of pollen deposition on host plants hofmann et al 2016 maize pollen deposition dependent on the distance to the maize field according to hofmann et al 2014 the mean amount μ of maize pollen deposition as measured by pmf samplers follows a power law function dependent on the distance d from the nearest maize field μ d 127 d 0 585 note that dimensions are neglected this standardized integrated deposition measured by a pmf mass filter quantifies the total amount of maize pollen over the entire maize flowering period with the usual cultivation practices in germany the standardized integrated deposition varies according to regional and local differences e g climate soil sowing date seed varieties taking this variation into account the integrated pollen deposition variation at a given distance d follows a log normal distribution p d l n μ d σ d where μ d and σ d can be derived from the mean and the confidence intervals of the datasets respectively provided by hofmann et al 2014 according to the distance d the value of p d is chosen randomly for each simulation run temporal distribution of pollen deposition pollen release during the flowering period is not constant but depends on climatic conditions a diurnal pattern is typical for the release of pollen and is correlated to turbulent weather conditions during the day boehm et al 2008 hofmann et al 2013 unfavourable weather conditions regularly cause interruptions of the period in which maize pollen is released which leads to a prolonged period of pollen dispersal rather than a compact period hofmann et al 2013 long term measurements of maize pollen are available from ganderkesee lower saxony germany for the years 1994 to 2010 data kindly provided by r wachter pollenflug nord in cooperation with f hofmann see also hofmann et al 2008 2013 these temporally resolved periods of maize pollen deposition were used to simulate the variability of the temporal pattern of maize pollen over the flowering period in the simulation how the actual total pollen amount at a distance d is distributed over the days in a year comprises two aspects first the starting day of pollen shedding has to be set second one has to determine for each day which proportion of the actual total amount of pollen is disposed per day i e the temporal pattern of pollen distribution in a simulation year as a basis for our model approach we used long term data of the temporal maize pollen shedding for the site ganderkesee see above these data encompass the time span over which the pollen concentration in the air h 1994 t h 2010 t was measured per day t in 1 of 17 consecutive years 1994 2010 the starting date t s of the temporal flowering pattern for a simulation year is drawn from a uniform distribution t s u t s b e g i n t s e n d where t s begin and t s end is the earliest and latest day in a year respectively on which pollen was observed in the field in order to simulate realistic temporal patterns of pollen deposition the relative proportion of pollen that is deposited per day is calculated from each of the 17 datasets of hofmann et al 2009 thus we obtained 17 different temporal patterns h 1994 t h 2010 t for the relative daily pollen deposition each of which fulfill t 0 364 h n t 1 where n denotes the year of measurement 1994 2010 for each year in a simulation run a specific temporal pattern h n t is randomly chosen but as described above the starting day t s for shedding is randomly distributed therefore we have to shift the values of h n t in time such that the beginning of shedding in the chosen temporal pattern h n t coincides with the chosen starting day t s we denote these shifted temporal patterns as h n t s t in this way we have at distance d p a i r d t p d h n t s t i e the simulated pollen deposition at day t in a simulation year for a given starting day t s estimation of pollen deposition on leaves since the daily amount of pollen in the air determines the amount of pollen on host plant leaves it is necessary to relate pmf estimates of pollen deposition air to pollen deposition on the acceptor surface leaf in the model this is achieved by the factor γ which has been determined in field experiments by using different methods in parallel hofmann et al 2016 the daily amount of pollen on the leaves is assumed to accumulate on the host plant leaves and therefore the deposition amounts from the previous day must be taken into account however we assumed that the amount of pollen of the previous day only partly remains on the host leaves because of wind and or rain to simulate this decline in pollen density over time a loss rate ε is introduced which describes the relative amount of pollen that is lost per day in summary the mean deposition on day t on a host plant leaf at distance d for a year is p l e a f t p l e a f t 1 1 ε γ p a i r d t pollen is not uniformly distributed on host plant leaves hofmann et al 2011 2016 hofmann et al 2016 have shown that the spatial distribution of maize pollen on host plant leaves can be described by a log normal density distribution with specific parameters for different plant species because butterfly larvae especially young and thus sensitive instars feed only on a small fraction of leaves the spatial distribution of pollen will ultimately influence the exposure of larvae to pollen and thus the magnitude of effects as dose and effect are non linearly related see mortality module it is important to include the spatial variability of pollen densities on host plant leaves hofmann et al 2016 the data of hofmann et al 2016 motivates the use of a log normal distribution which uses p l e a f t as μ parameter and a constant σ leaf parameter thus the pollen amount p l e a f i t on a leaf i is considered to be a derivative p l e a f i t l n p l e a f t σ l e a f exposure module the exposure module estimates the amount of pollen per cm2 that each larva is exposed to this information is required for determining the risk of mortality see next section in determining the pollen exposure for each larva in a simulation run we made two assumptions i each larva feeds only on one particular part of a leaf per day and ii the pollen exposure of a larva l results from the deposition values p l e a f i t of a number of m consecutive days as described in detail in the following according to the first assumption the daily deposition of pollen p l t on the position where a larva l is located is p l t p l e a f i t where p l e a f i t is provided by the deposition module these values are used to calculate the exposure a l of the specific larva using the equation a l 1 4 max t t 4 p l t f o r e v e r y t s t 0 l t e n d l 4 a l is actually the mean pollen deposition on leaves derived from the sum of pollen deposition during the time period m the time period m was set to 4 days in our example as a proxy for the exposure time that elicits effects from the uptake of bt pollen mortality module the pollen exposure of individual larva a l as described in the previous section is the basis for deriving the risk of mortality of an individual larva we assume in our model that each individual larva can only be subjected once to mortality caused by the ingestion of bt pollen in order to estimate the toxic effect of bt pollen on a given species c the slope and the lc50 value from an empirical dose response relationship of pollen of the relevant bt maize event and the butterfly species are needed we used a hill equation as a dose response relationship frank 2013 to calculate the mortality m c dependent on the amount of pollen al to which a larva of the species c is exposed m c a l 1 1 a l l c 50 c s l o p e this individual mortality is used to determine the mortalities of a population of 1000 larvae in a simulation run and the mean mortality of 1000 runs i e 1000 simulated populations are considered as an estimator of the mean risk of mortality for one particular parameter setting scenario 3 case example calibration and settings the lepix model can in principle be used for any butterfly species geographical region and bt maize event we calibrated the model for bt maize event mon810 which produces the lepidopteran active bt protein cry1ab mon810 maize is the only bt maize currently approved for cultivation in the eu the lepidopteran species i io used in our case example bryant et al 2000 2002 ebert and rennwald 1991 is common in agricultural areas of europe and is protected in some eu member states holst et al 2013b i io also has been the subject of earlier risk assessments and is used as a model species efsa 2009 holst et al 2013b perry et al 2010 different estimates of the toxicity of mon810 pollen for i io have been found see table 1 below 3 1 geographical regions we chose two locations for our study in bad hersfeld 50 52ʹ12 n 9 42ʹ7ʹʹe in central germany i io is univoltine in rheinfelden 47 35ʹ23ʹʹn 7 46ʹ8 e close to the swiss border i io is bivoltine ebert and rennwald 1991 3 2 individual module because generally few phenotypic data of larval stages are available in the literature we calculated the beginning of the larval period based on phenotypic data of imagines as follows we chose the earliest egg hatch date t h begin such that the simulated occurrence patterns of the imagines matches the phenotypic observations given in the literature ebert and rennwald 1991 thus for bad hersfeld the value of t h begin was set to 19 may and for rheinfelden the value of t h begin of the first larval generation was set to 15 may and the value of the second generation was set to 20 july the temperature sums for larval and pupal development were 315 2 and 110 0 degree days respectively with a lower temperature threshold of 8 3 c bryant et al 2002 3 3 deposition module we chose the earliest day for the beginning of pollen shedding t s begin as 14 july and the latest day t s end as 5 august these dates represent the earliest and latest dates recorded in long term measurements of the temporal distribution of maize pollen see deposition module in section 2 2 2 the ratio γ of pollen flow in the air to pollen deposition on the host plant leaves nettle was set to 0 68 as given in hofmann et al 2016 only few data are available for estimating the daily loss rate ε of pollen on plant leaves to obtain a realistic value of ε we compared distributions of on leaf pollen deposition provided by field measurements hofmann et al 2016 with simulated distributions we identified ε 20 pollen loss per day as a reasonable value for ε in our simulations this value is in the range of other estimates e g holst et al 2013b although the standard deviation of the simulated distributions was slightly lower than that of the field data of hofmann et al 2016 3 4 mortality module different estimates of the dose response curve of i io to pollen containing cry1ab from mon810 have been determined to take this source of uncertainty into account we ran the model with different combinations of the various lc50 values and the two slopes of the dose response curve table 1 and fig 2 when necessary the slope parameter slope was transformed from a probit response relationship to the hill equation perry et al 2010 4 results according to the calibration of the model for i io and the two geographical regions we performed various simulations to validate the model estimate rates of mortality and analyse the sensitivity of the model results according to the input parameters the output of the individual module simulating the phenology of i io was in good agreement with field data ebert and rennwald 1991 for larval and adult phenology in the regions where univoltine e g bad hersfeld or bivoltine e g rheinfelden larval generations of i io can be expected this corroborates the phenology module in which a simple degree days model and literature data bryant et al 2000 2002 have been used to simulate the phenology of i io according to ebert and rennwald 1991 the first larval generation of i io can be observed in the upper rhine valley from may to the beginning of july and the second larval generation can be observed from august to september with some larvae developing in october or november in extreme years the imagines from the first and second larval generation can be sighted typically in july and from the end of august through october respectively we simulated larval and adult phenologies for both generations using the climatic data of rheinfelden fig 3 we found a good correspondence between the observed and simulated times for the occurrence of both larvae and imagines especially the simulated larval phenology fit the observations well and confirmed sensu oreskes et al 1994 our approach to estimate the average risk of mortality of an individual of i io dependent on the distance to a field of bt maize we simulated 1000 populations of 1000 individuals each see section 2 2 1 simulations showed no apparent 1 mortality rates with the climatic conditions in bad hersfeld where i io is univoltine data not shown with climatic data from rheinfelden where i io is bivoltine the simulations predicted low mortality rates of the first larval generation of i io similar to those of bad hersfeld but higher mortality rates 1 for the second larval generation depending on the distance to the maize field and toxicological input data fig 4 we used a threshold of 1 mortality as this threshold is currently used in the risk assessment of bt maize at the eu level efsa 2015 both the distance and the ecotoxicological parameters influenced the risk of mortality fig 4 mortality decreased with increasing distance to the maize field and with decreasing sensitivity increasing lc50 furthermore mortality estimates depended on the slope as an input parameter to describe the dose response equation steeper slopes in this respect decreased mortality estimates because of non linear relationships this decrease was more distinct with increasing distance to the maize field for example assuming an lc50 value of 2972 pollen cm2 mortalities of 5 9 and 0 3 were predicted at a distance of 1 m whereas mortalities of 0 75 and 0 04 were predicted at a distance of 100 m for the applied slopes of 0 84 and 1 76 respectively see also sensitivity analysis below to test the robustness of the model results presented above against the chosen values for the model parameters we performed a two stage sensitivity analysis we analysed simulations of the second generation of i io in rheinfelden which had the highest mortality in our simulations in the first step we identified parameters that had the most severe impact on the results for this purpose for each of the four different lc50 values we used a latin hypercube sampling with uniform stratified parameter values for nearly all model parameters saltelli et al 2008 and simulated a total of 1000 simulations runs data not shown the analyses indicated that besides the lc50 value whose impact on mortality is obvious the average individual risks of mortality are most strongly influenced by the parameters slope in the dose response curve and the earliest day of hatching parameter t h begin of the second generation in the second step the two parameters slope and t h begin were varied systematically in combination to test for their impact on mortality risks the risk of mortality invariably decreased with steeper slopes for different dates of first hatching fig 5 complementary the mortality rates for different slopes depicted a maximum at ca t h begin 200 days i e 18 july this date mirrors a maximum overlap of larvae occurrence and pollen shedding the mean mortality rates as shown in figs 4 and 5 were derived for each parameter set from a sample of 1000 simulated populations each providing one mean individual mortality rate within the population the differences between the simulated populations are solely due to different realizations of random processes i e weather and individual hatching times see section 2 2 2 to estimate the variation in individual mortality rates we looked for the variation in risks of mortality within single populations as an example fig 6 a demonstrates for a specific parameter setting with a distance of 40 m from the bt maize field the distribution of 1000 mean individual mortality values gained from 1000 simulated populations in this example the mean mortality risk was about 25 but it varied from 0 to about 50 when we considered the total sample of 1000 1000 pooled individuals from all simulated populations for one specific distance to the field we observed a multimodal distribution with a distinct maximum in the class of nearly zero mortality fig 6b where approximately 10 of all individuals do not notably suffer mortality the remaining individuals were assigned to risks of mortality ranging from 1 to approximately 80 the graphs in fig 6c and d exemplify the distribution of individual mortalities for two particular populations using the identical input parameters as in fig 6b although both populations belong to the same sample that leads to an average individual mortality risk of about 25 the simulations demonstrate that different distributions can be observed in one run the majority of individuals of a population hardly suffered any mortality fig 6c whereas in other runs individual mortality covered the entire range between 0 and 1 fig 6d note that this striking difference is solely due to random effects 5 discussion 5 1 general remarks the lepix model presented here is an individual based model designed to estimate the risk of mortality of non target butterfly larvae caused by exposure to bt toxins expressed in pollen of insect resistant bt maize lepix can be easily applied to other bt maize events both single and stacked events and to other species of lepidoptera the specific data needed should in principle be available from the scientific literature and from market applications of the respective bt maize the conceptual model can be also applied for crop species other than maize and different taxa of non target organisms the agent based approach in the lepix model allows explicit consideration of the impact of variability on the estimation of the individual risk of mortality in the lepix model variability is considered in nearly all features weather temperature occurrence of larvae pollen deposition and individual exposure this variability in the processes finds expression in stochastic distributions for the output variables and provides a much more distinct interpretation of model outcomes than the use of just mean values alone in this way lepix is suitable for assessing individual mortality probabilities which might need to be considered for strictly protected species the ability to assess such individual mortality probabilities is one major advantage of the use of agent based models grimm and railsback 2006 in this respect lepix differs from the model currently used in the eu risk assessment efsa 2015 perry et al 2010 2012 lepix provides not only quantitative values for important output variables such as the risk of mortality but also constitutes a valuable tool for investigation of the sensitivity of model assumptions to these variables the model can be used to directly compare different scenarios and parameter sets in view of the output variables see below 5 2 comparison to other approaches to date two other models for estimating lepidopteran larvae mortality caused by bt maize pollen have been published see introduction the efsa model efsa 2015 perry et al 2010 2012 and the btbuttox model holst et al 2013a b like the efsa model lepix can be used to take various distances to the bt maize field into account all three models use a dose response curve to calculate mortality and do not consider sub lethal effects in contrast to the efsa model perry et al 2012 lepix does not make any assumptions on the distribution of host plants butterfly populations or adoption of bt maize cultivation any comparisons of lepix to the efsa model must therefore be made to the present efsa local model efsa 2015 only the btbuttox and lepix models simulate the temporal coincidence of larvae and maize pollen to do so an insect module and a deposition module are required holst et al 2013b used a full scale insect model requiring detailed biological input whereas we reduced biological input data used in lepix to reflect the lack of availability of detailed data on e g the lifespan or the pre oviposition period for most butterfly species instead the phenology module of lepix is mainly driven by a simple degree days model and relies on field observation data on the adult flight period which is available for many species a single observation of the flight activity of a species can also be used to derive accumulated degree days sums for a species if weather data for the region can be obtained although larval development is variable and in part dependent on environmental and genetic factors friberg et al 2011 saastamoinen et al 2013 degree days calculation are useful for predicting phenology of butterflies across species cayton et al 2015 the btbuttox model does not include a distance relationship of the deposition of maize pollen and the maize field by contrast both the current efsa model efsa 2015 and the lepix model use in principle the same distance relationship of hofmann et al 2014 compared to other approaches lepix uses the so far most comprehensive set of field data to estimate pollen deposition on plant leaves and is the only model that accounts for the variability of pollen on leaves compared to holst et al 2013b who approximated pollen deposition on leaves using durham samplers that operated over one single year and in one single location in japan kawashima et al 2004 both the lepix and efsa models derive pollen deposition on leaves from long term monitoring data obtained using standardized technical samplers hofmann et al 2014 to translate pollen counts from technical samplers to acceptor specific pollen deposition on leaves of specific host plants we followed the approach of hofmann et al 2016 who experimentally compared the efficacy of different sampling methods and thus was able to calibrate pmf measurements to in situ field measurements of pollen deposition on host plant leaves in contrast to the efsa model efsa 2015 this has the advantage of replacing expert estimates with field data in addition we included the variability of pollen deposition among leaves as dose response effects are basically non linear it is important to consider this variability explicitly for a reliable risk assessment the results of modelling larval mortality using the lepix and btbuttox models can only be partially compared because the conceptual models and the model formulations differ the results of the two models for i io are in good agreement in that they predict no apparent mortality for the first generation of i io regardless of the chosen climatic data similar to the btbuttox results of holst et al 2013b the lack of mortality effects predicted by lepix can be explained by the lack of overlap between pollen shedding and larval occurrence for the second larval generation in rheinfelden however the importance of this overlap is reflected in the sensitivity analysis of model parameters which stresses the importance of the beginning of the larval period for the prediction of mortality with identical dose response parameters slope 1 76 lc50 451 pollen cm2 the lepix model predicts 28 mortality for i io larvae feeding on host plants at the field edge 0 2 m this value is on the lower end but within the range of the estimates 28 86 of holst et al 2013a b taking into account different assumptions for pollen deposition rates of the btbuttox model with parameter settings for the dose response similar to those of the efsa model slope 0 84 lc50 5800 pollen cm2 the lepix model predicts 6 9 mortality for i io larvae feeding on host plants at the field edge 0 2 m although a direct comparison of estimates with the current version of the efsa model efsa 2015 is difficult we can compare the estimates indirectly by using suggested mitigation measures to keep mortalities of larvae 1 to achieve this threshold efsa 2015 recommends isolation distances of 5 m to 20 m depending on the parameter setting our results for i io are in keeping with this lepix predicts a mortality of i io of 0 9 at a distance of 20 m and a moderately higher mortality of 1 7 at a distance of 5 m from the maize field it is important to note however that some butterfly species have a higher sensitivity to mon810 pollen cry1ab toxin for native species in europe this has been demonstrated e g for the protected common swallowtail papilio machaon l lang and vojtech 2006 or for the diamondback moth plutella xystostella especially p xystostellahas been reported to be highly sensitive to cry1 and thus will better perform as a surrogate for highly sensitive species felke et al 2002 wolt et al 2005 using the efsa correction factor of 31 05 perry et al 2010 to adjust the toxin concentration from bt176 pollen to mon810 pollen the lc50 value of p xystotella larvae l4 is estimated to be 595 pollen cm2 felke et al 2002 and larger isolation distances will apply for the risk management see table 2 5 3 implications of uncertainty although the output of lepix is in agreement with previous calculations the modelling results also highlight the importance of input data for the model outcome to date the scientific discussion in this context has mainly focused on exposure estimates efsa 2015 2016b hofmann et al 2014 2016 kruse plass et al 2017 perry et al 2013 and it is agreed that the exposure estimate will have a strong influence on any model predicting the effects of the exposure of non target organisms to bt pollen however our simulations demonstrate that both lc50 and the slope of the dose response curve strongly influence mortalities and thus envisaged risk management measures these findings agree with those of perry et al 2012 who stressed the importance of these parameters for the efsa model as has been shown in figs 4 and 5 both the slope and the lc50 value of the dose response as well as the timing of larval development will influence the mortality estimate imprecisions in these model parameter in consequence will affect not only the mortality estimate but also any risk management measure using this estimate in our case example a less steep slope 0 84 of the dose response curve caused higher mortality of i io larvae regardless of the assumed lc50 value or the distance to the maize field compared to a steep slope a less steep slope will increase the mortality estimate if the environmental concentration of the stressor bt protein in pollen is lower than the lc50 value as the distance relationship of maize pollen follows a power function larger distances will increase the probability that exposure levels are below the lc50 even for highly sensitive species in our case example this can be illustrated by comparing the mortality estimates for different slopes at a given distance assuming an lc50 value of 1351 pollen cm2 the less steep slope 0 84 in comparison to the steeper slope 1 76 results in about a 4 30 97 and 220 fold increase in mortality for distances of 0 2 10 100 and 500 m respectively our modelling results affirm the use of less steep slope estimates for the risk assessment in order not to underestimate effects perry et al 2010 this may also be reasonable as the influence of sub lethal effects such as reduced weight and presumably fitness or prolonged developmental time on individual fitness or population growth have not yet been included in simulation models to date no standardized ecotoxicity testing for lepidoptera exists which takes exposure of larvae to toxic pollen into account the lack of agreed methodology causes considerable uncertainties which have been addressed in detail in lang and otto 2010 in fact in experiments carried out to determine lc50 values for bt toxins and lepidoptera some of the used experimental parameters such as exposure time the time of mortality readings or the lack of secondary stressors have been criticized to underestimate real effects lang et al 2011 as lepix can rely only on available data this uncertainty has to be addressed in the final risk assessment and risk management provided that suitable data exist some uncertainties in lc50 values can be addressed by the use of species sensitivity distributions posthuma et al 2002 this approach has been followed in the current efsa model efsa 2015 perry et al 2012 and is useful for estimating e g effects on species of conservation concern for which ecotoxicological data are lacking both lc50 and slope estimates and to a minor extent estimates of larval phenology will influence risk management measures we illustrate this in table 2 which provides isolation distances based on lepix calculations needed to obtain mortality estimates for i io larvae 1 see above when the steep slope is used changes in the lc50 value do not alter isolation distances greatly i e all distances lie within one order of magnitude when the gentler slope in lepix is used however isolation distances greatly increase to roughly two orders of magnitude a less steep slope and the uncertainties in lc50 values resulted in estimated isolation distances range from 20 m to 2000 m 5 4 implications of individual and population variability the individual based lepix model provides especially insight into the variation in mortality to be expected for a single larva or single populations such analyses are useful when impacts on protected butterfly species need to be taken into account many protected species have a limited potential for recovery and are already under threat by multiple stressors efsa 2016a in addition many of these species are rare and only occur in small populations and thus are highly vulnerable to extinction for this reason the relevant protection goal may need to focus on single populations or in the case of highly protected species on single individuals of a population the variability of the mortality rates on the population level varied from 0 to 50 fig 6a the variability on the individual level was much higher fig 6b although the overall average mortality rate determined in our case example was about 25 random effects alone can lead to quite different outcomes for the same specific input parameter set in different model populations as demonstrated in fig 6c and d therefore it may be misleading to consider only average mortality rates especially in the context of conservation of single individuals or populations 6 conclusions we present lepix as a versatile tool to assist the risk assessment and risk management of bt maize effects on non target lepidoptera the model balances the need for detailed biological data while offering a high degree of stochasticity to account for the natural variabilities for all three model components i pollen deposition and exposure ii larval phenology and iii larval mortality lepix allows modelling the effect of larval phenology on the likelihood of exposure to maize pollen and can be used to derive risk management measures in terms of isolation distances however the definition of such distances will depend on the amount of uncertainties that regulators and risk managers are willing to accept a sensitivity analysis of our model implementation for i io revealed a prominent influence of both lc50 value and the slope of the dose response equation on the mortality estimate this stresses the importance of obtaining reliable more standardized toxicity data before any decision can be made on the risk assessment and risk management prior to market release of bt maize lang and otto 2010 although this has been realized by the efsa gmo panel perry et al 2012 as the eu regulatory authority very few data especially on non pest species are available in technical dossiers or in public literature our results strongly speak in favour of reliable ecotoxicological data that should be routinely calculated and reported together with estimates of their variability perry et al 2012 without reliable data uncertainty in risk management measures can be high and respective measures can be difficult to defend the individual based approach provides insights in the variability of mortality estimates of individuals or single populations and stresses that mortality in single populations or of individuals can be substantially higher than the average model predictions this aspect has so far not been fully taken into account in the assessment of risks for highly protected butterfly species and may stimulate the scientific discussion on alternative approaches to the current risk assessment practice of protected species efsa 2015 lepix will be further developed and is not restricted in its applications to gmos the model design might also be useful in a wider context for different crop plants toxicants and non target species in principal the conceptual model and its modules are suited for simulating any effect of a toxic component in pollen such as pesticide residuals from systemic insecticides acknowledgements we thank

25326,the cultivation of bt maize genetically modified to be resistant to insect pests has led to intense scientific and political debate about its possible adverse impacts on biodiversity to better address this question we developed an individual based simulation model lepix lepix considers the temporal dynamics of maize pollen shedding and larval phenology and pollen deposition on host plants related to distance from the maize field in order to estimate mortality of lepidopteran larvae exposed to toxic bt pollen we employed a refined exposure analysis comparison to previous approaches using recent evidence on leaf pollen deposition and accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of pollen on leaves moreover we used a stochastic approach considering literature data on a minimum dataset for butterfly biology in combination with historic data on temporal pollen deposition to predict the coincidence between larval phenology and pollen deposition since conservation management actions may act at the level of the individual for protected species lepix as an individual based spatially explicit model is suited to assist both risk assessment and management measures based on threshold mortalities we tested our model using inachis io lepidoptera nymphalidae as butterfly species and the cultivation of insect resistant mon810 maize in accordance to predictions based on other models we identified mortality risks of i io larvae for the second larval generation an analysis of the sensitivity of input parameters stressed the importance of both the slope and the lc50 value of the dose response curve as well as the earliest day of larval hatching using different published data to characterize the dose response of mon810 pollen to i io we revealed consequences due to uncertainties in ecotoxicological parameters and thus highlight the importance of key biological parameters for reliable estimates of effects and decision making e g isolation distances in risk assessment keywords

sweet 2002 habitats adjacent to bt maize cultivation fields will be exposed to pollen containing bt proteins hofmann et al 2010 and off field effects have to be considered in the risk assessment maize flowering and the larval phenology of many butterfly species overlap therefore non target butterflies in europe are likely at risk lang et al 2015 musche et al 2009 schmitz et al 2003 traxler and gaugg 2005 this risk will depend on a variety of factors such as the degree of temporal overlap in phenologies amount of pollen to be expected on host plants toxin concentration in pollen and sensitivity of the non target species risk assessment prior to gmo authorization requires substantial data and analytical tools in 2009 the european food safety authority efsa deployed a first mathematical simulation model to predict the consequences of cultivation of bt maize on non target lepidoptera efsa 2009 perry et al 2010 this model has been developed further to take new aspects and data for the assessment into account efsa 2011a b 2012 2015 in addition holst et al 2013a b estimated the mortality of the peacock butterfly inachis io caused by bt maize in a simulation model of the butterfly s annual life cycle over laid with the phenology of maize pollen deposition on the leaves of the food plant urtica dioica however the model has not been used in the context of regulatory purposes and did not include spatial aspects such as the distance of larvae and host plants to the maize field here we present a new simulation model lepix 1 0 to estimate off field effects of bt maize cultivation on non target butterfly species our model is designed to simulate the temporal overlap of maize flowering and larval phenology pollen deposition on host plants depending on the distance to the maize field and the effect of bt pollen exposure on the mortality of butterfly larvae because we can obtain information on both individual larvae and populations lepix is especially suited to analyse effects on rare endangered and or protected lepidoptera as these may be protected on the level of the individuum and or population the exposure module of our model uses the so far most comprehensive set of field data from research projects dealing with maize pollen deposition which were initiated by the german federal agency for nature conservation in collaboration with german federal states to improve the assessment of bt maize exposure on non target organisms hofmann et al 2009 2011 2013 2014 2016 2 the lepix model at first we specify the purpose of the model section 2 1

to estimate mortality probabilities for non target insect species affected by bt maize dependent on the distance from the maize field the information obtained assists the risk assessment and risk management of genetically engineered plants that express bt proteins as insecticidal components 2 2 model description in principle lepix is a generic model that can be parametrized for any species or group of butterflies or moth and for any geographical location and for any gm crop variety as a case study we used the bt maize event mon810 and the non target species inachis io at two locations in germany bad hersfeld and rheinfelden where it is known to be univoltine and bivoltine respectively see section 3 2 2 1 general structure and design species protected under e g the german federal species protection regulations bundesartenschutzverordnung bartschv are protected not only as populations but also as individuals therefore a model for risk assessment of individuals is desirable and motivates an individual based approach grimm and railsback 2005 lepix is discrete in time and simulates a time period of one year with a time step of one day for each year both a specific temporal pattern of pollen shedding during the flowering period and mean daily temperatures are randomly chosen from historical field data these temporal patterns serve as input data for the simulation of butterfly phenology and exposure the daily development of larvae depends on the sums of daily temperatures weather the risk of mortality per day depends on the amount of pollen one single larva is exposed to daily the quantitative exposure is not equal for all larvae therefore we included spatial variation of the deposition on host plants according to the data of hofmann et al 2016 this leads to an individual pollen exposure for each larva in the model the lepix model simulates the development and exposure of 1000 larvae during one year this simulation was repeated 1000 times with different randomly chosen temporal patterns for flowering periods pollen shedding and daily temperatures weather in the following we refer to these 1000 simulated populations as 1000 simulation runs and denote the ensemble of the 1000 simulated populations as one scenario i e for one fixed model parameter setting the distances between the maize field and the location of maize pollen deposition were taken into account by using long term monitoring data of fields which were cultivated under common agricultural conditions hofmann et al 2014 in this way the lepix model is in substance spatially implicit i e the exact positions of the larvae in space or on the host plants are not considered the lepix model consists of five modules fig 1 the weather module provides the daily temperatures of one year and passes this information to the individual module where the individual larval periods are simulated the pollen deposition module provides the amount of bt maize pollen on the host plant leaves at any distance from the maize field and for each day of the year the exposure module simulates the relevant exposure to pollen of each larva the individual exposure rates finally result in the individual risks of mortality mortality module in the lepix model the individuals do not interact and no reproduction or resource limitation is considered stochasticity plays a major role in all sub models for details see section 2 2 2 especially the start of the larval stage and the daily variation in consumed pollen are drawn from probability distributions which also stochastically affect individual traits e g the development time of a larva the model is implemented in c following a purely object orientated approach and agent based modelling design patterns grimm and railsback 2005 using r for statistical post process analysis r core team 2016 2 2 2 sub models in detail weather module the weather module provides the mean daily temperature t t for a day of year t in the run of one year for the two example study sites rheinfelden baden württemberg germany and bad hersfeld hesse germany we used series of daily temperature measurements provided by the german weather service dwd for the years 1961 2010 for each simulation run one specific series of measurements over the period of one year was randomly chosen i e for one simulation run the 1000 individuals considered experienced the same daily temperatures these daily temperatures t t determine the development time of one larva by means of a degree days approach as described in the individual model below individual module the individual model considers the phenology of butterfly larvae in this module both the day of occurrence and the duration of the larval period from hatching until pupation are determined for each larva this module uses as input data a start date for the hatching of a larva from an egg t 0 l denoted by an id code l and the daily temperature series t t from the weather module t 0 l is drawn for each larva individually from a beta distribution where the range of the distribution i e the possible earliest and latest days for hatching is obtained from published phenology data based on field observations for the species considered if multiple butterfly generations occur per year in the corresponding location the module considers multiple hatching periods in the following the earliest day of hatching of a generation is denoted by th begin the duration of larval period δt l of larva l is calculated from the weather data and the simple degree days approach baskerville and emin 1969 i e the daily non negative differences between temperature t t and a given threshold temperature t min are accumulated until a limit degree days temperature t dd larva is reached in recursive form this reads as t a c c u m t t a c c u m t 1 max t t t min 0 f o r t t 0 l a n d t a c c u m t 0 l m a x t t 0 l t min 0 the day t where t a c c u m t exceeds t dd larva is assumed to set the day of individual pupation thus the larval period of an individual l has the length of δt l t t 0 l the length of the individual pupal period δt p is calculated analogously to the larval period with the same temperature threshold t min but with a different limit degree days temperature t dd pupa in summary this module defines the following state variables for each butterfly larva time of hatching t 0 l duration of larval period δt l and duration of its pupal period δt p the end of the larval instar is t end l t 0 l δt l and the emergence of imagines is at t end p t 0 l δt l δt p deposition module maize pollen deposition was derived from a large dataset hofmann et al 2014 obtained by standardized technical sampling pmf mass filter standardized via vdi 4330 3 and cen ts 16817 1 covering 10 years and different locations mostly in germany but also including sites in belgium and switzerland each of the 214 sampling points used in hofmann et al 2014 represents the integrated pollen deposition for one sampling point over the entire flowering period and thus approximates the total amount of pollen deposited at this location all these data reflect the common maize cultivation practices in germany which also should be expected if bt maize is commercialized the deposition module simulates the maize pollen flow during the flowering period and the deposition of maize pollen on host plants for each day t and for different distances d from a maize field the host plant used in our case was nettle urtica dioica l the amount of pollen was transformed to the amount of pollen accumulated on host plants i e nettles leaves by calibrating pmf data to field data of pollen deposition on host plants hofmann et al 2016 maize pollen deposition dependent on the distance to the maize field according to hofmann et al 2014 the mean amount μ of maize pollen deposition as measured by pmf samplers follows a power law function dependent on the distance d from the nearest maize field μ d 127 d 0 585 note that dimensions are neglected this standardized integrated deposition measured by a pmf mass filter quantifies the total amount of maize pollen over the entire maize flowering period with the usual cultivation practices in germany the standardized integrated deposition varies according to regional and local differences e g climate soil sowing date seed varieties taking this variation into account the integrated pollen deposition variation at a given distance d follows a log normal distribution p d l n μ d σ d where μ d and σ d can be derived from the mean and the confidence intervals of the datasets respectively provided by hofmann et al 2014 according to the distance d the value of p d is chosen randomly for each simulation run temporal distribution of pollen deposition pollen release during the flowering period is not constant but depends on climatic conditions a diurnal pattern is typical for the release of pollen and is correlated to turbulent weather conditions during the day boehm et al 2008 hofmann et al 2013 unfavourable weather conditions regularly cause interruptions of the period in which maize pollen is released which leads to a prolonged period of pollen dispersal rather than a compact period hofmann et al 2013 long term measurements of maize pollen are available from ganderkesee lower saxony germany for the years 1994 to 2010 data kindly provided by r wachter pollenflug nord in cooperation with f hofmann see also hofmann et al 2008 2013 these temporally resolved periods of maize pollen deposition were used to simulate the variability of the temporal pattern of maize pollen over the flowering period in the simulation how the actual total pollen amount at a distance d is distributed over the days in a year comprises two aspects first the starting day of pollen shedding has to be set second one has to determine for each day which proportion of the actual total amount of pollen is disposed per day i e the temporal pattern of pollen distribution in a simulation year as a basis for our model approach we used long term data of the temporal maize pollen shedding for the site ganderkesee see above these data encompass the time span over which the pollen concentration in the air h 1994 t h 2010 t was measured per day t in 1 of 17 consecutive years 1994 2010 the starting date t s of the temporal flowering pattern for a simulation year is drawn from a uniform distribution t s u t s b e g i n t s e n d where t s begin and t s end is the earliest and latest day in a year respectively on which pollen was observed in the field in order to simulate realistic temporal patterns of pollen deposition the relative proportion of pollen that is deposited per day is calculated from each of the 17 datasets of hofmann et al 2009 thus we obtained 17 different temporal patterns h 1994 t h 2010 t for the relative daily pollen deposition each of which fulfill t 0 364 h n t 1 where n denotes the year of measurement 1994 2010 for each year in a simulation run a specific temporal pattern h n t is randomly chosen but as described above the starting day t s for shedding is randomly distributed therefore we have to shift the values of h n t in time such that the beginning of shedding in the chosen temporal pattern h n t coincides with the chosen starting day t s we denote these shifted temporal patterns as h n t s t in this way we have at distance d p a i r d t p d h n t s t i e the simulated pollen deposition at day t in a simulation year for a given starting day t s estimation of pollen deposition on leaves since the daily amount of pollen in the air determines the amount of pollen on host plant leaves it is necessary to relate pmf estimates of pollen deposition air to pollen deposition on the acceptor surface leaf in the model this is achieved by the factor γ which has been determined in field experiments by using different methods in parallel hofmann et al 2016 the daily amount of pollen on the leaves is assumed to accumulate on the host plant leaves and therefore the deposition amounts from the previous day must be taken into account however we assumed that the amount of pollen of the previous day only partly remains on the host leaves because of wind and or rain to simulate this decline in pollen density over time a loss rate ε is introduced which describes the relative amount of pollen that is lost per day in summary the mean deposition on day t on a host plant leaf at distance d for a year is p l e a f t p l e a f t 1 1 ε γ p a i r d t pollen is not uniformly distributed on host plant leaves hofmann et al 2011 2016 hofmann et al 2016 have shown that the spatial distribution of maize pollen on host plant leaves can be described by a log normal density distribution with specific parameters for different plant species because butterfly larvae especially young and thus sensitive instars feed only on a small fraction of leaves the spatial distribution of pollen will ultimately influence the exposure of larvae to pollen and thus the magnitude of effects as dose and effect are non linearly related see mortality module it is important to include the spatial variability of pollen densities on host plant leaves hofmann et al 2016 the data of hofmann et al 2016 motivates the use of a log normal distribution which uses p l e a f t as μ parameter and a constant σ leaf parameter thus the pollen amount p l e a f i t on a leaf i is considered to be a derivative p l e a f i t l n p l e a f t σ l e a f exposure module the exposure module estimates the amount of pollen per cm2 that each larva is exposed to this information is required for determining the risk of mortality see next section in determining the pollen exposure for each larva in a simulation run we made two assumptions i each larva feeds only on one particular part of a leaf per day and ii the pollen exposure of a larva l results from the deposition values p l e a f i t of a number of m consecutive days as described in detail in the following according to the first assumption the daily deposition of pollen p l t on the position where a larva l is located is p l t p l e a f i t where p l e a f i t is provided by the deposition module these values are used to calculate the exposure a l of the specific larva using the equation a l 1 4 max t t 4 p l t f o r e v e r y t s t 0 l t e n d l 4 a l is actually the mean pollen deposition on leaves derived from the sum of pollen deposition during the time period m the time period m was set to 4 days in our example as a proxy for the exposure time that elicits effects from the uptake of bt pollen mortality module the pollen exposure of individual larva a l as described in the previous section is the basis for deriving the risk of mortality of an individual larva we assume in our model that each individual larva can only be subjected once to mortality caused by the ingestion of bt pollen in order to estimate the toxic effect of bt pollen on a given species c the slope and the lc50 value from an empirical dose response relationship of pollen of the relevant bt maize event and the butterfly species are needed we used a hill equation as a dose response relationship frank 2013 to calculate the mortality m c dependent on the amount of pollen al to which a larva of the species c is exposed m c a l 1 1 a l l c 50 c s l o p e this individual mortality is used to determine the mortalities of a population of 1000 larvae in a simulation run and the mean mortality of 1000 runs i e 1000 simulated populations are considered as an estimator of the mean risk of mortality for one particular parameter setting scenario 3 case example calibration and settings the lepix model can in principle be used for any butterfly species geographical region and bt maize event we calibrated the model for bt maize event mon810 which produces the lepidopteran active bt protein cry1ab mon810 maize is the only bt maize currently approved for cultivation in the eu the lepidopteran species i io used in our case example bryant et al 2000 2002 ebert and rennwald 1991 is common in agricultural areas of europe and is protected in some eu member states holst et al 2013b i io also has been the subject of earlier risk assessments and is used as a model species efsa 2009 holst et al 2013b perry et al 2010 different estimates of the toxicity of mon810 pollen for i io have been found see table 1 below 3 1 geographical regions we chose two locations for our study in bad hersfeld 50 52ʹ12 n 9 42ʹ7ʹʹe in central germany i io is univoltine in rheinfelden 47 35ʹ23ʹʹn 7 46ʹ8 e close to the swiss border i io is bivoltine ebert and rennwald 1991 3 2 individual module because generally few phenotypic data of larval stages are available in the literature we calculated the beginning of the larval period based on phenotypic data of imagines as follows we chose the earliest egg hatch date t h begin such that the simulated occurrence patterns of the imagines matches the phenotypic observations given in the literature ebert and rennwald 1991 thus for bad hersfeld the value of t h begin was set to 19 may and for rheinfelden the value of t h begin of the first larval generation was set to 15 may and the value of the second generation was set to 20 july the temperature sums for larval and pupal development were 315 2 and 110 0 degree days respectively with a lower temperature threshold of 8 3 c bryant et al 2002 3 3 deposition module we chose the earliest day for the beginning of pollen shedding t s begin as 14 july and the latest day t s end as 5 august these dates represent the earliest and latest dates recorded in long term measurements of the temporal distribution of maize pollen see deposition module in section 2 2 2 the ratio γ of pollen flow in the air to pollen deposition on the host plant leaves nettle was set to 0 68 as given in hofmann et al 2016 only few data are available for estimating the daily loss rate ε of pollen on plant leaves to obtain a realistic value of ε we compared distributions of on leaf pollen deposition provided by field measurements hofmann et al 2016 with simulated distributions we identified ε 20 pollen loss per day as a reasonable value for ε in our simulations this value is in the range of other estimates e g holst et al 2013b although the standard deviation of the simulated distributions was slightly lower than that of the field data of hofmann et al 2016 3 4 mortality module different estimates of the dose response curve of i io to pollen containing cry1ab from mon810 have been determined to take this source of uncertainty into account we ran the model with different combinations of the various lc50 values and the two slopes of the dose response curve table 1 and fig 2 when necessary the slope parameter slope was transformed from a probit response relationship to the hill equation perry et al 2010 4 results according to the calibration of the model for i io and the two geographical regions we performed various simulations to validate the model estimate rates of mortality and analyse the sensitivity of the model results according to the input parameters the output of the individual module simulating the phenology of i io was in good agreement with field data ebert and rennwald 1991 for larval and adult phenology in the regions where univoltine e g bad hersfeld or bivoltine e g rheinfelden larval generations of i io can be expected this corroborates the phenology module in which a simple degree days model and literature data bryant et al 2000 2002 have been used to simulate the phenology of i io according to ebert and rennwald 1991 the first larval generation of i io can be observed in the upper rhine valley from may to the beginning of july and the second larval generation can be observed from august to september with some larvae developing in october or november in extreme years the imagines from the first and second larval generation can be sighted typically in july and from the end of august through october respectively we simulated larval and adult phenologies for both generations using the climatic data of rheinfelden fig 3 we found a good correspondence between the observed and simulated times for the occurrence of both larvae and imagines especially the simulated larval phenology fit the observations well and confirmed sensu oreskes et al 1994 our approach to estimate the average risk of mortality of an individual of i io dependent on the distance to a field of bt maize we simulated 1000 populations of 1000 individuals each see section 2 2 1 simulations showed no apparent 1 mortality rates with the climatic conditions in bad hersfeld where i io is univoltine data not shown with climatic data from rheinfelden where i io is bivoltine the simulations predicted low mortality rates of the first larval generation of i io similar to those of bad hersfeld but higher mortality rates 1 for the second larval generation depending on the distance to the maize field and toxicological input data fig 4 we used a threshold of 1 mortality as this threshold is currently used in the risk assessment of bt maize at the eu level efsa 2015 both the distance and the ecotoxicological parameters influenced the risk of mortality fig 4 mortality decreased with increasing distance to the maize field and with decreasing sensitivity increasing lc50 furthermore mortality estimates depended on the slope as an input parameter to describe the dose response equation steeper slopes in this respect decreased mortality estimates because of non linear relationships this decrease was more distinct with increasing distance to the maize field for example assuming an lc50 value of 2972 pollen cm2 mortalities of 5 9 and 0 3 were predicted at a distance of 1 m whereas mortalities of 0 75 and 0 04 were predicted at a distance of 100 m for the applied slopes of 0 84 and 1 76 respectively see also sensitivity analysis below to test the robustness of the model results presented above against the chosen values for the model parameters we performed a two stage sensitivity analysis we analysed simulations of the second generation of i io in rheinfelden which had the highest mortality in our simulations in the first step we identified parameters that had the most severe impact on the results for this purpose for each of the four different lc50 values we used a latin hypercube sampling with uniform stratified parameter values for nearly all model parameters saltelli et al 2008 and simulated a total of 1000 simulations runs data not shown the analyses indicated that besides the lc50 value whose impact on mortality is obvious the average individual risks of mortality are most strongly influenced by the parameters slope in the dose response curve and the earliest day of hatching parameter t h begin of the second generation in the second step the two parameters slope and t h begin were varied systematically in combination to test for their impact on mortality risks the risk of mortality invariably decreased with steeper slopes for different dates of first hatching fig 5 complementary the mortality rates for different slopes depicted a maximum at ca t h begin 200 days i e 18 july this date mirrors a maximum overlap of larvae occurrence and pollen shedding the mean mortality rates as shown in figs 4 and 5 were derived for each parameter set from a sample of 1000 simulated populations each providing one mean individual mortality rate within the population the differences between the simulated populations are solely due to different realizations of random processes i e weather and individual hatching times see section 2 2 2 to estimate the variation in individual mortality rates we looked for the variation in risks of mortality within single populations as an example fig 6 a demonstrates for a specific parameter setting with a distance of 40 m from the bt maize field the distribution of 1000 mean individual mortality values gained from 1000 simulated populations in this example the mean mortality risk was about 25 but it varied from 0 to about 50 when we considered the total sample of 1000 1000 pooled individuals from all simulated populations for one specific distance to the field we observed a multimodal distribution with a distinct maximum in the class of nearly zero mortality fig 6b where approximately 10 of all individuals do not notably suffer mortality the remaining individuals were assigned to risks of mortality ranging from 1 to approximately 80 the graphs in fig 6c and d exemplify the distribution of individual mortalities for two particular populations using the identical input parameters as in fig 6b although both populations belong to the same sample that leads to an average individual mortality risk of about 25 the simulations demonstrate that different distributions can be observed in one run the majority of individuals of a population hardly suffered any mortality fig 6c whereas in other runs individual mortality covered the entire range between 0 and 1 fig 6d note that this striking difference is solely due to random effects 5 discussion 5 1 general remarks the lepix model presented here is an individual based model designed to estimate the risk of mortality of non target butterfly larvae caused by exposure to bt toxins expressed in pollen of insect resistant bt maize lepix can be easily applied to other bt maize events both single and stacked events and to other species of lepidoptera the specific data needed should in principle be available from the scientific literature and from market applications of the respective bt maize the conceptual model can be also applied for crop species other than maize and different taxa of non target organisms the agent based approach in the lepix model allows explicit consideration of the impact of variability on the estimation of the individual risk of mortality in the lepix model variability is considered in nearly all features weather temperature occurrence of larvae pollen deposition and individual exposure this variability in the processes finds expression in stochastic distributions for the output variables and provides a much more distinct interpretation of model outcomes than the use of just mean values alone in this way lepix is suitable for assessing individual mortality probabilities which might need to be considered for strictly protected species the ability to assess such individual mortality probabilities is one major advantage of the use of agent based models grimm and railsback 2006 in this respect lepix differs from the model currently used in the eu risk assessment efsa 2015 perry et al 2010 2012 lepix provides not only quantitative values for important output variables such as the risk of mortality but also constitutes a valuable tool for investigation of the sensitivity of model assumptions to these variables the model can be used to directly compare different scenarios and parameter sets in view of the output variables see below 5 2 comparison to other approaches to date two other models for estimating lepidopteran larvae mortality caused by bt maize pollen have been published see introduction the efsa model efsa 2015 perry et al 2010 2012 and the btbuttox model holst et al 2013a b like the efsa model lepix can be used to take various distances to the bt maize field into account all three models use a dose response curve to calculate mortality and do not consider sub lethal effects in contrast to the efsa model perry et al 2012 lepix does not make any assumptions on the distribution of host plants butterfly populations or adoption of bt maize cultivation any comparisons of lepix to the efsa model must therefore be made to the present efsa local model efsa 2015 only the btbuttox and lepix models simulate the temporal coincidence of larvae and maize pollen to do so an insect module and a deposition module are required holst et al 2013b used a full scale insect model requiring detailed biological input whereas we reduced biological input data used in lepix to reflect the lack of availability of detailed data on e g the lifespan or the pre oviposition period for most butterfly species instead the phenology module of lepix is mainly driven by a simple degree days model and relies on field observation data on the adult flight period which is available for many species a single observation of the flight activity of a species can also be used to derive accumulated degree days sums for a species if weather data for the region can be obtained although larval development is variable and in part dependent on environmental and genetic factors friberg et al 2011 saastamoinen et al 2013 degree days calculation are useful for predicting phenology of butterflies across species cayton et al 2015 the btbuttox model does not include a distance relationship of the deposition of maize pollen and the maize field by contrast both the current efsa model efsa 2015 and the lepix model use in principle the same distance relationship of hofmann et al 2014 compared to other approaches lepix uses the so far most comprehensive set of field data to estimate pollen deposition on plant leaves and is the only model that accounts for the variability of pollen on leaves compared to holst et al 2013b who approximated pollen deposition on leaves using durham samplers that operated over one single year and in one single location in japan kawashima et al 2004 both the lepix and efsa models derive pollen deposition on leaves from long term monitoring data obtained using standardized technical samplers hofmann et al 2014 to translate pollen counts from technical samplers to acceptor specific pollen deposition on leaves of specific host plants we followed the approach of hofmann et al 2016 who experimentally compared the efficacy of different sampling methods and thus was able to calibrate pmf measurements to in situ field measurements of pollen deposition on host plant leaves in contrast to the efsa model efsa 2015 this has the advantage of replacing expert estimates with field data in addition we included the variability of pollen deposition among leaves as dose response effects are basically non linear it is important to consider this variability explicitly for a reliable risk assessment the results of modelling larval mortality using the lepix and btbuttox models can only be partially compared because the conceptual models and the model formulations differ the results of the two models for i io are in good agreement in that they predict no apparent mortality for the first generation of i io regardless of the chosen climatic data similar to the btbuttox results of holst et al 2013b the lack of mortality effects predicted by lepix can be explained by the lack of overlap between pollen shedding and larval occurrence for the second larval generation in rheinfelden however the importance of this overlap is reflected in the sensitivity analysis of model parameters which stresses the importance of the beginning of the larval period for the prediction of mortality with identical dose response parameters slope 1 76 lc50 451 pollen cm2 the lepix model predicts 28 mortality for i io larvae feeding on host plants at the field edge 0 2 m this value is on the lower end but within the range of the estimates 28 86 of holst et al 2013a b taking into account different assumptions for pollen deposition rates of the btbuttox model with parameter settings for the dose response similar to those of the efsa model slope 0 84 lc50 5800 pollen cm2 the lepix model predicts 6 9 mortality for i io larvae feeding on host plants at the field edge 0 2 m although a direct comparison of estimates with the current version of the efsa model efsa 2015 is difficult we can compare the estimates indirectly by using suggested mitigation measures to keep mortalities of larvae 1 to achieve this threshold efsa 2015 recommends isolation distances of 5 m to 20 m depending on the parameter setting our results for i io are in keeping with this lepix predicts a mortality of i io of 0 9 at a distance of 20 m and a moderately higher mortality of 1 7 at a distance of 5 m from the maize field it is important to note however that some butterfly species have a higher sensitivity to mon810 pollen cry1ab toxin for native species in europe this has been demonstrated e g for the protected common swallowtail papilio machaon l lang and vojtech 2006 or for the diamondback moth plutella xystostella especially p xystostellahas been reported to be highly sensitive to cry1 and thus will better perform as a surrogate for highly sensitive species felke et al 2002 wolt et al 2005 using the efsa correction factor of 31 05 perry et al 2010 to adjust the toxin concentration from bt176 pollen to mon810 pollen the lc50 value of p xystotella larvae l4 is estimated to be 595 pollen cm2 felke et al 2002 and larger isolation distances will apply for the risk management see table 2 5 3 implications of uncertainty although the output of lepix is in agreement with previous calculations the modelling results also highlight the importance of input data for the model outcome to date the scientific discussion in this context has mainly focused on exposure estimates efsa 2015 2016b hofmann et al 2014 2016 kruse plass et al 2017 perry et al 2013 and it is agreed that the exposure estimate will have a strong influence on any model predicting the effects of the exposure of non target organisms to bt pollen however our simulations demonstrate that both lc50 and the slope of the dose response curve strongly influence mortalities and thus envisaged risk management measures these findings agree with those of perry et al 2012 who stressed the importance of these parameters for the efsa model as has been shown in figs 4 and 5 both the slope and the lc50 value of the dose response as well as the timing of larval development will influence the mortality estimate imprecisions in these model parameter in consequence will affect not only the mortality estimate but also any risk management measure using this estimate in our case example a less steep slope 0 84 of the dose response curve caused higher mortality of i io larvae regardless of the assumed lc50 value or the distance to the maize field compared to a steep slope a less steep slope will increase the mortality estimate if the environmental concentration of the stressor bt protein in pollen is lower than the lc50 value as the distance relationship of maize pollen follows a power function larger distances will increase the probability that exposure levels are below the lc50 even for highly sensitive species in our case example this can be illustrated by comparing the mortality estimates for different slopes at a given distance assuming an lc50 value of 1351 pollen cm2 the less steep slope 0 84 in comparison to the steeper slope 1 76 results in about a 4 30 97 and 220 fold increase in mortality for distances of 0 2 10 100 and 500 m respectively our modelling results affirm the use of less steep slope estimates for the risk assessment in order not to underestimate effects perry et al 2010 this may also be reasonable as the influence of sub lethal effects such as reduced weight and presumably fitness or prolonged developmental time on individual fitness or population growth have not yet been included in simulation models to date no standardized ecotoxicity testing for lepidoptera exists which takes exposure of larvae to toxic pollen into account the lack of agreed methodology causes considerable uncertainties which have been addressed in detail in lang and otto 2010 in fact in experiments carried out to determine lc50 values for bt toxins and lepidoptera some of the used experimental parameters such as exposure time the time of mortality readings or the lack of secondary stressors have been criticized to underestimate real effects lang et al 2011 as lepix can rely only on available data this uncertainty has to be addressed in the final risk assessment and risk management provided that suitable data exist some uncertainties in lc50 values can be addressed by the use of species sensitivity distributions posthuma et al 2002 this approach has been followed in the current efsa model efsa 2015 perry et al 2012 and is useful for estimating e g effects on species of conservation concern for which ecotoxicological data are lacking both lc50 and slope estimates and to a minor extent estimates of larval phenology will influence risk management measures we illustrate this in table 2 which provides isolation distances based on lepix calculations needed to obtain mortality estimates for i io larvae 1 see above when the steep slope is used changes in the lc50 value do not alter isolation distances greatly i e all distances lie within one order of magnitude when the gentler slope in lepix is used however isolation distances greatly increase to roughly two orders of magnitude a less steep slope and the uncertainties in lc50 values resulted in estimated isolation distances range from 20 m to 2000 m 5 4 implications of individual and population variability the individual based lepix model provides especially insight into the variation in mortality to be expected for a single larva or single populations such analyses are useful when impacts on protected butterfly species need to be taken into account many protected species have a limited potential for recovery and are already under threat by multiple stressors efsa 2016a in addition many of these species are rare and only occur in small populations and thus are highly vulnerable to extinction for this reason the relevant protection goal may need to focus on single populations or in the case of highly protected species on single individuals of a population the variability of the mortality rates on the population level varied from 0 to 50 fig 6a the variability on the individual level was much higher fig 6b although the overall average mortality rate determined in our case example was about 25 random effects alone can lead to quite different outcomes for the same specific input parameter set in different model populations as demonstrated in fig 6c and d therefore it may be misleading to consider only average mortality rates especially in the context of conservation of single individuals or populations 6 conclusions we present lepix as a versatile tool to assist the risk assessment and risk management of bt maize effects on non target lepidoptera the model balances the need for detailed biological data while offering a high degree of stochasticity to account for the natural variabilities for all three model components i pollen deposition and exposure ii larval phenology and iii larval mortality lepix allows modelling the effect of larval phenology on the likelihood of exposure to maize pollen and can be used to derive risk management measures in terms of isolation distances however the definition of such distances will depend on the amount of uncertainties that regulators and risk managers are willing to accept a sensitivity analysis of our model implementation for i io revealed a prominent influence of both lc50 value and the slope of the dose response equation on the mortality estimate this stresses the importance of obtaining reliable more standardized toxicity data before any decision can be made on the risk assessment and risk management prior to market release of bt maize lang and otto 2010 although this has been realized by the efsa gmo panel perry et al 2012 as the eu regulatory authority very few data especially on non pest species are available in technical dossiers or in public literature our results strongly speak in favour of reliable ecotoxicological data that should be routinely calculated and reported together with estimates of their variability perry et al 2012 without reliable data uncertainty in risk management measures can be high and respective measures can be difficult to defend the individual based approach provides insights in the variability of mortality estimates of individuals or single populations and stresses that mortality in single populations or of individuals can be substantially higher than the average model predictions this aspect has so far not been fully taken into account in the assessment of risks for highly protected butterfly species and may stimulate the scientific discussion on alternative approaches to the current risk assessment practice of protected species efsa 2015 lepix will be further developed and is not restricted in its applications to gmos the model design might also be useful in a wider context for different crop plants toxicants and non target species in principal the conceptual model and its modules are suited for simulating any effect of a toxic component in pollen such as pesticide residuals from systemic insecticides acknowledgements we thank

25327,odense fjord denmark has suffered from a drastic decline in eelgrass zostera marina coverage during the last decades in 1983 eelgrass still covered about 25 of the estuary which in 2005 was reduced to less than 2 the alarming decline in the past decades initiated preliminary restoration activities where it was questioned whether the present low eelgrass biomass is able to produce a sustainable seed bank to support natural recovery field studies verified that the seed bank was hampered laboratory experiments were conducted to determine 1 seed dispersion along the sediment surface and in the water column 2 settling rates of seeds and flowering shoots 3 critical current speed for seed movement 4 floating dynamic of flowering shoots and 5 seed dropping dynamics during transport of rafting shoots these parameters supported the development of an agent based model abm predicting seed movements in estuaries the model handled two ways of seed dispersal 1 seeds dropped in eelgrass beds and transport by hydrodynamic forces along the seabed 2 seeds released by rafting shoots this setup allowed assessment of both eelgrass seed loss and potential connectivity between beds seed losses were divided into direct losses such as seeds lost on land due to desiccation or external boundary and indirect losses affecting seedling establishment the model estimates that app 92 of the seeds would be retained in the odense fjord while only 5 0 of the seeds ended up in areas supporting seedling establishment eelgrass seeds were also found in areas with insufficient light high hydrodynamic pressure excessive sediment reworking by lugworms or poor anchoring capacity in addition the model showed potential bed connectivity via rafting shoots but also with individual seed movement along the bottom when beds were not separated by deep areas such as boating channels keywords abm modelling seagrass seed bank dynamics restoration recovery seed loss seedling establishment 1 introduction eelgrass zostera marina is the most widespread seagrass species in the northern hemisphere moore and short 2006 eelgrass beds provide a set of essential ecosystem functions and services such as increase of biodiversity boström and bonsdorff 2000 duarte and chiscano 1999 hemminga and duarte 2000 moore and short 2006 nutrient cycling and therefore contribute to improve the water quality by immobilising nutrients coming from land in the coastal zones flindt 1994 flindt et al 1999 hemminga and duarte 2000 moore and short 2006 ward et al 1984 climate regulation through carbon sequestration and burial duffy 2006 fourqurean et al 2012 erosion control seabed stabilisation and coastal protection hansen and reidenbach 2012 and shelter for juvenile species hemminga and duarte 2000 orth et al 2006a terrados duarte 2000 in 1900 a total area of approximately 6726 km2 was covered by eelgrass in danish coastal waters boström et al 2003 seagrass coverage has significantly decreased worldwide with global decline rates of 110 km2 y 1 since 1980s waycott et al 2009 decline of eelgrass coverage was in the 1930s caused by the wasting disease short et al 1987 and later by eutrophication lillebø et al 2011 waycott et al 2009 leading to high blooms of phytoplankton and opportunistic macroalgae creating turbid waters canal vergés et al 2014 canal vergés et al 2010 flindt et al 2007 flindt et al 1997 salomonsen et al 1997 in 1990s the eelgrass beds in odense fjord covered only 20 25 of the original eelgrass bed area in the 1900s boström et al 2003 due to the lack of eelgrass recovery todays estuarine ecosystems are less stable nutrients earlier immobilized by eelgrass uptake are today supporting macroalgae growth that are hindering the natural recovery of eelgrass where eelgrass seedlings are strongly impacted macroalgae movements due to generated ballistic impact flindt et al 2016 kuusemäe et al 2016 valdemarsen et al 2010 nevertheless successful large scale recolonization strongly depends on the existence of a seed bank as it is not feasible to recover large areas with clonal expansion boese et al 2009 olesen and sand jensen 1994 restoration of eelgrass beds occurs by seed dispersal orth et al 2006c or transplantation of vegetative shoots van katwijk et al 2016 vegetative growth is a slow process and not feasible for recolonization of extended areas of lost beds olesen 1999 thus existence of a seed bank is crucial orth et al 2006b for seed germination and formation of new beds the challenge is that eelgrass seed banks are transient harwell and orth 2002 with a fast turnover in contradiction to most terrestrial species eelgrass seeds stay viable for only 11 months in laboratory conditions harrison 1991 moore et al 1993 field campaigns in odense fjord have not been able to locate seed banks near or within existing beds flindt et al unpublished data rather it is hypothesised that the seeds are dispersed to deeper areas or washed on land in addition the lack of seeds needed for natural recovery can be attributed the decline of pristine eelgrass beds which act as donor and main seed production sites connectivity between sparsely located eelgrass beds may have been lost hindering natural recovery gene exchange and resilience to seascape changes kendrick et al 2016 a high genetic diversity have also been shown to increase restoration success reynolds et al 2013 eelgrass seeds are dispersed by several documented methods firstly seeds are negatively buoyant with settling rates of 1 4 8 6 cm s 1 delefosse et al 2016 infantes et al 2016 as a result several authors concluded that dispersal distances were short berkovic et al 2014 orth et al 2006b orth et al 1994 jahnke et al 2016 modelled dispersal capacity for z marina with distances from cm to m in reality this might not be the case as recent studies have shown that eelgrass seeds can be dispersed along the bottom by rolling around flindt et al unpublished data koch et al 2010 they are even capable of overcoming small seabed structures such as sand ripples flindt et al unpublished data secondly long distance seed dispersal has been shown by detached flowering shoots and fragments by rafting or as bedload transport erftemeijer et al 2008 flindt et al 1997 hosokawa et al 2015 källström et al 2008 flowering shoots are buoyant and float from 2 weeks to several months depending on the condition of the flowering shoot at the time of detachment harwell orth 2002 källström et al 2008 taking into account the various methods of seed transport erftemeijer et al 2008 hosokawa et al 2015 koch et al 2010 källström et al 2008 orth et al 2006b they all contribute to seed losses from the production sites seeds can be transported 1 to land where they dry out and the germination capacity is lost pan et al 2012 2 to deeper areas in the fjord estuary where seedling growth is impossible due to insufficient light intensities 3 to areas with high densities of lugworms that rework the sediment burry the seeds and uproot the seedlings valdemarsen et al 2011 4 to areas with a high organic content that reduces the sediment anchoring capacity of seedlings 5 to areas with high sediment mobility valdemarsen et al 2010 in many danish estuaries eelgrass seedlings are yearly supporting attempts to recover lost areas however in majority of the locations the low densities of emerging seedlings are lost within a few months valdemarsen et al 2010 combining the results with field surveys documenting very high seed losses from donor sites and seed broadcasting experiments lange 2010 unpublished suggests that loss rates of produced seeds may be an important explanation for the low success rates for natural recovery in danish estuaries therefore the aim of this work was to develop a dynamic model to assess eelgrass seed production dispersion and distribution as well as eelgrass bed connectivity using agent based modelling abm techniques keeping mass conservation of seeds in the model it may provide explanation for the lacking natural recovery in danish estuaries as well as predictions of optimal sites for eelgrass conservation actions for the model calibration and validation a field campaign and flume experiments were performed to quantify the flowering shoot densities seed densities seed losses and seed mobility understanding seed production and losses may support the identification of threshold quantities for seeds needed for natural recovery furthermore modelling a complex ecological function as seed dispersal will aid in revealing knowledge gaps understanding seed dispersal and seed banks in odense fjord will also support future restoration efforts orth et al 2006b currently several transplanting methods are being tested to increase the large scale transplantation success the existence of a viable seed bank may play a part in site selection for eelgrass conservation or restoration in order to increase its success the model will also be able to predict restoration sites where seeds would stay in their biosphere and hereby support the natural recovery process 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site odense fjord is a shallow estuary divided into inner and outer part with a mean depth of 0 9 m and 2 7 m respectively fyns amt 2006 it is located on the northern part of funen denmark fig 1 the fjord has a total area of 62 km2 and is connected to the open sea through a narrow opening the tidal amplitude fluctuates between 0 3 0 5 m riisgård et al 2008 valdemarsen et al 2010 the fjord is influenced by freshwater input from odense river at the southern part of the fjord together with several smaller rivers and streams along the coastline the mixing zone of salt and freshwater generates salinity gradient throughout the fjord hence the salinity ranges from 5 to 17 in the inner part and 15 25 at the outer part of the fjord valdemarsen et al 2010 odense fjord with a catchment area of 1046 km2 is heavily influenced by nutrient inputs prior to 1990 the annual external loading exceeded 2500 t total n y 1 and 300 t total p y 1 due to national environmental regulations the nutrient loading has decreased to current levels of about 1700 t n y 1 and 64 t p y 1 windolf et al 2013 as a result of long term nutrient inputs wave protected and deeper areas in the fjord have acted as sinks for suspended organic matter and associated nutrients contributing to the internal nutrient loading valdemarsen et al 2014 eelgrass meadows cover about 2 of the fjord extending out to a maximal depth of 2 6 m naturstyrelsen 2011 2 1 1 field campaign field campaigns to dalby bay fig 5 were established to quantify the flowering shoot densities seed densities and seed loss rates weekly measurements of flowering shoot densities were performed using a metal frame 0 5 0 5 m that was thrown randomly and the flowering shoots within the frame were counted n 5 flowering shoots were also collected and taken to the laboratory to estimate the seasonality of seed numbers in reproductive shoots experimental areas were designated specifically for both reproductive shoot counts and for collection of reproductive shoots to avoid interference between the measurements seed release from reproductive shoots was collected by randomly placing a circular frame area 0 05 m2 on top of the bed and the top 3 4 cm sediment seed mixture n 5 was harvested and sieved through a mesh ø 1 mm retaining seeds shells and debris the samples were brought back to the laboratory where the area specific seed density was calculated 2 1 2 flume experiments to measure the seed mobility thresholds a set of annular flume experiments were performed in the laboratory using the setup developed by lundkvist et al 2007 and canal vergés et al 2010 sandy sediment with a loss on ignition loi of 0 5 an average grain size of 162 μm was collected in odense fjord enebærodde sediment beds of app 9 cm depth app 5 l of sediment were formed in each flume and filled with about 17 l of estuarine water the flumes were left to acclimatise to ambient conditions for 7 days then pre collected mature seeds n 30 were placed at the sediment surface inside a defined section of the flume during the experiments seeds were subjected to increasing current velocities in incremental steps of 2 cm s 1 with duration of 10 min the seed mobility was followed by recording the time and respective current velocity according to each seed movement seed resuspension thresholds were also registered 2 2 model description following abm model was designed to bring better understanding of eelgrass seed dispersal to quantify seed losses follow seed movements in various climate conditions inspect eelgrass bed connectivity this tool is meant to help describe seed banks and their changes over years the 3d model setup consists of a hydrodynamic model a wave model and an ecological model the used mike software is developed by dhi www mikepoweredbydhi com mike 3fm was used for the hydrodynamic model mike sw for the wave model and the mike eco lab module was used for ecological modelling kuusemäe et al 2016 the ecological model includes two frameworks euler and lagrange the following section describes the model loosely following odd protocol by grimm et al 2010 a detailed description of the model is given in the appendix 2 2 1 entities state variables and scales agents individuals state variables model consists of 4 types of entities or agents describing different life stages and dispersal modes of eelgrass and its seeds fig 3 gives an overview about the relations between the different entities agents the entities are descripted in more detail later appendix in supplementary material in a simulation a varying number of particles representing an agent entity from a certain type can co occur each of these particles agents has its own set of variables states but behaves according to the definition of its group some types can spawn new particles of another class i e a patch plant can generate seeds or dislodged reproductive shoots class 1 s1 eelgrass seeds dropped from attached flowering shoots this class represents mobile seeds that are dropped from eelgrass meadows entities particles of this class are created by the plant patch class their movement is defined by the hydrodynamic flow conditions the surrounding biomass i e algae eelgrass in the current grid element and their settling speed once settled critical shear stress must be reached to cause resuspension and initiate movement a particle of this class keeps track of the distance and time of being immobile when particle has been incorporated to the sediment or lost to land outer boundary the number of seeds it was carrying are transferred to euler framework and particle is removed class 2 s2 eelgrass seeds dropped from rafting flowering shoots this class represents mobile eelgrass seeds that are dropped while rafting from reproductive shoots their behaviour is identical to class 1 s1 entities particles of this class are created by the class 3 fs the differentiations between s1 and s2 are purely made for seed bank analysis to be able determine the method dominating in specific areas class 3 fs flowering shoots dislodged from the bed this class represents dislodged reproductive shoots entities particles of this class are created by the plant patch class these entities are positively buoyant and float to the surface where their movement is defined by the hydrodynamic flow conditions and wind drift during the particles rafting it is capable of releasing seeds when they have matured this particle can drift maximum of 2 months flindt et al unpublished data each entity particle carries information about the number of flowering shoots and seed it represent time it is motionless and distance travelled if the particle entity reaches land or outer boundary it is removed from simulation and its seed and reproductive shoot numbers are transferred updated to euler frame work class 4 plant patch eelgrass plants in the meadow this immobile class represents eelgrass patches and meadows this class is responsible for flowering seed production and release creating particles of class 1 s1 and 3 fs flowering and seed production are driven by monitored eelgrass biomasses and densities observed flowering seasonality field studies conducted in 2015 at dalby bay seed release through seeds dropped from meadows creation of class 1 s1 is based on measured seed densities in the meadow during growth season while seed release through dislodgement of flowering shoots is kept 5 per day spatial units space is described by a grid of triangular and quadrangular elements describing the horizontal domain for the hydrodynamic simulation the model is comprised of 2388 finite elements with flexible grid sizes ranging from 243 to 321658 m2 fig 2 a the total model area covers 117 7 km2 each element can be addressed by its sequential number or coordinate the bathymetric or vertical description is spatially represented by several layers in each grid starting at the see surface it is made of 3 variable sized terrain following sigma layers up to 3 m depth followed by fixed 1 m layers to the bottom kuusemäe et al 2016 the domain has one open boundary red in fig 2 in the northern end and some other open boundaries representing rivers smaller water bodies contributing to the hydrodynamic conditions land boundaries green in fig 2 restrict the flow and movement of particles a position of an entity particle is described by a continuous x y z coordinate inside the model domain some all entities except class 4 plant patch may move freely in the model area if entities cross the open boundary or reach land i e at the next time step entity should be on the land they are lost and removed from the simulation any input parameter such as flow information biomass etc is based on a grid elements value i e each grid cell holds a set of values describing the environmental parameters in this cell in order to prevent discontinuities especially in the flow values represented to an entity can be the result of a spatial interpolation of the surrounding elements data from external sources e g wind biomass etc are mapped onto the according grid elements to speed up computation a parallelisation scheme may be applied where the total domain is split up into several smaller sub domains at the start of the simulation during the simulation these sub domains are computed independent of each other however taking the movement of particles from one sub domain to another one into account temporal scales the simulation time progresses in discrete steps of 1800 s the simulation period is from 1st of january 2009 to 1st of january 2010 environment information of a grid element is handled by eulerian framework apart from variables keeping track of the number of entities in a specific element for result extraction the model includes 17 parameters that set the environment for the entities controlling seed production and dispersal table 2 some of these input parameters are the results of previous hydrodynamic simulations of the same domain setup others represent user provided information 2 2 2 process overview and scheduling the process scheduling is done according to the following scheme in each time step the eulerian framework is updated first i e updated input parameters are processed in the order of the grid cells and for all grid elements then the lagrange framework is processed updating all particles of all classes in the domain here all particles of class 1 s1 are processed before particles of class 2 s2 and so on inside each class the particles are processed in the order of their current grid element position inside a single particle all variables are updated in the order of their definition finally resulting in a movement vector that is null for not moving particles this movement vector is used in the next time step to move the particle to its new position and possibly to a new grid element before computing the next change in the state variables if particles leave the domain through an open boundary or have their next location on land the particle is removed from the setup after all particles have been processed some eulerian variables e g final number of particles in an element get updated finally all results for the current time step are written two conceptual diagrams are added to aid visual understanding of the model in terms of model compartments and ordering figs 3 and 4 2 2 3 design concepts 2 2 3 1 basic principles eelgrass follows a general plant growth pattern grow and expand in both size and area area expansion is done by vegetative growth not included in the model and sexual reproduction as eelgrass grows over the season seeds are produced and released in demark this period is from april to october peak seed release in odense fjord is generally late july to early august eelgrass has 2 main ways of seed dispersal 1 seeds dropping from the bed class 1 s1 and moved with water currents short distance 2 seeds dropped by rafting flowering shoots class s2 long distance both ways of dispersal are included in the abm model where seed release and production is calculated based on eelgrass biomass and flowering shoots in combination with seasonality study conducted in dalby bay fig 5a the seeds released from bed class 1 s1 are affected by hydrodynamics and start to move with water currents over 6 8 cm s 1 fig 5d at current speeds above 18 cm s 1 seeds are resuspended to the water column fig 5d thus seeds are subjected to both a rolling motion on the bed where their movement is inhibited by obstacles thick eelgrass bed macroalgae and jumping motion caused by rapid resuspension and settling long distance dispersal is implemented through dislodgement of seed carrying shoots class 3 fs these shoots are buoyant and thus affected by wind drift erftemeijer et al 2008 källström et al 2008 while flowering shoots are rafting seeds mature and can be dropped class 2 s2 these principles were introduced to the abm model to determine seed movement and production seeds were considered stationary and incorporated to the sediment when no movement occurred for 7 days in areas with loss on ignition loi above 2 and 14 days in areas with where loi was below 2 to our knowledge there is no data available for seed sediment incorporation thus biofilm generation time of 7 days was considered as a best proxy lundkvist et al 2007 in the model plant patch class 4 is responsible for seed production seed class 1 s1 and rafting shoot class 3 fs release both released entities s1 and fs have their own distinct movement description entity fs is also able to release seeds s2 though this model does have a delay of 2 weeks for seed dropping from fs as it was considered that seeds in the rafting shoots were not ripe at the point of release seed movement along the bottom is hindered by obstacles as a set value from a current speed when the obstacle reaches certain biomass both shortcomings will be corrected in the new generation 2 2 3 2 emergence it is expected that when changing the hydrodynamic forcings and wind changes in seed bank and loss locations wash ashore loss to land will be seen changing parameters such as critical values for movement thresholds will greatly affect the distances seeds can travel to and their locations 2 2 3 3 observations observations represent the particle positions and state variables as well as the variables from the eulerian framework at a certain time step the results extracted in two formats 1 as tracks xml file that contain info from particle location x y z coordinate and state variables 2 2d accumulated maps euler state variables that show the accumulated results of abm model the maps give information about total seed numbers in the fjord number of seeds released number of rafting shoots released number of seeds lost both s1 and s2 etc within each grid cell maps need to be treated to be able to validate seed bank locations as no loss processes are included e g natural mortality track can be used to evaluate bed connectivity by following individual particles or calculate parameter constant sensitivity 2 2 4 initialization model starts at time 0 beginning of the year january the 1st initially there is 1 stationary plant patch entity in each grid cell where eelgrass beds are monitored in odense fjord fig 2b total of 84 particles state variables of the particles are initially set to 0 development of flowering shoots and seeds follows seasonal dynamics and is calculated based on eelgrass biomass seasonality and number of seeds per flowering shoot eelgrass vegetative shoot maps are used as forcings to calculate flowering shoot fs densities developing as a seasonal measured ratio recorded in dalby bay during the field campaign in 2015 von thenen 2016 2 2 5 input data modelling results from kuusemäe et al 2016 were used as flow field and input to the ecological model the flow field used was calculated based on water densities salinity three dimensional flows tidal dynamics and temperature are computed in the hydrodynamic model water movement is forced by water level fluctuations at the boundary discharge from land water densities and local wind patterns rasmussen et al 2000 the ecological input parameters forcings that were taken from kuusemäe et al 2016 were as follows 1 sediment loi 2 wave and current generated shear stress 3 sediment reworking by arenicola marina 4 ephemeral macroalgae carbon biomass and 5 perennial macroalgae carbon biomass the model represented in kuusemäe et al 2016 tests stressors effect on eelgrass biomass thus the control simulation results from steady state 3rd year were selected eelgrass specific biomasses g c m 2 were calculated based on eelgrass coverage maps measured by the national monitoring activities fig 1 the eelgrass coverage was converted to biomass using the relation 1 coverage equals 2 g c m 2 carstensen et al 2015 further adjustments were done by averaging the biomass values where several eelgrass coverages were recorded in the same model grid cell the maps of vegetative shoots numbers were calculated from the biomass maps conversion factor for average vegetative shoot biomass was 0 2 g c shoot 1 kuusemäe et al 2016 2 2 6 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of 3 parameters where tested k move tau resusp and tau move k move determines how long seeds need to be immobile before they are considered to be incorporated into the sediment tau move indicates the shear stress needed for seed movement along the bottom and tau resusp marks the shear stress for resuspension in the model seeds were released in several locations around the fjord in order to test the effect of the three parameters on the simulated seed mobility distance travelled final location of the seeds and number of seeds lost 2 2 7 simulation setup particles were released from 84 grid cells that represented existing monitored beds these stationery eelgrass patches acted as donors for seed release eelgrass seed release s1 was controlled by the measured seasonal dynamics with a peak in july while the release rate of flowering shoots fs was set to 5 per day over the flowering season the wind drift effect on detached flowering shoot distribution was investigated using wind data from the period 2002 2011 year 2002 was selected due to dominant eastern winds in august 2005 was picked for its dominant south westerly winds 2007 was the calmest year with low winds from various directions 2009 was used as the control 2010 had dominant winds from south west while 2011 had winds from all directions eelgrass seeds were released from the same locations as the flowering shoots fig 5 the seed dispersal was tested on decoupled hydrodynamic files with an improved bathymetry all simulations were run with the same hydrodynamic files while wind forcing varied seed losses were calculated based on simulations from the 2009 setup 2 2 8 data treatment the results were treated to find possible locations of seed banks where seedlings could establish four scenarios were made table 1 named after the main limiting factor for seedling growth thus the simulations are layered where the read marks indicate a progressive adding of limiting factors as the simulations get more complex suitable areas are reduced with the added layers depth distribution was selected based on known eelgrass beds and secchi depth limits simultaneously depth also indicates hydrodynamic and light stress sediment organic content in the fjord was used to limit the eelgrass anchoring capacity valdemarsen et al 2014 sediment reworking by a marina maps was taken into account for its stress on eelgrass seeds and seedlings flindt et al 2016 valdemarsen et al 2011 sediment mobility map was constructed based on known areas with strong sand movement these areas used to be vegetated with eelgrass beds but now loose sand is moved by strong hydrodynamic forces maps were made to visualize the effects of the known stressors on seed banks formation and the successfulness of seedling recruitment seed density was corrected with area factors due to model over estimation of biomass within each grid fig 5 alongside with the maps of stressors on seed banks the effect of wind was studied on reproductive shoot dispersal and accumulated seed densities in the fjord 3 results parameterization of the model demanded a full field campaign to obtain seasonality data of essential patterns in the sexual reproduction cycle the model was able to simulate seed dispersal with multiple agents simultaneously for testing the model validation and calibration a field campaign and laboratorial flume experiments were performed 3 1 data collection field campaigns and flume experiments a dynamic change of reproductive shoot densities was seen over the growth season with an initial low density of flowering shoots in may increasing in june with high densities until mid august fig 5a over the growth season 3 separate peaks of flowering shoots of 95 9 6 120 6 2 and 131 16 no m 2 mean sd occurred in june july and august respectively the number of seeds within flowering shoots varied over the entire season fig 5b the seeds on the reproductive shoots appeared in early june and peaked from late june until late august without any distinct peak the seeds started to drop from the reproductive shoots in july and the highest number of released seeds was found in the sediment surface in july and august 110 48 no m 2 mean sd almost no seeds remained in the eelgrass patches until september fig 5b c concerning the mobility of seeds two thresholds were found from the field campaigns fig 5d 1 a threshold for seed movement as bedload at 6 8 cm s 1 and 2 a threshold for seed resuspension at 18 cm s 1 3 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses were done for several parameters affecting seed movement in the water column and along the seabed focus was on the constants with the biggest uncertainty affecting seed movement and where no literature values are available first the resuspension threshold for seeds was tested by selecting four values between 0 01 0 3 n m 2 and 0 02 1 7 n m 2 for bedload seed transport the seed movement declined with increasing thresholds for both resuspension and movement along the bottom the variability of distances travelled is high over all resuspension thresholds fig 6 a variability was evaluated by selecting 5 locations with varying hydrodynamic conditions as an average the travelled distances decline with increasing thresholds for resuspension up to 0 20 n m 2 overall increased threshold for bedload movement of seeds reduces the mobility of the seeds shown as transport distances fig 6b the variation of seed movement was higher in the lowest tested threshold for bedload movement while variation among tested sites is negligible with thresholds ranging from 0 07 1 7 n m 2 at high bedload thresholds 1 2 and 1 7 n m 2 seed movement is minimal 140 m and 75 m respectively increasing the number of days for seed incorporation led to an increase in the average distance travelled by the seeds fig 6c a steep increase of travelled distance is the consequence of increasing the threshold of incorporation time from 1 to 14 days yet after 14 days the increase lessens number of incorporation days affected both seed loss out of model area as well as range of covered distances by the seeds release locations and the differences in hydrodynamic forces among these areas increase the variability in travelled distances 3 3 seed dispersal the developed abm model was used to study seed dispersal in odense fjord simulations showed that drifting flowering shoots could travel distances up to 35 6 km in the odense fjord system table 5 the time and distance travelled depends immensely on wind direction and strength generally flowering shoots are washed out of the system within 3 days though the majority of seed carrying shoots was washed on shore within the first few hours table 5 all the dislodged released flowering shoots were transported out of the system or washed to land the simulations with different wind speeds and directions revealed that all the released flowering shoots carrying seeds were beached without dropping any seeds along the way the majority of seed carrying shoots were washed up on the coastlines near the beds but higher numbers were seen in northeast side of the bed no visible wind effect on loss locations was observed over the year while testing 6 different years with varying wind conditions during growth season this was attributed to short drift time meaning the majority of drifting shoots washed ashore near bed and dominant wind direction being from west or south west over the whole growth season loss of seeds dropped from attached flowering shoots were quantified using results from the 2009 simulation constants used in the simulation based on flume experiments and sensitivity analysis to control seed movement are shown in table 4 in order to evaluate viable seed banks for seedling recruitment losses were divided into 1 loss to land 2 areas with poor light conditions 3 areas with low anchoring capacity 4 areas dominated by sediment reworked by lugworms 5 areas with high sediment mobility table 3 a small portion of seeds were lost to land 2 9 table 6 the main areas of seed losses were found adjacent to the donor beds on the northeast side data not shown these were considered directly lost while 92 29 of the seeds released were found in the fjord depth was used as a proxy for light availability only 20 6 of the seeds moved to areas with a favourable light climate for seedling establishment fig 8a while 40 1 of the seeds were found in areas with an impoverished light environment table 6 the second parameter evaluated was anchoring capacity for seedling development from seeds loi was used as a proxy where sediment was considered appropriate when loi was below 2 flindt et al 2016 areas with a viable seed banks decreased marginally when the anchoring capacity and light regime are coupled fig 8a b non suitable areas with seeds increased from 31 6 to 51 1 when depth and anchoring capacity were compared table 6 additional areas were lost for potential seedling recruitment when lugworm burial of seeds was considered these main changes were observed near the seed banks on the eastern shore fig 8c taking into account the main threats for seed loss to seedling recruitment 6 3 of the released seeds are found in areas with good potential areas with heavy sediment movement are located along the shallow part of the eastern shoreline thus areas suitable for successful seedling recruitment are highly impacted in this area fig 8d therefore the area with good recruitment potential for seedbank development declines to 5 due to sediment mobility equivalent to only 2 km2 table 6 however seed densities vary greatly within the potentially good area ranging from 1 to above 1000 no m 2 with a mean 299 no m 2 fig 9 4 discussion seed production and dispersal is essential for the natural recovery of seagrass meadows that have been exposed to severe eutrophication odense fjord housed very extended and productive eelgrass meadows until 1983 covering 25 of the system fyns amt 2006 petersen et al 2009 since then a dramatic decrease occurred petersen et al 2009 and nowadays the eelgrass coverage is below 2 although water action plans have led to improved water quality by reducing the external nutrient loading fyns amt 2006 natural recovery of eelgrass remains absent natural recovery of large areas must be based on seed production followed by seed dispersal to sites that support germination seedling establishment and development of patches by vegetative growth in a previous work no seeds were found inside or near the meadows in odense fjord t lange 2012 unpublished another preliminary study verified that the produced seeds in the system were not stored within or close to the reproductive patches since the production period july until germination april instead almost all seeds were washed away during the late summer and autumn therefore it has been questioned if seed the production from such a small population could support a natural recovery previous studies have looked at eelgrass dispersal by drifting flowering shoots which were implemented in the model källström et al 2008 and erftemeijer et al 2008 calculated rafting shoots travelling up to 150 and 130 km respectively in the current model the maximum realized distance was 3 4 times lower with a maximal distance of 38 9 km and drifting times of 100 h the average journey of the drifting flowering shoots was much shorter 1 0 3 7 km and 1 7 6 0 h table 5 this can be explained by the small area of odense fjord in combination with general high wind speeds from the western corner and low tidal amplitude in odense fjord eelgrass patches are located fairly close to the coast on shallow depths and many are situated on wind exposed coastlines making dislodged flowering shoots vulnerable washing upon shore fig 1 the low tidal amplitude together with strong wind patterns makes the wind energy more dominant on the drifting flowers than the tide generated current velocity altogether it documents that eelgrass seed dispersal and connectivity by rafting is reduced in small shallow wind enforced estuaries even though the drifting time and distance was short table 5 the simulations show that the beds around odense fjord are still connected fig 7 the developed model is successfully able to simulate eelgrass seed release reproductive shoot drift and individual seed movement seed dispersal simulations from individual beds von thenen 2016 show that eelgrass beds are well connected by both dispersal methods simulation results of rafting shoots released within odense fjord show that all eelgrass meadows in odense fjord and dalby are connected although no rafting shoots from dalby reached patches in odense fjord fig 7 von thenen 2016 patch connectivity by individual seed movement was reduced as the deeper areas worked as settling areas individual seeds are predicted to move on average 1018 m fig 6b thus having the capability to move long enough distances to allow patch connectivity this is observed between otterup enebærodde and mid eastern eelgrass beds figs 2b and 8 boese and robbins 2008 found higher seed densities within perennial beds while seed densities dropped rapidly with distance from permanent bed likewise the model predicts the highest seed densities in areas with well established beds with seed densities decreasing with increasing distance from the meadow figs 2b and 9 sensitivity analysis revealed substantial effect of constants affecting movement individual seed movement for eelgrass is described by few studies fig 5 koch et al 2010 distances travelled by seeds are highly affected by the parameterization the more days needed for seeds to be incorporated to the sediment the longer distances they are potentially able to travel fig 6c for the muddy sediment lundkvist et al 2007 found that the maximal sediment stability was obtained after 7 days this study assumed that the seeds would be incorporated into the diatom produced polysaccharide matrix though a positive effect of current speeds on release of flowering shoots has been shown for zostera noltii berkovic et al 2014 no quantitative information of reproductive shoot fragment release was found for eelgrass based on field observations it was postulated that seeds are transported to deeper areas or washed on shore which the model was able to simulate the analysis of seeds final destination showed a large fraction of produced seeds ended up in suboptimal areas although all seeds are produced at areas well supported with light only about 20 6 of the seeds ended up in areas able to support seedlings with sufficient light intensities 0 5 2 m covering an area of 5 4 of the system 117 7 km2 in the studied estuary eelgrass cannot grow in depths shallower than 0 5 m due to high hydrodynamic impact and low tides about 31 6 of the seeds are lost to areas where seedlings will never be able to establish through many years of eutrophication the estuary has accumulated high amounts of organic matter in the sediment which has turned former fine sediment beds into muddy areas that have lost the capacity to anchor eelgrass seedlings valdemarsen et al 2014 about 51 1 of the seeds final destination is in these muddy areas therefore only 7 1 of the seeds produced settle on sediments supporting proper anchoring germination and development of new eelgrass patches regarding sediment characteristics and thus a proper anchoring capacity for eelgrass seedlings only 3 1 of total area 117 7 km2 is available for the eelgrass successful establishment many of the shallow sandy areas have been colonized by lugworms after the reduction of eelgrass coverage through the high reworking activity of lugworms seedling establishment is severely hampered by burial of seeds below the germination threshold depth and by burial and uprooting of young seedling in faecal mounts valdemarsen et al 2011 including the impact from lugworms the current model predicts that only 6 3 of the produced seeds end up in potential successful seedling establishment areas corresponding to an area of 3 1 km2 table 6 considering areas where sediment mobility prevents seedling establishment the proportion of seed production located in good areas is reduced to 5 0 corresponding to an area of 2 0 table 6 the predictions need to be treated with care in regard to light availability anchoring capacity and lugworm stress in the dalby bay area fig 8a although the area is well studied regarding eelgrass coverage no major monitoring activities have been conducted on loi or lugworm densities in addition the depth map used in this study underestimates the extent of shallow areas in dalby bay therefore the good potential areas in dalby may be under or overestimated fig 8 in addition in the current setup all seeds within rafting shoots are lost due to quick wash ashore time seed release from rafting shoots was delayed by 2 weeks as a laboratory studies showed a delay in seed maturation and dropping flindt et al unpublished data even though the model fails to simulate mature flower release it is acknowledged that the seed release should be random and will be included in the next generation of the model in addition the true connectivity of beds through rafting shoots can be underestimated because of constant release of flowering shoots wash ashore locations and quantities are expected to change dependent on varying meteorological release conditions wash ashore locations were not found to be heavily influenced by varying wind conditions as accumulated numbers though implications of variance were seen while looking at eelgrass beds separately denmark has predominant westerly winds which can explain the lack of variance between years nevertheless release of flowering shoots and fragments is expected to be stochastic inside the season meaning release is not constant and will vary among years and conditions seed banks in eelgrass meadows are necessary for eelgrass to survive unfavourable conditions it has been shown zostera marina persistence depends on seedling recruitment and seed bank e g seed bank played major role in recolonizing a lost eelgrass meadow due to anoxic event greve et al 2005 furthermore seeds are important for closing caps within meadows it is agreed that the best results are achieved with largescale restoration and high planting densities van katwijk et al 2016 since this is expensive selecting sites where a natural seed bank is present could supplement the needed densities choosing a restoration site with a viable seed bank with high seed densities in areas where seedling recruitment is plausible increases recovery success through natural seedling recruitment orth et al 2006b also highlights the importance of seeds increasing genetic diversity and using adult plants in combination with seeds as this could potentially be the most cost effective way for restoring lost beds the developed abm model could also help in predicting where and when to release seeds for successful restoration with seeds in odense fjord restoration attempts with seeds have so far failed which is attributed to hydrodynamics lange et al 2017 in prep the analysis of developed model has revealed areas of further improvement the current abm model developed overestimates seed densities especially in the enebærodde area and possibly in other areas with high eelgrass bed biomass fig 9 assumption of overestimation is supported by previous field campaigns to odense fjord lange unpublished data and seedling densities observed in the area are considerably lower valdemarsen et al 2010 overestimation may occur due to overestimation of eelgrass bed area field studies in the area have shown high seed loss from the bed flindt unpublished data hence it is believed that the model overestimates seed entrapment by eelgrass and macroalgae however there is a lack of works conducted on this topic the entrapment of seeds can also be lessened by wave action that increases resuspension frequency thus a better understanding and description of seed entrapment by meadows is needed in conclusion the developed model performs as expected seeds are dispersed as bedload with current speeds and dispersal distance is reduced by obstacles such as eelgrass beds and macroalgae mats however high seed densities are predicted in eelgrass beds the model is successfully used to analyse wind effects on drifting flowering shoots seed bedload transport seed loss and potential seedling recruitment areas it is acknowledged that validation of the model only is performed with observations and data due to the knowledge gaps in seed dispersal dynamics the best estimate has been made with the current information this study has revealed areas of further research for understanding the complex mechanisms involved in seed dispersal processes seed movement inhibition by

25327,odense fjord denmark has suffered from a drastic decline in eelgrass zostera marina coverage during the last decades in 1983 eelgrass still covered about 25 of the estuary which in 2005 was reduced to less than 2 the alarming decline in the past decades initiated preliminary restoration activities where it was questioned whether the present low eelgrass biomass is able to produce a sustainable seed bank to support natural recovery field studies verified that the seed bank was hampered laboratory experiments were conducted to determine 1 seed dispersion along the sediment surface and in the water column 2 settling rates of seeds and flowering shoots 3 critical current speed for seed movement 4 floating dynamic of flowering shoots and 5 seed dropping dynamics during transport of rafting shoots these parameters supported the development of an agent based model abm predicting seed movements in estuaries the model handled two ways of seed dispersal 1 seeds dropped in eelgrass beds and transport by hydrodynamic forces along the seabed 2 seeds released by rafting shoots this setup allowed assessment of both eelgrass seed loss and potential connectivity between beds seed losses were divided into direct losses such as seeds lost on land due to desiccation or external boundary and indirect losses affecting seedling establishment the model estimates that app 92 of the seeds would be retained in the odense fjord while only 5 0 of the seeds ended up in areas supporting seedling establishment eelgrass seeds were also found in areas with insufficient light high hydrodynamic pressure excessive sediment reworking by lugworms or poor anchoring capacity in addition the model showed potential bed connectivity via rafting shoots but also with individual seed movement along the bottom when beds were not separated by deep areas such as boating channels keywords abm modelling seagrass seed bank dynamics restoration recovery seed loss seedling establishment 1 introduction eelgrass zostera marina is the most widespread seagrass species in the northern hemisphere moore and short 2006 eelgrass beds provide a set of essential ecosystem functions and services such as increase of biodiversity boström and bonsdorff 2000 duarte and chiscano 1999 hemminga and duarte 2000 moore and short 2006 nutrient cycling and therefore contribute to improve the water quality by immobilising nutrients coming from land in the coastal zones flindt 1994 flindt et al 1999 hemminga and duarte 2000 moore and short 2006 ward et al 1984 climate regulation through carbon sequestration and burial duffy 2006 fourqurean et al 2012 erosion control seabed stabilisation and coastal protection hansen and reidenbach 2012 and shelter for juvenile species hemminga and duarte 2000 orth et al 2006a terrados duarte 2000 in 1900 a total area of approximately 6726 km2 was covered by eelgrass in danish coastal waters boström et al 2003 seagrass coverage has significantly decreased worldwide with global decline rates of 110 km2 y 1 since 1980s waycott et al 2009 decline of eelgrass coverage was in the 1930s caused by the wasting disease short et al 1987 and later by eutrophication lillebø et al 2011 waycott et al 2009 leading to high blooms of phytoplankton and opportunistic macroalgae creating turbid waters canal vergés et al 2014 canal vergés et al 2010 flindt et al 2007 flindt et al 1997 salomonsen et al 1997 in 1990s the eelgrass beds in odense fjord covered only 20 25 of the original eelgrass bed area in the 1900s boström et al 2003 due to the lack of eelgrass recovery todays estuarine ecosystems are less stable nutrients earlier immobilized by eelgrass uptake are today supporting macroalgae growth that are hindering the natural recovery of eelgrass where eelgrass seedlings are strongly impacted macroalgae movements due to generated ballistic impact flindt et al 2016 kuusemäe et al 2016 valdemarsen et al 2010 nevertheless successful large scale recolonization strongly depends on the existence of a seed bank as it is not feasible to recover large areas with clonal expansion boese et al 2009 olesen and sand jensen 1994 restoration of eelgrass beds occurs by seed dispersal orth et al 2006c or transplantation of vegetative shoots van katwijk et al 2016 vegetative growth is a slow process and not feasible for recolonization of extended areas of lost beds olesen 1999 thus existence of a seed bank is crucial orth et al 2006b for seed germination and formation of new beds the challenge is that eelgrass seed banks are transient harwell and orth 2002 with a fast turnover in contradiction to most terrestrial species eelgrass seeds stay viable for only 11 months in laboratory conditions harrison 1991 moore et al 1993 field campaigns in odense fjord have not been able to locate seed banks near or within existing beds flindt et al unpublished data rather it is hypothesised that the seeds are dispersed to deeper areas or washed on land in addition the lack of seeds needed for natural recovery can be attributed the decline of pristine eelgrass beds which act as donor and main seed production sites connectivity between sparsely located eelgrass beds may have been lost hindering natural recovery gene exchange and resilience to seascape changes kendrick et al 2016 a high genetic diversity have also been shown to increase restoration success reynolds et al 2013 eelgrass seeds are dispersed by several documented methods firstly seeds are negatively buoyant with settling rates of 1 4 8 6 cm s 1 delefosse et al 2016 infantes et al 2016 as a result several authors concluded that dispersal distances were short berkovic et al 2014 orth et al 2006b orth et al 1994 jahnke et al 2016 modelled dispersal capacity for z marina with distances from cm to m in reality this might not be the case as recent studies have shown that eelgrass seeds can be dispersed along the bottom by rolling around flindt et al unpublished data koch et al 2010 they are even capable of overcoming small seabed structures such as sand ripples flindt et al unpublished data secondly long distance seed dispersal has been shown by detached flowering shoots and fragments by rafting or as bedload transport erftemeijer et al 2008 flindt et al 1997 hosokawa et al 2015 källström et al 2008 flowering shoots are buoyant and float from 2 weeks to several months depending on the condition of the flowering shoot at the time of detachment harwell orth 2002 källström et al 2008 taking into account the various methods of seed transport erftemeijer et al 2008 hosokawa et al 2015 koch et al 2010 källström et al 2008 orth et al 2006b they all contribute to seed losses from the production sites seeds can be transported 1 to land where they dry out and the germination capacity is lost pan et al 2012 2 to deeper areas in the fjord estuary where seedling growth is impossible due to insufficient light intensities 3 to areas with high densities of lugworms that rework the sediment burry the seeds and uproot the seedlings valdemarsen et al 2011 4 to areas with a high organic content that reduces the sediment anchoring capacity of seedlings 5 to areas with high sediment mobility valdemarsen et al 2010 in many danish estuaries eelgrass seedlings are yearly supporting attempts to recover lost areas however in majority of the locations the low densities of emerging seedlings are lost within a few months valdemarsen et al 2010 combining the results with field surveys documenting very high seed losses from donor sites and seed broadcasting experiments lange 2010 unpublished suggests that loss rates of produced seeds may be an important explanation for the low success rates for natural recovery in danish estuaries therefore the aim of this work was to develop a dynamic model to assess eelgrass seed production dispersion and distribution as well as eelgrass bed connectivity using agent based modelling abm techniques keeping mass conservation of seeds in the model it may provide explanation for the lacking natural recovery in danish estuaries as well as predictions of optimal sites for eelgrass conservation actions for the model calibration and validation a field campaign and flume experiments were performed to quantify the flowering shoot densities seed densities seed losses and seed mobility understanding seed production and losses may support the identification of threshold quantities for seeds needed for natural recovery furthermore modelling a complex ecological function as seed dispersal will aid in revealing knowledge gaps understanding seed dispersal and seed banks in odense fjord will also support future restoration efforts orth et al 2006b currently several transplanting methods are being tested to increase the large scale transplantation success the existence of a viable seed bank may play a part in site selection for eelgrass conservation or restoration in order to increase its success the model will also be able to predict restoration sites where seeds would stay in their biosphere and hereby support the natural recovery process 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site odense fjord is a shallow estuary divided into inner and outer part with a mean depth of 0 9 m and 2 7 m respectively fyns amt 2006 it is located on the northern part of funen denmark fig 1 the fjord has a total area of 62 km2 and is connected to the open sea through a narrow opening the tidal amplitude fluctuates between 0 3 0 5 m riisgård et al 2008 valdemarsen et al 2010 the fjord is influenced by freshwater input from odense river at the southern part of the fjord together with several smaller rivers and streams along the coastline the mixing zone of salt and freshwater generates salinity gradient throughout the fjord hence the salinity ranges from 5 to 17 in the inner part and 15 25 at the outer part of the fjord valdemarsen et al 2010 odense fjord with a catchment area of 1046 km2 is heavily influenced by nutrient inputs prior to 1990 the annual external loading exceeded 2500 t total n y 1 and 300 t total p y 1 due to national environmental regulations the nutrient loading has decreased to current levels of about 1700 t n y 1 and 64 t p y 1 windolf et al 2013 as a result of long term nutrient inputs wave protected and deeper areas in the fjord have acted as sinks for suspended organic matter and associated nutrients contributing to the internal nutrient loading valdemarsen et al 2014 eelgrass meadows cover about 2 of the fjord extending out to a maximal depth of 2 6 m naturstyrelsen 2011 2 1 1 field campaign field campaigns to dalby bay fig 5 were established to quantify the flowering shoot densities seed densities and seed loss rates weekly measurements of flowering shoot densities were performed using a metal frame 0 5 0 5 m that was thrown randomly and the flowering shoots within the frame were counted n 5 flowering shoots were also collected and taken to the laboratory to estimate the seasonality of seed numbers in reproductive shoots experimental areas were designated specifically for both reproductive shoot counts and for collection of reproductive shoots to avoid interference between the measurements seed release from reproductive shoots was collected by randomly placing a circular frame area 0 05 m2 on top of the bed and the top 3 4 cm sediment seed mixture n 5 was harvested and sieved through a mesh ø 1 mm retaining seeds shells and debris the samples were brought back to the laboratory where the area specific seed density was calculated 2 1 2 flume experiments to measure the seed mobility thresholds a set of annular flume experiments were performed in the laboratory using the setup developed by lundkvist et al 2007 and canal vergés et al 2010 sandy sediment with a loss on ignition loi of 0 5 an average grain size of 162 μm was collected in odense fjord enebærodde sediment beds of app 9 cm depth app 5 l of sediment were formed in each flume and filled with about 17 l of estuarine water the flumes were left to acclimatise to ambient conditions for 7 days then pre collected mature seeds n 30 were placed at the sediment surface inside a defined section of the flume during the experiments seeds were subjected to increasing current velocities in incremental steps of 2 cm s 1 with duration of 10 min the seed mobility was followed by recording the time and respective current velocity according to each seed movement seed resuspension thresholds were also registered 2 2 model description following abm model was designed to bring better understanding of eelgrass seed dispersal to quantify seed losses follow seed movements in various climate conditions inspect eelgrass bed connectivity this tool is meant to help describe seed banks and their changes over years the 3d model setup consists of a hydrodynamic model a wave model and an ecological model the used mike software is developed by dhi www mikepoweredbydhi com mike 3fm was used for the hydrodynamic model mike sw for the wave model and the mike eco lab module was used for ecological modelling kuusemäe et al 2016 the ecological model includes two frameworks euler and lagrange the following section describes the model loosely following odd protocol by grimm et al 2010 a detailed description of the model is given in the appendix 2 2 1 entities state variables and scales agents individuals state variables model consists of 4 types of entities or agents describing different life stages and dispersal modes of eelgrass and its seeds fig 3 gives an overview about the relations between the different entities agents the entities are descripted in more detail later appendix in supplementary material in a simulation a varying number of particles representing an agent entity from a certain type can co occur each of these particles agents has its own set of variables states but behaves according to the definition of its group some types can spawn new particles of another class i e a patch plant can generate seeds or dislodged reproductive shoots class 1 s1 eelgrass seeds dropped from attached flowering shoots this class represents mobile seeds that are dropped from eelgrass meadows entities particles of this class are created by the plant patch class their movement is defined by the hydrodynamic flow conditions the surrounding biomass i e algae eelgrass in the current grid element and their settling speed once settled critical shear stress must be reached to cause resuspension and initiate movement a particle of this class keeps track of the distance and time of being immobile when particle has been incorporated to the sediment or lost to land outer boundary the number of seeds it was carrying are transferred to euler framework and particle is removed class 2 s2 eelgrass seeds dropped from rafting flowering shoots this class represents mobile eelgrass seeds that are dropped while rafting from reproductive shoots their behaviour is identical to class 1 s1 entities particles of this class are created by the class 3 fs the differentiations between s1 and s2 are purely made for seed bank analysis to be able determine the method dominating in specific areas class 3 fs flowering shoots dislodged from the bed this class represents dislodged reproductive shoots entities particles of this class are created by the plant patch class these entities are positively buoyant and float to the surface where their movement is defined by the hydrodynamic flow conditions and wind drift during the particles rafting it is capable of releasing seeds when they have matured this particle can drift maximum of 2 months flindt et al unpublished data each entity particle carries information about the number of flowering shoots and seed it represent time it is motionless and distance travelled if the particle entity reaches land or outer boundary it is removed from simulation and its seed and reproductive shoot numbers are transferred updated to euler frame work class 4 plant patch eelgrass plants in the meadow this immobile class represents eelgrass patches and meadows this class is responsible for flowering seed production and release creating particles of class 1 s1 and 3 fs flowering and seed production are driven by monitored eelgrass biomasses and densities observed flowering seasonality field studies conducted in 2015 at dalby bay seed release through seeds dropped from meadows creation of class 1 s1 is based on measured seed densities in the meadow during growth season while seed release through dislodgement of flowering shoots is kept 5 per day spatial units space is described by a grid of triangular and quadrangular elements describing the horizontal domain for the hydrodynamic simulation the model is comprised of 2388 finite elements with flexible grid sizes ranging from 243 to 321658 m2 fig 2 a the total model area covers 117 7 km2 each element can be addressed by its sequential number or coordinate the bathymetric or vertical description is spatially represented by several layers in each grid starting at the see surface it is made of 3 variable sized terrain following sigma layers up to 3 m depth followed by fixed 1 m layers to the bottom kuusemäe et al 2016 the domain has one open boundary red in fig 2 in the northern end and some other open boundaries representing rivers smaller water bodies contributing to the hydrodynamic conditions land boundaries green in fig 2 restrict the flow and movement of particles a position of an entity particle is described by a continuous x y z coordinate inside the model domain some all entities except class 4 plant patch may move freely in the model area if entities cross the open boundary or reach land i e at the next time step entity should be on the land they are lost and removed from the simulation any input parameter such as flow information biomass etc is based on a grid elements value i e each grid cell holds a set of values describing the environmental parameters in this cell in order to prevent discontinuities especially in the flow values represented to an entity can be the result of a spatial interpolation of the surrounding elements data from external sources e g wind biomass etc are mapped onto the according grid elements to speed up computation a parallelisation scheme may be applied where the total domain is split up into several smaller sub domains at the start of the simulation during the simulation these sub domains are computed independent of each other however taking the movement of particles from one sub domain to another one into account temporal scales the simulation time progresses in discrete steps of 1800 s the simulation period is from 1st of january 2009 to 1st of january 2010 environment information of a grid element is handled by eulerian framework apart from variables keeping track of the number of entities in a specific element for result extraction the model includes 17 parameters that set the environment for the entities controlling seed production and dispersal table 2 some of these input parameters are the results of previous hydrodynamic simulations of the same domain setup others represent user provided information 2 2 2 process overview and scheduling the process scheduling is done according to the following scheme in each time step the eulerian framework is updated first i e updated input parameters are processed in the order of the grid cells and for all grid elements then the lagrange framework is processed updating all particles of all classes in the domain here all particles of class 1 s1 are processed before particles of class 2 s2 and so on inside each class the particles are processed in the order of their current grid element position inside a single particle all variables are updated in the order of their definition finally resulting in a movement vector that is null for not moving particles this movement vector is used in the next time step to move the particle to its new position and possibly to a new grid element before computing the next change in the state variables if particles leave the domain through an open boundary or have their next location on land the particle is removed from the setup after all particles have been processed some eulerian variables e g final number of particles in an element get updated finally all results for the current time step are written two conceptual diagrams are added to aid visual understanding of the model in terms of model compartments and ordering figs 3 and 4 2 2 3 design concepts 2 2 3 1 basic principles eelgrass follows a general plant growth pattern grow and expand in both size and area area expansion is done by vegetative growth not included in the model and sexual reproduction as eelgrass grows over the season seeds are produced and released in demark this period is from april to october peak seed release in odense fjord is generally late july to early august eelgrass has 2 main ways of seed dispersal 1 seeds dropping from the bed class 1 s1 and moved with water currents short distance 2 seeds dropped by rafting flowering shoots class s2 long distance both ways of dispersal are included in the abm model where seed release and production is calculated based on eelgrass biomass and flowering shoots in combination with seasonality study conducted in dalby bay fig 5a the seeds released from bed class 1 s1 are affected by hydrodynamics and start to move with water currents over 6 8 cm s 1 fig 5d at current speeds above 18 cm s 1 seeds are resuspended to the water column fig 5d thus seeds are subjected to both a rolling motion on the bed where their movement is inhibited by obstacles thick eelgrass bed macroalgae and jumping motion caused by rapid resuspension and settling long distance dispersal is implemented through dislodgement of seed carrying shoots class 3 fs these shoots are buoyant and thus affected by wind drift erftemeijer et al 2008 källström et al 2008 while flowering shoots are rafting seeds mature and can be dropped class 2 s2 these principles were introduced to the abm model to determine seed movement and production seeds were considered stationary and incorporated to the sediment when no movement occurred for 7 days in areas with loss on ignition loi above 2 and 14 days in areas with where loi was below 2 to our knowledge there is no data available for seed sediment incorporation thus biofilm generation time of 7 days was considered as a best proxy lundkvist et al 2007 in the model plant patch class 4 is responsible for seed production seed class 1 s1 and rafting shoot class 3 fs release both released entities s1 and fs have their own distinct movement description entity fs is also able to release seeds s2 though this model does have a delay of 2 weeks for seed dropping from fs as it was considered that seeds in the rafting shoots were not ripe at the point of release seed movement along the bottom is hindered by obstacles as a set value from a current speed when the obstacle reaches certain biomass both shortcomings will be corrected in the new generation 2 2 3 2 emergence it is expected that when changing the hydrodynamic forcings and wind changes in seed bank and loss locations wash ashore loss to land will be seen changing parameters such as critical values for movement thresholds will greatly affect the distances seeds can travel to and their locations 2 2 3 3 observations observations represent the particle positions and state variables as well as the variables from the eulerian framework at a certain time step the results extracted in two formats 1 as tracks xml file that contain info from particle location x y z coordinate and state variables 2 2d accumulated maps euler state variables that show the accumulated results of abm model the maps give information about total seed numbers in the fjord number of seeds released number of rafting shoots released number of seeds lost both s1 and s2 etc within each grid cell maps need to be treated to be able to validate seed bank locations as no loss processes are included e g natural mortality track can be used to evaluate bed connectivity by following individual particles or calculate parameter constant sensitivity 2 2 4 initialization model starts at time 0 beginning of the year january the 1st initially there is 1 stationary plant patch entity in each grid cell where eelgrass beds are monitored in odense fjord fig 2b total of 84 particles state variables of the particles are initially set to 0 development of flowering shoots and seeds follows seasonal dynamics and is calculated based on eelgrass biomass seasonality and number of seeds per flowering shoot eelgrass vegetative shoot maps are used as forcings to calculate flowering shoot fs densities developing as a seasonal measured ratio recorded in dalby bay during the field campaign in 2015 von thenen 2016 2 2 5 input data modelling results from kuusemäe et al 2016 were used as flow field and input to the ecological model the flow field used was calculated based on water densities salinity three dimensional flows tidal dynamics and temperature are computed in the hydrodynamic model water movement is forced by water level fluctuations at the boundary discharge from land water densities and local wind patterns rasmussen et al 2000 the ecological input parameters forcings that were taken from kuusemäe et al 2016 were as follows 1 sediment loi 2 wave and current generated shear stress 3 sediment reworking by arenicola marina 4 ephemeral macroalgae carbon biomass and 5 perennial macroalgae carbon biomass the model represented in kuusemäe et al 2016 tests stressors effect on eelgrass biomass thus the control simulation results from steady state 3rd year were selected eelgrass specific biomasses g c m 2 were calculated based on eelgrass coverage maps measured by the national monitoring activities fig 1 the eelgrass coverage was converted to biomass using the relation 1 coverage equals 2 g c m 2 carstensen et al 2015 further adjustments were done by averaging the biomass values where several eelgrass coverages were recorded in the same model grid cell the maps of vegetative shoots numbers were calculated from the biomass maps conversion factor for average vegetative shoot biomass was 0 2 g c shoot 1 kuusemäe et al 2016 2 2 6 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of 3 parameters where tested k move tau resusp and tau move k move determines how long seeds need to be immobile before they are considered to be incorporated into the sediment tau move indicates the shear stress needed for seed movement along the bottom and tau resusp marks the shear stress for resuspension in the model seeds were released in several locations around the fjord in order to test the effect of the three parameters on the simulated seed mobility distance travelled final location of the seeds and number of seeds lost 2 2 7 simulation setup particles were released from 84 grid cells that represented existing monitored beds these stationery eelgrass patches acted as donors for seed release eelgrass seed release s1 was controlled by the measured seasonal dynamics with a peak in july while the release rate of flowering shoots fs was set to 5 per day over the flowering season the wind drift effect on detached flowering shoot distribution was investigated using wind data from the period 2002 2011 year 2002 was selected due to dominant eastern winds in august 2005 was picked for its dominant south westerly winds 2007 was the calmest year with low winds from various directions 2009 was used as the control 2010 had dominant winds from south west while 2011 had winds from all directions eelgrass seeds were released from the same locations as the flowering shoots fig 5 the seed dispersal was tested on decoupled hydrodynamic files with an improved bathymetry all simulations were run with the same hydrodynamic files while wind forcing varied seed losses were calculated based on simulations from the 2009 setup 2 2 8 data treatment the results were treated to find possible locations of seed banks where seedlings could establish four scenarios were made table 1 named after the main limiting factor for seedling growth thus the simulations are layered where the read marks indicate a progressive adding of limiting factors as the simulations get more complex suitable areas are reduced with the added layers depth distribution was selected based on known eelgrass beds and secchi depth limits simultaneously depth also indicates hydrodynamic and light stress sediment organic content in the fjord was used to limit the eelgrass anchoring capacity valdemarsen et al 2014 sediment reworking by a marina maps was taken into account for its stress on eelgrass seeds and seedlings flindt et al 2016 valdemarsen et al 2011 sediment mobility map was constructed based on known areas with strong sand movement these areas used to be vegetated with eelgrass beds but now loose sand is moved by strong hydrodynamic forces maps were made to visualize the effects of the known stressors on seed banks formation and the successfulness of seedling recruitment seed density was corrected with area factors due to model over estimation of biomass within each grid fig 5 alongside with the maps of stressors on seed banks the effect of wind was studied on reproductive shoot dispersal and accumulated seed densities in the fjord 3 results parameterization of the model demanded a full field campaign to obtain seasonality data of essential patterns in the sexual reproduction cycle the model was able to simulate seed dispersal with multiple agents simultaneously for testing the model validation and calibration a field campaign and laboratorial flume experiments were performed 3 1 data collection field campaigns and flume experiments a dynamic change of reproductive shoot densities was seen over the growth season with an initial low density of flowering shoots in may increasing in june with high densities until mid august fig 5a over the growth season 3 separate peaks of flowering shoots of 95 9 6 120 6 2 and 131 16 no m 2 mean sd occurred in june july and august respectively the number of seeds within flowering shoots varied over the entire season fig 5b the seeds on the reproductive shoots appeared in early june and peaked from late june until late august without any distinct peak the seeds started to drop from the reproductive shoots in july and the highest number of released seeds was found in the sediment surface in july and august 110 48 no m 2 mean sd almost no seeds remained in the eelgrass patches until september fig 5b c concerning the mobility of seeds two thresholds were found from the field campaigns fig 5d 1 a threshold for seed movement as bedload at 6 8 cm s 1 and 2 a threshold for seed resuspension at 18 cm s 1 3 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses were done for several parameters affecting seed movement in the water column and along the seabed focus was on the constants with the biggest uncertainty affecting seed movement and where no literature values are available first the resuspension threshold for seeds was tested by selecting four values between 0 01 0 3 n m 2 and 0 02 1 7 n m 2 for bedload seed transport the seed movement declined with increasing thresholds for both resuspension and movement along the bottom the variability of distances travelled is high over all resuspension thresholds fig 6 a variability was evaluated by selecting 5 locations with varying hydrodynamic conditions as an average the travelled distances decline with increasing thresholds for resuspension up to 0 20 n m 2 overall increased threshold for bedload movement of seeds reduces the mobility of the seeds shown as transport distances fig 6b the variation of seed movement was higher in the lowest tested threshold for bedload movement while variation among tested sites is negligible with thresholds ranging from 0 07 1 7 n m 2 at high bedload thresholds 1 2 and 1 7 n m 2 seed movement is minimal 140 m and 75 m respectively increasing the number of days for seed incorporation led to an increase in the average distance travelled by the seeds fig 6c a steep increase of travelled distance is the consequence of increasing the threshold of incorporation time from 1 to 14 days yet after 14 days the increase lessens number of incorporation days affected both seed loss out of model area as well as range of covered distances by the seeds release locations and the differences in hydrodynamic forces among these areas increase the variability in travelled distances 3 3 seed dispersal the developed abm model was used to study seed dispersal in odense fjord simulations showed that drifting flowering shoots could travel distances up to 35 6 km in the odense fjord system table 5 the time and distance travelled depends immensely on wind direction and strength generally flowering shoots are washed out of the system within 3 days though the majority of seed carrying shoots was washed on shore within the first few hours table 5 all the dislodged released flowering shoots were transported out of the system or washed to land the simulations with different wind speeds and directions revealed that all the released flowering shoots carrying seeds were beached without dropping any seeds along the way the majority of seed carrying shoots were washed up on the coastlines near the beds but higher numbers were seen in northeast side of the bed no visible wind effect on loss locations was observed over the year while testing 6 different years with varying wind conditions during growth season this was attributed to short drift time meaning the majority of drifting shoots washed ashore near bed and dominant wind direction being from west or south west over the whole growth season loss of seeds dropped from attached flowering shoots were quantified using results from the 2009 simulation constants used in the simulation based on flume experiments and sensitivity analysis to control seed movement are shown in table 4 in order to evaluate viable seed banks for seedling recruitment losses were divided into 1 loss to land 2 areas with poor light conditions 3 areas with low anchoring capacity 4 areas dominated by sediment reworked by lugworms 5 areas with high sediment mobility table 3 a small portion of seeds were lost to land 2 9 table 6 the main areas of seed losses were found adjacent to the donor beds on the northeast side data not shown these were considered directly lost while 92 29 of the seeds released were found in the fjord depth was used as a proxy for light availability only 20 6 of the seeds moved to areas with a favourable light climate for seedling establishment fig 8a while 40 1 of the seeds were found in areas with an impoverished light environment table 6 the second parameter evaluated was anchoring capacity for seedling development from seeds loi was used as a proxy where sediment was considered appropriate when loi was below 2 flindt et al 2016 areas with a viable seed banks decreased marginally when the anchoring capacity and light regime are coupled fig 8a b non suitable areas with seeds increased from 31 6 to 51 1 when depth and anchoring capacity were compared table 6 additional areas were lost for potential seedling recruitment when lugworm burial of seeds was considered these main changes were observed near the seed banks on the eastern shore fig 8c taking into account the main threats for seed loss to seedling recruitment 6 3 of the released seeds are found in areas with good potential areas with heavy sediment movement are located along the shallow part of the eastern shoreline thus areas suitable for successful seedling recruitment are highly impacted in this area fig 8d therefore the area with good recruitment potential for seedbank development declines to 5 due to sediment mobility equivalent to only 2 km2 table 6 however seed densities vary greatly within the potentially good area ranging from 1 to above 1000 no m 2 with a mean 299 no m 2 fig 9 4 discussion seed production and dispersal is essential for the natural recovery of seagrass meadows that have been exposed to severe eutrophication odense fjord housed very extended and productive eelgrass meadows until 1983 covering 25 of the system fyns amt 2006 petersen et al 2009 since then a dramatic decrease occurred petersen et al 2009 and nowadays the eelgrass coverage is below 2 although water action plans have led to improved water quality by reducing the external nutrient loading fyns amt 2006 natural recovery of eelgrass remains absent natural recovery of large areas must be based on seed production followed by seed dispersal to sites that support germination seedling establishment and development of patches by vegetative growth in a previous work no seeds were found inside or near the meadows in odense fjord t lange 2012 unpublished another preliminary study verified that the produced seeds in the system were not stored within or close to the reproductive patches since the production period july until germination april instead almost all seeds were washed away during the late summer and autumn therefore it has been questioned if seed the production from such a small population could support a natural recovery previous studies have looked at eelgrass dispersal by drifting flowering shoots which were implemented in the model källström et al 2008 and erftemeijer et al 2008 calculated rafting shoots travelling up to 150 and 130 km respectively in the current model the maximum realized distance was 3 4 times lower with a maximal distance of 38 9 km and drifting times of 100 h the average journey of the drifting flowering shoots was much shorter 1 0 3 7 km and 1 7 6 0 h table 5 this can be explained by the small area of odense fjord in combination with general high wind speeds from the western corner and low tidal amplitude in odense fjord eelgrass patches are located fairly close to the coast on shallow depths and many are situated on wind exposed coastlines making dislodged flowering shoots vulnerable washing upon shore fig 1 the low tidal amplitude together with strong wind patterns makes the wind energy more dominant on the drifting flowers than the tide generated current velocity altogether it documents that eelgrass seed dispersal and connectivity by rafting is reduced in small shallow wind enforced estuaries even though the drifting time and distance was short table 5 the simulations show that the beds around odense fjord are still connected fig 7 the developed model is successfully able to simulate eelgrass seed release reproductive shoot drift and individual seed movement seed dispersal simulations from individual beds von thenen 2016 show that eelgrass beds are well connected by both dispersal methods simulation results of rafting shoots released within odense fjord show that all eelgrass meadows in odense fjord and dalby are connected although no rafting shoots from dalby reached patches in odense fjord fig 7 von thenen 2016 patch connectivity by individual seed movement was reduced as the deeper areas worked as settling areas individual seeds are predicted to move on average 1018 m fig 6b thus having the capability to move long enough distances to allow patch connectivity this is observed between otterup enebærodde and mid eastern eelgrass beds figs 2b and 8 boese and robbins 2008 found higher seed densities within perennial beds while seed densities dropped rapidly with distance from permanent bed likewise the model predicts the highest seed densities in areas with well established beds with seed densities decreasing with increasing distance from the meadow figs 2b and 9 sensitivity analysis revealed substantial effect of constants affecting movement individual seed movement for eelgrass is described by few studies fig 5 koch et al 2010 distances travelled by seeds are highly affected by the parameterization the more days needed for seeds to be incorporated to the sediment the longer distances they are potentially able to travel fig 6c for the muddy sediment lundkvist et al 2007 found that the maximal sediment stability was obtained after 7 days this study assumed that the seeds would be incorporated into the diatom produced polysaccharide matrix though a positive effect of current speeds on release of flowering shoots has been shown for zostera noltii berkovic et al 2014 no quantitative information of reproductive shoot fragment release was found for eelgrass based on field observations it was postulated that seeds are transported to deeper areas or washed on shore which the model was able to simulate the analysis of seeds final destination showed a large fraction of produced seeds ended up in suboptimal areas although all seeds are produced at areas well supported with light only about 20 6 of the seeds ended up in areas able to support seedlings with sufficient light intensities 0 5 2 m covering an area of 5 4 of the system 117 7 km2 in the studied estuary eelgrass cannot grow in depths shallower than 0 5 m due to high hydrodynamic impact and low tides about 31 6 of the seeds are lost to areas where seedlings will never be able to establish through many years of eutrophication the estuary has accumulated high amounts of organic matter in the sediment which has turned former fine sediment beds into muddy areas that have lost the capacity to anchor eelgrass seedlings valdemarsen et al 2014 about 51 1 of the seeds final destination is in these muddy areas therefore only 7 1 of the seeds produced settle on sediments supporting proper anchoring germination and development of new eelgrass patches regarding sediment characteristics and thus a proper anchoring capacity for eelgrass seedlings only 3 1 of total area 117 7 km2 is available for the eelgrass successful establishment many of the shallow sandy areas have been colonized by lugworms after the reduction of eelgrass coverage through the high reworking activity of lugworms seedling establishment is severely hampered by burial of seeds below the germination threshold depth and by burial and uprooting of young seedling in faecal mounts valdemarsen et al 2011 including the impact from lugworms the current model predicts that only 6 3 of the produced seeds end up in potential successful seedling establishment areas corresponding to an area of 3 1 km2 table 6 considering areas where sediment mobility prevents seedling establishment the proportion of seed production located in good areas is reduced to 5 0 corresponding to an area of 2 0 table 6 the predictions need to be treated with care in regard to light availability anchoring capacity and lugworm stress in the dalby bay area fig 8a although the area is well studied regarding eelgrass coverage no major monitoring activities have been conducted on loi or lugworm densities in addition the depth map used in this study underestimates the extent of shallow areas in dalby bay therefore the good potential areas in dalby may be under or overestimated fig 8 in addition in the current setup all seeds within rafting shoots are lost due to quick wash ashore time seed release from rafting shoots was delayed by 2 weeks as a laboratory studies showed a delay in seed maturation and dropping flindt et al unpublished data even though the model fails to simulate mature flower release it is acknowledged that the seed release should be random and will be included in the next generation of the model in addition the true connectivity of beds through rafting shoots can be underestimated because of constant release of flowering shoots wash ashore locations and quantities are expected to change dependent on varying meteorological release conditions wash ashore locations were not found to be heavily influenced by varying wind conditions as accumulated numbers though implications of variance were seen while looking at eelgrass beds separately denmark has predominant westerly winds which can explain the lack of variance between years nevertheless release of flowering shoots and fragments is expected to be stochastic inside the season meaning release is not constant and will vary among years and conditions seed banks in eelgrass meadows are necessary for eelgrass to survive unfavourable conditions it has been shown zostera marina persistence depends on seedling recruitment and seed bank e g seed bank played major role in recolonizing a lost eelgrass meadow due to anoxic event greve et al 2005 furthermore seeds are important for closing caps within meadows it is agreed that the best results are achieved with largescale restoration and high planting densities van katwijk et al 2016 since this is expensive selecting sites where a natural seed bank is present could supplement the needed densities choosing a restoration site with a viable seed bank with high seed densities in areas where seedling recruitment is plausible increases recovery success through natural seedling recruitment orth et al 2006b also highlights the importance of seeds increasing genetic diversity and using adult plants in combination with seeds as this could potentially be the most cost effective way for restoring lost beds the developed abm model could also help in predicting where and when to release seeds for successful restoration with seeds in odense fjord restoration attempts with seeds have so far failed which is attributed to hydrodynamics lange et al 2017 in prep the analysis of developed model has revealed areas of further improvement the current abm model developed overestimates seed densities especially in the enebærodde area and possibly in other areas with high eelgrass bed biomass fig 9 assumption of overestimation is supported by previous field campaigns to odense fjord lange unpublished data and seedling densities observed in the area are considerably lower valdemarsen et al 2010 overestimation may occur due to overestimation of eelgrass bed area field studies in the area have shown high seed loss from the bed flindt unpublished data hence it is believed that the model overestimates seed entrapment by eelgrass and macroalgae however there is a lack of works conducted on this topic the entrapment of seeds can also be lessened by wave action that increases resuspension frequency thus a better understanding and description of seed entrapment by meadows is needed in conclusion the developed model performs as expected seeds are dispersed as bedload with current speeds and dispersal distance is reduced by obstacles such as eelgrass beds and macroalgae mats however high seed densities are predicted in eelgrass beds the model is successfully used to analyse wind effects on drifting flowering shoots seed bedload transport seed loss and potential seedling recruitment areas it is acknowledged that validation of the model only is performed with observations and data due to the knowledge gaps in seed dispersal dynamics the best estimate has been made with the current information this study has revealed areas of further research for understanding the complex mechanisms involved in seed dispersal processes seed movement inhibition by

25328,the response of coffee coffea arabica l agronomical performance to changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration co2 is uncertain improving our understanding of potential responses of the coffee plant to these changes while taking into consideration agricultural management is required for identifying best bet adaptation strategies a mechanistic crop modelling approach enables the inclusion of a wide range of prior knowledge and an evaluation of assumptions we adapt a model by connecting it to spatially variable soil and climate data by which we are able to calculate yield of rain fed coffee on a daily time step the model takes account of variation in microclimate and water use as influenced by shade trees the approach is exemplified at two east african sites with distinctly different climates mt elgon uganda and mt kilimanjaro tanzania using a global sensitivity analysis for evaluation of model behavior and prior parameter uncertainty assessment we use the climate scenario driven by the hadley global environment model 2 earth system representative for the year 2050 to discuss potential responses of the coffee plant to interactions of elevated co2 temperature and water availability we subsequently explore the potential for adaptation to this scenario through shade management the results indicate that under current climatic conditions optimal shade cover at low elevations 1000 m a s l is 50 provided soil water storage capacity is sufficient enabling a 13 5 increase in coffee yield compared to unshaded systems coffee plants are expected to be severely impacted ranging from 18 to 32 coffee yield reductions at low elevations by increased temperature 2 5 c and drought stress when no elevated co2 is assumed water competition between coffee and shade trees are projected to be a severe limitation in the future requiring careful selection of appropriate shade tree species or the adoption of other technologies like conservation measures or irrigation the co2 fertilization effect could potentially mitigate the negative effect of temperature increase and drought stress up to 13 21 depending on site conditions and will increase yield at higher altitudes high uncertainty remains regarding impacts of climate change on flowering the presented model allows for estimating the optimal shade level along environmental gradients now and in the future overall it shows that shade proves to be an important adaptation strategy but this requires improved understanding regarding site specific management and selection of tree species moreover we do not yet include climate change uncertainty keywords coffea arabica l agroforestry system spatial decision support adaptation to climate change parameter uncertainty 1 introduction coffee is cultivated in over 70 countries throughout the tropics with approximately 60 of the production being coffea arabica l arabica coffee and 40 being coffea canephora pierre ex froehner syn coffea robusta robusta coffee fao 2015 over 70 of the world s coffee is produced by smallholders managing less than 10 ha of land fridell 2014 climate change is expected to have substantial impacts on suitable areas for coffee c arabica cultivation bunn et al 2015a ovalle rivera et al 2015 magrach and ghazoul 2015 pests and diseases pressure jaramillo et al 2011 magrach and ghazoul 2015 and genetic resources davis et al 2012 thereby likely changing the agro ecological zones most suitable for coffee production bunn et al 2015b agroforestry systems can both contribute to climate change mitigation while potentially enabling adaptation to climatic changes matocha et al 2012 mbow et al 2014 vaast et al 2016 due to the perennial nature of coffee with an economic lifespan typically up to 30 years wintgens 2004 and the long time required for agroforestry trees to grow to maturity decisions regarding adaptation to climate change are challenging therefore there is an urgent need for decision support consisting of accurate estimates of climatic suitability for coffee production and the influence of modified microclimate by shade trees including competition effects luedeling et al 2014 where long historical records of coffee performance weather and soil conditions are available this is a relatively easy task but the majority of coffee growing areas lack such data luedeling et al 2014 statistical species distribution modelling approaches schroth et al 2009 bunn et al 2015a magrach and ghazoul 2015 or agro climatic indices lane and jarvis 2007 have instead been used these methods are suitable for characterizing broad agro ecological zones bunn et al 2015b and generating hypotheses on the suitable climatic conditions for coffee but they lack a mechanistic process representation required to predict crop response outside the current growing domain including the carbon fertilization effect cfe induced by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration co2 furthermore while the above studies have analyzed geographical shifts in coffee suitability indicating a decrease of available area in the future they did neither include phenotypic responses of the coffee plant nicotra et al 2010 nor management practices allowing for adaptation to climate change such as shade management irrigation or changes in coffee genotypes vaast et al 2016 mechanistic crop models are believed to be more appropriate in generating realistic simulations of plant soil climate interactions moreover they facilitate learning through hypothesis testing and identification of missing knowledge sinclair and seligman 1996 boote et al 2010 which enables guidance for management action harfoot et al 2014 however applying such models without sufficient data for calibration results in large uncertainties of model predictions next to existing uncertainties in model structure beven 2008 luedeling et al 2016 the latter is often not identifiable by comparing model outputs with observations alone as many models can be fitted to the same data leading to the problem of equifinality beven and freer 2001 model comparison and critical reflection of assumptions is considered more appropriate de kauwe et al 2014 most of the parameters in a crop model are considered genetic coefficients and do not have to be adjusted when applied at different sites yin et al 2004 yet some parameters encompass limited process understanding and require calibration when the model is applied to different sites these include parameters related to the induction of flowering in coffee van oijen et al 2010b rodriguez et al 2011 another aspect related to parameter values is phenotypic plasticity i e changes in morphological chemical and physical characteristics of a plant in response to the environment if phenotypic plasticity is explicitly accounted for there is no need to adapt parameters in different environmental conditions yin 2013 obviously this is only possible when the required knowledge is available to adequately represent these processes considerable understanding is available on phenotypic responses of coffee to water poorter and nagel 2000 carr 2012 cavatte et al 2012 cannavo et al 2011 and light availabilities matos et al 2009 charbonnier et al 2013 martins et al 2014a but uncertainty is much greater with regard to phenotypic plasticity to atmospheric co2 variation yin 2013 with only few experimental studies regarding coffee so far martins et al 2014c ghini et al 2015 damatta et al 2016 other difficulties in exploring possible impacts of climate change on crop production are related to modelling climate extremes and its impacts thornton et al 2014 depending on the used global climate model gcm and the methods for downscaling the output to scales relevant for agriculture the projected changes in climate may only represent mean changes in temperature and precipitation and not adequately represent changing climate variability notably temperature and precipitation extremes müller et al 2011 ramirez villegas et al 2013 in addition to uncertainty in boundary conditions there is also uncertainty in the actual effects of such extremes on the plant reyer et al 2013 the goal of this study is to use a mechanistic coffee model which integrates current knowledge on coffee ecophysiology to evaluate potential impacts of climate change in various agro ecological settings and agricultural managements by making use of statistical approaches to explore the plausible parameter space we identify optimal current and future management practices of a wide range of potential genotypes the objectives of this paper are to 1 present the proposed coffee model 2 assess model outcome in time and space using mean literature derived parameter values 3 identify model behavior through global sensitivity analysis and 4 evaluate how robust the predicted change is despite parameter uncertainty conditioned by different climate scenarios we used two contrasting sites of east africa as case study areas namely the wet slopes of mount elgon uganda vs the drier slopes of mount kilimanjaro tanzania 2 material and methods 2 1 coffee model the original version of the coffee agroforestry model caf2007 was described by van oijen et al 2010b and extended by ovalle rivera 2014 this study adapts the caf2014 model for use as a spatially contextualized decision support tool spcaf this model was chosen as it is specifically designed to deal with coffee agroforestry systems and includes a mechanistic light use efficiency approach that deals with the interaction between temperature and co2 in comparison to caf2014 we assume no nutrient limitations as we intend to isolate the impact of climate on coffee and therefore focus on yield response to water i e water limited yield according to van ittersum et al 2013 temperature and atmospheric co2 levels consequently coffee yield is expressed exclusively as a function of climate and soil water availability excluding nutrient competition pest and disease alterations or allelopathic properties of shade trees on understory coffee tree shading is simplified to a canopy that provides shade and competes for water through evapotranspiration thus the objective is not to explicitly model a specific shade tree species but rather allow for exploration of the continuity between no shade and heavy shade and its effects on microclimate and water competition the model calculates water limited coffee yield at a daily time step and is implemented in r statistics r core team 2014 in the following sections all key processes and model assumptions are presented an overview of the model is illustrated in fig 1 2 1 1 coffee growth under optimal water supply canopy photosynthesis is modelled using a mechanistic light use efficiency lue approach based on the leaf photosynthesis model of farquhar et al 1980 and scaled up to canopy photosynthesis charles edwards 1982 as described in detail by van oijen et al 2004 this formula for lue is calculated on a daily basis and depends on temperature atmospheric co2 concentration light intensity and the rubisco content of upper leaves instead of modelling photosynthesis and respiration separately the lue approach assumes a constant ratio of daily rates of respiration and photosynthesis which has been explained experimentally e g gifford 1995 2003 and theoretically van oijen et al 2010c the parameters have been adjusted to very low and high light intensity yielding highest values for lue at low intensity van oijen et al 2010b this allows consistency with observations as reported by franck and vaast 2009 cavatte et al 2012 and charbonnier et al 2017 for arabica coffee moreover by expressing the lue approach based on the farquhar et al 1980 biochemical model the interaction between temperature and elevated atmospheric co2 is represented yin 2013 under favorable conditions growth rate is proportional to the amount of light intercepted by the canopy monteith 1977 therefore lue is multiplied with daily intercepted solar radiation calculated as an exponential function of leaf area index lai and a constant light extinction coefficient according to beer s law for attenuation monsi and saeki 1953 water stress decreases lue proportionally via the ratio of actual to potential transpiration rate kropff and van laar 1993 the lue of c arabica has been shown to range between 0 23 0 8 g mj 1 bote et al 2016a charbonnier et al 2017 it has also been shown that lue can increase by 50 under shade and thereby largely compensate for a reduction in 60 photosynthetically active radiation par leading to almost equal net primary productivity charbonnier et al 2017 therefore using the lue approach appears to be particularly appropriate for summarizing differences in phenotypic plasticity to shade cavatte et al 2012 charbonnier et al 2017 bote et al 2016a this plasticity is reflected by several physiological and morphological adjustments firstly plants in low light conditions allocate more nitrogen to light harvesting rather than carbon assimilating enzymes cavatte et al 2012 poorter et al 2014 although coffee was found to have a robust photosynthetic machinery even in low light that allows to maximize variable light availability by sunflecks martins et al 2013 secondly in high light an increased investment in photoprotective mechanisms was observed matos et al 2009 thirdly reduced vpd under shade improves stomatal and mesophyll conductance over the day franck and vaast 2009 martins et al 2014b which is particularly important as coffee photosynthesis is mainly limited by diffusive rather than biochemical limitations damatta et al 2007 chaves et al 2008 franck and vaast 2009 martins et al 2014b fourthly increases in specific leaf area martins et al 2014b and diffuse light availability charbonnier et al 2013 under shade might further increase fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation compared to unshaded systems the fraction of carbon c allocated to the different plant organs depends on phenological stage vegetative growth bean maturation and is modulated by water availability root c sink strength increases with increasing water stress to the detriment of other plant organs according to the functional equilibrium theory brouwer 1983 high fruit load can come at the expense of i vegetative growth leading to die back vaast et al 2005 in extreme cases and ii the development of fruiting nodes and hence lower sink strength of fruits in the following year vaast et al 2005 bote and jan 2016 phenology is based on thermal time degree days and flowering is induced by a threshold amount of rainfall after the dry season damatta et al 2007 carr 2012 the intensity of flowering is a function of monthly light intensity around flowering cannell 1985 franck vaast 2009 leaf senescence varies depending on the degree of water stress while roots were set with a constant lifespan leaf growth is calculated as the product of leaf biomass and specific leaf area the latter is decreased by water stress 2 1 2 soil water balance and water stress a simple one layer soil water balance is used to calculate the amount of water in the root zone whereby water is added by precipitation and lost through interception transpiration evaporation runoff and drainage van keulen 1986 van oijen et al 2010b runoff is calculated as the amount of water lost through surface flow which is a function of rainfall interception by vegetation cover modelled by the system s leaf area index soil water holding capacity and slope drainage is calculated as the remaining water not used by evapotranspiration interception by vegetation or loss through runoff which is not retained by the soil van oijen et al 2010b no groundwater influence is assumed potential transpiration depends on temperature solar radiation vapor pressure and lai and is calculated with the penman equation penman 1948 according to van oijen and leffelaar 2008 actual transpiration rate decreases below the potential rate when soil water content is below a critical value which is lower than field capacity by an amount that depends inversely on atmospheric evaporative demand driessen 1986 van oijen et al 2010b this critical plant available soil water content additionally depends on the sensitivity of the coffee cultivar to drought waterlogging can hamper crop growth when soil water content exceeds a given threshold evapo transpiration demand is partly covered by daily rainfall interception through foliage up to a maximum level which is proportional to lai van oijen et al 2010b siles et al 2010 2 1 3 shade light transmission microclimate buffering and water competition light transmission through shade tree canopy is modelled with beer s law using the lai of the shade tree canopy and an extinction coefficient reflecting different degrees of light transmission and assuming a horizontally homogeneous canopy kropff and van laar 1993 zuidema et al 2005 these two variables allow for varying light transmission through shade tree canopy between 0 and 100 in reality the shade tree canopy in agroforestry systems is never homogeneous and includes multiple layers and species as well as canopy gaps charbonnier et al 2013 showed that the assumption of a homogeneous canopy is nevertheless valid at plot scale at least under their studied conditions at a humid site in costa rica with high planting density of dwarf caturra variety and low shade tree density with crown projections covering 16 of the farm although it is difficult to assume their findings are valid under other environmental and shade management conditions it is an important indication that plot level modelling might be sufficiently approximated with this approach therefore it provides an appropriate reference for comparing the effects of climate and shade on coffee conceptually non shaded and homogeneous shade canopy constitute reference points for the extreme shade canopy types whereby the lai and light extinction coefficient represent different shade tree compositions changes in coffee leaf functional traits e g sla and leaf nitrogen concentration between management systems of different vegetation structures i e various shade tree compositions to no shade is mainly related to light availability rather than shade tree species composition gagliardi et al 2015 microclimate modification by shade is reflected as a decrease of daily average temperature proportional to the fraction of radiation intercepted by the shade trees van oijen et al 2010b mean daily temperature decreases according to shade level down to a given maximum e g 4 c beer et al 1998 water competition starts with rain interception of shade trees which is proportional to lai up to a specified threshold siles et al 2010 tree transpiration was modelled as for coffee with the penman equation penman 1948 shade trees transpire water from the same soil water layer as used by coffee plants hence competition of water occurs when transpiration demands of coffee and shade trees together drive the soil water content below the critical soil water threshold when actual transpiration rate declines below potential rate 2 2 climate and soil data parameters of the soil water balance model are retrieved from the gridded functional soil information dataset on root zone plant available water holding capacity of the sub sahara african soil afsis leenaars et al 2015 terrain slope is calculated with the terrain function from the raster package hijmans 2015 based on the srtm 90 m digital elevation model daily weather data is generated from the worldclim database hijmans et al 2005 using the marksim weather generator jones and thornton 2000 on a 30 s resolution approximately 1 km near the equator for current interpolation of observed data representative of 1950 2000 and future climatic conditions downscaled gcm data using the delta method ramirez villegas and jarvis 2010 and representative of the 2040 2069 time slice since the objective of this study is to present the model and its behavior instead of a climate change impact assessment we chose only one gcm to exemplify model capability we focus the study on possible responses of the coffee plant with consideration of its management to a changing climate rather than assessing uncertainty in climate change predictions the hadley global environment model 2 earth system hadgem2 es jones et al 2011 from the ipcc 5th assessment report ipcc 2013 using the representative concentration pathway 6 0 van vuuren et al 2011 was chosen for illustration purposes hadgem2 es has been identified as one of the best performing gcms e g brands et al 2013 perez et al 2014 and is one of the most commonly used vapor pressure is estimated from temperature assuming dew point is equal to minimum temperature as shown by wang et al 2004 solar radiation is estimated with marksim using the model of donatelli and campbell 1997 cit in jones and thornton 2000 and adjusted to topography with the slopefactor function of the ecohydrology package of r fuka et al 2014 because arabica coffee is mainly cultivated on the slopes of mountain ranges spatial resolution should not be too low in order to account for the heterogeneity arising through complex topography to account for the stochasticity of the marksim weather generator 100 replicates of yearly weather data are simulated for each pixel to account for the diversity of possible weather constellations that monthly mean values could be made up of we calculated four 25 year growth periods per site and then calculated the mean annual yield values of the 100 year simulations 2 3 study sites two study sites of east africa were chosen with distinctly different climates fig 2 and table s1 an altitudinal transect 1000 2200 m a s l was selected along the slopes of mt elgon uganda with hot and dry climate at low altitudes and cool and wet climate at high altitudes on the other hand mt kilimanjaro tanzania was chosen as a prominent coffee growing region with severe drought issues and a high predicted climate change impact craparo et al 2015 the precipitation values of the worldclim data for mt kilimanjaro above 1500 m a s l were corrected with the insights gained from weather monitoring along the altitudinal transect as recently published by appelhans et al 2016 fig 4 at the two study sites the hadgem2 es estimates a slightly higher temperature increase and a lower change in annual rainfall compared to four other commonly used gcms table s2 therefore the hadgem2 es represents a warmer and drier climate with respect to the other evaluated gcms the soils on the slopes of mt elgon and mt kilimanjaro are predominantly nitisols wrb for soil classification iuss working group 2015 developed on basaltic outflows water holding capacity is highly heterogeneous due to the complex topography and is highest at mid altitude fig s1 the selected areas have an extension of 1739 km2 on mt elgon and 1430 km2 on mt kilimanjaro and are important coffee production areas with the majority of households growing coffee the coffee is often intercropped with banana musa spp and a diversity of shade trees with cordia africana albizia schimperiana and ficus mucosa being the most frequent ones hemp 2006 van der wolf et al 2016 2 4 experimental design the full continuum of light and water competition was modelled to calculate optimal shade level per pixel for maximum coffee yield we varied the shade tree leaf area index between 0 and 3 and the shade tree light extinction coefficient between 0 4 and 0 8 yielding shade levels between 0 and 90 the continuum of water competition was represented by the two extremes of full potential and no water competition full potential water competition between coffee and shade trees is assumed due to presence of coffee and tree roots in the same single and homogeneous soil layer and with no preferential access of coffee roots to soil water for the sensitivity and uncertainty analyses on the other hand we did not use the full continuum of light and water competition due to high computation demand we compared non shaded systems with systems covered by 50 shade shade tree leaf area index 1 and shade tree light extinction coefficient 0 7 assuming full water competition climate scenarios consisted of current climatic conditions referring to 1950 2000 according to worldclim and denoted as year 2000 and future climate representative of the 2040 2069 time slice in the following referred to 2050 without elevated atmospheric co2 future a and with elevated atmospheric co2 future b atmospheric co2 concentrations for current and future a scenarios were 380 ppm and 478 ppm for future b scenario according to the ipcc representative concentration pathways rcp 6 0 van vuuren et al 2011 for the future b scenario we assumed neither photosynthetic downregulation nor changes in carbon allocation to represent the maximum possible co2 fertilization effect cfe the future a scenario represents the temperature effect of climate change and the difference between future b and future a represents the uncertainty in cfe maximum cfe reflects increased photosynthesis and water use efficiency assuming no phenotypic responses to elevated co2 the uncertainty range therefore reflects possible physiological and or morphological changes as a response to elevated co2 not accounted for by the model for the sensitivity analysis and prior i e uncalibrated uncertainty assessment we chose two locations each on mt elgon and mt kilimanjaro one at low altitude 1097 and 1133 m a s l respectively and a second one at high altitude 1863 and 1629 m a s l respectively 2 5 evaluation 2 5 1 parameter ranges and assumptions parameter ranges were selected as marginally uniform distributions based on published studies as presented by van oijen et al 2010a and from more recent literature see table s3 and s5 it is important to differentiate between parameter values that can be considered as generally valid for all arabica coffee species and parameter values that are genotype specific boote et al 2003 genotype specific parameters include carbon allocation parameters transpiration coefficient light extinction coefficient leaf rubisco content time between seedling planting and reproductive phase specific leaf area and parameters of plant organ senescence differences between traditional low yielding and improved high yielding genotypes can be largely explained by differences in carbon allocation patterns whereby the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus remained almost the same génard et al 2008 ericsson et al 1996 for example the difference at juvenile stage between the coffee cultivars coffea arabica cv caturra catuai and catimor was mainly related to morphological variables i e height leaf area internode number root to shoot ratio while physiological variables i e leaf net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance intercellular co2 and intrinsic water use efficiency were not significantly different zhang et al 2017 2 5 2 sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis was performed using the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast of saltelli et al 1999 the efast estimates the contribution of individual input factors to output variance and evaluates the variability of the output for the entire uncertainty domains of the parameters additionally it addresses higher order interaction between input factors the method makes use of a sampling approach following a systematic search trajectory designed to explore the parameter space via a transformation function a first order sensitivity and a total effect sensitivity index are computed from the generated trajectories using a spectral decomposition of the model output variability the total output variance is decomposed to estimate the influence of individual parameters by its main effects and the interactions with other parameters this method was shown to be more efficient than sobol s method sobol 1993 which uses a monte carlo approach to estimate first and total sensitivity indices makowski et al 2006 and has been shown to be more robust than several other global sensitivity methods chan et al 1997 saltelli and bolado 1998 furthermore computational demand is significantly lower with efast and interaction effects among parameters are computed which is not the case with sobol s algorithm we used the sensitivity r package by pujol et al 2015 conversion of the sensitivity indices was found for a sample size of factor 1000 resulting in 26 000 model runs with 26 parameters i e 26 000 parameter vectors were sampled and run with the model per climate and management scenario 2 6 prior parameter uncertainty analysis as the exact parameter values are unknown we evaluate how the different shade management and climate scenarios impact on the different parameter sets within the range of parameter uncertainty this approach is called forward uncertainty analysis beven 2008 as the outputs depend entirely on the prior assumptions of the parameters which are propagated forward through the model predictions to assess forward parameter uncertainty we use the parameter vectors as sampled with the efast method the uncertainty is exemplified for a hypothetical but realistic i e derived from existing literature coffee arabica genotype therefore we set the light extinction coefficient and rubisco content in leaves to 0 65 m2 m 2 and 0 54 g m 2 respectively the uncertain parameters are given in table s4 the soil parameters representing the fraction of water content at field capacity air dryness wilting point and water saturation have been set to the values of the respective pixels of the afsis database leenaars et al 2015 3 results 3 1 model runs with mean parameter values 3 1 1 mount elgon on mt elgon the high altitude is currently the most suitable area for coffee production with a peak at 1780 m a s l fig 3 due to the optimal mean annual temperature 19 3 c annual precipitation 1654 mm high cloud cover and hence low daily mean solar radiation 19 7 mj m 2 d 1 coffee is not dependent on shade for buffering microclimate shade becomes beneficial from 1500 m a s l on downwards whereby the benefit increases as altitude decreases maximum yield gain due to optimal shade management assuming full potential water competition is 11 for current and 13 and 10 for future a and b respectively at low altitude shade up to 50 increases coffee yield despite the conservative assumption of non preferential access of coffee roots to soil water and hence full potential water competition between coffee and shade trees yet some areas at low altitudes have soils with low water holding capacity resulting in increased competition for water between coffee and shade trees in the scenario of future climate 2050 as predicted by the hadgem2 es without considering elevated atmospheric co2 coffee yield is negatively affected up to 2000 m a s l with a maximum decrease of 44 on poor soils at low altitude mean 25 while at altitudes higher than 2000 m a s l yield is increased due to predicted higher temperatures optimal coffee suitability increases up to 2200 m a s l equaling an altitudinal shift of 400 m this drastically reduces the suitable area for coffee cultivation as exemplified by a comparison of maps on current and future a scenarios fig 3 the increased yield in the future limited to the highest altitudes is additionally attributed to a foreseen precipitation increase 100 300 mm yr 1 however this area coincides with the protected afromontane forest starting at around 2200 m a s l hence agricultural expansion to these higher altitudes is not permitted shade as an adaptation strategy allows to adapt currently non shaded systems in the future but only if coffee is associated with tree species not competitive but rather complementary in terms of water use unless water competition is adequately dealt with the benefit of modified microclimate by shade trees will not be able to sustain the current yield level assuming no phenotypic plasticity as a response to elevated co2 the cfe cancels the negative effect of high temperature at low and mid altitudes on mt elgon while at high altitude yield is increased 10 15 3 1 2 mount kilimanjaro on the slopes of mt kilimanjaro the highest yield of rain fed coffee is between 1600 and 1800 m a s l fig 4 shade improves coffee yield at lower altitudes 1600 m a s l only if non water competitive shade tree species are used assuming full potential water competition shade is beneficial solely up to 1370 m a s l due to the dry climate reducing the net benefit of shade trees furthermore the temperature effect of predicted climate change according to the hadgem2 es without considering elevated co2 decreases yield up to 1730 m a s l higher evaporative demand and hence water stress will be a serious problem and the issue of water competition between coffee and shade trees even more critical adapting coffee systems to this foreseen climate will require substantial knowledge on shade tree selection and management elevated co2 might mitigate the negative effects of predicted climate change at low altitude if no physiological and or morphological acclimation processes take place at mid altitude future elevated co2 conditions will not be able to maintain the same yield levels as under current conditions maximum yield gain with optimal shade management assuming full potential water competition is 12 for current and 18 and 17 for future a and b respectively 3 2 prior parameter uncertainty prior parameter uncertainty analysis provides insights on the qualitative changes to be expected using different parameter sets when evaluating different shade management and climate scenarios fig 5 the mean responses of the impact of different management practices no shade vs shaded systems at current and future with cfe vs no cfe climatic conditions over a longer time period give a clear picture of the climate signal incorporating shade trees with 50 canopy cover at low altitude 1092 m a s l on mt elgon benefits coffee yield on average by 13 5 over a 25 year growth period despite high parameter uncertainty fig 5 this shade level also constitutes the optimal shade level for highest coffee yield fig 6 a few parameter sets reveal no change or even a yield decrease under shaded conditions this occurs under conditions of combined low leaf sink strength low maximum leaf life span and short thermal time requirement for bean maturation such a parameter constellation is unlikely present in a real genotype therefore making this scenario rather unrealistic yet to improve our model understanding it is still helpful to identify such conditions in these parameter constellations lai is too small to adapt to the limited light availability under shade which outweighs the benefits of improved microclimate furthermore the short thermal time requirement for bean maturation results in an increased photo assimilate demand by berries that cannot be provided by the low leaf area and low light availability at high altitudes on the other hand shade with 50 canopy cover is not beneficial for coffee yield compared to unshaded systems fig 5 due to the already low temperature high humidity associated to high annual rainfall and low solar radiation due to high cloud cover none of the evaluated parameter constellations allow for improved yield under shade at high altitude unshaded coffee outperforms shaded coffee in terms of coffee yield at current climatic conditions at high altitude fig 6 in a future climate as projected by the hadgem2 es coffee yield is hampered by increased temperature and drought stress at low altitude 18 if no elevated atmospheric co2 concentration is assumed fig 5 for most parameter constellations this negative impact on yield can be mitigated if shade is included allowing to maintain current yield in the future a shade level of 50 continues to provide the highest net benefit resulting in highest yield fig 6 the shade effect for different parameter constellations has been described above in a future scenario with elevated atmospheric co2 reaching 478 ppm the negative impact of increased temperature and drought stress is mitigated fig 5 allowing to maintain current yield in the future even without shade this is assuming neither a downregulation in photosynthesis nor changes in carbon allocation as a response to elevated co2 as shown in fig 5 and 6 optimizing shade management under these conditions results in increased yield compared to current unshaded systems 18 at high altitude by contrast increased temperatures will benefit coffee yield in both scenarios no with elevated co2 shade with 50 canopy cover at these altitudes will not be able to outperform unshaded systems either today or in the future if the sole objective is to maximize coffee yield fig 5 but shade up to 18 does not lead to a yield reduction fig 6 on mt kilimanjaro tanzania shade also improves coffee yield at low altitude 24 but not at high altitude compared to mt elgon future predicted climate change has a more negative effect in both scenarios without 32 and with elevated co2 18 in unshaded conditions but yield can be improved by shading to 2 and 16 in scenarios without and with elevated co2 respectively although shading coffee at high altitude reduces potential yield at current climatic conditions it buffers coffee systems against future climate scenarios and helps maintain yield no elevated co2 or even increases yield with elevated co2 3 3 parameter sensitivity the most sensitive parameters are those related to soil water availability i e amount of water available for coffee and trees between field capacity and wilting point light interception light extinction coefficient photosynthesis rubisco content in leaves and carbon allocation i e sink strength for leaves and storage organs fig 7 these parameters need to be well known or appropriately estimated to reduce uncertainty the remaining parameters do not significantly influence output variance and hence can be set as constant values allowing for model simplification the difference in parameter sensitivity to changes in environment uganda vs tanzania low vs high altitude is less than to shade level shade reduces the energy input reaching the soil and the coffee plants and therefore reduces water use by coffee transpiration and to a lesser extent soil evaporation yet adding transpiration of the shade trees hence assuming full potential water competition all year around leads to high sensitivity of soil parameters the soil water budget of coffee plants is less important under shaded conditions when there is no water competition the strong influence of soil hydraulic parameters parameters related to field capacity and wilting point highlights the need for using high quality soil data as inputs as water becomes less limiting parameters related to light interception canopy photosynthesis and carbon allocation become more important the c sink strength of roots gains importance in water limited conditions when soil hydraulic parameters are excluded of the sensitivity analysis data not shown while sink strengths of leaves and berries are relatively more important in light limited conditions as shown in fig 7 the general pattern of model parameter sensitivity between mt elgon and mt kilimanjaro is consistent despite the differences in climatic conditions the main difference is the higher sensitivity of parameters related to thermal time namely base temperature for maturation tmatb and thermal time to maturation tmatt particularly in unshaded systems located at low altitude the soil water balance parameters are provided as input by the afsis database whereby the uncertainty of this database is not considered in this study yet as the model is very sensitive to soil hydraulic parameters accurate estimates are required to reduce uncertainty for calibration purposes it is important to know which parameters are critical when removing them from the analysis when excluding the soil water balance parameters the sensitive parameters 0 1 are in descending order carbon sink strength of leaves sinkl rubisco content of upper leaves rubisc sink strength for storage organs sinkpmax light extinction coefficient kext and carbon sink strength of roots sinkr 4 discussion we presented a model that allows to taking into account spatially explicit soil and climate characteristics to explore management options for coffee systems via shade tree association one gcm was used as the main purpose of this study is the presentation of the model features rather than a full climate change impact assessment nonetheless consistent with earlier studies we found negative impacts of increased temperature at low altitude while high altitude areas should gain in terms of yield potential bunn et al 2015a magrach and ghazoul 2015 our model suggests that the cfe could potentially mitigate the negative effects of increased temperature to a large extent hence suggesting that previous studies might have overestimated the negative impact of climate change additionally one of the most salient features of the present model is to calculate the optimal shade level along environmental gradients now and in the future according to different climate scenarios below we discuss differences among coffee genotypes the effect of shade and co2 fertilization the importance of soil water availability the interaction between temperature and co2 effect as well as implications for smallholders on mt elgon and mt kilimanjaro and ultimately model improvements 4 1 genotypic variation data availability for calibration purposes is a major constraint explicitly analyzing the uncertainty range in parameters is therefore of great importance beven 2008 due to the lack of certainty concerning which parameter sets best simulate the actual genotypes and planting densities currently cultivated at the sites of interest we did our simulations based on the entire range of parameter values by sampling the plausible parameter space despite the uncertainty in the absolute change induced by the assessed scenarios compared to current non shaded systems fig 5 and 6 the model allows for identifying the direction of change in coffee yield reyer et al 2016 it further exemplifies the potential of improved genotypes in the context of climate change adaptation bertrand et al 2016 the maps in figs 3 and 4 represent only one general arabica genotype at a fixed planting density resulting in relatively low observed water limited yield up to 2 5 t ha the use of modern high yielding dwarf varieties e g catimor derived varieties planted at high density 4000 5000 plants ha as commonly found on coffee plantations in brazil and colombia for example can reach yield levels over 3 t ha van der vossen 2005 damatta et al 2007 different coffee varieties exhibit different yield potentials and responses to environmental stresses differences in morphological traits have been identified to be the main determinants of yield differences and drought tolerance among arabica cultivars tausend et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 open questions remain regarding genotypic differences in temperature tolerance and response to elevated co2 furthermore hybrid varieties between arabica robusta and hybrids of timor have been developed mainly for pest and or disease resistance bertrand et al 2016 herrera and lambot 2017 that could potentially also benefit of robusta s tolerance to higher temperature to analyze this data of different varieties on the physiological particularly stomatal conductance and morphological characteristics are required the sensitivity analysis fig 7 highlights that plant architecture light extinction coefficient plays an important role in plant performance under shaded or non shaded conditions traditional varieties which have a less dense canopy unigarro et al 2016 are usually better adapted to shade while modern dwarf varieties with high self shading often grow well without shade montagnon et al 2012 genotypic differences regarding responses to light availability are of great interest for using agroforestry systems as adaptation strategy bertrand et al 2016 4 2 effect of shade the model allows for estimating the optimal shade level along environmental gradients now and in changing future climates in areas with optimal water supply elevated temperatures and high solar radiation a range of shade tree species can be used with beneficial effects for coffee yield in these areas trees with high timber value or fast growing ones can substantially improve farmers livelihoods schaller et al 2003 vaast et al 2008 vaast et al 2015 where water is limiting shade trees need to be selected with high root niche differentiation cannavo et al 2011 padovan et al 2015 and non competing phenology the latter also provides options to optimize light availability beer et al 1998 knowledge of appropriate selection of shade tree species van der wolf et al 2016 and their management related to timing and amount of pruning is thus required beer et al 1998 it is important to further consider the economic impact of agroforestry systems at locations where shade does not decrease coffee yield or when such decreases are relatively small increased farm profitability and revenue diversification can be achieved by farmers due to the co production of other agroforestry products such as fruits firewood and timber rice 2011 vaast et al 2015 we showed that the model responds well to decreasing light availability by increasing the sensitivity of parameters relevant to light interception fig 7 soil hydraulic parameters had a strong effect on yield which emphasizes the importance of sound soil input data different soil types will therefore have an important influence on yield output which need to be accounted for in addition to changes in climate variables we suggest the use of recently established spatial databases on root zone plant available water holding capacity leenaars et al 2015 but uncertainties in these data should be taken into account in future studies these soil types in combination with precipitation regime and root distribution of shade tree species will largely determine the risk for water competition or potential for complementarity between coffee and intercrops shade trees van kanten and vaast 2006 cannavo et al 2011 padovan et al 2015 in this study light and water competitions were estimated conservatively assuming homogeneous shade cover and full potential water competition within a single soil layer nevertheless the selected approach allows the calculation of the biophysical determinants of successful agroforestry systems sanchez 1995 at the critical endpoints of the continuum of different degrees of light and water competition shade tree species differ substantially in the way they intercept light and use water based on their canopy root architecture and phenology e g deciduous vs evergreen trees luedeling et al 2016 on the other hand the model does not account for the effect of shade and climate change on pests and diseases shade can either have beneficial or negative effects on pests and diseases depending on environmental context jonsson et al 2015 liebig et al 2016 which additionally requires careful consideration for shade tree management staver et al 2001 4 3 effect of co2 fertilization we identified that an increase in co2 might substantially mitigate some of the negative impacts caused by climate change although the magnitude of that mitigation effect is not clear due to possible responses in phenotypic plasticity aspinwall et al 2015 to account for this uncertainty in cfe we modelled zero effect modelled by omitting an increase in co2 in the future and the effect resulting when no phenotypic plasticity is assumed as a response to elevated co2 from 380 ppm to 478 ppm the model indicates an averaged maximum effect on coffee yield between 13 5 21 fig 5 with higher effect at the more humid mt elgon site compared to the drier mt kilimanjaro site although water use efficiency generally increases due to elevated co2 at an instantaneous time scale the duration of stomatal opening at longer time scales is increased at more humid sites which can lead to higher overall benefit of co2 our modelled values agree well with the average response of 13 found in free air co2 enrichment experiments face across a range of c3 crops long et al 2006 and a recent one conducted on coffee in brazil resulting in a yield increase of 12 0 14 6 depending on genotype due to increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations from 390 ppm to 550 ppm over a two year period without increasing ambient temperature ghini et al 2015 damatta et al 2016 this yield increase was even larger approx 40 in the third year leading to a mean increase of 28 raquel ghini personal communication this high cfe found in this face experiment is due to the absence of downregulation in photosynthetic capacity or acclimation of stomatal conductance there was no decrease in leaf nitrogen content and no alteration in leaf rubisco content differences between the two evaluated genotypes in their responses to elevated co2 were found suggesting some uncertainties on how other common arabica varieties might respond anyway this general lack of phenotypic plasticity in response to elevated co2 is exceptional when compared to many other c3 plants ainsworth and long 2005 and suggests that arabica coffee benefits comparatively well from cfe this appears to be due to the fact that coffee photosynthesis is highly limited by diffusional rather than biochemical limitations martins et al 2014b research on other c3 plants with similar diffusional limitations have also indicated above average benefit of cfe niinemets et al 2011 flexas et al 2014 additionally as a perennial woody species it has a larger carbon sink capacity compared to annual crops ainsworth long 2005 higher water use efficiency is achieved by increasing net photosynthesis at maintained stomatal and mesophyll conductance damatta et al 2016 maintaining stomatal conductance is beneficial as a reduction might result in an increased leaf temperature via its effects on leaf energy balance bernacchi et al 2007 which could exacerbate the warming induced by climate change 4 4 interaction between temperature and co2 effect to what extent elevated co2 might mitigate increased temperature is unclear and might be different for different genotypes and dependent on the accompanying change in air humidity and soil water availability growth chamber studies have found increased tolerance of coffee to supra optimal temperature at elevated co2 mainly due to increased investment into protective measures martins et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2016 the degree of this increased tolerance will depend on the temperature and precipitation induced changes in soil moisture and vpd and the vigor of the coffee plant therefore hot and humid areas are expected to benefit more from the interaction between elevated co2 and supra optimal temperature compared to areas that will become hot and dry this explains why our model implies that elevated co2 does not allow to maintain current yield on mt kilimanjaro while on mt elgon it might cancel out the negative effect of increased mean temperature irrigation practices are widespread in the kilimanjaro area hemp 2006 and the last two decades 1990 2010 have been identified as quite dry compared to average climate with reductions in precipitations during the main growing season otte et al 2016 further drying is projected by the hadgem2 es due to decreased rainfall in combination with higher evaporative demand as a result of higher temperatures particularly during bean filling this likely results in increased c demand for maintenance and respiration as well as for bean filling with simultaneous decrease in photosynthesis due to increased vpd and drought stress importantly we have to be aware that there remain high uncertainties on how the interactions between warming and elevated co2 will impact flowering bean maturation and cup quality for example there are indications that flowering might be severely reduced under increased temperature drinnan and menzel 1995 craparo et al 2015 which is currently not included in the model due to limited process knowledge pest and disease pressure will additionally change and likely continue to constitute a primary production constraint to coffee cultivation for which we have only limited information at present jaramillo et al 2011 ghini et al 2015 jonsson et al 2015 4 5 what does the co2 effect mean for smallholder farmers on mt elgon and mt kilimanjaro the vast majority of farmers on mt elgon and mt kilimanjaro are smallholders who face several constraints to access adequate nutrient and pest and disease management options leading to coffee systems with very low yield wang et al 2015 craparo et al 2015 liebig et al 2016 therefore it is unlikely that they will benefit of the cfe unless appropriate actions to promote climate smart agricultural management are taken vaast et al 2016 the challenge of the cfe is that it favors highly intensified systems thereby further increasing their competitive advantage compared to extensive ones of smallholders and hence likely making the formers more vulnerable morton 2007 the opportunity of cfe however is that improving smallholders farming conditions might allow more of them to continue cultivating coffee in the future than previously estimated 4 6 model improvements several aspects need to be highlighted for future improvements regarding the present coffee model firstly further insights are required on how coffee light use efficiency is affected by different light availabilities at different time scales this allows for clarifying to what extent the mechanistic light use efficiency approach van oijen et al 2004 is an appropriate summary model of changes in microclimate due to shade i e changes in minimum and maximum temperatures decreased vpd and increased diffuse light and changes in phenotypic plasticity of the coffee plant secondly we still lack a sufficient mechanistic understanding of flowering induction and associated asynchronous flowering events a first attempt has been done by rodriguez et al 2011 by using demographic population models which should be further evaluated to improve our understanding it will require long term data sets of flowering events combined with weather and soil data of different environmental contexts the same is required to better understand factors leading to flower abortion thirdly a more detailed modelling routine might be required for branch dynamics that adequately represent competition between fruit load and increment in branch and new branch development depending on the new branches formed and extension of existing branches the nodes and potential flowering should be calculated finally improvement is also required in representing the impact of extreme events such as temperature and rainfall on coffee productivity as more data become available more complex process representation will be possible either through direct parameterization or inverse modelling particularly this is needed for extending the soil water balance to multilayered soil compartments enabling root niche differentiation between the coffee plant and shade trees as recently exemplified in nicaragua padovan et al 2015 in order to better account for differences in canopy structure of the shade trees summary models as presented by duursma and mäkelä 2007 and forrester 2014 could be implemented with intermediary complexity between our present approach and the maestra approach as used by charbonnier et al 2013 2017 these improvements strongly depend on data availability the collection of functional trait data for different genotypes in different environmental contexts will allow to analyze genotypic and phenotypic plasticity and significantly contribute to the required data for modelling endeavors this requires the consolidation of available functional trait data for coffee particularly flowering phenology and shade trees within the plant trait database kattge et al 2011 martin and isaac 2015 but also on coffee yield management practices and local knowledge ordonez et al 2014 van der wolf et al 2016 consolidation of such a database would improve either direct parameterization or calibration through inverse modelling for example by using a bayesian approach thereby allowing to estimate parameter values in different climates where weather soil and production data are available van oijen et al 2005 5 conclusions we presented a mechanistic model that processes spatially explicit soil and climate data to guide coffee cultivation and shade tree management for sustainable coffee production systems we applied the model to two case studies namely the slopes of mt elgon uganda and mt kilimanjaro tanzania according to the gcm used hadgem2 es mt kilimanjaro will be severely affected by a drying climate in the future while mt elgon is impacted to a lesser extent the presented modelling results confirm earlier studies on coffee suitability changes namely that low altitude areas will be more strongly affected by climate change however previous studies did not include neither cfe nor shade management and consequently seem to have overestimated the negative effects of mean changes in temperature and shifts in precipitation regimes i e yield improvements due to elevated co2 seem to largely mitigate the negative impacts of elevated temperature shade trees can play a strong beneficial role at the low altitude areas that have more marginal climates and will suffer most from climate change higher altitude areas 1500 m may see little to no direct benefit from shade trees on coffee yield the model outputs can guide initiatives related to trees in agricultural landscapes such as biodiversity conservation and or carbon sequestration and in minimizing potential trade offs with farm productivity this will aid in decision making towards improvement of current coffee landscapes and their adaptation to climatic change in integrating the current understanding of the coffee system we also identify knowledge gaps related to flowering and bean maturation and hence cup quality in response to climate change with particular focus on climate extremes which require further study the positive effect of cfe will particularly benefit intensified systems hence significant improvements in agronomic management of smallholder systems will be required therefore sustainable intensification remains an important aspect of climate change adaptation although we showed that shade management consists of an important adaptation strategy increased knowledge on adequate selection and management of shade tree species will be required to maximize complementarity in the use of resources particularly water this will also require more insights into the impact of shade trees on

25328,the response of coffee coffea arabica l agronomical performance to changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration co2 is uncertain improving our understanding of potential responses of the coffee plant to these changes while taking into consideration agricultural management is required for identifying best bet adaptation strategies a mechanistic crop modelling approach enables the inclusion of a wide range of prior knowledge and an evaluation of assumptions we adapt a model by connecting it to spatially variable soil and climate data by which we are able to calculate yield of rain fed coffee on a daily time step the model takes account of variation in microclimate and water use as influenced by shade trees the approach is exemplified at two east african sites with distinctly different climates mt elgon uganda and mt kilimanjaro tanzania using a global sensitivity analysis for evaluation of model behavior and prior parameter uncertainty assessment we use the climate scenario driven by the hadley global environment model 2 earth system representative for the year 2050 to discuss potential responses of the coffee plant to interactions of elevated co2 temperature and water availability we subsequently explore the potential for adaptation to this scenario through shade management the results indicate that under current climatic conditions optimal shade cover at low elevations 1000 m a s l is 50 provided soil water storage capacity is sufficient enabling a 13 5 increase in coffee yield compared to unshaded systems coffee plants are expected to be severely impacted ranging from 18 to 32 coffee yield reductions at low elevations by increased temperature 2 5 c and drought stress when no elevated co2 is assumed water competition between coffee and shade trees are projected to be a severe limitation in the future requiring careful selection of appropriate shade tree species or the adoption of other technologies like conservation measures or irrigation the co2 fertilization effect could potentially mitigate the negative effect of temperature increase and drought stress up to 13 21 depending on site conditions and will increase yield at higher altitudes high uncertainty remains regarding impacts of climate change on flowering the presented model allows for estimating the optimal shade level along environmental gradients now and in the future overall it shows that shade proves to be an important adaptation strategy but this requires improved understanding regarding site specific management and selection of tree species moreover we do not yet include climate change uncertainty keywords coffea arabica l agroforestry system spatial decision support adaptation to climate change parameter uncertainty 1 introduction coffee is cultivated in over 70 countries throughout the tropics with approximately 60 of the production being coffea arabica l arabica coffee and 40 being coffea canephora pierre ex froehner syn coffea robusta robusta coffee fao 2015 over 70 of the world s coffee is produced by smallholders managing less than 10 ha of land fridell 2014 climate change is expected to have substantial impacts on suitable areas for coffee c arabica cultivation bunn et al 2015a ovalle rivera et al 2015 magrach and ghazoul 2015 pests and diseases pressure jaramillo et al 2011 magrach and ghazoul 2015 and genetic resources davis et al 2012 thereby likely changing the agro ecological zones most suitable for coffee production bunn et al 2015b agroforestry systems can both contribute to climate change mitigation while potentially enabling adaptation to climatic changes matocha et al 2012 mbow et al 2014 vaast et al 2016 due to the perennial nature of coffee with an economic lifespan typically up to 30 years wintgens 2004 and the long time required for agroforestry trees to grow to maturity decisions regarding adaptation to climate change are challenging therefore there is an urgent need for decision support consisting of accurate estimates of climatic suitability for coffee production and the influence of modified microclimate by shade trees including competition effects luedeling et al 2014 where long historical records of coffee performance weather and soil conditions are available this is a relatively easy task but the majority of coffee growing areas lack such data luedeling et al 2014 statistical species distribution modelling approaches schroth et al 2009 bunn et al 2015a magrach and ghazoul 2015 or agro climatic indices lane and jarvis 2007 have instead been used these methods are suitable for characterizing broad agro ecological zones bunn et al 2015b and generating hypotheses on the suitable climatic conditions for coffee but they lack a mechanistic process representation required to predict crop response outside the current growing domain including the carbon fertilization effect cfe induced by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration co2 furthermore while the above studies have analyzed geographical shifts in coffee suitability indicating a decrease of available area in the future they did neither include phenotypic responses of the coffee plant nicotra et al 2010 nor management practices allowing for adaptation to climate change such as shade management irrigation or changes in coffee genotypes vaast et al 2016 mechanistic crop models are believed to be more appropriate in generating realistic simulations of plant soil climate interactions moreover they facilitate learning through hypothesis testing and identification of missing knowledge sinclair and seligman 1996 boote et al 2010 which enables guidance for management action harfoot et al 2014 however applying such models without sufficient data for calibration results in large uncertainties of model predictions next to existing uncertainties in model structure beven 2008 luedeling et al 2016 the latter is often not identifiable by comparing model outputs with observations alone as many models can be fitted to the same data leading to the problem of equifinality beven and freer 2001 model comparison and critical reflection of assumptions is considered more appropriate de kauwe et al 2014 most of the parameters in a crop model are considered genetic coefficients and do not have to be adjusted when applied at different sites yin et al 2004 yet some parameters encompass limited process understanding and require calibration when the model is applied to different sites these include parameters related to the induction of flowering in coffee van oijen et al 2010b rodriguez et al 2011 another aspect related to parameter values is phenotypic plasticity i e changes in morphological chemical and physical characteristics of a plant in response to the environment if phenotypic plasticity is explicitly accounted for there is no need to adapt parameters in different environmental conditions yin 2013 obviously this is only possible when the required knowledge is available to adequately represent these processes considerable understanding is available on phenotypic responses of coffee to water poorter and nagel 2000 carr 2012 cavatte et al 2012 cannavo et al 2011 and light availabilities matos et al 2009 charbonnier et al 2013 martins et al 2014a but uncertainty is much greater with regard to phenotypic plasticity to atmospheric co2 variation yin 2013 with only few experimental studies regarding coffee so far martins et al 2014c ghini et al 2015 damatta et al 2016 other difficulties in exploring possible impacts of climate change on crop production are related to modelling climate extremes and its impacts thornton et al 2014 depending on the used global climate model gcm and the methods for downscaling the output to scales relevant for agriculture the projected changes in climate may only represent mean changes in temperature and precipitation and not adequately represent changing climate variability notably temperature and precipitation extremes müller et al 2011 ramirez villegas et al 2013 in addition to uncertainty in boundary conditions there is also uncertainty in the actual effects of such extremes on the plant reyer et al 2013 the goal of this study is to use a mechanistic coffee model which integrates current knowledge on coffee ecophysiology to evaluate potential impacts of climate change in various agro ecological settings and agricultural managements by making use of statistical approaches to explore the plausible parameter space we identify optimal current and future management practices of a wide range of potential genotypes the objectives of this paper are to 1 present the proposed coffee model 2 assess model outcome in time and space using mean literature derived parameter values 3 identify model behavior through global sensitivity analysis and 4 evaluate how robust the predicted change is despite parameter uncertainty conditioned by different climate scenarios we used two contrasting sites of east africa as case study areas namely the wet slopes of mount elgon uganda vs the drier slopes of mount kilimanjaro tanzania 2 material and methods 2 1 coffee model the original version of the coffee agroforestry model caf2007 was described by van oijen et al 2010b and extended by ovalle rivera 2014 this study adapts the caf2014 model for use as a spatially contextualized decision support tool spcaf this model was chosen as it is specifically designed to deal with coffee agroforestry systems and includes a mechanistic light use efficiency approach that deals with the interaction between temperature and co2 in comparison to caf2014 we assume no nutrient limitations as we intend to isolate the impact of climate on coffee and therefore focus on yield response to water i e water limited yield according to van ittersum et al 2013 temperature and atmospheric co2 levels consequently coffee yield is expressed exclusively as a function of climate and soil water availability excluding nutrient competition pest and disease alterations or allelopathic properties of shade trees on understory coffee tree shading is simplified to a canopy that provides shade and competes for water through evapotranspiration thus the objective is not to explicitly model a specific shade tree species but rather allow for exploration of the continuity between no shade and heavy shade and its effects on microclimate and water competition the model calculates water limited coffee yield at a daily time step and is implemented in r statistics r core team 2014 in the following sections all key processes and model assumptions are presented an overview of the model is illustrated in fig 1 2 1 1 coffee growth under optimal water supply canopy photosynthesis is modelled using a mechanistic light use efficiency lue approach based on the leaf photosynthesis model of farquhar et al 1980 and scaled up to canopy photosynthesis charles edwards 1982 as described in detail by van oijen et al 2004 this formula for lue is calculated on a daily basis and depends on temperature atmospheric co2 concentration light intensity and the rubisco content of upper leaves instead of modelling photosynthesis and respiration separately the lue approach assumes a constant ratio of daily rates of respiration and photosynthesis which has been explained experimentally e g gifford 1995 2003 and theoretically van oijen et al 2010c the parameters have been adjusted to very low and high light intensity yielding highest values for lue at low intensity van oijen et al 2010b this allows consistency with observations as reported by franck and vaast 2009 cavatte et al 2012 and charbonnier et al 2017 for arabica coffee moreover by expressing the lue approach based on the farquhar et al 1980 biochemical model the interaction between temperature and elevated atmospheric co2 is represented yin 2013 under favorable conditions growth rate is proportional to the amount of light intercepted by the canopy monteith 1977 therefore lue is multiplied with daily intercepted solar radiation calculated as an exponential function of leaf area index lai and a constant light extinction coefficient according to beer s law for attenuation monsi and saeki 1953 water stress decreases lue proportionally via the ratio of actual to potential transpiration rate kropff and van laar 1993 the lue of c arabica has been shown to range between 0 23 0 8 g mj 1 bote et al 2016a charbonnier et al 2017 it has also been shown that lue can increase by 50 under shade and thereby largely compensate for a reduction in 60 photosynthetically active radiation par leading to almost equal net primary productivity charbonnier et al 2017 therefore using the lue approach appears to be particularly appropriate for summarizing differences in phenotypic plasticity to shade cavatte et al 2012 charbonnier et al 2017 bote et al 2016a this plasticity is reflected by several physiological and morphological adjustments firstly plants in low light conditions allocate more nitrogen to light harvesting rather than carbon assimilating enzymes cavatte et al 2012 poorter et al 2014 although coffee was found to have a robust photosynthetic machinery even in low light that allows to maximize variable light availability by sunflecks martins et al 2013 secondly in high light an increased investment in photoprotective mechanisms was observed matos et al 2009 thirdly reduced vpd under shade improves stomatal and mesophyll conductance over the day franck and vaast 2009 martins et al 2014b which is particularly important as coffee photosynthesis is mainly limited by diffusive rather than biochemical limitations damatta et al 2007 chaves et al 2008 franck and vaast 2009 martins et al 2014b fourthly increases in specific leaf area martins et al 2014b and diffuse light availability charbonnier et al 2013 under shade might further increase fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation compared to unshaded systems the fraction of carbon c allocated to the different plant organs depends on phenological stage vegetative growth bean maturation and is modulated by water availability root c sink strength increases with increasing water stress to the detriment of other plant organs according to the functional equilibrium theory brouwer 1983 high fruit load can come at the expense of i vegetative growth leading to die back vaast et al 2005 in extreme cases and ii the development of fruiting nodes and hence lower sink strength of fruits in the following year vaast et al 2005 bote and jan 2016 phenology is based on thermal time degree days and flowering is induced by a threshold amount of rainfall after the dry season damatta et al 2007 carr 2012 the intensity of flowering is a function of monthly light intensity around flowering cannell 1985 franck vaast 2009 leaf senescence varies depending on the degree of water stress while roots were set with a constant lifespan leaf growth is calculated as the product of leaf biomass and specific leaf area the latter is decreased by water stress 2 1 2 soil water balance and water stress a simple one layer soil water balance is used to calculate the amount of water in the root zone whereby water is added by precipitation and lost through interception transpiration evaporation runoff and drainage van keulen 1986 van oijen et al 2010b runoff is calculated as the amount of water lost through surface flow which is a function of rainfall interception by vegetation cover modelled by the system s leaf area index soil water holding capacity and slope drainage is calculated as the remaining water not used by evapotranspiration interception by vegetation or loss through runoff which is not retained by the soil van oijen et al 2010b no groundwater influence is assumed potential transpiration depends on temperature solar radiation vapor pressure and lai and is calculated with the penman equation penman 1948 according to van oijen and leffelaar 2008 actual transpiration rate decreases below the potential rate when soil water content is below a critical value which is lower than field capacity by an amount that depends inversely on atmospheric evaporative demand driessen 1986 van oijen et al 2010b this critical plant available soil water content additionally depends on the sensitivity of the coffee cultivar to drought waterlogging can hamper crop growth when soil water content exceeds a given threshold evapo transpiration demand is partly covered by daily rainfall interception through foliage up to a maximum level which is proportional to lai van oijen et al 2010b siles et al 2010 2 1 3 shade light transmission microclimate buffering and water competition light transmission through shade tree canopy is modelled with beer s law using the lai of the shade tree canopy and an extinction coefficient reflecting different degrees of light transmission and assuming a horizontally homogeneous canopy kropff and van laar 1993 zuidema et al 2005 these two variables allow for varying light transmission through shade tree canopy between 0 and 100 in reality the shade tree canopy in agroforestry systems is never homogeneous and includes multiple layers and species as well as canopy gaps charbonnier et al 2013 showed that the assumption of a homogeneous canopy is nevertheless valid at plot scale at least under their studied conditions at a humid site in costa rica with high planting density of dwarf caturra variety and low shade tree density with crown projections covering 16 of the farm although it is difficult to assume their findings are valid under other environmental and shade management conditions it is an important indication that plot level modelling might be sufficiently approximated with this approach therefore it provides an appropriate reference for comparing the effects of climate and shade on coffee conceptually non shaded and homogeneous shade canopy constitute reference points for the extreme shade canopy types whereby the lai and light extinction coefficient represent different shade tree compositions changes in coffee leaf functional traits e g sla and leaf nitrogen concentration between management systems of different vegetation structures i e various shade tree compositions to no shade is mainly related to light availability rather than shade tree species composition gagliardi et al 2015 microclimate modification by shade is reflected as a decrease of daily average temperature proportional to the fraction of radiation intercepted by the shade trees van oijen et al 2010b mean daily temperature decreases according to shade level down to a given maximum e g 4 c beer et al 1998 water competition starts with rain interception of shade trees which is proportional to lai up to a specified threshold siles et al 2010 tree transpiration was modelled as for coffee with the penman equation penman 1948 shade trees transpire water from the same soil water layer as used by coffee plants hence competition of water occurs when transpiration demands of coffee and shade trees together drive the soil water content below the critical soil water threshold when actual transpiration rate declines below potential rate 2 2 climate and soil data parameters of the soil water balance model are retrieved from the gridded functional soil information dataset on root zone plant available water holding capacity of the sub sahara african soil afsis leenaars et al 2015 terrain slope is calculated with the terrain function from the raster package hijmans 2015 based on the srtm 90 m digital elevation model daily weather data is generated from the worldclim database hijmans et al 2005 using the marksim weather generator jones and thornton 2000 on a 30 s resolution approximately 1 km near the equator for current interpolation of observed data representative of 1950 2000 and future climatic conditions downscaled gcm data using the delta method ramirez villegas and jarvis 2010 and representative of the 2040 2069 time slice since the objective of this study is to present the model and its behavior instead of a climate change impact assessment we chose only one gcm to exemplify model capability we focus the study on possible responses of the coffee plant with consideration of its management to a changing climate rather than assessing uncertainty in climate change predictions the hadley global environment model 2 earth system hadgem2 es jones et al 2011 from the ipcc 5th assessment report ipcc 2013 using the representative concentration pathway 6 0 van vuuren et al 2011 was chosen for illustration purposes hadgem2 es has been identified as one of the best performing gcms e g brands et al 2013 perez et al 2014 and is one of the most commonly used vapor pressure is estimated from temperature assuming dew point is equal to minimum temperature as shown by wang et al 2004 solar radiation is estimated with marksim using the model of donatelli and campbell 1997 cit in jones and thornton 2000 and adjusted to topography with the slopefactor function of the ecohydrology package of r fuka et al 2014 because arabica coffee is mainly cultivated on the slopes of mountain ranges spatial resolution should not be too low in order to account for the heterogeneity arising through complex topography to account for the stochasticity of the marksim weather generator 100 replicates of yearly weather data are simulated for each pixel to account for the diversity of possible weather constellations that monthly mean values could be made up of we calculated four 25 year growth periods per site and then calculated the mean annual yield values of the 100 year simulations 2 3 study sites two study sites of east africa were chosen with distinctly different climates fig 2 and table s1 an altitudinal transect 1000 2200 m a s l was selected along the slopes of mt elgon uganda with hot and dry climate at low altitudes and cool and wet climate at high altitudes on the other hand mt kilimanjaro tanzania was chosen as a prominent coffee growing region with severe drought issues and a high predicted climate change impact craparo et al 2015 the precipitation values of the worldclim data for mt kilimanjaro above 1500 m a s l were corrected with the insights gained from weather monitoring along the altitudinal transect as recently published by appelhans et al 2016 fig 4 at the two study sites the hadgem2 es estimates a slightly higher temperature increase and a lower change in annual rainfall compared to four other commonly used gcms table s2 therefore the hadgem2 es represents a warmer and drier climate with respect to the other evaluated gcms the soils on the slopes of mt elgon and mt kilimanjaro are predominantly nitisols wrb for soil classification iuss working group 2015 developed on basaltic outflows water holding capacity is highly heterogeneous due to the complex topography and is highest at mid altitude fig s1 the selected areas have an extension of 1739 km2 on mt elgon and 1430 km2 on mt kilimanjaro and are important coffee production areas with the majority of households growing coffee the coffee is often intercropped with banana musa spp and a diversity of shade trees with cordia africana albizia schimperiana and ficus mucosa being the most frequent ones hemp 2006 van der wolf et al 2016 2 4 experimental design the full continuum of light and water competition was modelled to calculate optimal shade level per pixel for maximum coffee yield we varied the shade tree leaf area index between 0 and 3 and the shade tree light extinction coefficient between 0 4 and 0 8 yielding shade levels between 0 and 90 the continuum of water competition was represented by the two extremes of full potential and no water competition full potential water competition between coffee and shade trees is assumed due to presence of coffee and tree roots in the same single and homogeneous soil layer and with no preferential access of coffee roots to soil water for the sensitivity and uncertainty analyses on the other hand we did not use the full continuum of light and water competition due to high computation demand we compared non shaded systems with systems covered by 50 shade shade tree leaf area index 1 and shade tree light extinction coefficient 0 7 assuming full water competition climate scenarios consisted of current climatic conditions referring to 1950 2000 according to worldclim and denoted as year 2000 and future climate representative of the 2040 2069 time slice in the following referred to 2050 without elevated atmospheric co2 future a and with elevated atmospheric co2 future b atmospheric co2 concentrations for current and future a scenarios were 380 ppm and 478 ppm for future b scenario according to the ipcc representative concentration pathways rcp 6 0 van vuuren et al 2011 for the future b scenario we assumed neither photosynthetic downregulation nor changes in carbon allocation to represent the maximum possible co2 fertilization effect cfe the future a scenario represents the temperature effect of climate change and the difference between future b and future a represents the uncertainty in cfe maximum cfe reflects increased photosynthesis and water use efficiency assuming no phenotypic responses to elevated co2 the uncertainty range therefore reflects possible physiological and or morphological changes as a response to elevated co2 not accounted for by the model for the sensitivity analysis and prior i e uncalibrated uncertainty assessment we chose two locations each on mt elgon and mt kilimanjaro one at low altitude 1097 and 1133 m a s l respectively and a second one at high altitude 1863 and 1629 m a s l respectively 2 5 evaluation 2 5 1 parameter ranges and assumptions parameter ranges were selected as marginally uniform distributions based on published studies as presented by van oijen et al 2010a and from more recent literature see table s3 and s5 it is important to differentiate between parameter values that can be considered as generally valid for all arabica coffee species and parameter values that are genotype specific boote et al 2003 genotype specific parameters include carbon allocation parameters transpiration coefficient light extinction coefficient leaf rubisco content time between seedling planting and reproductive phase specific leaf area and parameters of plant organ senescence differences between traditional low yielding and improved high yielding genotypes can be largely explained by differences in carbon allocation patterns whereby the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus remained almost the same génard et al 2008 ericsson et al 1996 for example the difference at juvenile stage between the coffee cultivars coffea arabica cv caturra catuai and catimor was mainly related to morphological variables i e height leaf area internode number root to shoot ratio while physiological variables i e leaf net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance intercellular co2 and intrinsic water use efficiency were not significantly different zhang et al 2017 2 5 2 sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis was performed using the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast of saltelli et al 1999 the efast estimates the contribution of individual input factors to output variance and evaluates the variability of the output for the entire uncertainty domains of the parameters additionally it addresses higher order interaction between input factors the method makes use of a sampling approach following a systematic search trajectory designed to explore the parameter space via a transformation function a first order sensitivity and a total effect sensitivity index are computed from the generated trajectories using a spectral decomposition of the model output variability the total output variance is decomposed to estimate the influence of individual parameters by its main effects and the interactions with other parameters this method was shown to be more efficient than sobol s method sobol 1993 which uses a monte carlo approach to estimate first and total sensitivity indices makowski et al 2006 and has been shown to be more robust than several other global sensitivity methods chan et al 1997 saltelli and bolado 1998 furthermore computational demand is significantly lower with efast and interaction effects among parameters are computed which is not the case with sobol s algorithm we used the sensitivity r package by pujol et al 2015 conversion of the sensitivity indices was found for a sample size of factor 1000 resulting in 26 000 model runs with 26 parameters i e 26 000 parameter vectors were sampled and run with the model per climate and management scenario 2 6 prior parameter uncertainty analysis as the exact parameter values are unknown we evaluate how the different shade management and climate scenarios impact on the different parameter sets within the range of parameter uncertainty this approach is called forward uncertainty analysis beven 2008 as the outputs depend entirely on the prior assumptions of the parameters which are propagated forward through the model predictions to assess forward parameter uncertainty we use the parameter vectors as sampled with the efast method the uncertainty is exemplified for a hypothetical but realistic i e derived from existing literature coffee arabica genotype therefore we set the light extinction coefficient and rubisco content in leaves to 0 65 m2 m 2 and 0 54 g m 2 respectively the uncertain parameters are given in table s4 the soil parameters representing the fraction of water content at field capacity air dryness wilting point and water saturation have been set to the values of the respective pixels of the afsis database leenaars et al 2015 3 results 3 1 model runs with mean parameter values 3 1 1 mount elgon on mt elgon the high altitude is currently the most suitable area for coffee production with a peak at 1780 m a s l fig 3 due to the optimal mean annual temperature 19 3 c annual precipitation 1654 mm high cloud cover and hence low daily mean solar radiation 19 7 mj m 2 d 1 coffee is not dependent on shade for buffering microclimate shade becomes beneficial from 1500 m a s l on downwards whereby the benefit increases as altitude decreases maximum yield gain due to optimal shade management assuming full potential water competition is 11 for current and 13 and 10 for future a and b respectively at low altitude shade up to 50 increases coffee yield despite the conservative assumption of non preferential access of coffee roots to soil water and hence full potential water competition between coffee and shade trees yet some areas at low altitudes have soils with low water holding capacity resulting in increased competition for water between coffee and shade trees in the scenario of future climate 2050 as predicted by the hadgem2 es without considering elevated atmospheric co2 coffee yield is negatively affected up to 2000 m a s l with a maximum decrease of 44 on poor soils at low altitude mean 25 while at altitudes higher than 2000 m a s l yield is increased due to predicted higher temperatures optimal coffee suitability increases up to 2200 m a s l equaling an altitudinal shift of 400 m this drastically reduces the suitable area for coffee cultivation as exemplified by a comparison of maps on current and future a scenarios fig 3 the increased yield in the future limited to the highest altitudes is additionally attributed to a foreseen precipitation increase 100 300 mm yr 1 however this area coincides with the protected afromontane forest starting at around 2200 m a s l hence agricultural expansion to these higher altitudes is not permitted shade as an adaptation strategy allows to adapt currently non shaded systems in the future but only if coffee is associated with tree species not competitive but rather complementary in terms of water use unless water competition is adequately dealt with the benefit of modified microclimate by shade trees will not be able to sustain the current yield level assuming no phenotypic plasticity as a response to elevated co2 the cfe cancels the negative effect of high temperature at low and mid altitudes on mt elgon while at high altitude yield is increased 10 15 3 1 2 mount kilimanjaro on the slopes of mt kilimanjaro the highest yield of rain fed coffee is between 1600 and 1800 m a s l fig 4 shade improves coffee yield at lower altitudes 1600 m a s l only if non water competitive shade tree species are used assuming full potential water competition shade is beneficial solely up to 1370 m a s l due to the dry climate reducing the net benefit of shade trees furthermore the temperature effect of predicted climate change according to the hadgem2 es without considering elevated co2 decreases yield up to 1730 m a s l higher evaporative demand and hence water stress will be a serious problem and the issue of water competition between coffee and shade trees even more critical adapting coffee systems to this foreseen climate will require substantial knowledge on shade tree selection and management elevated co2 might mitigate the negative effects of predicted climate change at low altitude if no physiological and or morphological acclimation processes take place at mid altitude future elevated co2 conditions will not be able to maintain the same yield levels as under current conditions maximum yield gain with optimal shade management assuming full potential water competition is 12 for current and 18 and 17 for future a and b respectively 3 2 prior parameter uncertainty prior parameter uncertainty analysis provides insights on the qualitative changes to be expected using different parameter sets when evaluating different shade management and climate scenarios fig 5 the mean responses of the impact of different management practices no shade vs shaded systems at current and future with cfe vs no cfe climatic conditions over a longer time period give a clear picture of the climate signal incorporating shade trees with 50 canopy cover at low altitude 1092 m a s l on mt elgon benefits coffee yield on average by 13 5 over a 25 year growth period despite high parameter uncertainty fig 5 this shade level also constitutes the optimal shade level for highest coffee yield fig 6 a few parameter sets reveal no change or even a yield decrease under shaded conditions this occurs under conditions of combined low leaf sink strength low maximum leaf life span and short thermal time requirement for bean maturation such a parameter constellation is unlikely present in a real genotype therefore making this scenario rather unrealistic yet to improve our model understanding it is still helpful to identify such conditions in these parameter constellations lai is too small to adapt to the limited light availability under shade which outweighs the benefits of improved microclimate furthermore the short thermal time requirement for bean maturation results in an increased photo assimilate demand by berries that cannot be provided by the low leaf area and low light availability at high altitudes on the other hand shade with 50 canopy cover is not beneficial for coffee yield compared to unshaded systems fig 5 due to the already low temperature high humidity associated to high annual rainfall and low solar radiation due to high cloud cover none of the evaluated parameter constellations allow for improved yield under shade at high altitude unshaded coffee outperforms shaded coffee in terms of coffee yield at current climatic conditions at high altitude fig 6 in a future climate as projected by the hadgem2 es coffee yield is hampered by increased temperature and drought stress at low altitude 18 if no elevated atmospheric co2 concentration is assumed fig 5 for most parameter constellations this negative impact on yield can be mitigated if shade is included allowing to maintain current yield in the future a shade level of 50 continues to provide the highest net benefit resulting in highest yield fig 6 the shade effect for different parameter constellations has been described above in a future scenario with elevated atmospheric co2 reaching 478 ppm the negative impact of increased temperature and drought stress is mitigated fig 5 allowing to maintain current yield in the future even without shade this is assuming neither a downregulation in photosynthesis nor changes in carbon allocation as a response to elevated co2 as shown in fig 5 and 6 optimizing shade management under these conditions results in increased yield compared to current unshaded systems 18 at high altitude by contrast increased temperatures will benefit coffee yield in both scenarios no with elevated co2 shade with 50 canopy cover at these altitudes will not be able to outperform unshaded systems either today or in the future if the sole objective is to maximize coffee yield fig 5 but shade up to 18 does not lead to a yield reduction fig 6 on mt kilimanjaro tanzania shade also improves coffee yield at low altitude 24 but not at high altitude compared to mt elgon future predicted climate change has a more negative effect in both scenarios without 32 and with elevated co2 18 in unshaded conditions but yield can be improved by shading to 2 and 16 in scenarios without and with elevated co2 respectively although shading coffee at high altitude reduces potential yield at current climatic conditions it buffers coffee systems against future climate scenarios and helps maintain yield no elevated co2 or even increases yield with elevated co2 3 3 parameter sensitivity the most sensitive parameters are those related to soil water availability i e amount of water available for coffee and trees between field capacity and wilting point light interception light extinction coefficient photosynthesis rubisco content in leaves and carbon allocation i e sink strength for leaves and storage organs fig 7 these parameters need to be well known or appropriately estimated to reduce uncertainty the remaining parameters do not significantly influence output variance and hence can be set as constant values allowing for model simplification the difference in parameter sensitivity to changes in environment uganda vs tanzania low vs high altitude is less than to shade level shade reduces the energy input reaching the soil and the coffee plants and therefore reduces water use by coffee transpiration and to a lesser extent soil evaporation yet adding transpiration of the shade trees hence assuming full potential water competition all year around leads to high sensitivity of soil parameters the soil water budget of coffee plants is less important under shaded conditions when there is no water competition the strong influence of soil hydraulic parameters parameters related to field capacity and wilting point highlights the need for using high quality soil data as inputs as water becomes less limiting parameters related to light interception canopy photosynthesis and carbon allocation become more important the c sink strength of roots gains importance in water limited conditions when soil hydraulic parameters are excluded of the sensitivity analysis data not shown while sink strengths of leaves and berries are relatively more important in light limited conditions as shown in fig 7 the general pattern of model parameter sensitivity between mt elgon and mt kilimanjaro is consistent despite the differences in climatic conditions the main difference is the higher sensitivity of parameters related to thermal time namely base temperature for maturation tmatb and thermal time to maturation tmatt particularly in unshaded systems located at low altitude the soil water balance parameters are provided as input by the afsis database whereby the uncertainty of this database is not considered in this study yet as the model is very sensitive to soil hydraulic parameters accurate estimates are required to reduce uncertainty for calibration purposes it is important to know which parameters are critical when removing them from the analysis when excluding the soil water balance parameters the sensitive parameters 0 1 are in descending order carbon sink strength of leaves sinkl rubisco content of upper leaves rubisc sink strength for storage organs sinkpmax light extinction coefficient kext and carbon sink strength of roots sinkr 4 discussion we presented a model that allows to taking into account spatially explicit soil and climate characteristics to explore management options for coffee systems via shade tree association one gcm was used as the main purpose of this study is the presentation of the model features rather than a full climate change impact assessment nonetheless consistent with earlier studies we found negative impacts of increased temperature at low altitude while high altitude areas should gain in terms of yield potential bunn et al 2015a magrach and ghazoul 2015 our model suggests that the cfe could potentially mitigate the negative effects of increased temperature to a large extent hence suggesting that previous studies might have overestimated the negative impact of climate change additionally one of the most salient features of the present model is to calculate the optimal shade level along environmental gradients now and in the future according to different climate scenarios below we discuss differences among coffee genotypes the effect of shade and co2 fertilization the importance of soil water availability the interaction between temperature and co2 effect as well as implications for smallholders on mt elgon and mt kilimanjaro and ultimately model improvements 4 1 genotypic variation data availability for calibration purposes is a major constraint explicitly analyzing the uncertainty range in parameters is therefore of great importance beven 2008 due to the lack of certainty concerning which parameter sets best simulate the actual genotypes and planting densities currently cultivated at the sites of interest we did our simulations based on the entire range of parameter values by sampling the plausible parameter space despite the uncertainty in the absolute change induced by the assessed scenarios compared to current non shaded systems fig 5 and 6 the model allows for identifying the direction of change in coffee yield reyer et al 2016 it further exemplifies the potential of improved genotypes in the context of climate change adaptation bertrand et al 2016 the maps in figs 3 and 4 represent only one general arabica genotype at a fixed planting density resulting in relatively low observed water limited yield up to 2 5 t ha the use of modern high yielding dwarf varieties e g catimor derived varieties planted at high density 4000 5000 plants ha as commonly found on coffee plantations in brazil and colombia for example can reach yield levels over 3 t ha van der vossen 2005 damatta et al 2007 different coffee varieties exhibit different yield potentials and responses to environmental stresses differences in morphological traits have been identified to be the main determinants of yield differences and drought tolerance among arabica cultivars tausend et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 open questions remain regarding genotypic differences in temperature tolerance and response to elevated co2 furthermore hybrid varieties between arabica robusta and hybrids of timor have been developed mainly for pest and or disease resistance bertrand et al 2016 herrera and lambot 2017 that could potentially also benefit of robusta s tolerance to higher temperature to analyze this data of different varieties on the physiological particularly stomatal conductance and morphological characteristics are required the sensitivity analysis fig 7 highlights that plant architecture light extinction coefficient plays an important role in plant performance under shaded or non shaded conditions traditional varieties which have a less dense canopy unigarro et al 2016 are usually better adapted to shade while modern dwarf varieties with high self shading often grow well without shade montagnon et al 2012 genotypic differences regarding responses to light availability are of great interest for using agroforestry systems as adaptation strategy bertrand et al 2016 4 2 effect of shade the model allows for estimating the optimal shade level along environmental gradients now and in changing future climates in areas with optimal water supply elevated temperatures and high solar radiation a range of shade tree species can be used with beneficial effects for coffee yield in these areas trees with high timber value or fast growing ones can substantially improve farmers livelihoods schaller et al 2003 vaast et al 2008 vaast et al 2015 where water is limiting shade trees need to be selected with high root niche differentiation cannavo et al 2011 padovan et al 2015 and non competing phenology the latter also provides options to optimize light availability beer et al 1998 knowledge of appropriate selection of shade tree species van der wolf et al 2016 and their management related to timing and amount of pruning is thus required beer et al 1998 it is important to further consider the economic impact of agroforestry systems at locations where shade does not decrease coffee yield or when such decreases are relatively small increased farm profitability and revenue diversification can be achieved by farmers due to the co production of other agroforestry products such as fruits firewood and timber rice 2011 vaast et al 2015 we showed that the model responds well to decreasing light availability by increasing the sensitivity of parameters relevant to light interception fig 7 soil hydraulic parameters had a strong effect on yield which emphasizes the importance of sound soil input data different soil types will therefore have an important influence on yield output which need to be accounted for in addition to changes in climate variables we suggest the use of recently established spatial databases on root zone plant available water holding capacity leenaars et al 2015 but uncertainties in these data should be taken into account in future studies these soil types in combination with precipitation regime and root distribution of shade tree species will largely determine the risk for water competition or potential for complementarity between coffee and intercrops shade trees van kanten and vaast 2006 cannavo et al 2011 padovan et al 2015 in this study light and water competitions were estimated conservatively assuming homogeneous shade cover and full potential water competition within a single soil layer nevertheless the selected approach allows the calculation of the biophysical determinants of successful agroforestry systems sanchez 1995 at the critical endpoints of the continuum of different degrees of light and water competition shade tree species differ substantially in the way they intercept light and use water based on their canopy root architecture and phenology e g deciduous vs evergreen trees luedeling et al 2016 on the other hand the model does not account for the effect of shade and climate change on pests and diseases shade can either have beneficial or negative effects on pests and diseases depending on environmental context jonsson et al 2015 liebig et al 2016 which additionally requires careful consideration for shade tree management staver et al 2001 4 3 effect of co2 fertilization we identified that an increase in co2 might substantially mitigate some of the negative impacts caused by climate change although the magnitude of that mitigation effect is not clear due to possible responses in phenotypic plasticity aspinwall et al 2015 to account for this uncertainty in cfe we modelled zero effect modelled by omitting an increase in co2 in the future and the effect resulting when no phenotypic plasticity is assumed as a response to elevated co2 from 380 ppm to 478 ppm the model indicates an averaged maximum effect on coffee yield between 13 5 21 fig 5 with higher effect at the more humid mt elgon site compared to the drier mt kilimanjaro site although water use efficiency generally increases due to elevated co2 at an instantaneous time scale the duration of stomatal opening at longer time scales is increased at more humid sites which can lead to higher overall benefit of co2 our modelled values agree well with the average response of 13 found in free air co2 enrichment experiments face across a range of c3 crops long et al 2006 and a recent one conducted on coffee in brazil resulting in a yield increase of 12 0 14 6 depending on genotype due to increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations from 390 ppm to 550 ppm over a two year period without increasing ambient temperature ghini et al 2015 damatta et al 2016 this yield increase was even larger approx 40 in the third year leading to a mean increase of 28 raquel ghini personal communication this high cfe found in this face experiment is due to the absence of downregulation in photosynthetic capacity or acclimation of stomatal conductance there was no decrease in leaf nitrogen content and no alteration in leaf rubisco content differences between the two evaluated genotypes in their responses to elevated co2 were found suggesting some uncertainties on how other common arabica varieties might respond anyway this general lack of phenotypic plasticity in response to elevated co2 is exceptional when compared to many other c3 plants ainsworth and long 2005 and suggests that arabica coffee benefits comparatively well from cfe this appears to be due to the fact that coffee photosynthesis is highly limited by diffusional rather than biochemical limitations martins et al 2014b research on other c3 plants with similar diffusional limitations have also indicated above average benefit of cfe niinemets et al 2011 flexas et al 2014 additionally as a perennial woody species it has a larger carbon sink capacity compared to annual crops ainsworth long 2005 higher water use efficiency is achieved by increasing net photosynthesis at maintained stomatal and mesophyll conductance damatta et al 2016 maintaining stomatal conductance is beneficial as a reduction might result in an increased leaf temperature via its effects on leaf energy balance bernacchi et al 2007 which could exacerbate the warming induced by climate change 4 4 interaction between temperature and co2 effect to what extent elevated co2 might mitigate increased temperature is unclear and might be different for different genotypes and dependent on the accompanying change in air humidity and soil water availability growth chamber studies have found increased tolerance of coffee to supra optimal temperature at elevated co2 mainly due to increased investment into protective measures martins et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2016 the degree of this increased tolerance will depend on the temperature and precipitation induced changes in soil moisture and vpd and the vigor of the coffee plant therefore hot and humid areas are expected to benefit more from the interaction between elevated co2 and supra optimal temperature compared to areas that will become hot and dry this explains why our model implies that elevated co2 does not allow to maintain current yield on mt kilimanjaro while on mt elgon it might cancel out the negative effect of increased mean temperature irrigation practices are widespread in the kilimanjaro area hemp 2006 and the last two decades 1990 2010 have been identified as quite dry compared to average climate with reductions in precipitations during the main growing season otte et al 2016 further drying is projected by the hadgem2 es due to decreased rainfall in combination with higher evaporative demand as a result of higher temperatures particularly during bean filling this likely results in increased c demand for maintenance and respiration as well as for bean filling with simultaneous decrease in photosynthesis due to increased vpd and drought stress importantly we have to be aware that there remain high uncertainties on how the interactions between warming and elevated co2 will impact flowering bean maturation and cup quality for example there are indications that flowering might be severely reduced under increased temperature drinnan and menzel 1995 craparo et al 2015 which is currently not included in the model due to limited process knowledge pest and disease pressure will additionally change and likely continue to constitute a primary production constraint to coffee cultivation for which we have only limited information at present jaramillo et al 2011 ghini et al 2015 jonsson et al 2015 4 5 what does the co2 effect mean for smallholder farmers on mt elgon and mt kilimanjaro the vast majority of farmers on mt elgon and mt kilimanjaro are smallholders who face several constraints to access adequate nutrient and pest and disease management options leading to coffee systems with very low yield wang et al 2015 craparo et al 2015 liebig et al 2016 therefore it is unlikely that they will benefit of the cfe unless appropriate actions to promote climate smart agricultural management are taken vaast et al 2016 the challenge of the cfe is that it favors highly intensified systems thereby further increasing their competitive advantage compared to extensive ones of smallholders and hence likely making the formers more vulnerable morton 2007 the opportunity of cfe however is that improving smallholders farming conditions might allow more of them to continue cultivating coffee in the future than previously estimated 4 6 model improvements several aspects need to be highlighted for future improvements regarding the present coffee model firstly further insights are required on how coffee light use efficiency is affected by different light availabilities at different time scales this allows for clarifying to what extent the mechanistic light use efficiency approach van oijen et al 2004 is an appropriate summary model of changes in microclimate due to shade i e changes in minimum and maximum temperatures decreased vpd and increased diffuse light and changes in phenotypic plasticity of the coffee plant secondly we still lack a sufficient mechanistic understanding of flowering induction and associated asynchronous flowering events a first attempt has been done by rodriguez et al 2011 by using demographic population models which should be further evaluated to improve our understanding it will require long term data sets of flowering events combined with weather and soil data of different environmental contexts the same is required to better understand factors leading to flower abortion thirdly a more detailed modelling routine might be required for branch dynamics that adequately represent competition between fruit load and increment in branch and new branch development depending on the new branches formed and extension of existing branches the nodes and potential flowering should be calculated finally improvement is also required in representing the impact of extreme events such as temperature and rainfall on coffee productivity as more data become available more complex process representation will be possible either through direct parameterization or inverse modelling particularly this is needed for extending the soil water balance to multilayered soil compartments enabling root niche differentiation between the coffee plant and shade trees as recently exemplified in nicaragua padovan et al 2015 in order to better account for differences in canopy structure of the shade trees summary models as presented by duursma and mäkelä 2007 and forrester 2014 could be implemented with intermediary complexity between our present approach and the maestra approach as used by charbonnier et al 2013 2017 these improvements strongly depend on data availability the collection of functional trait data for different genotypes in different environmental contexts will allow to analyze genotypic and phenotypic plasticity and significantly contribute to the required data for modelling endeavors this requires the consolidation of available functional trait data for coffee particularly flowering phenology and shade trees within the plant trait database kattge et al 2011 martin and isaac 2015 but also on coffee yield management practices and local knowledge ordonez et al 2014 van der wolf et al 2016 consolidation of such a database would improve either direct parameterization or calibration through inverse modelling for example by using a bayesian approach thereby allowing to estimate parameter values in different climates where weather soil and production data are available van oijen et al 2005 5 conclusions we presented a mechanistic model that processes spatially explicit soil and climate data to guide coffee cultivation and shade tree management for sustainable coffee production systems we applied the model to two case studies namely the slopes of mt elgon uganda and mt kilimanjaro tanzania according to the gcm used hadgem2 es mt kilimanjaro will be severely affected by a drying climate in the future while mt elgon is impacted to a lesser extent the presented modelling results confirm earlier studies on coffee suitability changes namely that low altitude areas will be more strongly affected by climate change however previous studies did not include neither cfe nor shade management and consequently seem to have overestimated the negative effects of mean changes in temperature and shifts in precipitation regimes i e yield improvements due to elevated co2 seem to largely mitigate the negative impacts of elevated temperature shade trees can play a strong beneficial role at the low altitude areas that have more marginal climates and will suffer most from climate change higher altitude areas 1500 m may see little to no direct benefit from shade trees on coffee yield the model outputs can guide initiatives related to trees in agricultural landscapes such as biodiversity conservation and or carbon sequestration and in minimizing potential trade offs with farm productivity this will aid in decision making towards improvement of current coffee landscapes and their adaptation to climatic change in integrating the current understanding of the coffee system we also identify knowledge gaps related to flowering and bean maturation and hence cup quality in response to climate change with particular focus on climate extremes which require further study the positive effect of cfe will particularly benefit intensified systems hence significant improvements in agronomic management of smallholder systems will be required therefore sustainable intensification remains an important aspect of climate change adaptation although we showed that shade management consists of an important adaptation strategy increased knowledge on adequate selection and management of shade tree species will be required to maximize complementarity in the use of resources particularly water this will also require more insights into the impact of shade trees on

25329,we describe an industrial ecology teaching exercise on the recycling of discarded consumer electronics e waste using a computer as an example in the exercise students working in groups disassemble a used computer into component parts the parts are classified and inventoried in terms of mass then using available information on the prices of materials that can be readily recycled an economic assessment of the recycled computer is made we provide a sample data set from the lab for a computer hard drive that was disassembled into 12 categories of components with a recycling value of 2 58 us the students enjoy the hands on experience of disassembly as an exercise in creative destruction and they are encouraged to discuss ways that computers might be better designed for disassembly and recycling based on their experience in the lab an energy circuit diagram of material cycling in consumer electronics is presented to provide a systems context for the overall teaching exercise 1 introduction industrial ecology is a relatively new synthesis of human interaction with the environment graedel and allenby 2003 one version of the field has the goal to make industrial systems more like natural ecosystems in terms of cycling and recycling of products made and used by humans the view of the founding industrial engineers was that natural ecosystems completely cycle materials such as plant nutrients and that this level of cycling performance should be a goal of industrial production according to the editor of the journal of industrial ecology brattebo 2002 ie is not an academic discipline it is a scientific concept or some would say a scientific field that is working across established disciplines it is also a way of thinking and a strategy that may be applied at different scales in society and is founded on a set of theories and methods ie is therefore oriented toward describing analyzing understanding and improving systems a conceptual advancement of the field was to consider that man made products have a life cycle like living organisms this thinking has led to life cycle assessment which is a major new accounting approach for material balances energy efficiency and environmental impact in the ecosystem at the end of life organisms die but the elements they are composed of recycle back to support the next generation of organisms much of ecology deals with studying how elements cycle which requires a system approach of pathways and rates of movement of elements through the network of living and non living components of the ecosystem in contrast to natural ecosystems in the industrial systems at the end of life human made products are typically disposed of in landfills as waste the elements in the products are lost and cannot be used to support the next generation of the human made products mcdonough and braungart 2002 coined the metaphor cradle to grave to describe the one way linear dynamics of industrial systems and cradle to cradle to describe the cycling dynamics of natural ecosystems in this paper we describe a teaching exercise in which students disassemble a used computer for hands on experience on material cycling in consumer electronics most discussions of industrial ecology education involve the design of multi course curricula marstrander et al 2000 ning et al 2007 geng et al 2009 shi 2016 or broad concepts such as life cycle assessment cooper and fava 2000 hawkins and matthews 2009 this type of literature takes an overall top down approach to the issue of industrial ecology education in this paper we use a bottom up approach of describing a single laboratory exercise in a university industrial ecology course that has been successful at engaging students 2 teaching exercise we have developed several lab exercises as part of a class on industrial ecology for advanced undergraduates and graduate students at the university of maryland the labs are meant to support lecture topics and to provide active experiences for learning the lab exercise described here is intended to cover the cycling of materials that occurs when items of consumer electronics reach their end of life the analogy with this exercise is that a used discarded computer is like a tree leaf that falls to the forest floor at the end of the growing season and the disassembly of the computer is similar to decomposition that occurs when the leaf reaches the forest litter layer and is broken down by physical processes microbes and invertebrate animals this example of a human product was chosen because of interesting aspects of rare materials needed to make the electronics and because of critical environmental issues with the disposal of the electronics at the end of their useful life the term e waste has been used to describe consumer electronics when they reach the end of their useful life certain materials in the e waste can cause toxic pollution such as mercury other materials in the e waste are valuable and in short supply such as gold and copper and can be lost if not cycled back to the production of useful products the challenge of e waste is that the different elements occur in complex combinations of hazardous and valuable materials that are difficult to separate and ultimately only 10 25 of end of life consumer electronics are recycled wilshire et al 2008 leonard 2010 e waste is a global issue with significant potential environmental impacts carroll and essick 2008 grossman 2006 robinson 2009 as an indication of the issue leonard 2010 states e waste is a global nightmare with between 5 and 7 million tons of electronics becoming obsolete each year their trashed toxic components poisoning the land air water and all of the earth s inhabitants in the u s the disposal and recycling of electronics are strongly regulated but this is not the case in africa and asia where laws are not as strict recycling of e waste in lesser developed countries can be more like a salvage operation with open air burning of wire to recover copper and open acid baths for separating metals such as lead silver and gold these kinds of recycling operations can create toxic conditions for the workers and pollution for the environment stone 2009 various issues about the consumer electronics industry and e waste are discussed in lecture which compliments the laboratory session the hands on lab exercise involves the disassembly of examples of used consumer electronics that we collect prior to the class we have most commonly used computers that have been discarded but other items have been tried as well fig 1 to begin the exercise students are divided into groups of 4 5 individuals and each group is given the computer an effort is made to provide similar machines to each group in the class so that the results of the exercise are comparable between groups and can be used for statistical analysis each group is given a tool kit containing tools necessary for electronics disassembly these tool kits include a magnet for separating ferrous versus non ferrous metals screwdrivers pliers small wrench and socket sets wire cutters and prying tools a larger tool box containing more specialized tools is also available in the laboratory for shared use by students in the disassembly project this box contains bits and drivers for removing tamper proof and security fasteners a drill and drill bit set miniature screwdrivers and extraction tools each student is provided with a set of cotton gloves and safety glasses the students are given general safety instructions along with specific instructions relevant to the particular item being disassembled this could include techniques for discharging capacitors and batteries removing glass fuses handling laser cut metal components etc tool use instruction is also included we usually allow two 3 h lab sessions for the exercise this time commitment allows for disassembly an inventory of disassembled parts class discussion and lab clean up at the conclusion of the lab students recycle the disassembled component parts in the university s recycling facilities as an example of the results of the exercise table 1 shows the inventory of disassembled component parts for a computer hard drive from one student group twelve component parts are shown according to mass and their potential recyclability ferrous metals circuit boards and hard plastic make up more than 90 of the total mass of the disassembled hard drive most of the components are disassembled into uniform categories as shown in table 1 however the circuit boards remain mostly intact since it is not possible to break them down further in the time alloted and with the techniques available to the class in terms of recycling circuit boards are typically soaked in an acid bath to remove the attached parts and that process was not feasible to perform in the lab exercise nine of the 12 component parts are listed as being potentially recyclable for typical recycling programs table 2 lists those components that have market values that are easily accessible by checking commodity web sites such as https rockawayrecycling com scrap metal prices or www scrapregister com scrap prices united states 260 with a summation of the potential market values the total value is quite small for an individual computer hard drive e g 2 58 us and this quantitative exercise of summation demonstrates to the students the economic limitation of the recycling industry 3 discussion the lab exercise described in this paper is part of a course for advanced undergraduates and graduate students that includes labs lectures and field trips other lab exercises are on eco design of bottled water containers biodegradation of compostable paper products and assessment of floating plastic trash on local aquatic ecosystems this exercise on e waste recycling is just an introduction to the complicated circuits of labor technology and economic markets that need to interact for recycling of human products into basic raw materials that can be utilized again in production processes the raw materials may not go back into the same kind of product but the goal is to find some productive use for the recycled materials this involves networking with a diversity of production processes to find best fits thus for example copper recycled from disassembly of computers might be used in the construction industry or communications industry rather than being re used to make new computers the lab exercise provides the opportunity to discuss a number of topics from the lectures in industrial ecology such as toxicology of e waste planned obsolescence and geopolitical issues of rare mineral deposits in particular the potential price of recycled components leads to discussion of the general basis of recycling in human societies recycling only takes place if the component parts have market value it may be technically feasible to recycle a component but if it doesn t yield a positive income stream to the recycler it is unlikely to be recycled the similarity with recycling in natural ecosystems is also brought into the discussion in ecosystems organisms evolve the ability to breakdown and decompose materials such as leaf litter or animal carcasses if they can acquire net energy for metabolism in the process in this exercise the market value of recycling parts in human systems corresponds to the net metabolic energy that the decomposers acquire through decomposition techniques for improving the recycling of materials from e waste such as green design hersh 1998 recycling potential algorithms zeng et al 2017 and design for disassembly dfd veerakamolmal and gupta 2000 villalba et al 2004 are discussed and students are encouraged to make suggestions along these lines of thought in their written lab reports based on their experience in the exercise a systems model fig 2 using the energy circuit language odum 1994 is presented to summarize and synthesize the lab exercise in the model diagram sources of energy labor and component parts come together through the interaction symbols to produce the computer represented by the storage tank in the lower portion of the diagram on the right hand side of the diagram the computer interacts with human use to depict the basis of the overall computer system at the end of life the computer can follow one of two alternative paths shown by the flows out of the computer storage through the switch symbol pathways the pathway to the landfill represents the cradle to grave metaphor of mcdonough and braungart 2002 while the disassembly pathway represents the cradle to cradle metaphor disassembly basically recycles the computer into its component parts in the upper portion of the diagram five of the classes of component parts from the teaching exercise are depicted in the system diagram these recycled components can cycle back into the next generation computer production or they can flow out of the system to other uses as shown in the left hard side of the systems diagram the systems model provides a larger context for the lab exercise the disassembly of the computer into component parts by the students represents only half of the total material cycle but the use of the model diagram helps communicate the concept of the overall cycle as a system our experience has been that most of the students come into the class with a fairly deep knowledge of consumer electronics hardware from their personal lives so the systems diagram is not difficult for them to grasp the exercise in physical disassembly is an active hands on process for the students requiring selection of tools manual tool use inventorying of parts and mass balance calculations some students are handier than others and self organization of tasks required for disassembly emerges within the groups during the exercise in the lab there is a feeling of creative destruction as the computers come apart which the students tend to enjoy in a larger sense the lab exercise in consumer electronic disassembly is an example of what todd mclellan 2013 has called the new teardown movement in technology which he suggests challenges our disposable culture by exposing just what we are throwing away it has the feel of an old school shop class that most students don t experience anymore yet they enjoy it and seem to learn effectively from the teaching exercise as an aside we still have technical shop type vocational classes at the university of maryland ag mechanics power and machinery etc in our institute of applied agriculture program which offers two year technical degrees as opposed to the more general university education of the four year undergraduate degree in for example our environmental science and technology department however the typical curriculum of an undergraduate is so full that they face difficulties scheduling vocational classes they are however recognized as approved electives and count towards their degree if they take them our experience in the industrial ecology lab exercises suggests that these vocational classes still have a role in university curricula especially for environmental design majors if they could be fit into a student s schedule of classes

much of ecology deals with studying how elements cycle which requires a system approach of pathways and rates of movement of elements through the network of living and non living components of the ecosystem in contrast to natural ecosystems in the industrial systems at the end of life human made products are typically disposed of in landfills as waste the elements in the products are lost and cannot be used to support the next generation of the human made products mcdonough and braungart 2002 coined the metaphor cradle to grave to describe the one way linear dynamics of industrial systems and cradle to cradle to describe the cycling dynamics of natural ecosystems in this paper we describe a teaching exercise in which students disassemble a used computer for hands on experience on material cycling in consumer electronics most discussions of industrial ecology education involve the design of multi course curricula marstrander et al 2000 ning et al 2007 geng et al 2009 shi 2016 or broad concepts such as life cycle assessment cooper and fava 2000 hawkins and matthews 2009 this type of literature takes an overall top down approach to the issue of industrial ecology education in this paper we use a bottom up approach of describing a single laboratory exercise in a university industrial ecology course that has been successful at engaging students 2 teaching exercise we have developed several lab exercises as part of a class on industrial ecology for advanced undergraduates and graduate students at the university of maryland the labs are meant to support lecture topics and to provide active experiences for learning the lab exercise described here is intended to cover the cycling of materials that occurs when items of consumer electronics reach their end of life the analogy with this exercise is that a used discarded computer is like a tree leaf that falls to the forest floor at the end of the growing season and the disassembly of the computer is similar to decomposition that occurs when the leaf reaches the forest litter layer and is broken down by physical processes microbes and invertebrate animals this example of a human product was chosen because of interesting aspects of rare materials needed to make the electronics and because of critical environmental issues with the disposal of the electronics at the end of their useful life the term e waste has been used to describe consumer electronics when they reach the end of their useful life certain materials in the e waste can cause toxic pollution such as mercury other materials in the e waste are valuable and in short supply such as gold and copper and can be lost if not cycled back to the production of useful products the challenge of e waste is that the different elements occur in complex combinations of hazardous and valuable materials that are difficult to separate and ultimately only 10 25 of end of life consumer electronics are recycled wilshire et al 2008 leonard 2010 e waste is a global issue with significant potential environmental impacts carroll and essick 2008 grossman 2006 robinson 2009 as an indication of the issue leonard 2010 states e waste is a global nightmare with between 5 and 7 million tons of electronics becoming obsolete each year their trashed toxic components poisoning the land air water and all of the earth s inhabitants in the u s the disposal and recycling of electronics are strongly regulated but this is not the case in africa and asia where laws are not as strict recycling of e waste in lesser developed countries can be more like a salvage operation with open air burning of wire to recover copper and open acid baths for separating metals such as lead silver and gold these kinds of recycling operations can create toxic conditions for the workers and pollution for the environment stone 2009 various issues about the consumer electronics industry and e waste are discussed in lecture which compliments the laboratory session the hands on lab exercise involves the disassembly of examples of used consumer electronics that we collect prior to the class we have most commonly used computers that have been discarded but other items have been tried as well fig 1 to begin the exercise students are divided into groups of 4 5 individuals and each group is given the computer an effort is made to provide similar machines to each group in the class so that the results of the exercise are comparable between groups and can be used for statistical analysis each group is given a tool kit containing tools necessary for electronics disassembly these tool kits include a magnet for separating ferrous versus non ferrous metals screwdrivers pliers small wrench and socket sets wire cutters and prying tools a larger tool box containing more specialized tools is also available in the laboratory for shared use by students in the disassembly project this box contains bits and drivers for removing tamper proof and security fasteners a drill and drill bit set miniature screwdrivers and extraction tools each student is provided with a set of cotton gloves and safety glasses the students are given general safety instructions along with specific instructions relevant to the particular item being disassembled this could include techniques for discharging capacitors and batteries removing glass fuses handling laser cut metal components etc tool use instruction is also included we usually allow two 3 h lab sessions for the exercise this time commitment allows for disassembly an inventory of disassembled parts class discussion and lab clean up at the conclusion of the lab students recycle the disassembled component parts in the university s recycling facilities as an example of the results of the exercise table 1 shows the inventory of disassembled component parts for a computer hard drive from one student group twelve component parts are shown according to mass and their potential recyclability ferrous metals circuit boards and hard plastic make up more than 90 of the total mass of the disassembled hard drive most of the components are disassembled into uniform categories as shown in table 1 however the circuit boards remain mostly intact since it is not possible to break them down further in the time alloted and with the techniques available to the class in terms of recycling circuit boards are typically soaked in an acid bath to remove the attached parts and that process was not feasible to perform in the lab exercise nine of the 12 component parts are listed as being potentially recyclable for typical recycling programs table 2 lists those components that have market values that are easily accessible by checking commodity web sites such as https rockawayrecycling com scrap metal prices or www scrapregister com scrap prices united states 260 with a summation of the potential market values the total value is quite small for an individual computer hard drive e g 2 58 us and this quantitative exercise of summation demonstrates to the students the economic limitation of the recycling industry 3 discussion the lab exercise described in this paper is part of a course for advanced undergraduates and graduate students that includes labs lectures and field trips other lab exercises are on eco design of bottled water containers biodegradation of compostable paper products and assessment of floating plastic trash on local aquatic ecosystems this exercise on e waste recycling is just an introduction to the complicated circuits of labor technology and economic markets that need to interact for recycling of human products into basic raw materials that can be utilized again in production processes the raw materials may not go back into the same kind of product but the goal is to find some productive use for the recycled materials this involves networking with a diversity of production processes to find best fits thus for example copper recycled from disassembly of computers might be used in the construction industry or communications industry rather than being re used to make new computers the lab exercise provides the opportunity to discuss a number of topics from the lectures in industrial ecology such as toxicology of e waste planned obsolescence and geopolitical issues of rare mineral deposits in particular the potential price of recycled components leads to discussion of the general basis of recycling in human societies recycling only takes place if the component parts have market value it may be technically feasible to recycle a component but if it doesn t yield a positive income stream to the recycler it is unlikely to be recycled the similarity with recycling in natural ecosystems is also brought into the discussion in ecosystems organisms evolve the ability to breakdown and decompose materials such as leaf litter or animal carcasses if they can acquire net energy for metabolism in the process in this exercise the market value of recycling parts in human systems corresponds to the net metabolic energy that the decomposers acquire through decomposition techniques for improving the recycling of materials from e waste such as green design hersh 1998 recycling potential algorithms zeng et al 2017 and design for disassembly dfd veerakamolmal and gupta 2000 villalba et al 2004 are discussed and students are encouraged to make suggestions along these lines of thought in their written lab reports based on their experience in the exercise a systems model fig 2 using the energy circuit language odum 1994 is presented to summarize and synthesize the lab exercise in the model diagram sources of energy labor and component parts come together through the interaction symbols to produce the computer represented by the storage tank in the lower portion of the diagram on the right hand side of the diagram the computer interacts with human use to depict the basis of the overall computer system at the end of life the computer can follow one of two alternative paths shown by the flows out of the computer storage through the switch symbol pathways the pathway to the landfill represents the cradle to grave metaphor of mcdonough and braungart 2002 while the disassembly pathway represents the cradle to cradle metaphor disassembly basically recycles the computer into its component parts in the upper portion of the diagram five of the classes of component parts from the teaching exercise are depicted in the system diagram these recycled components can cycle back into the next generation computer production or they can flow out of the system to other uses as shown in the left hard side of the systems diagram the systems model provides a larger context for the lab exercise the disassembly of the computer into component parts by the students represents only half of the total material cycle but the use of the model diagram helps communicate the concept of the overall cycle as a system our experience has been that most of the students come into the class with a fairly deep knowledge of consumer electronics hardware from their personal lives so the systems diagram is not difficult for them to grasp the exercise in physical disassembly is an active hands on process for the students requiring selection of tools manual tool use inventorying of parts and mass balance calculations some students are handier than others and self organization of tasks required for disassembly emerges within the groups during the exercise in the lab there is a feeling of creative destruction as the computers come apart which the students tend to enjoy in a larger sense the lab exercise in consumer electronic disassembly is an example of what todd mclellan 2013 has called the new teardown movement in technology which he suggests challenges our disposable culture by exposing just what we are throwing away it has the feel of an old school shop class that most students don t experience anymore yet they enjoy it and seem to learn effectively from the teaching exercise as an aside we still have technical shop type vocational classes at the university of maryland ag mechanics power and machinery etc in our institute of applied agriculture program which offers two year technical degrees as opposed to the more general university education of the four year undergraduate degree in for example our environmental science and technology department however the typical curriculum of an undergraduate is so full that they face difficulties scheduling vocational classes they are however recognized as approved electives and count towards their degree if they take them our experience in the industrial ecology lab exercises suggests that these vocational classes still have a role in university curricula especially for environmental design majors if they could be fit into a student s schedule of classes
