this study a techno economic feasibility analysis for different modern compact municipal wastewater treatment technologies including aerobic granular sludge ags high rate activated sludge hras coupled with membrane bioreactor mbr hras mbr process was conducted the findings were comparatively evaluated with the conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process capital operation and maintenance o m costs for each system were investigated in detail environmental benefits for each system were assessed and an energy balance for each system was conducted 21 lower energy consumption was observed in the ags system in comparison to the a2o system this finding might be associated with the absence of mixers return sludge pumping and recirculation of wastewater for nitrogen removal in ags system the unit total cost was found to be 0 113 m3 0 091 m3 and 0 195 m3 for a2o process ags process and hras mbr process in order based on the energy balance and economic analysis ags system was found to have lower net energy consumption and total cost compared to a2o process and hras mbr process the results obtained from this study are of vital importance in the economic evaluation of the projected large new wwtps graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aerobic granular sludge environmental benefits high rate activated sludge membrane bioreactor municipal wastewater treatment techno economic data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps are designed for reducing pollutants to protect human health and aquatic environment however it is essential to assess the sustainability of wwtps in terms of economic feasibility energy requirement and subsequent environmental impacts while meeting the discharge standards 1 3 nitrogen and phosphorus are essential elements for life nevertheless excessive nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations in water bodies resulting from wastewater discharges have a deleterious impact on aquatic life thus biological nutrient removal bnr processes have been developed in the 1960s to decrease the nutrient discharges into receiving water bodies 4 in today s world it is obvious that there is a need to imply innovative and sustainable technologies rather than conventional bnr systems due to the increase in the amount of wastewater and the tightening discharge standards 5 6 anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process is the most widely used conventional bnr process that removes carbon nitrogen and phosphorus 7 a2o process consists of anaerobic anoxic aerobic compartments with various redox potentials and a separate settling tank for liquid solid separation the compartments and the settling tank are arranged in sequence with nitrate circulation flow from the aerobic compartment to the anoxic compartment and sludge circulation flow from the settling tank to the anaerobic compartment the high footprint and energy requirement of a2o process have accelerated the research on innovative wastewater treatment technologies 8 in the last two decades aerobic granular sludge ags technology a promising and proven technology that allows simultaneous carbon and nutrient removal has been increasingly applied 6 9 ags process is operated in a single reactor concept especially in sequencing batch reactors sbrs enabling lower footprint requirements and less energy consumption compared to conventional bnr processes 10 another process that has been developed to capture organic matter for harvesting energy is the adsorption bio oxidation ab process high rate activated sludge hras process is implemented as the high loaded biological adsorption stage a stage in the ab process hras process is applied at very short hydraulic retention times hrts e g 0 25 0 5 h and sludge retention times e g 0 5 3 days 11 13 following a stage a low loaded bio oxidation process b stage removes residual organic matter and nutrients 14 16 hras process can also be coupled with membrane bioreactor mbr process to maintain effluent requirements for further use of treated wastewater such as irrigational and reclamation purposes 17 18 economic evaluation of wwtps is a crucial issue especially for decision makers high capital and operation and maintenance o m costs of the wastewater treatment processes put financial strains on the public and thus force administrators to find innovative cost effective and environmentally feasible ways 19 capital costs involve construction equipment and land costs whereas o m costs comprise labor energy chemicals maintenance and repairs sludge disposal etc the size of the treatment plant discharge standards flowrate population equivalent pe life span of treatment plant and treatment technology type have significant effects on the energy consumption and thus o m costs of wwtps 20 it is also known that wastewater treatment offers significant environmental advantages that can be classified as positive externalities in economic terms therefore cost benefit analyses are performed in order to find economically feasible treatment systems 21 there are several studies conducted on the economical evaluation of wwtps for municipal wastewater treatment in the literature 21 28 molinos senante et al 21 applied a cost benefit analysis for 22 wwtps located in spain and they reported that the net profit for wttps was 0 1413 m3 on average the average concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in the influent were reported as 700 mg l 390 mg l 30 mg l and 5 5 mg l in order 21 li et al 29 reported that the labor and energy costs covered 30 1 and 26 3 in the total cost respectively for wwtps saleh et al 26 applied a life cycle cost analysis lcca method for the economical evaluation of various technologies including sbr oxidation ditch od and waste stabilization ponds for centralized and decentralized wwtps in that study the capacities of centralized wwtp and decentralized wwtp were 10 000 m3 day and 2 000 m3 day respectively based on the lcca method the lowest total cost was found for od system for centralized and decentralized wwtps respectively brepols 5 compared the capital costs of mbr and conventional activated sludge cas plants having biological nitrogen removal with chemical phosphorus precipitation for a population equivalent of 10 000 pe in germany capital cost of the mbr system was lower than that of the cas system for municipal wastewater treatment moreover mbr system had better effluent quality than cas system which was 20 mg l of cod concentration and 1 5 mg l of tp concentration in the effluent young et al 23 comparatively evaluated the capital and o m costs of cas and mbr systems with a flowrate of 18 927 m3 d for biological nutrient removal from municipal wastewater with an average cod tss tn and tp concentrations of 430 mg l 210 mg l 40 mg l and 7 mg l in order cas and mbr systems had excellent treatment performance with 90 removal efficiency of cod tss and tn and 75 removal efficiency of tp lower capital and higher o m costs were reported for the mbr system in comparison to the cas system these studies indicated that the mbr system has better effluent quality and lower capital cost in comparison to the cas system moreover iglesias et al 24 evaluated the cost of six full scale mbr plants treating municipal wastewater in spain four of the mbr plants included biological nitrogen removal with chemical phosphorus precipitation and two of them involved extended aeration with biological nitrogen removal they reported that unit capital cost was almost 2 000 3 200 m3 day in the plants with capacities ranging from 1 000 to 2 000 m3 day it could decrease to 625 m3 day in large plants with a capacity of 20 000 m3 day energy labor and handling of solid waste from screening units and grit chamber and sludge accounted for 41 28 and 16 of the o m cost in order 24 ćetković et al 27 conducted a study focusing on the economical evaluation of a wwtp in nov dojran north macedonia the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr was found to be the most cost efficient wastewater treatment process with a unit total cost of 1 45 m3 he et al 30 investigated the techno economic feasibility for the integration of membrane based pre concentration mpc and post treatment systems for municipal wastewater treatment a combination of the mpc reverse osmosis and anaerobic digestion system as a novel system was propound for water reuse and energy recovery from municipal wastewater the net energy consumption and o m costs of the system were found to be 0 273 kwh m3 and 1 132 cny m3 respectively in the study of rathore et al 31 llca was conducted for the economical evaluation of wastewater treatment technologies including cas upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and mbbr mbbr system had better cod removal efficiency with a value of 85 90 in comparison to cas 75 94 and uasb 70 80 mbbr system had a higher total cost because of the membrane used for wastewater treatment which provides the best effluent quality among the other systems it was reported that the uasb system is a cost effective alternative among the other systems due to its lower energy and o m costs on the other hand the main limitation of uasb process is that it might not withstand discharge standards and the effluent might require tertiary treatment before discharge or reuse in the literature the techno economic feasibility of several aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies was assessed 32 35 to the best of the authors knowledge no study has been comparatively conducted for the techno economic feasibility of the ags process and hras integrated mbr process hras mbr process the objective of this study was to reveal a comprehensive techno economic feasibility analysis of three systems including a2o process ags process and hras mbr process the distributions of different components in capital and o m costs were evaluated comparatively for each system in the study moreover energy balance and environmental benefit analysis were conducted to have a better understanding of the economic performance of all systems this extensive techno economic feasibility study is supposed to provide valuable and adequate financial insights for the decision makers to be able to benchmark the different municipal wastewater treatment systems 2 material and methods 2 1 system description three different wastewater treatment systems including a2o process ags process and hras mbr process were comparatively evaluated in this study each system was designed for a treatment capacity of 550 000 m3 day 2 750 000 pe the characteristics of the influent wastewater which was used for the design of the treatment systems based on dry weather flow dwf conditions are provided in table 1 the preliminary treatment stage of each system was the same and consisted of screening and a grit chamber the screening units and grit chamber were located at the head of wwtps to avoid large particles to pass through and remove grit the primary treatment stage of the a2o system comprised a primary sedimentation unit that could remove settleable solids and part of the organic matter the secondary treatment stage consisted of biological processes and a final sedimentation tank for the removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus ags system included a biological reactor which allowed simultaneous carbon and nutrient removal in a single reactor that operated using a sbr therefore the influent was pumped directly to the ags reactor soon after passing the screens and grit chamber it was assumed that the sbr was operated in cycles including filling decanting aeration anaerobic idle and settling in the hras mbr process following the screens and grit chamber wastewater was first sent to the hras process including a high loaded aeration tank and a settling tank effluent from the hras process was directed to the mbr process for further treatment the membrane was installed in this system in order to maintain better effluent quality in terms of solids content and pathogens in each system following the ultraviolet uv disinfection unit treated wastewater was planned to be discharged into a water body while waste sludge was further processed before disposal by sludge treatment processes including thickening anaerobic digestion and dewatering the treatment schemes of each system are given in fig 1 the design criteria used for each system are given in table 2 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 4 g l was used for the design in the a2o system while mlss concentration in the mbr system treating sewage was assumed to be 8 g l mlss similarly mlss concentration of 8 g l was assumed in the ags reactor which is in line with existing ags systems applied at full scale 2 in addition for the ags system the appropriateness of the design criteria and reactor sizing results were validated with the owner of the market leading ags technology 36 average food to microorganism f m ratio ranged between 0 04 and 0 06 kg bod kg mlss d for all systems in the study the f m ratio was reported in the range of 0 02 0 30 kg bod kg mlss d for cas processes 37 38 in the study the effluent quality was determined in accordance with the urban wastewater directive european union eu council directive 91 271 eec for all systems 39 the expected effluent quality for each system is provided in table 3 effluent quality was assumed as same for all of the parameters for a2o and ags systems however lower tss cod and bod concentrations were estimated for hras mbr process compared to the other two systems indeed this was expected since mbr system could provide high quality effluent enabling reuse for different purposes 40 2 2 cost analysis the overall cost of each system was represented by the sum of the capital and o m costs in this study capital cost involved civil electromechanical control automation and engineering consulting costs o m cost included energy labor chemical sludge handling and maintenance costs energy cost comprised the costs associated with energy consumption while labor costs include wages and social insurance payment for employees and other relevant staff chemical cost included the price of chemical reagents used for wastewater treatment and sludge conditioning in this study ferric chloride fecl3 consumption for chemical phosphorus removal methanol consumption as a carbon source and polyelectrolyte consumption for sludge conditioning were taken into account for each system sludge handling cost included the costs related with waste and sludge management maintenance cost covered the costs related with maintenance and replacement of equipment and machinery the yearly maintenance cost was calculated by the sum of 0 5 of the civil cost 3 of the electromechanical cost and 5 of electricity and control and automation cost for the a2o process and hras mbr process for the ags process an extra maintenance cost as 1 5 of the electromechanical cost was added due to reactor internals and more automatic valves the replacement costs comprising the costs associated with the replacement of the membrane and lamp in disinfection unit were computed based on 10 and 2 years of lifespan respectively local market prices applicable in 2021 for the unit cost of the electrical energy and chemicals including fecl3 methanol and polyelectrolyte were used to estimate the energy and chemical costs respectively the capital cost of each system was withdrawn to 2021 with a plant lifetime of 30 years and a real interest rate of 3 the value of capital cost in 2021 was calculated by using eq 1 where spca is a single payment compound amount factor eq 2 was used to compute the annualization of capital costs where crf is the capital recovery factor in eqs 1 and 2 f and p represented future value and the present value of a given amount of money respectively besides in eqs 1 and 2 a is the value in the annualized form i is the interest rate per period and n is the period 1 f p 1 i n p spca 2 a p i 1 i n 1 i n 1 p crf 2 3 environmental benefit analysis economic analysis was made to have a better understanding of the techno economic feasibility of each system obviously both benefits and costs must be expressed in the same units for the analysis to be implemented thus monetary units must be used as a way of homogenization because of the heterogeneity in the measurement units of costs and benefits environmental benefit analysis is a way to reveal the net environmental benefits of different systems or alternatives the environmental benefits were calculated by using the shadow price instead of the unmeasurable market price shadow prices represent the environmental harm avoided if these pollutants would be dumped in an uncontrolled manner or an approximation of the environmental benefits associated with the treatment process 21 energy recovery water reuse potential and land footprint were determined as environmental benefits in this study to quantify the energy recovery of the wwtps daily energy generation via the anaerobic digestion of sludge was calculated in terms of a kilowatt hour kwh and a shadow price 0 07 kw was used to estimate the benefits related with energy recovery water reuse potential for industrial process water was considered as an environmental benefit in this study an average local tariff value 0 045 m3 for water reuse was used in order to qualify the water reuse benefit a land footprint benefit was assessed based on the area required for the construction of the wwtp a shadow price was used for the estimation of land footprint benefit notably the unit land price per area m2 in different regions of the world varies in a large range e g 0 02 m2 to 640 66 m2 41 47 the unit local based land price was assumed as 500 m2 in the study in order to estimate the land footprint benefit of the systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 cost analysis 3 1 1 capital cost fig 2 indicates the shares of capital cost components for each system the a2o process had the highest share in civil costs with a value of 60 ozgun et al 48 reported that the civil cost had the highest share for large scale wwtps 400 000 m3 day including a2o process the share of electromechanical cost for the a2o process was found to be 26 of the capital cost de kreuk et al 49 reported that the share of the electromechanical cost for the a2o processes was between 25 and 30 of the capital cost on the other hand it was observed that hras mbr process had the highest share in electromechanical cost with a value of 58 the highest share in electromechanical cost in hras mbr process might be related with the membrane used for wastewater treatment in the ags process the civil and electromechanical costs were found to be 45 and 40 of the capital cost respectively fig 2 in the study of de kreuk 50 the share of the electromechanical cost in the ags process was reported as 40 45 of the capital cost all processes had the same share of the control automation cost and engineering consulting cost in the capital cost representing 3 and 1 respectively considering table 4 the capital cost of the ags process was 24 less than the capital cost of the a2o process this lower cost could be related that the ags process had lower construction volume and fewer numbers of mechanical equipment like mixers and pumps compared to the a2o process ags process covered 35 40 lower land footprint than the a2o process it is obvious that ags process is a quite compact process which is a significant advantage in relation to a2o process especially in densely populated areas sengar et al 51 reported that the ags system can save up to 25 75 of land footprint compared to the cas system since ags system can maintain more biomass concentration in the bioreactor and does not require an additional settling tank similarly bengtsson et al 52 pointed out that the cas systems including modified ludzack ettinger activated sludge process with chemical phosphorus removal and university of cape town activated sludge process with biological phosphorus removal require 40 50 higher land footprint compared to the ags system moreover the electricity cost of the ags system 12 310 000 was 20 lower compared to that of the a2o system 15 310 000 rosa masegosa et al 53 reported that the ags system has a 25 50 smaller area for implementation and 23 40 lower electricity cost in comparison to the cas systems besides the capital cost of hras mbr process was 1 2 times higher than that of the a2o process which was related with the additional costs for the mbr system in terms of membranes additional pumps sludge recirculation pumps and permeate pumps and blower costs arif et al 34 reported that the total capital cost of an mbr system was 1 8 times higher than that of a cas process designed only to remove carbon organic compounds and 1 4 times higher than that of a cas process designed to remove carbon and nitrogen similarly zaerpour 54 also found that capital cost of the mbr systems was higher than that of cas systems due to the initial cost of the membranes 3 1 2 o m cost economic analysis of the wwtps must include consideration of the o m costs fig 3 shows the distribution of o m cost components following fig 3 the chemical cost had the highest share in o m cost for hras mbr process with a value of 25 which could be linked with the methanol consumption as a carbon source and more amount of fecl3 usage for chemical phosphate removal compared to the other investigated processes annual fecl3 consumption for chemical phosphate removal was calculated to be 2 400 tons year 1 170 tons year and 14 200 tons year in a2o process ags process and hras mbr process in order whereas only hras mbr process had methanol consumption of 7 300 tons year the chemical cost of the ags process 1 520 000 year was found to be lower than that of the a2o process 2 000 000 year table 5 this lower chemical cost of the ags system could be attributed to the better biological phosphorus removal compared to the a2o system yu et al 55 indicated that ags system could perform excellent nutrient removal without external carbon sources and phosphorus removing agents resulting in a decreased overall o m cost by about 30 it was determined that ags system had slightly lower polyelectrolyte consumption 450 tons year compared to the other systems 560 tons year for a2o system and 570 tons year for hras mbr system which could be related with less sludge production in the ags system in comparison to the other systems it was found that ags system produced 18 less sludge compared to a2o system the main challenges in a2o process are the poor dewaterability of the excess sludge with higher sludge disposal cost ags process can be considered as a good option to overcome these challenges due to its lower sludge production and good sludge dewaterability characteristics the unit energy consumption was averagely calculated as 0 27 kwh m3 0 21 kwh m3 and 0 33 kwh m3 for a2o ags and hras mbr systems in order in the previous studies related to the energy consumption in wwtps including a2o process the unit energy consumption was 0 267 kwh m3 in china 56 0 33 kwh m3 in iran 57 and 0 3 kwh m3 in italy 58 besides the unit energy consumption for the ags system and ab system was reported as 0 17 kwh m3 and 0 33 kwh m3 respectively 59 in this study the unit energy consumption of each system falls within similar ranges reported in the literature the share of energy cost in o m cost for a2o and ags systems was found to be 25 and 23 respectively the lower energy cost in the ags system might be attributed to the absence of mixers return sludge pumping and recirculation of wastewater for nitrogen removal in comparison to the a2o system this finding was in agreement with the results of nancharaiah et al 60 which also attributed the lower energy cost of ags system in comparison to cas system to the absence of mixers conventional recycle pumps and sludge return pump pronk et al 10 reported that the ags process consumed 20 50 less energy compared to the cas processes based on the results obtained from our study the lower energy consumption of 21 was observed in the ags system in comparison to the a2o system moreover hras mbr process had 30 more energy consumption than a2o system the aeration system and the high recycle rate in the mbr stage might be the reason behind the higher energy consumption in hras mbr process only coarse bubble aerators in both the hras process and mbr process were designed in continuous mode while the fine bubble aerators in the bioreactor were controlled by an oxygen set point in the a2o process fine bubble aerators have the advantage of higher transfer efficiency and lower energy requirements compared to coarse bubble aerators fenu et al 61 reported that the fine bubble aeration system contributes to 10 5 of overall energy consumption whereas the coarse bubble aeration system accounts for 35 2 moreover the share of membrane replacement cost in hras mbr process was 20 of the annual o m costs decarolis et al 62 reported that the share of membrane replacement cost was 28 of the o m cost in an mbr system treating municipal wastewater additionally it was reported that the affordable membrane replacement costs in wastewater treatment should be 10 of the equipment costs 63 which was found as 6 in hras mbr process in this study table 5 illustrates annual o m cost for each system ags system had 18 less annual o m cost than a2o system de kreuk 50 and vashi 64 reported that ags system had 7 17 less o m cost than a2o system additionally rosa masegosa et al 53 indicated that ags system requires 20 25 lower o m cost compared to cas systems the low energy consumption of the ags system might contribute to the development of energy neutral or energy positive wwtps 3 1 3 total cost the distribution of total cost components for each system was given in fig 4 considering fig 4 the share of the capital cost was close to each other in a2o and ags systems representing 34 and 32 respectively the unit total cost was calculated to be 0 113 m3 0 091 m3 and 0 195 m3 for a2o process ags process and hras mbr process in order table 6 the relatively lower unit total cost of the ags system could be mainly related with its lower land requirement and less energy consumption compared to the other investigated processes in addition the main reason behind the higher total cost in hras mbr process might be linked with the additional costs for the mbr system in terms of membranes additional pumps and blower costs the unit total cost of the a2o system determined in this study table 6 was consistent with the unit total costs for treatment of the municipal wastewater reported in the literature whereas the unit cost of the ags system was lower than that given in the literature due to economies of scale vuori and ollikainen 65 reported that wastewater treatment becomes less expensive as the capacity of wwtps increases due to economies of scale 3 2 environmental benefits analysis three main environmental benefits energy recovery water reuse potential and land footprint were considered for the analysis of the environmental benefits within the context of this study energy recovery from wwtps via anaerobic digestion of the sludge is one of the great benefits the amount of energy recovery from hras mbr process 99 900 kwh day was found higher than that from the other systems 94 100 kwh day and 80 200 kwh day from a2o process and ags process respectively hras process is mainly used to up concentrate organic matter and promote energy recovery 72 however from an environmental point of view it should be noted that hras mbr process consumed more energy 225 200 kwh day than a2o process 181 500 kwh day and ags process 144 700 kwh day ags process had the least energy consumption in terms of the net energy consumption ags process and hras mbr process required lower land area in comparison to the a2o process hence compared to the a2o system ags and hras mbr systems have alternative land with possible use as farmland or housing area etc this alternative land for ags process and hras mbr process was 95 000 m2 and 97 000 m2 respectively the environmental benefits of each system are represented in table 7 following table 7 hras mbr process had more environmental benefits in comparison to a2o process and ags process which was mainly related with the better effluent quality of hras mbr process hras mbr process could achieve nearly complete removal of suspended solids and provide low bod and cod concentrations in the effluent the effluent quality of the investigated processes was indicated by the effluent quality index eqi in terms of g pollutant per day based on the approach suggested by copp 73 eqi was calculated by using the average concentrations of tss cod tn no3 n and tp in the effluent of each system eqi of the hras mbr process was found to be 26 better than the other systems eqi was 10 3 g pollutant day 10 3 g pollutant day and 7 6 g pollutant day for a2o process ags process and hras mbr process in order sludge from ags process could also be used to harvest biopolymer and generate a resource income 3 3 overall evaluation the cost and environmental benefits of the investigated wastewater treatment systems were holistically considered fig 5 and table s1 electricity can be recovered from excess sludge via combined heat and power chp system this recovery potential was determined to be 94 100 kwh d 80 200 kwh d and 99 900 kwh day for a2o process ags process and hras mbr process in order based on the energy balance the ags system had the most energy efficient treatment system among the other systems with a net energy consumption of around 35 500 kwh d fig 5 the net energy consumptions of the a2o process and hras mbr process were 52 900 kwh d and 90 800 kwh d respectively indeed this was expected since ags system had lower energy consumption than the other systems due to the lack of mixers recycle pumps and return sludge pumps hras mbr process had higher energy recovery with a value of 99 900 kwh day among the other processes however hras mbr process had the highest energy consumption among the other systems due to the aeration system for the membrane and additional pumps thus the net energy consumption of hras mbr process was higher than that of a2o process and ags process it was reported that mbrs had almost three times higher energy consumption compared to cas systems due to the higher energy consumption in coarse bubble aeration system used in mbrs 61 74 net total cost was found to be roughly 18 940 00 year 12 460 000 year and 31 540 000 year for a2o system ags system and hras mbr system in order fig 6 and table s2 overall considering the results presented in fig 5 and fig 6 ags system is the most attractive system compared to a2o system and hras mbr system since the ags system had lower net energy consumption and net total cost than the other systems besides additional benefits can be provided from ags system via aforementioned exopolymers resource recovery these new value added products can improve cost recovery of ags technology 75 ags process provides an overall improvement in efficiency energy cost and reliability for the wastewater treatment process in comparison to a2o process however the studies on energy recovery from excess sludge from ags process are missing several techniques can be applied in order to enhance the biodegradability of sludge and hence enhancing energy recovery potential pre treatment techniques involving either thermal chemical acid alkali and ozone physical mechanical and biological techniques can be used prior to anaerobic digestion to disintegrate biomass and make the organic matter more accessible to microorganisms and thus it accelerates the conversion of organic solids into methane co treatment of complementary feedstocks can be applied to improve the digestibility of mono substrates the addition of different substrates like industrial waste manure and food waste can be utilized to increase methane production in sludge management 76 therefore future studies should focus on the energy recovery from the sludge of ags process 4 conclusions the main purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive techno economic feasibility analysis for three different wastewater treatment systems including a2o process ags process and hras mbr process the main conclusions that can be drawn from this study were provided below ags system had lower capital cost of 24 in comparison to a2o system this might be related with significantly lower construction volume and fewer numbers of mechanical equipment need in the ags system compared to a2o system o m cost of ags system was found to be 18 lower than that of a2o system whereas o m cost of hras mbr system was significantly higher than a2o system the unit total costs were 0 113 m3 0 091 m3 and 0 195 m3 for a2o system ags system and hras mbr system in order from the perspective of net energy consumption and total cost ags system was the most favorable wastewater treatment system among the others compared to a2o system ags system consumed 21 less energy whereas hras mbr system consumed 30 more energy ags system had the lowest net total cost among the other systems ags process can contribute to the development of cost effective and energy neutral or energy positive wwtps in comparison to the other wastewater treatment processes moreover future studies to enhance the energy recovery potential of the excess sludge obtained from ags system could be conducted the presented results can be considered as guidelines and orientations for the techno economic evaluation of

increasingly applied 6 9 ags process is operated in a single reactor concept especially in sequencing batch reactors sbrs enabling lower footprint requirements and less energy consumption compared to conventional bnr processes 10 another process that has been developed to capture organic matter for harvesting energy is the adsorption bio oxidation ab process high rate activated sludge hras process is implemented as the high loaded biological adsorption stage a stage in the ab process hras process is applied at very short hydraulic retention times hrts e g 0 25 0 5 h and sludge retention times e g 0 5 3 days 11 13 following a stage a low loaded bio oxidation process b stage removes residual organic matter and nutrients 14 16 hras process can also be coupled with membrane bioreactor mbr process to maintain effluent requirements for further use of treated wastewater such as irrigational and reclamation purposes 17 18 economic evaluation of wwtps is a crucial issue especially for decision makers high capital and operation and maintenance o m costs of the wastewater treatment processes put financial strains on the public and thus force administrators to find innovative cost effective and environmentally feasible ways 19 capital costs involve construction equipment and land costs whereas o m costs comprise labor energy chemicals maintenance and repairs sludge disposal etc the size of the treatment plant discharge standards flowrate population equivalent pe life span of treatment plant and treatment technology type have significant effects on the energy consumption and thus o m costs of wwtps 20 it is also known that wastewater treatment offers significant environmental advantages that can be classified as positive externalities in economic terms therefore cost benefit analyses are performed in order to find economically feasible treatment systems 21 there are several studies conducted on the economical evaluation of wwtps for municipal wastewater treatment in the literature 21 28 molinos senante et al 21 applied a cost benefit analysis for 22 wwtps located in spain and they reported that the net profit for wttps was 0 1413 m3 on average the average concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in the influent were reported as 700 mg l 390 mg l 30 mg l and 5 5 mg l in order 21 li et al 29 reported that the labor and energy costs covered 30 1 and 26 3 in the total cost respectively for wwtps saleh et al 26 applied a life cycle cost analysis lcca method for the economical evaluation of various technologies including sbr oxidation ditch od and waste stabilization ponds for centralized and decentralized wwtps in that study the capacities of centralized wwtp and decentralized wwtp were 10 000 m3 day and 2 000 m3 day respectively based on the lcca method the lowest total cost was found for od system for centralized and decentralized wwtps respectively brepols 5 compared the capital costs of mbr and conventional activated sludge cas plants having biological nitrogen removal with chemical phosphorus precipitation for a population equivalent of 10 000 pe in germany capital cost of the mbr system was lower than that of the cas system for municipal wastewater treatment moreover mbr system had better effluent quality than cas system which was 20 mg l of cod concentration and 1 5 mg l of tp concentration in the effluent young et al 23 comparatively evaluated the capital and o m costs of cas and mbr systems with a flowrate of 18 927 m3 d for biological nutrient removal from municipal wastewater with an average cod tss tn and tp concentrations of 430 mg l 210 mg l 40 mg l and 7 mg l in order cas and mbr systems had excellent treatment performance with 90 removal efficiency of cod tss and tn and 75 removal efficiency of tp lower capital and higher o m costs were reported for the mbr system in comparison to the cas system these studies indicated that the mbr system has better effluent quality and lower capital cost in comparison to the cas system moreover iglesias et al 24 evaluated the cost of six full scale mbr plants treating municipal wastewater in spain four of the mbr plants included biological nitrogen removal with chemical phosphorus precipitation and two of them involved extended aeration with biological nitrogen removal they reported that unit capital cost was almost 2 000 3 200 m3 day in the plants with capacities ranging from 1 000 to 2 000 m3 day it could decrease to 625 m3 day in large plants with a capacity of 20 000 m3 day energy labor and handling of solid waste from screening units and grit chamber and sludge accounted for 41 28 and 16 of the o m cost in order 24 ćetković et al 27 conducted a study focusing on the economical evaluation of a wwtp in nov dojran north macedonia the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr was found to be the most cost efficient wastewater treatment process with a unit total cost of 1 45 m3 he et al 30 investigated the techno economic feasibility for the integration of membrane based pre concentration mpc and post treatment systems for municipal wastewater treatment a combination of the mpc reverse osmosis and anaerobic digestion system as a novel system was propound for water reuse and energy recovery from municipal wastewater the net energy consumption and o m costs of the system were found to be 0 273 kwh m3 and 1 132 cny m3 respectively in the study of rathore et al 31 llca was conducted for the economical evaluation of wastewater treatment technologies including cas upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and mbbr mbbr system had better cod removal efficiency with a value of 85 90 in comparison to cas 75 94 and uasb 70 80 mbbr system had a higher total cost because of the membrane used for wastewater treatment which provides the best effluent quality among the other systems it was reported that the uasb system is a cost effective alternative among the other systems due to its lower energy and o m costs on the other hand the main limitation of uasb process is that it might not withstand discharge standards and the effluent might require tertiary treatment before discharge or reuse in the literature the techno economic feasibility of several aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies was assessed 32 35 to the best of the authors knowledge no study has been comparatively conducted for the techno economic feasibility of the ags process and hras integrated mbr process hras mbr process the objective of this study was to reveal a comprehensive techno economic feasibility analysis of three systems including a2o process ags process and hras mbr process the distributions of different components in capital and o m costs were evaluated comparatively for each system in the study moreover energy balance and environmental benefit analysis were conducted to have a better understanding of the economic performance of all systems this extensive techno economic feasibility study is supposed to provide valuable and adequate financial insights for the decision makers to be able to benchmark the different municipal wastewater treatment systems 2 material and methods 2 1 system description three different wastewater treatment systems including a2o process ags process and hras mbr process were comparatively evaluated in this study each system was designed for a treatment capacity of 550 000 m3 day 2 750 000 pe the characteristics of the influent wastewater which was used for the design of the treatment systems based on dry weather flow dwf conditions are provided in table 1 the preliminary treatment stage of each system was the same and consisted of screening and a grit chamber the screening units and grit chamber were located at the head of wwtps to avoid large particles to pass through and remove grit the primary treatment stage of the a2o system comprised a primary sedimentation unit that could remove settleable solids and part of the organic matter the secondary treatment stage consisted of biological processes and a final sedimentation tank for the removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus ags system included a biological reactor which allowed simultaneous carbon and nutrient removal in a single reactor that operated using a sbr therefore the influent was pumped directly to the ags reactor soon after passing the screens and grit chamber it was assumed that the sbr was operated in cycles including filling decanting aeration anaerobic idle and settling in the hras mbr process following the screens and grit chamber wastewater was first sent to the hras process including a high loaded aeration tank and a settling tank effluent from the hras process was directed to the mbr process for further treatment the membrane was installed in this system in order to maintain better effluent quality in terms of solids content and pathogens in each system following the ultraviolet uv disinfection unit treated wastewater was planned to be discharged into a water body while waste sludge was further processed before disposal by sludge treatment processes including thickening anaerobic digestion and dewatering the treatment schemes of each system are given in fig 1 the design criteria used for each system are given in table 2 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 4 g l was used for the design in the a2o system while mlss concentration in the mbr system treating sewage was assumed to be 8 g l mlss similarly mlss concentration of 8 g l was assumed in the ags reactor which is in line with existing ags systems applied at full scale 2 in addition for the ags system the appropriateness of the design criteria and reactor sizing results were validated with the owner of the market leading ags technology 36 average food to microorganism f m ratio ranged between 0 04 and 0 06 kg bod kg mlss d for all systems in the study the f m ratio was reported in the range of 0 02 0 30 kg bod kg mlss d for cas processes 37 38 in the study the effluent quality was determined in accordance with the urban wastewater directive european union eu council directive 91 271 eec for all systems 39 the expected effluent quality for each system is provided in table 3 effluent quality was assumed as same for all of the parameters for a2o and ags systems however lower tss cod and bod concentrations were estimated for hras mbr process compared to the other two systems indeed this was expected since mbr system could provide high quality effluent enabling reuse for different purposes 40 2 2 cost analysis the overall cost of each system was represented by the sum of the capital and o m costs in this study capital cost involved civil electromechanical control automation and engineering consulting costs o m cost included energy labor chemical sludge handling and maintenance costs energy cost comprised the costs associated with energy consumption while labor costs include wages and social insurance payment for employees and other relevant staff chemical cost included the price of chemical reagents used for wastewater treatment and sludge conditioning in this study ferric chloride fecl3 consumption for chemical phosphorus removal methanol consumption as a carbon source and polyelectrolyte consumption for sludge conditioning were taken into account for each system sludge handling cost included the costs related with waste and sludge management maintenance cost covered the costs related with maintenance and replacement of equipment and machinery the yearly maintenance cost was calculated by the sum of 0 5 of the civil cost 3 of the electromechanical cost and 5 of electricity and control and automation cost for the a2o process and hras mbr process for the ags process an extra maintenance cost as 1 5 of the electromechanical cost was added due to reactor internals and more automatic valves the replacement costs comprising the costs associated with the replacement of the membrane and lamp in disinfection unit were computed based on 10 and 2 years of lifespan respectively local market prices applicable in 2021 for the unit cost of the electrical energy and chemicals including fecl3 methanol and polyelectrolyte were used to estimate the energy and chemical costs respectively the capital cost of each system was withdrawn to 2021 with a plant lifetime of 30 years and a real interest rate of 3 the value of capital cost in 2021 was calculated by using eq 1 where spca is a single payment compound amount factor eq 2 was used to compute the annualization of capital costs where crf is the capital recovery factor in eqs 1 and 2 f and p represented future value and the present value of a given amount of money respectively besides in eqs 1 and 2 a is the value in the annualized form i is the interest rate per period and n is the period 1 f p 1 i n p spca 2 a p i 1 i n 1 i n 1 p crf 2 3 environmental benefit analysis economic analysis was made to have a better understanding of the techno economic feasibility of each system obviously both benefits and costs must be expressed in the same units for the analysis to be implemented thus monetary units must be used as a way of homogenization because of the heterogeneity in the measurement units of costs and benefits environmental benefit analysis is a way to reveal the net environmental benefits of different systems or alternatives the environmental benefits were calculated by using the shadow price instead of the unmeasurable market price shadow prices represent the environmental harm avoided if these pollutants would be dumped in an uncontrolled manner or an approximation of the environmental benefits associated with the treatment process 21 energy recovery water reuse potential and land footprint were determined as environmental benefits in this study to quantify the energy recovery of the wwtps daily energy generation via the anaerobic digestion of sludge was calculated in terms of a kilowatt hour kwh and a shadow price 0 07 kw was used to estimate the benefits related with energy recovery water reuse potential for industrial process water was considered as an environmental benefit in this study an average local tariff value 0 045 m3 for water reuse was used in order to qualify the water reuse benefit a land footprint benefit was assessed based on the area required for the construction of the wwtp a shadow price was used for the estimation of land footprint benefit notably the unit land price per area m2 in different regions of the world varies in a large range e g 0 02 m2 to 640 66 m2 41 47 the unit local based land price was assumed as 500 m2 in the study in order to estimate the land footprint benefit of the systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 cost analysis 3 1 1 capital cost fig 2 indicates the shares of capital cost components for each system the a2o process had the highest share in civil costs with a value of 60 ozgun et al 48 reported that the civil cost had the highest share for large scale wwtps 400 000 m3 day including a2o process the share of electromechanical cost for the a2o process was found to be 26 of the capital cost de kreuk et al 49 reported that the share of the electromechanical cost for the a2o processes was between 25 and 30 of the capital cost on the other hand it was observed that hras mbr process had the highest share in electromechanical cost with a value of 58 the highest share in electromechanical cost in hras mbr process might be related with the membrane used for wastewater treatment in the ags process the civil and electromechanical costs were found to be 45 and 40 of the capital cost respectively fig 2 in the study of de kreuk 50 the share of the electromechanical cost in the ags process was reported as 40 45 of the capital cost all processes had the same share of the control automation cost and engineering consulting cost in the capital cost representing 3 and 1 respectively considering table 4 the capital cost of the ags process was 24 less than the capital cost of the a2o process this lower cost could be related that the ags process had lower construction volume and fewer numbers of mechanical equipment like mixers and pumps compared to the a2o process ags process covered 35 40 lower land footprint than the a2o process it is obvious that ags process is a quite compact process which is a significant advantage in relation to a2o process especially in densely populated areas sengar et al 51 reported that the ags system can save up to 25 75 of land footprint compared to the cas system since ags system can maintain more biomass concentration in the bioreactor and does not require an additional settling tank similarly bengtsson et al 52 pointed out that the cas systems including modified ludzack ettinger activated sludge process with chemical phosphorus removal and university of cape town activated sludge process with biological phosphorus removal require 40 50 higher land footprint compared to the ags system moreover the electricity cost of the ags system 12 310 000 was 20 lower compared to that of the a2o system 15 310 000 rosa masegosa et al 53 reported that the ags system has a 25 50 smaller area for implementation and 23 40 lower electricity cost in comparison to the cas systems besides the capital cost of hras mbr process was 1 2 times higher than that of the a2o process which was related with the additional costs for the mbr system in terms of membranes additional pumps sludge recirculation pumps and permeate pumps and blower costs arif et al 34 reported that the total capital cost of an mbr system was 1 8 times higher than that of a cas process designed only to remove carbon organic compounds and 1 4 times higher than that of a cas process designed to remove carbon and nitrogen similarly zaerpour 54 also found that capital cost of the mbr systems was higher than that of cas systems due to the initial cost of the membranes 3 1 2 o m cost economic analysis of the wwtps must include consideration of the o m costs fig 3 shows the distribution of o m cost components following fig 3 the chemical cost had the highest share in o m cost for hras mbr process with a value of 25 which could be linked with the methanol consumption as a carbon source and more amount of fecl3 usage for chemical phosphate removal compared to the other investigated processes annual fecl3 consumption for chemical phosphate removal was calculated to be 2 400 tons year 1 170 tons year and 14 200 tons year in a2o process ags process and hras mbr process in order whereas only hras mbr process had methanol consumption of 7 300 tons year the chemical cost of the ags process 1 520 000 year was found to be lower than that of the a2o process 2 000 000 year table 5 this lower chemical cost of the ags system could be attributed to the better biological phosphorus removal compared to the a2o system yu et al 55 indicated that ags system could perform excellent nutrient removal without external carbon sources and phosphorus removing agents resulting in a decreased overall o m cost by about 30 it was determined that ags system had slightly lower polyelectrolyte consumption 450 tons year compared to the other systems 560 tons year for a2o system and 570 tons year for hras mbr system which could be related with less sludge production in the ags system in comparison to the other systems it was found that ags system produced 18 less sludge compared to a2o system the main challenges in a2o process are the poor dewaterability of the excess sludge with higher sludge disposal cost ags process can be considered as a good option to overcome these challenges due to its lower sludge production and good sludge dewaterability characteristics the unit energy consumption was averagely calculated as 0 27 kwh m3 0 21 kwh m3 and 0 33 kwh m3 for a2o ags and hras mbr systems in order in the previous studies related to the energy consumption in wwtps including a2o process the unit energy consumption was 0 267 kwh m3 in china 56 0 33 kwh m3 in iran 57 and 0 3 kwh m3 in italy 58 besides the unit energy consumption for the ags system and ab system was reported as 0 17 kwh m3 and 0 33 kwh m3 respectively 59 in this study the unit energy consumption of each system falls within similar ranges reported in the literature the share of energy cost in o m cost for a2o and ags systems was found to be 25 and 23 respectively the lower energy cost in the ags system might be attributed to the absence of mixers return sludge pumping and recirculation of wastewater for nitrogen removal in comparison to the a2o system this finding was in agreement with the results of nancharaiah et al 60 which also attributed the lower energy cost of ags system in comparison to cas system to the absence of mixers conventional recycle pumps and sludge return pump pronk et al 10 reported that the ags process consumed 20 50 less energy compared to the cas processes based on the results obtained from our study the lower energy consumption of 21 was observed in the ags system in comparison to the a2o system moreover hras mbr process had 30 more energy consumption than a2o system the aeration system and the high recycle rate in the mbr stage might be the reason behind the higher energy consumption in hras mbr process only coarse bubble aerators in both the hras process and mbr process were designed in continuous mode while the fine bubble aerators in the bioreactor were controlled by an oxygen set point in the a2o process fine bubble aerators have the advantage of higher transfer efficiency and lower energy requirements compared to coarse bubble aerators fenu et al 61 reported that the fine bubble aeration system contributes to 10 5 of overall energy consumption whereas the coarse bubble aeration system accounts for 35 2 moreover the share of membrane replacement cost in hras mbr process was 20 of the annual o m costs decarolis et al 62 reported that the share of membrane replacement cost was 28 of the o m cost in an mbr system treating municipal wastewater additionally it was reported that the affordable membrane replacement costs in wastewater treatment should be 10 of the equipment costs 63 which was found as 6 in hras mbr process in this study table 5 illustrates annual o m cost for each system ags system had 18 less annual o m cost than a2o system de kreuk 50 and vashi 64 reported that ags system had 7 17 less o m cost than a2o system additionally rosa masegosa et al 53 indicated that ags system requires 20 25 lower o m cost compared to cas systems the low energy consumption of the ags system might contribute to the development of energy neutral or energy positive wwtps 3 1 3 total cost the distribution of total cost components for each system was given in fig 4 considering fig 4 the share of the capital cost was close to each other in a2o and ags systems representing 34 and 32 respectively the unit total cost was calculated to be 0 113 m3 0 091 m3 and 0 195 m3 for a2o process ags process and hras mbr process in order table 6 the relatively lower unit total cost of the ags system could be mainly related with its lower land requirement and less energy consumption compared to the other investigated processes in addition the main reason behind the higher total cost in hras mbr process might be linked with the additional costs for the mbr system in terms of membranes additional pumps and blower costs the unit total cost of the a2o system determined in this study table 6 was consistent with the unit total costs for treatment of the municipal wastewater reported in the literature whereas the unit cost of the ags system was lower than that given in the literature due to economies of scale vuori and ollikainen 65 reported that wastewater treatment becomes less expensive as the capacity of wwtps increases due to economies of scale 3 2 environmental benefits analysis three main environmental benefits energy recovery water reuse potential and land footprint were considered for the analysis of the environmental benefits within the context of this study energy recovery from wwtps via anaerobic digestion of the sludge is one of the great benefits the amount of energy recovery from hras mbr process 99 900 kwh day was found higher than that from the other systems 94 100 kwh day and 80 200 kwh day from a2o process and ags process respectively hras process is mainly used to up concentrate organic matter and promote energy recovery 72 however from an environmental point of view it should be noted that hras mbr process consumed more energy 225 200 kwh day than a2o process 181 500 kwh day and ags process 144 700 kwh day ags process had the least energy consumption in terms of the net energy consumption ags process and hras mbr process required lower land area in comparison to the a2o process hence compared to the a2o system ags and hras mbr systems have alternative land with possible use as farmland or housing area etc this alternative land for ags process and hras mbr process was 95 000 m2 and 97 000 m2 respectively the environmental benefits of each system are represented in table 7 following table 7 hras mbr process had more environmental benefits in comparison to a2o process and ags process which was mainly related with the better effluent quality of hras mbr process hras mbr process could achieve nearly complete removal of suspended solids and provide low bod and cod concentrations in the effluent the effluent quality of the investigated processes was indicated by the effluent quality index eqi in terms of g pollutant per day based on the approach suggested by copp 73 eqi was calculated by using the average concentrations of tss cod tn no3 n and tp in the effluent of each system eqi of the hras mbr process was found to be 26 better than the other systems eqi was 10 3 g pollutant day 10 3 g pollutant day and 7 6 g pollutant day for a2o process ags process and hras mbr process in order sludge from ags process could also be used to harvest biopolymer and generate a resource income 3 3 overall evaluation the cost and environmental benefits of the investigated wastewater treatment systems were holistically considered fig 5 and table s1 electricity can be recovered from excess sludge via combined heat and power chp system this recovery potential was determined to be 94 100 kwh d 80 200 kwh d and 99 900 kwh day for a2o process ags process and hras mbr process in order based on the energy balance the ags system had the most energy efficient treatment system among the other systems with a net energy consumption of around 35 500 kwh d fig 5 the net energy consumptions of the a2o process and hras mbr process were 52 900 kwh d and 90 800 kwh d respectively indeed this was expected since ags system had lower energy consumption than the other systems due to the lack of mixers recycle pumps and return sludge pumps hras mbr process had higher energy recovery with a value of 99 900 kwh day among the other processes however hras mbr process had the highest energy consumption among the other systems due to the aeration system for the membrane and additional pumps thus the net energy consumption of hras mbr process was higher than that of a2o process and ags process it was reported that mbrs had almost three times higher energy consumption compared to cas systems due to the higher energy consumption in coarse bubble aeration system used in mbrs 61 74 net total cost was found to be roughly 18 940 00 year 12 460 000 year and 31 540 000 year for a2o system ags system and hras mbr system in order fig 6 and table s2 overall considering the results presented in fig 5 and fig 6 ags system is the most attractive system compared to a2o system and hras mbr system since the ags system had lower net energy consumption and net total cost than the other systems besides additional benefits can be provided from ags system via aforementioned exopolymers resource recovery these new value added products can improve cost recovery of ags technology 75 ags process provides an overall improvement in efficiency energy cost and reliability for the wastewater treatment process in comparison to a2o process however the studies on energy recovery from excess sludge from ags process are missing several techniques can be applied in order to enhance the biodegradability of sludge and hence enhancing energy recovery potential pre treatment techniques involving either thermal chemical acid alkali and ozone physical mechanical and biological techniques can be used prior to anaerobic digestion to disintegrate biomass and make the organic matter more accessible to microorganisms and thus it accelerates the conversion of organic solids into methane co treatment of complementary feedstocks can be applied to improve the digestibility of mono substrates the addition of different substrates like industrial waste manure and food waste can be utilized to increase methane production in sludge management 76 therefore future studies should focus on the energy recovery from the sludge of ags process 4 conclusions the main purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive techno economic feasibility analysis for three different wastewater treatment systems including a2o process ags process and hras mbr process the main conclusions that can be drawn from this study were provided below ags system had lower capital cost of 24 in comparison to a2o system this might be related with significantly lower construction volume and fewer numbers of mechanical equipment need in the ags system compared to a2o system o m cost of ags system was found to be 18 lower than that of a2o system whereas o m cost of hras mbr system was significantly higher than a2o system the unit total costs were 0 113 m3 0 091 m3 and 0 195 m3 for a2o system ags system and hras mbr system in order from the perspective of net energy consumption and total cost ags system was the most favorable wastewater treatment system among the others compared to a2o system ags system consumed 21 less energy whereas hras mbr system consumed 30 more energy ags system had the lowest net total cost among the other systems ags process can contribute to the development of cost effective and energy neutral or energy positive wwtps in comparison to the other wastewater treatment processes moreover future studies to enhance the energy recovery potential of the excess sludge obtained from ags system could be conducted the presented results can be considered as guidelines and orientations for the techno economic evaluation of

12491,this study focuses on the use of climbing ornamentals and ornamental plants for greywater treatment in vertical flow constructed wetlands different design parameters such as substrate sand or vermiculite the use of saturation zone and plant species trachelospermum jasminoides lonicera japonica callistemon laevis were evaluated for optimal removal of studied pollutants results revealed that regarding the tested substrates sand with or without saturation zone presented significantly higher removal rates for turbidity 94 5 and chemical oxygen demand 96 7 than vermiculite turbidity 54 23 chemical oxygen demand 73 29 moreover slightly higher removal rates were recorded in vegetated systems compared to unvegetated systems according to the findings all examined plants survived and grew in vertical flow constructed wetlands receiving up to 204 mm of greywater per day however l japonica and c laevis are more well adapted to such constructed wetland systems compared to t jasminoides

available on request 1 introduction increased water demand coupled with rapid urbanization and climate change are some of the main driving forces of water crisis therefore alternative water sources such as light greywater that is wastewater discharges from showers baths and washing basins are becoming more attractive 1 light greywater has a great potential for reuse for non potable purposes such as toilet flushing laundry lawn irrigation due its availability its low concentration on pollutant load as well as its reduced public health risk 2 when compared to total domestic wastewater 3 through greywater recycling the potential domestic water savings vary from 9 to 46 4 although there are many technologies for greywater treatment nature based technologies such as constructed wetlands and green walls seem to be more promising due to their low energy requirements 5 living walls are mainly described as vertical vegetation systems that are attached to an internal or external wall 6 they consist of climber plants that grow on the ground or they are potted in containers at the base of the wall 7 some of their main benefits include microclimate improvement especially regarding air quality reduction of the urban heat island phenomenon heat shielding as well as sound insulation 7 9 regarding air quality improvement wood et al 10 presented that the combination of the plants the substrate as well as microorganisms could accomplish 90 removal efficiency of gases such as co2 no2 co so2 moreover djedjig et al 11 demonstrated that their experimental green wall not only did it contribute to streets cooling effect but also it lowered the operative temperature inside the building block up to 5 c however living walls high construction and maintenance costs 12 as well as possible clogging problems 13 constitute some of the main disadvantages of these systems constructed wetlands may demand high space and thus they could not be appropriate in compact urban cities 14 however there are some types that may be more suitable vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcws as a result of the smaller area demand are characterized by lower construction costs moreover they also exhibit higher oxygen transfer capacity when compared to horizontal flow constructed wetlands hfcws 15 arden and ma 16 listed 13 peer reviewed papers describing 38 systems in total regarding greywater treatment through constructed wetland systems more specifically high removal rates of biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and turbidity 70 85 respectively parameters were noted for vfcw systems such results are in accordance with the results of other previous studies which demonstrated that regarding bod chemical oxygen demand cod and tss parameters the removal efficiency was high as well bod 100 and 99 cod 81 and 96 tss 98 and 94 95 17 18 respectively one of the main operational characteristics that directly contribute to the treatment efficacy of vfcws is the filter media 15 apart from the role of filter media to support the plant to grow it is also important for the enhancement of biofilm growth as well as for the filtration of pollutants and adsorption of nutrients 19 20 two substrates that are typically used are sand and gravel epa 1993 as they are sustainable due to their availability and low cost 21 even though sand can be more efficient than gravel it is characterized by low long term phosphorus removal 19 different types of artificial filter media light expanded clay aggregates leca vermiculite crushed marble diatomaceous earth calcite and perlite have been studied as well for their performance in the removal of pollutants such as phosphorus 22 23 regarding vermiculite the results showed that when compared to perlite it contributes to higher p adsorption 24 however when compared to crushed marble diatomaceous earth and calcite its contribution to p removal is low 22 apart from the filter media another important component is vegetation some of plants main benefits regarding cws performance are oxygen provision through the root system 25 surface for microbial attachment and nutrient uptake 26 however there are contrasting results regarding plants contribution in systems performance some studies found no significant differences between planted and unplanted systems with respect to the removal efficiencies of organic matter solids and nutrients 18 27 while others found a significant influence of plants in the cws efficacy 24 28 29 apart from the genera carex cyperus juncus typha and phragmites which are mainly used in cws 30 ornamental plants have also started establishing their appearance in constructed wetlands either due to aesthetic reasons 31 32 or due to economic benefits through selling the flowers in high markets 33 and the production of colors by the extraction industry 34 it has been showed that ornamental plants can be as effective in cw removal performances as the traditional plants that are mentioned above and at the same time enhancing at greater extent cws acceptance from the public 35 37 however the use of ornamental climbing plants as vegetation in vertical flow constructed wetlands for greywater treatment is very limited fowdar et al 7 examined five climbing plants vitis vinifera parthenocissus tricuspidata pandorea jasminoides billardiera scandens and lonicera japonica for greywater treatment in lab scale columns in a greenhouse in australia and they provided promising results regarding the removal of organic matter and suspended solids another study in greece 18 showed that using the climber hederal helix as vfcw vegetation could be an interesting option for improving the aesthetic and the acceptability of the system 6 38 however more research is still need to find additional species of climbing plants that will be potential candidates for use in vfcw and to verify their functionality at a larger and more realistic scale it should be mentioned that using climbing plants in vfcw could potentially improve not only the aesthetic and the acceptance of the system but also offer an opportunity to develop green facades in buildings providing thermal insulation as well thus combining climbing ornamental plants with vfcw could offer the benefits of living walls without the added expense of constructing and maintaining a vertically applied growth medium to the best of our knowledge two of the ornamental plants used in this study trachelospermum jasminoides callistemon laevis have not been previously used in constructed wetlands particularly for greywater treatment additionally there has only been one previous study on use of lonicera japonica 38 moreover one of the tested substrates vermiculite has only been used in another vertical system with unvegetated columns 39 and from our research team in green roof systems 24 therefore further research is required for monitoring vermiculite s performance in vfcws the aim of this study was the evaluation of climbing ornamentals and ornamental plants contribution to greywater treatment in buildings using vertical flow constructed wetlands more specifically the contribution of various functional traits such as substrates presence of saturation zone and different plants were investigated not only for the optimal removal of specific pollutants but also for the possible aesthetical upgrade of these systems via the chosen plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted from january 2021 until december 2021 sixteen identical parallel piped vfcws 4 types of vegetation 2 substrates 2 configurations were installed outdoor in mytilene greece specifically open plastic containers internal width 0 47 m internal length 0 65 m internal height 0 60 m were filled with three layers of materials a drainage layer 10 cm filled with coarse gravel a transition layer 10 cm filled with fine gravel and a main layer 40 cm filled with washed sand or vermiculite as presented in fig 1 and fig s1 the particle sizes of the substrates were washed sand 1 5 mm vermiculite 0 5 3 mm table s1 the outlet of the vfcw was placed at the bottom or 10 cm above

systems contained two individual plants each from one of the three studied species these systems used either washed sand or vermiculite as a substrate and were either unsaturated or partially saturated the remaining four systems operated under the same conditions as the others but were unplanted in order to determine the plants contribution to the systems performance the three examined plants are commonly used as ornamentals plants in greece and are well adapted to the mediterranean climate during the first weeks of the operation systems operated with tap water for plants acclimatization as well as for the establishment of the microbial community in the studied substrates after this period the systems were loaded with synthetic greywater every 4 h by using a time controlled pump during the first four months of operation the hydraulic loading rate hlr was approximately 39 mm d 12 l of greywater per system per day number of flushes per day 6 duration of each

studies 18 table s2 table 1 demonstrates the physicochemical characteristics of the greywater used in the experiment every two to three days the synthetic greywater was added to a plastic tank of 1000

influent and effluent samples were analyzed for ph tss bod cod tp as well as total nitrogen tn and ammonium nh4 the ph was measured using a portable ph meter c932 consort turbidity was measured using a portable turbidity meter 2100q hach moreover tss cod and tp analyses were conducted according to apha 40 tn and nh4 was determined spectrophotometrically using standard test kit hach while bod was determined using the closed respirometric method aqualytic sensor system total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn in the influent was measured according to apha 40 sieve analysis for the substrates was conducted using a laboratory sieve shaker octagon endecotts regarding plant growth traits analysis leaf chlorophyll fluorescence was measured using a pocket pea chlorophyll fluorometer hansatech while chlorophyll content index cci was measured using a ccm 200 plus 25 opti sciences 2 4 data analysis all samples taken from each vfcw were considered as replicates to calculate the mean value and standard deviation throughout the two experimental phases olr1 and olr2 for the examination of whether conventional wastewater quality parameters followed a normal distribution the shapiro wilk test was performed due to the fact that our data were not normally distributed kruskall wallis test was conducted to test the contribution of each operational variable absence or presence of the different plant species two different substrates unsaturated or saturation zone on the effluent quality of the vfcws regarding the conventional wastewater quality parameters between the two studied periods moreover the contribution of the two different substrates was tested on each plant species by measuring the ratio of variable maximum fluorescence fv fm and chlorophyll content index cci values through the text mean numbers are followed by standard deviation sd all statistical tests were performed using originpro 2022 originlab usa software and p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of substrate type and presence of saturation zone fig 2 shows the variation of turbidity and cod concentration in the influents and the effluents of the saturated and unsaturated systems planted with t jasminoides and filled with sand or vermiculite during the two periods of operation with different hlrs and olrs high removal efficiencies were observed during both operational periods while the use of sand as a substrate appears to produce better effluent quality compared to the use of vermiculite specifically turbidity removal in vegetated constructed wetlands filled with sand ranged from 73 to 96 while in those filled with vermiculite the range was from 53 to 94 table 2 these findings are in accordance with previous studies that reported turbidity removal efficiencies between 47 and 97 16 the major mechanism for the removal of turbidity as well as suspended solids from wastewater in constructed wetlands is physical filtration as water flows through the substrate suspended particles are physically filtered out by the porous media and settle onto the surface or become trapped within the substrate 41 in this study the sand used for the experiments was a finer material than the vermiculite and as a consequence the vfcw filled with sand achieved higher removal efficiencies for both turbidity and tss compared to the vfcw filled with vermiculite fig 3 similar high efficiencies were also recorded regarding organic matter removal ranged from about 80 up to 100 in vfcw filled with sand and from approximately 50 up to 99 in vfcw filled with sand similar results have also been noted to other studies 18 24 42 that treated greywater using constructed wetlands kotsia et al 18 used fine sand as their systems media and noted 90 removal rates of bod and cod respectively thomaidi et al 24 used vermiculite as one of their studied substrates and found up to 90 removal rates for cod it is known that finer medias provide higher surface area for microbial growth and increase contact time between media and the wastewater 41 that is also the case in this study as the quantity of the fraction of fine grain size of sand 50 μm was more 1 4 g than that of vermiculite 0 29 g the presence of different substrates and saturation zone did not have a significant impact p 0 05 on tp removal during both operational periods however during the first period it was noted that most of the systems with sand with or without saturation zone had slightly lower concentrations e g tssz 3 7 1 3 mg l ls 3 9 1 8 mg l cs 3 8 1 4 mg l as well as higher removal rates e g tssz 30 24 ls 28 24 cs 30 26 than those with vermiculite tvsz 4 1 2 3 mg l 27 23 lv 4 8 1 5 mg l 17 21 cv 3 7 1 1 mg l 30 23 respectively table 2 during the second period some systems with sand and saturation zone as well as those without had rather lower values e g tssz 3 1 2 7 mg l ls 3 4 3 4 mg l respectively and slightly higher removal rates e g tssz 24 24 ls 17 28 respectively from those with vermiculite e g tvsz 3 3 3 3 mg l 19 39 lv 3 9 3 5 mg l 5 28 respectively table 2 fig 3 it can be deduced that both studied substrates contributed poorly to tp removal our results are in accordance with kotsia et al 18 and prodanovic et al 39 who also demonstrated tp removal rates up to 20 apart from plant uptake in combination with biomass harvest which is one of the main mechanisms for phosphorus removal 43 adsorption and chemical precipitation are being referred as well 41 brix et al 22 demonstrated that mostly the presence of calcium ca in the substrate plays a significant role in phosphorus removal due to its ability to create bond with this mineral at ph 6 44 which is the ph of our wastewater as well while aluminum al and iron fe are of least concern at such ph levels thus the presence of low calcium content in both growing medias could explain our results moreover as it has already been applied that sand may have contributed slightly more to phosphorus removal than vermiculite due to its finer grain size allowing more contact time of greywater and higher surface area for p adsorption 39 41 regarding the presence of saturation zone it has been previously described that lower do levels can be associated with higher phosphorus removal rates due to the presence of the polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos 45 table 2 shows that moderate to high removal efficiencies were recorded for total nitrogen during the first operational period tn concentration decreased by approximately 30 60 and during the second operational period it decreased by about 50 80 throughout the experimental period the concentration of nh4 n in the effluent remained below the detection limit 2 0 mg l indicating that almost all of the nh4 n produced due to the ammonification of organic nitrogen was nitrified in the constructed wetland the tn removals recorded in this study are at the upper limits of values recorded in previous works for example in a review article arden and ma 16 reported tn removal efficiencies in constructed wetlands for greywater treatment ranging from 44 to 59 while boano et al 5 found tn removal efficiencies between 46 and 78 in their review of pilot scale and full scale constructed wetlands for light greywater treatment similar to this study they recorded a tendency for increasing removal efficiencies as hlr increased the increase of hlr resulted in the presence of organic matter in the effluent promoting the denitrification process additionally nitrogen removal in vertical flow constructed wetlands can increase as the system matures as the plants and microbial communities within the system develop a more complex and diverse network of interactions improved removal of nitrogen through processes such as nitrification and denitrification can occur the use of a saturation zone was found also to improve the total nitrogen removal table 2 as it can enhance denitrification by providing anoxic conditions while vfcw is considered an aerobic system that enhances nitrification the use of a saturation zone provides anoxic conditions that enhance denitrification 41 3 2 plant contribution plants are characterized as an essential element in cws due to their crucial contribution to wastewater treatment processes 46 nutrient uptake through the root system provision of surface and increased oxygen concentration for microbial growth 47 as well as clogging evasion 48 are some of the key roles that plants possess in cws the contribution of plants in the percentage removal of the studied contaminants is demonstrated in fig 3 and table 2 in both studied periods systems with ornamental plants were characterized with slightly higher removal rates for most of the studied parameters more specifically during the first period of operation the only parameters where unvegetated systems noted higher removal rates when compared to their corresponding vegetated systems where among the systems with vermiculite and saturation zone as for turbidity and tss 94 9 97 4 respectively moreover regarding tp unvegetated systems among the sand with saturation zone as well as the systems with sand and not saturation zone had slightly higher removal rates compared to the vegetated ones table 2 therefore mostly the vegetated systems contributed to higher removal performance it should be mentioned that the age of the systems and season may also have an effect on the pollutant s removal performance of the examined constructed wetlands as it has been observed that more developed systems can achieve higher removal rates 49 during the second period of operation for turbidity tss cod and tp parameters mainly planted systems noted slightly higher removal rates than the unvegetated to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that t jasminoides ornamental climbing plant is used in vfcw systems moreover l japonica has been characterized as an effective species for greywater treatment in living walls especially for nutrients removal tn tp 7 results deriving from various research projects that investigated plants performance in comparison to unplanted systems are contradictory no effect of ornamental plants in organic 18 and nutrient pollutants 24 in vfcw systems have been noted before however in vymazal review 47 most research demonstrated that pollutants removal efficiency was positively affected by plants presence another research has demonstrated that ornamental plants performance in pollutants removal is as promising and satisfactory as common reeds performance and thus can replace them as well 37 furthermore the presence of ornamental plants not only provides an aesthetic improvement on these systems 1 when compared to the common reeds that are usually used but also it has been deduced that the cost of these plants does not impact at a great extent the overall cost of the systems construction 18 nonetheless directly nutrients uptake provision of oxygen in the systems through their root system 25 or indirectly carbon replenish through root exudates sites for microorganism growth 47 plants can increase the acceptability of cw systems furthermore incorporating climbing plants into vfcws can create green facades on buildings which can provide thermal insulation reduce urban temperatures mitigate noise pollution and at the same time treat and recycle greywater for indoor non potable use 3 3 plant adaptation leaf chlorophyll not only indicates leaf greenness but is also used to investigate leaf nutrient deficiencies and changes in chlorophyll 50 fig 4 demonstrates cci values of the studied plants during both operational periods during the first period of operation no statistically significant differences were found between the systems with sand with or without saturation zone and the corresponding ones with vermiculite for each studied plant however during the second period t jasminoides system with sand and saturation zone as well as with only sand had statistically significant p 0 05 higher cci values 87 31 66 28 respectively when compared to their correspondings with vermiculite 54 14 42 9 respectively however no significant differences between the substrates for l japonica and c laevis systems were obtained it is also important to be noted that during summer months of olr2 t jasminoides and l japonica cci values were slightly lower than the ones during autumn months such results could be explained by the fact that both plants are partially deciduous thus the new leaves that sprouted up had much lower cci values moreover in another study hedera helix a non deciduous climbing plant faced a decrease in the cci values during winter months while the exact opposite trend occurred during growing season 18 except for photosynthesis and re emission as heat which are two of the three pathways that light energy that is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules can follow the third is the re emission as light fluorescence moreover these three processes do exist in competition with each other hence chlorophyll fluorescence emission can provide valuable information about the quantum efficiency of photochemistry and heat dissipation 51 the ratio of variable maximum fluorescence fv fm which is a quantitative measure of the photochemical efficiency of photosystem psii can provide valuable information on this systems function as it has been observed that under severe environmental stress conditions a decrease has been noted in fv fm ratio 52 it is important to be noted that fv fm values lower than 0 83 indicate exposure to stress and more specifically to photoinhibition 53 it is believed that t jasminoides and l japonica were affected by the higher organic and hydraulic loading rates during the second period as a drop in their fv fm values is presented in fig 5 similar results but detrimental in this case were also obtained in another study that used ornamental plants in cw systems for municipal wastewater treatment iris pseudacorus and eichornia crassipes could not survive higher loading rates of the sewage as well as higher nutrient concentrations 54 in this study even though c laevis plants were facing photoinhibition from the very beginning especially during the winter season due to its unfavorable weather conditions heavy rainfall period low temperature frequent irrigation they managed to survive and acclimatize to the vfcws regarding substrates and configurations contribution to fv fm values of each system no statistically significant results were noted during both operational periods however some systems with sand with or without saturation zone had slightly higher fv fm values when compared to the corresponding with vermiculite e g olr2 t jasminoides sand and saturation zone 0 79 0 06 vermiculite and saturation zone 0 81 0 01 l japonica sand 0 81 0 06 vermiculite 0 77 0 04 c laevis sand 0 82 0 02 vermiculite 0 81 0 05 planned comparisons between the studied plants revealed that during the first period l japonica had statistically significant p 0 05 higher fv fm values 0 83 0 01 in comparison to t jasminoides 0 77 0 01 and c laevis 0 76 0 03 according to the statistical results concerning the second period not only l japonica differed statistically p 0 05 from t jasminoides but also c laevis both plants demonstrated higher values 0 81 0 03 0 82 0 02 respectively than t jasminoides leading to the conclusion that these plants are the most suitable for vfcws operating with greywater 4 conclusions this study aimed to evaluate the potential use of climbing ornamental and ornamental plants in vertical flow constructed wetlands for greywater treatment the evaluation considered the plants adaptation and growth as well as their effect on the pollutant removal performance results showed that the aesthetic enhancement of the systems was remarkably discernible with the use of climbing ornamental plants data collected on chlorophyll fluorescence and chlorophyll content index from the leaves of plants indicated that l japonica and c laevis were well adapted and grew well in vertical flow constructed wetlands however t jasminoides showed low fv fm values indicating possible plant stress regarding their effect on removal performance planted systems had slightly higher removal rates compared to unplanted ones moreover sand systems with or without saturation zone outperformed the corresponding systems with vermiculite in most parameters studied significant high removal efficiencies were observed for turbidity suspended solids organic matter and nitrogen providing a high quality water effluent that can potentially be recycled for indoor non potable uses overall the use of vfcws planted with l japonica and c laevis seems to be a feasible method for treating greywater in buildings enhancing the aesthetic of the system and producing high quality water effluent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article acknowledgments the research

12491,this study focuses on the use of climbing ornamentals and ornamental plants for greywater treatment in vertical flow constructed wetlands different design parameters such as substrate sand or vermiculite the use of saturation zone and plant species trachelospermum jasminoides lonicera japonica callistemon laevis were evaluated for optimal removal of studied pollutants results revealed that regarding the tested substrates sand with or without saturation zone presented significantly higher removal rates for turbidity 94 5 and chemical oxygen demand 96 7 than vermiculite turbidity 54 23 chemical oxygen demand 73 29 moreover slightly higher removal rates were recorded in vegetated systems compared to unvegetated systems according to the findings all examined plants survived and grew in vertical flow constructed wetlands receiving up to 204 mm of greywater per day however l japonica and c laevis are more well adapted to such constructed wetland systems compared to t jasminoides

available on request 1 introduction increased water demand coupled with rapid urbanization and climate change are some of the main driving forces of water crisis therefore alternative water sources such as light greywater that is wastewater discharges from showers baths and washing basins are becoming more attractive 1 light greywater has a great potential for reuse for non potable purposes such as toilet flushing laundry lawn irrigation due its availability its low concentration on pollutant load as well as its reduced public health risk 2 when compared to total domestic wastewater 3 through greywater recycling the potential domestic water savings vary from 9 to 46 4 although there are many technologies for greywater treatment nature based technologies such as constructed wetlands and green walls seem to be more promising due to their low energy requirements 5 living walls are mainly described as vertical vegetation systems that are attached to an internal or external wall 6 they consist of climber plants that grow on the ground or they are potted in containers at the base of the wall 7 some of their main benefits include microclimate improvement especially regarding air quality reduction of the urban heat island phenomenon heat shielding as well as sound insulation 7 9 regarding air quality improvement wood et al 10 presented that the combination of the plants the substrate as well as microorganisms could accomplish 90 removal efficiency of gases such as co2 no2 co so2 moreover djedjig et al 11 demonstrated that their experimental green wall not only did it contribute to streets cooling effect but also it lowered the operative temperature inside the building block up to 5 c however living walls high construction and maintenance costs 12 as well as possible clogging problems 13 constitute some of the main disadvantages of these systems constructed wetlands may demand high space and thus they could not be appropriate in compact urban cities 14 however there are some types that may be more suitable vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcws as a result of the smaller area demand are characterized by lower construction costs moreover they also exhibit higher oxygen transfer capacity when compared to horizontal flow constructed wetlands hfcws 15 arden and ma 16 listed 13 peer reviewed papers describing 38 systems in total regarding greywater treatment through constructed wetland systems more specifically high removal rates of biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and turbidity 70 85 respectively parameters were noted for vfcw systems such results are in accordance with the results of other previous studies which demonstrated that regarding bod chemical oxygen demand cod and tss parameters the removal efficiency was high as well bod 100 and 99 cod 81 and 96 tss 98 and 94 95 17 18 respectively one of the main operational characteristics that directly contribute to the treatment efficacy of vfcws is the filter media 15 apart from the role of filter media to support the plant to grow it is also important for the enhancement of biofilm growth as well as for the filtration of pollutants and adsorption of nutrients 19 20 two substrates that are typically used are sand and gravel epa 1993 as they are sustainable due to their availability and low cost 21 even though sand can be more efficient than gravel it is characterized by low long term phosphorus removal 19 different types of artificial filter media light expanded clay aggregates leca vermiculite crushed marble diatomaceous earth calcite and perlite have been studied as well for their performance in the removal of pollutants such as phosphorus 22 23 regarding vermiculite the results showed that when compared to perlite it contributes to higher p adsorption 24 however when compared to crushed marble diatomaceous earth and calcite its contribution to p removal is low 22 apart from the filter media another important component is vegetation some of plants main benefits regarding cws performance are oxygen provision through the root system 25 surface for microbial attachment and nutrient uptake 26 however there are contrasting results regarding plants contribution in systems performance some studies found no significant differences between planted and unplanted systems with respect to the removal efficiencies of organic matter solids and nutrients 18 27 while others found a significant influence of plants in the cws efficacy 24 28 29 apart from the genera carex cyperus juncus typha and phragmites which are mainly used in cws 30 ornamental plants have also started establishing their appearance in constructed wetlands either due to aesthetic reasons 31 32 or due to economic benefits through selling the flowers in high markets 33 and the production of colors by the extraction industry 34 it has been showed that ornamental plants can be as effective in cw removal performances as the traditional plants that are mentioned above and at the same time enhancing at greater extent cws acceptance from the public 35 37 however the use of ornamental climbing plants as vegetation in vertical flow constructed

for greywater treatment additionally there has only been one previous study on use of lonicera japonica 38 moreover one of the tested substrates vermiculite has only been used in another vertical system with unvegetated columns 39 and from our research team in green roof systems 24 therefore further research is required for monitoring vermiculite s performance in vfcws the aim of this study

reported turbidity removal efficiencies between 47 and 97 16 the major mechanism for the removal of turbidity as well as suspended solids from wastewater in constructed wetlands is physical filtration as water flows through the substrate suspended particles are physically filtered out by the porous media and settle onto the surface or become trapped within the substrate 41 in this study the sand used for the experiments was a finer material than the vermiculite and as a consequence the vfcw filled with sand achieved higher removal efficiencies for both turbidity and tss compared to the vfcw filled with vermiculite fig 3 similar high efficiencies were also recorded regarding organic matter removal ranged from about 80 up to 100 in vfcw filled with sand and from approximately 50 up to 99 in vfcw filled with sand similar results have also been noted to other studies 18 24 42 that treated greywater using constructed wetlands kotsia et al 18 used fine sand as their systems media and noted 90 removal rates of bod and cod respectively thomaidi et al 24 used vermiculite as one of their studied substrates and found up to 90 removal rates for cod it is known that finer medias provide higher surface area for microbial growth and increase contact time between media and the wastewater 41 that is also the case in this study as the quantity of the fraction of fine grain size of sand 50 μm was more 1 4 g than that of vermiculite 0 29 g the presence of different substrates and saturation zone did not have a significant impact p 0 05 on tp removal during both operational periods however during the first period it was noted that most of the systems with sand with or without saturation zone had slightly lower concentrations e g tssz 3 7 1 3 mg l ls 3 9 1 8 mg l cs 3 8 1 4 mg l as well as higher removal rates e g tssz 30 24 ls 28 24 cs 30 26 than those with vermiculite tvsz 4 1 2 3 mg l 27 23 lv 4 8 1 5 mg l 17 21 cv 3 7 1 1 mg l 30 23 respectively table 2 during the second period some systems with sand and saturation zone as well as those without had rather lower values e g tssz 3 1 2 7 mg l ls 3 4 3 4 mg l respectively and slightly higher removal rates e g tssz 24 24 ls 17 28 respectively from those with vermiculite e g tvsz 3 3 3 3 mg l 19 39 lv 3 9 3 5 mg l 5 28 respectively table 2 fig 3 it can be deduced that both studied substrates contributed poorly to tp removal our results are in accordance with kotsia et al 18 and prodanovic et al 39 who also demonstrated tp removal rates up to 20 apart from plant uptake in combination with biomass harvest which is one of the main mechanisms for phosphorus removal 43 adsorption and chemical precipitation are being referred as well 41 brix et al 22 demonstrated that mostly the presence of calcium ca in the substrate plays a significant role in phosphorus removal due to its ability to create bond with this mineral at ph 6 44 which is the ph of our wastewater as well while aluminum al and iron fe are of least concern at such ph levels thus the presence of low calcium content in both growing medias could explain our results moreover as it has already been applied that sand may have contributed slightly more to phosphorus removal than vermiculite due to its finer grain size allowing more contact time of greywater and higher surface area for p adsorption 39 41 regarding the presence of saturation zone it has been previously described that lower do levels can be associated with higher phosphorus removal rates due to the presence of the polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos 45 table 2 shows that moderate to high removal efficiencies were recorded for total nitrogen during the first operational period tn concentration decreased by approximately 30 60 and during the second operational period it decreased by about 50 80 throughout the experimental period the concentration of nh4 n in the effluent remained below the detection limit 2 0 mg l indicating that almost all of the nh4 n produced due to the ammonification of organic nitrogen was nitrified in the constructed wetland the tn removals recorded in this study are at the upper limits of values recorded in previous works for example in a review article arden and ma 16 reported tn removal efficiencies in constructed wetlands for greywater treatment ranging from 44 to 59 while boano et al 5 found tn removal efficiencies between 46 and 78 in their review of pilot scale and full scale constructed wetlands for light greywater treatment similar to this study they recorded a tendency for increasing removal efficiencies as hlr increased the increase of hlr resulted in the presence of organic matter in the effluent promoting the denitrification process additionally nitrogen removal in vertical flow constructed wetlands can increase as the system matures as the plants and microbial communities within the system develop a more complex and diverse network of interactions improved removal of nitrogen through processes such as nitrification and denitrification can occur the use of a saturation zone was found also to improve the total nitrogen removal table 2 as it can enhance denitrification by providing anoxic conditions while vfcw is considered an aerobic system that enhances nitrification the use of a saturation zone provides anoxic conditions that enhance denitrification 41 3 2 plant contribution plants are characterized as an essential element in cws due to their crucial contribution to wastewater treatment processes 46 nutrient uptake through the root system provision of surface and increased oxygen concentration for microbial growth 47 as well as clogging evasion 48 are some of the key roles that plants possess in cws the contribution of plants in the percentage removal of the studied contaminants is demonstrated in fig 3 and table 2 in both studied periods systems with ornamental plants were characterized with slightly higher removal rates for most of the studied parameters more specifically during the first period of operation the only parameters where unvegetated systems noted higher removal rates when compared to their corresponding vegetated systems where among the systems with vermiculite and saturation zone as for turbidity and tss 94 9 97 4 respectively moreover regarding tp unvegetated systems among the sand with saturation zone as well as the systems with sand and not saturation zone had slightly higher removal rates compared to the vegetated ones table 2 therefore mostly the vegetated systems contributed to higher removal performance it should be mentioned that the age of the systems and season may also have an effect on the pollutant s removal performance of the examined constructed wetlands as it has been observed that more developed systems can achieve higher removal rates 49 during the second period of operation for turbidity tss cod and tp parameters mainly planted systems noted slightly higher removal rates than the unvegetated to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that t jasminoides ornamental climbing plant is used in vfcw systems moreover l japonica has been characterized as an effective species for greywater treatment in living walls especially for nutrients removal tn tp 7 results deriving from various research projects that investigated plants performance in comparison to unplanted systems are contradictory no effect of ornamental plants in organic 18 and nutrient pollutants 24 in vfcw systems have been noted before however in vymazal review 47 most research demonstrated that pollutants removal efficiency was positively affected by plants presence another research has demonstrated that ornamental plants performance in pollutants removal is as promising and satisfactory as common reeds performance and thus can replace them as well 37 furthermore the presence of ornamental plants not only provides an aesthetic improvement on these systems 1 when compared to the common reeds that are usually used but also it has been deduced that the cost of these plants does not impact at a great extent the overall cost of the systems construction 18 nonetheless directly nutrients uptake provision of oxygen in the systems through their root system 25 or indirectly carbon replenish through root exudates sites for microorganism growth 47 plants can increase the acceptability of cw systems furthermore incorporating climbing plants into vfcws can create green facades on buildings which can provide thermal insulation reduce urban temperatures mitigate noise pollution and at the same time treat and recycle greywater for indoor non potable use 3 3 plant adaptation leaf chlorophyll not only indicates leaf greenness but is also used to investigate leaf nutrient deficiencies and changes in chlorophyll 50 fig 4 demonstrates cci values of the studied plants during both operational periods during the first period of operation no statistically significant differences were found between the systems with sand with or without saturation zone and the corresponding ones with vermiculite for each studied plant however during the second period t jasminoides system with sand and saturation zone as well as with only sand had statistically significant p 0 05 higher cci values 87 31 66 28 respectively when compared to their correspondings with vermiculite 54 14 42 9 respectively however no significant differences between the substrates for l japonica and c laevis systems were obtained it is also important to be noted that during summer months of olr2 t jasminoides and l japonica cci values were slightly lower than the ones during autumn months such results could be explained by the fact that both plants are partially deciduous thus the new leaves that sprouted up had much lower cci values moreover in another study hedera helix a non deciduous climbing plant faced a decrease in the cci values during winter months while the exact opposite trend occurred during growing season 18 except for photosynthesis and re emission as heat which are two of the three pathways that light energy that is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules can follow the third is the re emission as light fluorescence moreover these three processes do exist in competition with each other hence chlorophyll fluorescence emission can provide valuable information about the quantum efficiency of photochemistry and heat dissipation 51 the ratio of variable maximum fluorescence fv fm which is a quantitative measure of the photochemical efficiency of photosystem psii can provide valuable information on this systems function as it has been observed that under severe environmental stress conditions a decrease has been noted in fv fm ratio 52 it is important to be noted that fv fm values lower than 0 83 indicate exposure to stress and more specifically to photoinhibition 53 it is believed that t jasminoides and l japonica were affected by the higher organic and hydraulic loading rates during the second period as a drop in their fv fm values is presented in fig 5 similar results but detrimental in this case were also obtained in another study that used ornamental plants in cw systems for municipal wastewater treatment iris pseudacorus and eichornia crassipes could not survive higher loading rates of the sewage as well as higher nutrient concentrations 54 in this study even though c laevis plants were facing photoinhibition from the very beginning especially during the winter season due to its unfavorable weather conditions heavy rainfall period low temperature frequent irrigation they managed to survive and acclimatize to the vfcws regarding substrates and configurations contribution to fv fm values of each system no statistically significant results were noted during both operational periods however some systems with sand with or without saturation zone had slightly higher fv fm values when compared to the corresponding with vermiculite e g olr2 t jasminoides sand and saturation zone 0 79 0 06 vermiculite and saturation zone 0 81 0 01 l japonica sand 0 81 0 06 vermiculite 0 77 0 04 c laevis sand 0 82 0 02 vermiculite 0 81 0 05 planned comparisons between the studied plants revealed that during the first period l japonica had statistically significant p 0 05 higher fv fm values 0 83 0 01 in comparison to t jasminoides 0 77 0 01 and c laevis 0 76 0 03 according to the statistical results concerning the second period not only l japonica differed statistically p 0 05 from t jasminoides but also c laevis both plants demonstrated higher values 0 81 0 03 0 82 0 02 respectively than t jasminoides leading to the conclusion that these plants are the most suitable for vfcws operating with greywater 4 conclusions this study aimed to evaluate the potential use of climbing ornamental and ornamental plants in vertical flow constructed wetlands for greywater treatment the evaluation considered the plants adaptation and growth as well as their effect on the pollutant removal performance results showed that the aesthetic enhancement of the systems was remarkably discernible with the use of climbing ornamental plants data collected on chlorophyll fluorescence and chlorophyll content index from the leaves of plants indicated that l japonica and c laevis were well adapted and grew well in vertical flow constructed wetlands however t jasminoides showed low fv fm values indicating possible plant stress regarding their effect on removal performance planted systems had slightly higher removal rates compared to unplanted ones moreover sand systems with or without saturation zone outperformed the corresponding systems with vermiculite in most parameters studied significant high removal efficiencies were observed for turbidity suspended solids organic matter and nitrogen providing a high quality water effluent that can potentially be recycled for indoor non potable uses overall the use of vfcws planted with l japonica and c laevis seems to be a feasible method for treating greywater in buildings enhancing the aesthetic of the system and producing high quality water effluent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article acknowledgments the research

12492,in this study the magnetic cobalt iron composite loaded on carbon derived from cigarette butts cofe ccb was successfully prepared for the first time and applied for the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms to degrade rhodamine b rhb the results indicated that approximately 99 of rhb 50 mg l was degraded by cofe ccb 0 04 g l activated pms 0 3 mm within 15 min the reactive oxygen species ros in the reaction system were identified to be oh so4 and 1o2 which responsible for the rapid degradation of rhb it was also found that rhb could be efficiently removed in real water matrixes demonstrating that cofe ccb has excellent anti interference performance meanwhile strong magnetism of cofe ccb made it easy to separate from water and recover for reuse these results fully proved that cofe ccb has good practical application potential in addition the combination of cofe ccb and pms still exhibited outstanding degradation efficiencies of phenacetin pnt bisphenol a bpa sulfamethazine smz and 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d therefore this study provides a new method for the reuse of discarded cigarette butts to fabricate catalysts with extremely superior performance and easy to use for pms activation to eliminate organic pollutants from wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords discarded cigarette butts magnetic co fe composite peroxymonosulfate activation degradation of rhodamine b data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction an introduction of dyes usually is an essential in industries such as textiles foodstuffs and leather process but at the same time the non regulated discharge of dye wastewater has also caused great harm to the environment 1 dye wastewater has complex composition strong resistance to photolysis and oxidation and contains a variety of biotoxic organic compounds 2 rhodamine b rhb is a kind of cationic dye with good water solubility which is characterized by stable structure difficult degradation and high toxicity 3 rhb is commonly eliminated from wastewater via physical chemical and biological methods 4 however the removal efficiencies of these methods are often not high some of them still cause secondary pollution 5 therefore it is urgent to exploit new ways to degrade rhb advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely used to degrade organic pollutants in recent years because aops can produce reactive oxygen species ros such as sulfate radicals so4 hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 6 8 so4 has a long half life t 1 2 30 40 μs and a high redox potential e 0 2 5 3 1 v 9 and is generally considered the more efficient ros aops based on the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms have been shown to be effective in removing rhb from water 10 the activation of pms by transition metal based catalysts have attracted wide attention 11 for example a metal organic framework material containing co as a catalyst was successfully fabricated for pms activation to degrade rhb 12 the combination of fe and co co doped mofs and pms could realize 97 removal rate of rhb 13 wu et al 14 supported fe on activated carbon to activate pms and the degradation efficiency of 100 mg l rhb reached about 96 within 30 min carbon materials as a supporter of metals or metal oxides also exhibited the outstanding performance to degrade other organic pollutants with an assistance of pms 15 16 thus it could be concluded that carbon materials play an important role in aops based on pms activation by heterogeneous catalysts for the treatment of wastewater containing organic compounds waste cigarette butts are also a kind of carbon source material it has been reported that about 6 trillion cigarettes are consumed worldwide every year and about half of the butts couldn t be disposed of properly 17 as the main component of cigarette butts plasticized cellulose acetate is hard to degrade naturally in the environment 18 in addition there are many kinds of harmful substances in cigarette butts which will do harm to both nature and human therefore it is very meaningful to try to transform cigarette butts into carbon serving as carriers of metal or metallic oxide catalysts realizing the strategy of treat waste by waste in this study the mixture of cobalt and iron composites as well as discarded cigarette butts was calcined under nitrogen protection to obtain a solid mixture containing c and then the solid mixture was further calcined in air to form stable oxides loaded on the carbon which was labeled as cofe ccb the structure and property of cofe ccb were investigated in detail via a series of characterizations the catalytic performance of the obtained material for pms activation was assessed by the degradation of rhb with different catalytic dosages pms concentrations and initial ph the practical application potential of cofe ccb was also evaluated through coexisting ions ha real water samples and recycling tests finally the underlying catalytic mechanism and the possible pathways of rhb degradation were proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials co no3 2 6h2o was bought from aladdin industry corporation shanghai china fe no3 3 9h2o was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china the waste cigarette butts were supplied by china tobacco jiangsu industrial company the information of the other reagents used in this study is listed in text s1 2 2 preparation of catalysts the magnetic cobalt iron composite loaded on carbon derived from cigarette butts cofe ccb was prepared by the following method firstly 2 mmol of co no3 2 6h2o and 2 mmol of fe no3 3 9h2o were dissolved in 40 ml deionized water and then 1 g of mashed cigarette butts cb was introduced into the solution the mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 30 min on the other hand 0 8 g naoh was dissolved in 5 ml deionized water which was added drop by drop into the above mixture after that the mixture was heated to evaporate water the resultant solid was further dried in a drying furnace at 70 c for 6 h after drying the solid was calcined in a tube furnace in nitrogen atmosphere at 600 c at a heating rate of 5 c min for 2 h subsequently the calcination was further conducted in the air at 300 c at a heating rate of 5 c min for another 2 h finally the calcined material cofe ccb was washed by deionized water three times dried in a drying furnace at 90 c for 6 h and ground into powder for use for the sake of comparison carbon derived from cigarette butts ccb and cobalt and iron loaded on ccb co ccb fe ccb were also prepared respectively following to the same processes as described above 2 3 characterization the characterization of the catalysts is expressed in text s2 2 4 experimental procedures all batch experiments were performed in a 250 ml reaction bottle first 100 ml of the solution containing the contaminant 50 mg l and pms 0 3 mm was added into the reaction bottle the initial ph was adjusted to the desired value using 0 5 mm h2so4 and naoh after 4 mg of the catalyst was introduced the reaction bottle was placed in a water bath shaker at 180 rpm and 25 c to start the reaction at regular intervals about 2 5 ml of the solution was sucked with a disposable syringe passed through a 0 22 μm filter membrane and the filtrate was collected in a clear tube 20 μl sodium sulfite solution 1 mol l was immediately added into the filtrate to quench radical reactions finally 1 ml filtrate was used for the concentration determination of the residual rhb in the solution to evaluate the effect of the leached metal ions on rhb degradation a specific experiment was conducted according to the previous report 19 which is described in text s3 2 5 analytical methods the analytical methods used in this study are shown in text s4 the electrochemical experiments were performed and the detail processes are expressed in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization fig 1 shows the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the catalysts it can be seen from fig 1a that the diffraction peaks at 44 76 65 16 and 82 53 correspond to the 1 1 0 2 0 0 and 2 1 1 crystal planes of zero valent iron zvi respectively pdf 87 0722 no characteristic peaks of co are observed from fig 1 the possible reason is that the peak intensity of fe in cofe ccb is too high covering the peaks of other substances the xrd patterns of co ccb and fe ccb are shown in fig 1b and c respectively the diffraction peaks corresponding to the 2 2 0 3 1 1 4 0 0 5 1 1 and 4 4 0 crystal planes of co3o4 pdf 78 1969 fig 1b are clearly observed at 2theta 31 27 36 84 44 80 59 35 and 65 22 respectively as shown in fig 1c the diffraction peaks appearing at 2theta 30 16 35 52 43 17 53 56 57 10 and 62 70 are ascribed to the 2 2 0 3 1 1 4 0 0 4 2 2 5 1 1 and 4 4 0 crystal planes of fe3o4 pdf 88 0315 in addition the characteristic diffraction peaks of zvi are also observed at 2theta 44 76 65 16 and 82 53 from fig 1 it can be inferred that the intensities of co3o4 and fe3o4 characteristic peaks were much weaker than that of zvi which proves the above analysis the sem patterns of cofe ccb cofe and ccb are illustrated in fig 2a b and c respectively it can be clearly observed from these patterns that the particles of cofe adhered to the surface of ccb with flaky the tem image of cofe ccb fig 2d demonstrates that some particles were covered by flaky ccb and these structures were further characterized and enlarged via hrtem fig s1 the lattice fringes of 0 20 0 25 and 0 24 nm were indexed to the 1 1 0 crystal plane of fe the 3 1 1 crystal plane of fe3o4 and the 3 1 1 crystal plane of co3o4 respectively which were in accordance with the results of xrd spectra therein it can be seen that the cofe particles also existed in the interior of ccb the bet surface areas average pore diameters and cumulative pore volumes of these three materials were measured and the results are listed in table s1 the bet surface areas of cofe ccb cofe and ccb were 97 45 36 64 and 506 9 m2 g respectively the results proved that the bet surface area of cofe ccb could be effectively improved by loading cofe onto ccb which is conducive to the exposing of more active sites the elemental mapping images of cofe ccb are illustrated in fig 2e h as can be seen from these figures the elements of co fe c and o were evenly distributed in the catalyst the xps spectra of cofe ccb are demonstrated in fig 3 the presence of co fe o and c is observed in the catalyst fig 3a which is consistent with the results of the elemental mapping images these elemental percentages changed little before and after reaction see fig 3a suggesting that the catalyst has good stability fig 3b e shows the high resolution scanning patterns of each element in cofe ccb as shown in fig 3b a strong peak appeared at 284 80 ev which was the characteristic peak of the cc bond the peaks centering at 286 35 and 288 89 ev are attributed to the co bond and the co bond respectively 20 the peak at 530 27 ev fig 3c is characteristic of the feo bond hydroxyl group oh corresponds to the peak at 531 43 ev the peak intensity of co co 532 41 ev increased significantly after reaction which is well consistent with those shown in fig 3b the peak at 533 38 ev belongs to chemisorbed water h2o 21 22 the high resolution scanning pattern of co 2p could be divided into two orbits fig 3d which belong to the orbits of 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 respectively the peaks at 780 25 and 782 13 ev are ascribed to co3 and co2 respectively 23 in fig 3e the diffraction peak of fe 2p could also be divided into two orbits 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 by fitting the peak of 2p3 2 orbit two peaks at 713 16 and 710 96 ev are observed which represent fe3 and fe2 respectively a weak peak at 707 04 ev is attributed to zvi 24 these results mean that most of fe on the surface of the catalyst was oxidized it is considered that xps spectra only detect a few nanolayers on the surface of the materials so the peak strength of zvi in cofe ccb is not high based on the analyses above it can be concluded that cofe ccb was composed of co3o4 fe3o4 and zvi 3 2 catalytic activity in order to evaluate the catalytic performance of cofe ccb the degradation of rhb in different systems were investigated fig 4 it is observed that 10 of rhb was removed in the presence of cofe ccb alone within 15 min indicating that the adsorption of rhb toward cofe ccb was weak about 15 of rhb was degraded by pms during the same time which is ascribed to the contribution of pms itself and the produced 1o2 due to the self decomposition of pms 25 in the systems of ccb pms and fe ccb pms no obvious improvement of rhb degradation was observed implying that both ccb and fe ccb could not effectively activate pms however approximately 77 of rhb was decomposed by pms in the existence cofe composite within 15 min meaning that cofe composite possessed good catalytic performance for pms activation surprisingly almost complete degradation of rhb was achieved within 10 min in the systems of cofe ccb pms and co ccb pms this proves that ccb can greatly improve the catalytic performance of cofe for pms activation which is attributed to the synergistic effect of ccb and metal composites to reveal the synergy electrochemical experiments on cofe ccb co ccb and fe ccb were carried out fig s2 the cv curves show that cofe ccb exhibited the highest current response value in these three catalysts and a strong reduction peak meaning that a fast electron transfer of the redox pair could occur between cofe ccb and pms which improved the production of ros although the removal efficiency of rhb in the co ccb pms system was similar to that in the cofe ccb pms system the dissolution of co ions from co ccb 2 32 mg l 1 mg l co ion emission standard gb 25467 2010 china was much higher than that from cofe ccb 0 63 mg l high ion dissolution indicates that the stability of co ccb was poor and its application would cause secondary pollution in addition to evaluate the role of the leached ions as homogeneous catalysis in rhb degradation a specific experiment was conducted according to our previous report 19 as shown in fig s3 only about 20 of rhb was further degraded with an introduction of pms within 15 min when cofe ccb was removed from the solution via filtration however rhb was completely degraded during the same time with an introduction of pms when the catalyst was not removed the results confirmed that homogeneous catalysis made a weak contribution to the degradation of rhb in the cofe ccb pms system thus cofe ccb material can be considered to be most promising catalyst in the tested composites for pms activation to eliminate rhb from water 3 3 determination of ros in order to identify ros produced in the reaction system quenching experiments were firstly conducted fig 5a tert butanol tba is considered as a quencher of oh 19 it is noted that with the addition of tba the degradation of rhb decreased by about 15 proving that oh participated in the decomposition of rhb methanol ma serving as a scavenger of both oh and so4 26 its presence caused the degradation rate of rhb to decrease by about 60 based on the results above it can be deduced that so4 rather than oh made a key contribution to the degradation of rhb in addition it was also found in fig 5a that the decomposition of rhb was slightly suppressed by bq suggesting that a small amount of o2 was produced through the hydrolysis of pms 19 it has been reported that furfuryl alcohol ffa can not only quench 1o2 but also eliminate the role of oh and so4 27 consequently only about 10 degradation rate of rhb was achieved by the end of the reaction 15 min when ffa was added to the reaction system which confirms that 1o2 also played a role in the degradation of rhb ros species produced in the reaction system were further determined by the analyses of electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrum 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperi done temp were used as spin trapping agents it is noted that there are no any obvious peaks appeared on the epr spectrum in the system of dmpo and pms when dmpo was added to the system of cofe ccb pms system however seven peaks with an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 are clearly observed which was assigned to the signal of 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl dmpox implying the fast and direct oxidation of dmpo by strong oxidants so4 and oh 28 31 in addition the formation of dmpox may also result from the further oxidation of dmpo oh mediated by so4 32 these proved the presence of oh and so4 in the cofe ccb pms system in the system of temp pms three peaks with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 are observed due to self decomposition of pms which were further strengthened with an introduction of cofe ccb the results prove that 1o2 was produced in the reaction systems it should be pointed that no peaks of superoxide anion radicals o2 were observed in methanol solution when dmpo was used as a spin trapping agent meaning that the small amount of the produced o2 was immediately converted to 1o2 33 which was confirmed by the queching experiment of bq fig 5a to sum up the main ros species in the system are identified to be oh so4 and 1o2 to further clarify the contribution of different ros to the degradation of rhb in the system an analysis was carried out according to previous reports 34 the pseudo first order reaction rate constants without quencher and with tba ma and ffa quenchers were defined as k 0 k 1 k 2 and k 3 respectively through fitting the data fig 5a the values of k 0 k 1 k 2 and k 3 were obtained to be 0 27 0 23 0 11 and 0 03 min 1 according to the eqs 1 3 listed below the contribution of ros could be acquired 1 λ oh k 0 k 1 k 0 100 2 λ so 4 k 1 k 2 k 0 100 3 λ 1 o 2 k 2 k 3 k 0 100 here λ represents the contribution rate of ros therefore it is deduced that the contribution rates of oh so4 and 1o2 to the degradation of rhb were 17 20 44 28 and 27 11 respectively the remaining contribution of 11 45 is attributed to the oxidation of pms or the adsorption of rhb toward cofe ccb 3 4 effect of different factors on the degradation of rhb 3 4 1 catalyst dosage and pms concentration the influence of different catalyst dosages and pms concentrations on rhb degradation was investigated as shown in fig s4a when cofe ccb dosage increased from 0 to 0 04 g l the removal rate of rhb was markedly enhanced from 15 to 99 within 15 min with the further increase of cofe ccb dosage to 0 08 g l the removal rate of rhb couldn t be significantly improved this means that 0 04 g l cofe ccb could provide enough active sites for the activation of pms 0 3 mm therefore the catalyst dosage 0 04 g l was determined as the optimum condition fig s4b shows the effect of pms concentrations on the degradation of rhb it is observed that the degradation rate of rhb increased from about 10 to 99 within 15 min with an increase of pms concentration from 0 to 0 3 mm however only a slight enhancement of rhb degradation was obtained when pms concentration further increased from 0 3 to 0 6 mm the possible reason is that a great number of ros produced in the reaction system quenched each other limiting the degradation of rhb to some extent after comprehensive consideration such as the reaction solution of the sampling and the cost of the agent 0 3 mm pms was selected to carry out the subsequent experiments 3 4 2 co existing ions and ha in order to assess the practical application potential of cofe ccb the effect of coexisting ions including cl and hco3 and humic acid ha on the degradation of rhb by cofe ccb activated pms was investigated as demonstrated in fig 6a the introduction of these substances had an obvious impact on the degradation of rhb for example the removal rates of rhb in the presence of cl and hco3 decreased by 38 and 67 respectively this is because cl and hco3 could react with oh and so4 to produce chlorine radicals cl carbonate radicals co3 and bicarbonate radicals hco3 with lower oxidation capacity 34 35 in addition the addition of hco3 still enhanced the solution ph in the case the degradation of rhb was further suppressed ha also reduced the removal rate of rhb which is ascribed to the reasons that ha could compete for ros with rhb and it could be adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst covering some active sites 37 3 4 3 initial ph in the aops based on pms ph is a very important factor impacting the removal of pollutants therefore the catalytic performance of cofe ccb for pms activation to degrade rhb at different initial ph was examined as shown in fig 6b the degradation of rhb obviously increased with initial ph rising from 3 to 7 only about 82 of rhb was degraded within 15 min at initial ph 3 almost complete degradation of rhb was achieved within 15 min at initial ph 5 the reaction time for the complete removal of rhb was shorted to 10 min when the initial ph rose to 9 and 11 however the degradation efficiencies of rhb decreased to 70 and 10 within 15 min respectively to explain the phenomena the final ph and the point of zero charge pzc of cofe ccb were measured which were demonstrated in table s2 and in fig s5 respectively as pointed out in table s2 at initial ph 3 to 9 the final ph fell to a range of 3 26 to 5 98 lower than phpzc of cofe ccb 7 30 according to these data it can be inferred that the surface of cofe ccb carried with positively charge during the reaction initial ph 3 to 7 considering hso5 as main species of pms in the tested ph range the electrostatic attraction between cofe ccb and pms occurred improving the activation of pms for ros generation and leading to the rapid degradation of rhb nevertheless high h concentration in the solution may quench some radical reactions 38 on the other hand a relatively high concentration of h may restrain the formation of cooh on the surface of the catalyst as active sites for pms activation thus the degradation rate of rhb rose with initial ph increasing from 3 to 7 as for ph 9 despite the final ph 5 98 cofe ccb was negatively charged before the solution ph decreased to 7 30 during the reaction phase the electrostatic repulsion between cofe ccb and pms inhibited the removal of rhb when the initial ph was further enhanced to 11 the stronger electrostatic repulsion greatly limited pms activation by cofe ccb furthermore so4 could be converted into oh with lower oxidation capacity under alkaline condition 39 as a result the degradation of rhb was very poor at ph 11 in order to further reveal the effect of ph on the reaction the decomposition of pms at different initial ph was also investigated fig s6 which increased from 81 at ph 3 to 90 2 at ph 7 and decreased from 69 6 at ph 9 to 25 3 at ph 11 the tendency was well consistent with the degradation efficiency of rhb more decomposition of pms more production of ros resulting in faster removal of rhb 3 5 application potential of cofe ccb 3 5 1 stability and recovery of cofe ccb the stability of heterogeneous catalysts and their reusability is an important indicator to evaluate their catalytic performance thus cycling tests were conducted for 4 times without any regeneration treatment to investigate the practical application potential of cofe ccb as shown in fig s7 almost complete degradation of rhb could be achieved within 15 min through the first run to the third run even in the fourth run the removal of rhb still reached over 95 in addition the concentrations of leached co ions and fe ions in the solution were determined by the end of the reaction which were 0 63 and 0 09 mg l respectively these results fully prove that cofe ccb composite possessed rather high stability and reusability fig s8 shows the magnetization curve of cofe ccb the saturation magnetization of cofe ccb was high up to 89 15 emu g indicating that cofe ccb had strong magnetism this further confirmed that cofe ccb composite is easy to recovery and convenient to practical application 3 5 2 rhb degradation in real water matrixes in real water matrixes there are many interfering substances which may suppress the degradation of organic pollutants to further assess the application potential of cofe ccb the degradation of rhb in real water matrixes main parameters are listed in table s3 was investigated as shown in fig s9 no obvious difference of rhb degradation was observed in lake water and well water as compared with control deionized water although some anions ions and ha existed in these two natural waters the results testify that the combination of cofe ccb and pms held strong anti interference capacity in practical application 3 5 3 universality of cofe ccb pms system to verify the universality of the system of cofe ccb pms in this study the degradation of phenacetin pnt bisphenol a bpa sulfamethazine smz and 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d as the representatives of other organic pollutants was investigated and the results are illustrated in fig s10 it is observed that 5 mg l of smz was completely degraded within 10 min the degradation rates of pnt bpa and 2 4 d still reached over 90 within 15 min indicating that the cofe ccb pms system had a good universality in the removal of organic pollutants 3 6 activation mechanism of pms combining the identification of the produced ros in the reaction system with the characteristic analyses of cofe ccb composite before and after reaction the possible activation mechanism of pms could be speculated zvi could react with the dissolved oxygen to produce fe2 eq 4 which would participate in the subsequent redox reaction 40 in addition zvi could react directly with pms to generate so4 41 eq 5 so4 was produced by cooh activated pms eq 6 36 co2 and fe2 could directly activate pms to release so4 and oh according to eqs 7 and 8 42 in addition so4 would interact with h2o and oh to form oh 43 eqs 9 and 10 pms could cause the reduction of co3 and fe3 to the formation of co2 and fe2 coupled with the production of so5 eq 11 thus the cycle reactions between co3 co2 and fe3 fe2 were established in the reaction system the reactions could be further improved by the synergy effect of ccb and metal composites meanwhile so5 reacted with h2o to generate 1o2 eq 12 1o2 also resulted from the self decomposition of pms 44 eq 13 under the attack of ros including oh so4 and 1o2 rhb was gradually degraded to co2 and h2o eq 14 4 2fe0 o2 2h2o 2fe2 4oh 5 fe0 2hso5 fe2 2so4 2oh 6 cooh hso5 coo h2o so4 7 co2 fe2 hso5 co3 fe3 so4 oh 8 co2 fe2 hso5 co3 fe3 so4 2 oh 9 so4 h2o oh so4 2 h 10 so4 oh oh so4 2 11 co3 fe3 hso5 co2 fe2 so5 h 12 2so5 h2o 1 51o2 2hso4 13 hso5 so5 2 1o2 hso4 so4 2 14 rhb so4 oh 1o2 intermediates co2 h2o 3 7 possible degradation pathways in order to analyze the degradation pathways of rhb the intermediates resulted from degradation of rhb were detected by hplc hrms the related data are shown in fig s11 and table s4 based on the data the possible degradation pathways of rhb are proposed and illustrated in fig 7 first rhb was attacked by ros and p1 and p2 were produced through de ethylation 45 subsequently p1 further reacted with ros and the remaining three ethyl groups on the molecule were gradually removed to release p3 p4 and p5 3 46 p6 was obtained when p5 underwent deaminating accompanied by rings opening and oxidation the chromophore cleavage p2 and p6 gave rise to the formation of p7 and a series of monocyclic molecules p8 p11 furthermore p12 p15 single chain molecules were generated via cracking of benzene rings eventually these small molecules were mineralized into h2o and co2 4 conclusions the magnetic cobalt iron composite loaded on carbon derived from cigarette butts cofe ccb was successfully prepared and for the first time applied for the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms to degrade rhodamine b rhb cofe ccb showed excellent catalytic performance in a wide range of ph 5 7 due to the synergy of co fe and carbon materials which was confirmed by electrochemical tests the produced ros in the reaction system were identified to oh so4 and 1o2 by epr technology and quenching experiments whose contributions to the degradation of rhb were 17 20 44 28 and 27 11 respectively the practical application potential of cofe ccb was examined via cycling experiments and real water matrixes and the results prove that the material had high stability and reusability as well as strong anti interference capacity in addition the combination cofe ccb and pms held a good universality toward the degradation of other organic pollutants so present study provides a new method for the reuse of discarded cigarette butts to prepare catalysts with superior performance and strong magnetism for the activation of pms to remove organic

12492,in this study the magnetic cobalt iron composite loaded on carbon derived from cigarette butts cofe ccb was successfully prepared for the first time and applied for the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms to degrade rhodamine b rhb the results indicated that approximately 99 of rhb 50 mg l was degraded by cofe ccb 0 04 g l activated pms 0 3 mm within 15 min the reactive oxygen species ros in the reaction system were identified to be oh so4 and 1o2 which responsible for the rapid degradation of rhb it was also found that rhb could be efficiently removed in real water matrixes demonstrating that cofe ccb has excellent anti interference performance meanwhile strong magnetism of cofe ccb made it easy to separate from water and recover for reuse these results fully proved that cofe ccb has good practical application potential in addition the combination of cofe ccb and pms still exhibited outstanding degradation efficiencies of phenacetin pnt bisphenol a bpa sulfamethazine smz and 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d therefore this study provides a new method for the reuse of discarded cigarette butts to fabricate catalysts with extremely superior performance and easy to use for pms activation to eliminate organic pollutants from wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords discarded cigarette butts magnetic co fe composite peroxymonosulfate activation degradation of rhodamine b data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction an introduction of dyes usually is an essential in industries such as textiles foodstuffs and leather process but at the same time the non regulated discharge of dye wastewater has also caused great harm to the environment 1 dye wastewater has complex composition strong resistance to photolysis and oxidation and contains a variety of biotoxic organic compounds 2 rhodamine b rhb is a kind of cationic dye with good water solubility which is characterized by stable structure difficult degradation and high toxicity 3 rhb is commonly eliminated from wastewater via physical chemical and biological methods 4 however the removal efficiencies of these methods are often not high some of them still cause secondary pollution 5 therefore it is urgent to exploit new ways to degrade rhb advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely used to degrade organic pollutants in recent years because aops can produce reactive oxygen species ros such as sulfate radicals so4 hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 6 8 so4 has a long half life t 1 2 30 40 μs and a high redox potential e 0 2 5 3 1 v 9 and is generally considered the more efficient ros aops based on the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms have been shown to be effective in removing rhb from water 10 the activation of pms by transition metal based catalysts have attracted wide attention 11 for example a metal organic framework material containing co as a catalyst was successfully fabricated for pms activation to degrade rhb 12 the combination of fe and co co doped mofs and pms could realize 97 removal rate of rhb 13 wu et al 14 supported fe on activated carbon to activate pms and the degradation efficiency of 100 mg l rhb reached about 96 within 30 min carbon materials as a supporter of metals or metal oxides also exhibited the outstanding performance to degrade other organic pollutants with an assistance of pms 15 16 thus it could be concluded that carbon materials play an important role in aops based on pms activation by heterogeneous catalysts for the treatment of wastewater containing organic compounds waste cigarette butts are also a kind of carbon source material it has been reported that about 6 trillion cigarettes are consumed worldwide every year and about half of the butts couldn t be disposed of properly 17 as the main component of cigarette butts plasticized cellulose acetate is hard to degrade naturally in the environment 18 in addition there are many kinds of harmful substances in cigarette butts which will do harm to both nature and human therefore it is very meaningful to try to transform cigarette butts into carbon serving as carriers of metal or metallic oxide catalysts realizing the strategy of treat waste by waste in this study the mixture of cobalt and iron composites as well as discarded cigarette butts was calcined under nitrogen protection to obtain a solid mixture containing c and then the solid mixture was further calcined in air to form stable oxides loaded on the carbon which was labeled as cofe ccb the structure and property of cofe ccb were investigated in detail via a series of characterizations the catalytic performance of the obtained material for pms activation was assessed by the degradation of rhb with different catalytic dosages pms concentrations and initial ph the practical application potential of cofe ccb was also evaluated through coexisting ions ha real water samples and recycling tests finally the underlying catalytic mechanism and the possible pathways of rhb degradation were proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials co no3 2 6h2o was bought from aladdin industry corporation shanghai china fe no3 3 9h2o was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china the waste cigarette butts were supplied by china tobacco jiangsu industrial company the information of the other reagents used in this study is listed in text s1 2 2 preparation of catalysts the magnetic cobalt iron composite loaded on carbon derived from cigarette butts cofe ccb was prepared by the following method firstly 2 mmol of co no3 2 6h2o and 2 mmol of fe no3 3 9h2o were dissolved in 40 ml deionized water and then 1 g of mashed cigarette butts cb was introduced into the solution the mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 30 min on the other hand 0 8 g naoh was dissolved in 5 ml deionized water which was added drop by drop into the above mixture after that the mixture was heated to evaporate water the resultant solid was further dried in a drying furnace at 70 c for 6 h after drying the solid was calcined in a tube furnace in nitrogen atmosphere at 600 c at a heating rate of 5 c min for 2 h subsequently the calcination was further conducted in the air at 300 c at a heating rate of 5 c min for another 2 h finally the calcined material cofe ccb was washed by deionized water three times dried in a drying furnace at 90 c for 6 h and ground into powder for use for the sake of comparison carbon derived from cigarette butts ccb and cobalt and iron loaded on ccb co ccb fe ccb were also prepared respectively following to the same processes as described above 2 3 characterization the characterization of the catalysts is expressed in text s2 2 4 experimental procedures all batch experiments were performed in a 250 ml reaction bottle first 100 ml of the solution containing the contaminant 50 mg l and pms 0 3 mm was added into the reaction bottle the initial ph was adjusted to the desired value using 0 5 mm h2so4 and naoh after 4 mg of the catalyst was introduced the reaction bottle was placed in a water bath shaker at 180 rpm and 25 c to start the reaction at regular intervals about 2 5 ml of the solution was sucked with a disposable syringe passed through a 0 22 μm filter membrane and the filtrate was collected in a clear tube 20 μl sodium sulfite solution 1 mol l was immediately added into the filtrate to quench radical reactions finally 1 ml filtrate was used for the concentration determination of the residual rhb in the solution to evaluate the effect of the leached metal ions on rhb degradation a specific experiment was conducted according to the previous report 19 which is described in text s3 2 5 analytical methods the analytical methods used in this study are shown in text s4 the electrochemical experiments were performed and the detail processes are expressed in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization fig 1 shows the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the catalysts it can be seen from fig 1a that the diffraction peaks at 44 76 65 16 and 82 53 correspond to the 1 1 0 2 0 0 and 2 1 1 crystal planes of zero valent iron zvi respectively pdf 87 0722 no characteristic peaks of co are observed from fig 1 the possible reason is that the peak intensity of fe in cofe ccb is too high covering the peaks of other substances the xrd patterns of co ccb and fe ccb are shown in fig 1b and c respectively the diffraction peaks corresponding to the 2 2 0 3 1 1 4 0 0 5 1 1 and 4 4 0 crystal planes of co3o4 pdf 78 1969 fig 1b are clearly observed at 2theta 31 27 36 84 44 80 59 35 and 65 22 respectively as shown in fig 1c the diffraction peaks appearing at 2theta 30 16 35 52 43 17 53 56 57 10 and 62 70 are ascribed to the 2 2 0 3 1 1 4 0 0 4 2 2 5 1 1 and 4 4 0 crystal planes of fe3o4 pdf 88 0315 in addition the characteristic diffraction peaks of zvi are also observed at 2theta 44 76 65 16 and 82 53 from fig 1 it can be inferred that the intensities of co3o4 and fe3o4 characteristic peaks were much weaker than that of zvi which proves the above analysis the sem patterns of cofe ccb cofe and ccb are illustrated in fig 2a b and c respectively it can be clearly observed from these patterns that the particles of cofe adhered to the surface of ccb with flaky the tem image of cofe ccb fig 2d demonstrates that some particles were covered by flaky ccb and these structures were further characterized and enlarged via hrtem fig s1 the lattice fringes of 0 20 0 25 and 0 24 nm were indexed to the 1 1 0 crystal plane of fe the 3 1 1 crystal plane of fe3o4 and the 3 1 1 crystal plane of co3o4 respectively which were in accordance with the results of xrd spectra therein it can be seen that the cofe particles also existed in the interior of ccb the bet surface areas average pore diameters and cumulative pore volumes of these three materials were measured and the results are listed in table s1 the bet surface areas of cofe ccb cofe and ccb were 97 45 36 64 and 506 9 m2 g respectively the results proved that the bet surface area of cofe ccb could be effectively improved by loading cofe onto ccb which is conducive to the exposing of more active sites the elemental mapping images of cofe ccb are illustrated in fig 2e h as can be seen from these figures the elements of co fe c and o were evenly distributed in the catalyst the xps spectra of cofe ccb are demonstrated in fig 3 the presence of co fe o and c is observed in the catalyst fig 3a which is consistent with the results of the elemental mapping images these elemental percentages changed little before and after reaction see fig 3a suggesting that the catalyst has good stability fig 3b e shows the high resolution scanning patterns of each element in cofe ccb as shown in fig 3b a strong peak appeared at 284 80 ev which was the characteristic peak of the cc bond the peaks centering at 286 35 and 288 89 ev are attributed to the co bond and the co bond respectively 20 the peak at 530 27 ev fig 3c is characteristic of the feo bond hydroxyl group oh corresponds to the peak at 531 43 ev the peak intensity of co co 532 41 ev increased significantly after reaction which is well consistent with those shown in fig 3b the peak at 533 38 ev belongs to chemisorbed water h2o 21 22 the high resolution scanning pattern of co 2p could be divided into two orbits fig 3d which belong to the orbits of 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 respectively the peaks at 780 25 and 782 13 ev are ascribed to co3 and co2 respectively 23 in fig 3e the diffraction peak of fe 2p could also be divided into two orbits 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 by fitting the peak of 2p3 2 orbit two peaks at 713 16 and 710 96 ev are observed which represent fe3 and fe2 respectively a weak peak at 707 04 ev is attributed to zvi 24 these results mean that most of fe on the surface of the catalyst was oxidized it is considered that xps spectra only detect a few nanolayers on the surface of the materials so the peak strength of zvi in cofe ccb is not high based on the analyses above it can be concluded that cofe ccb was composed of co3o4 fe3o4 and zvi 3 2 catalytic activity in order to evaluate the catalytic performance of cofe ccb the degradation of rhb in different systems were investigated fig 4 it is observed that 10 of rhb was removed in the presence of cofe ccb alone within 15 min indicating that the adsorption of rhb toward cofe ccb was weak about 15 of rhb was degraded by pms during the same time which is ascribed to the contribution of pms itself and the produced 1o2 due to the self decomposition of pms 25 in the systems of ccb pms and fe ccb pms no obvious improvement of rhb degradation was observed implying that both ccb and fe ccb could not effectively activate pms however approximately 77 of rhb was decomposed by pms in the existence cofe composite within 15 min meaning that cofe composite possessed good catalytic performance for pms activation surprisingly almost complete degradation of rhb was achieved within 10 min in the systems of cofe ccb pms and co ccb pms this proves that ccb can greatly improve the catalytic performance of cofe for pms activation which is attributed to the synergistic effect of ccb and metal composites to reveal the synergy electrochemical experiments on cofe ccb co ccb and fe ccb were carried out fig s2 the cv curves show that cofe ccb exhibited the highest current response value in these three catalysts and a strong reduction peak meaning that a fast electron transfer of the redox pair could occur between cofe ccb and pms which improved the production of ros although the removal efficiency of rhb in the co ccb pms system was similar to that in the cofe ccb pms system the dissolution of co ions from co ccb 2 32 mg l 1 mg l co ion emission standard gb 25467 2010 china was much higher than that from cofe ccb 0 63 mg l high ion dissolution indicates that the stability of co ccb was poor and its application would cause secondary pollution in addition to evaluate the role of the leached ions as homogeneous catalysis in rhb degradation a specific experiment was conducted according to our previous report 19 as shown in fig s3 only about 20 of rhb was further degraded with an introduction of pms within 15 min when cofe ccb was removed from the solution via filtration however rhb was completely degraded during the same time with an introduction of pms when the catalyst was not removed the results confirmed that homogeneous catalysis made a weak contribution to the degradation of rhb in the cofe ccb pms system thus cofe ccb material can be considered to be most promising catalyst in the tested composites for pms activation to eliminate rhb from water 3 3 determination of ros in order to identify ros produced in the reaction system quenching experiments were firstly conducted fig 5a tert butanol tba is considered as a quencher of oh 19 it is noted that with the addition of tba the degradation of rhb decreased by about 15 proving that oh participated in the decomposition of rhb methanol ma serving as a scavenger of both oh and so4 26 its presence caused the degradation rate of rhb to decrease by about 60 based on the results above it can be deduced that so4 rather than oh made a key contribution to the degradation of rhb in addition it was also found in fig 5a that the decomposition of rhb was slightly suppressed by bq suggesting that a small amount of o2 was produced through the hydrolysis of pms 19 it has been reported that furfuryl alcohol ffa can not only quench 1o2 but also eliminate the role of oh and so4 27 consequently only about 10 degradation rate of rhb was achieved by the end of the reaction 15 min when ffa was added to the reaction system which confirms that 1o2 also played a role in the degradation of rhb ros species produced in the reaction system were further determined by the analyses of electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrum 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperi done temp were used as spin trapping agents it is noted that there are no any obvious peaks appeared on the epr spectrum in the system of dmpo and pms when dmpo was added to the system of cofe ccb pms system however seven peaks with an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 are clearly observed which was assigned to the signal of 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl dmpox implying the fast and direct oxidation of dmpo by strong oxidants so4 and oh 28 31 in addition the formation of dmpox may also result from the further oxidation of dmpo oh mediated by so4 32 these proved the presence of oh and so4 in the cofe ccb pms system in the system of temp pms three peaks with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 are observed due to self decomposition of pms which were further strengthened with an introduction of cofe ccb the results prove that 1o2 was produced in the reaction systems it should be pointed that no peaks of superoxide anion radicals o2 were observed in methanol solution when dmpo was used as a spin trapping agent meaning that the small amount of the produced o2 was immediately converted to 1o2 33 which was confirmed by the queching experiment of bq fig 5a to sum up the main ros species in the system are identified to be oh so4 and 1o2 to further clarify the contribution of different ros to the degradation of rhb in the system an analysis was carried out according to previous reports 34 the pseudo first order reaction rate constants without quencher and with tba ma and ffa quenchers were defined as k 0 k 1 k 2 and k 3 respectively through fitting the data fig 5a the values of k 0 k 1 k 2 and k 3 were obtained to be 0 27 0 23 0 11 and 0 03 min 1 according to the eqs 1 3 listed below the contribution of ros could be acquired 1 λ oh k 0 k 1 k 0 100 2 λ so 4 k 1 k 2 k 0 100 3 λ 1 o 2 k 2 k 3 k 0 100 here λ represents the contribution rate of ros therefore it is deduced that the contribution rates of oh so4 and 1o2 to the degradation of rhb were 17 20 44 28 and 27 11 respectively the remaining contribution of 11 45 is attributed to the oxidation of pms or the adsorption of rhb toward cofe ccb 3 4 effect of different factors on the degradation of rhb 3 4 1 catalyst dosage and pms concentration the influence of different catalyst dosages and pms concentrations on rhb degradation was investigated as shown in fig s4a when cofe ccb dosage increased from 0 to 0 04 g l the removal rate of rhb was markedly enhanced from 15 to 99 within 15 min with the further increase of cofe ccb dosage to 0 08 g l the removal rate of rhb couldn t be significantly improved this means that 0 04 g l cofe ccb could provide enough active sites for the activation of pms 0 3 mm therefore the catalyst dosage 0 04 g l was determined as the optimum condition fig s4b shows the effect of pms concentrations on the degradation of rhb it is observed that the degradation rate of rhb increased from about 10 to 99 within 15 min with an increase of pms concentration from 0 to 0 3 mm however only a slight enhancement of rhb degradation was obtained when pms concentration further increased from 0 3 to 0 6 mm the possible reason is that a great number of ros produced in the reaction system quenched each other limiting the degradation of rhb to some extent after comprehensive consideration such as the reaction solution of the sampling and the cost of the agent 0 3 mm pms was selected to carry out the subsequent experiments 3 4 2 co existing ions and ha in order to assess the practical application potential of cofe ccb the effect of coexisting ions including cl and hco3 and humic acid ha on the degradation of rhb by cofe ccb activated pms was investigated as demonstrated in fig 6a the introduction of these substances had an obvious impact on the degradation of rhb for example the removal rates of rhb in the presence of cl and hco3 decreased by 38 and 67 respectively this is because cl and hco3 could react with oh and so4 to produce chlorine radicals cl carbonate radicals co3 and bicarbonate radicals hco3 with lower oxidation capacity 34 35 in addition the addition of hco3 still enhanced the solution ph in the case the degradation of rhb was further suppressed ha also reduced the removal rate of rhb which is ascribed to the reasons that ha could compete for ros with rhb and it could be adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst covering some active sites 37 3 4 3 initial ph in the aops based on pms ph is a very important factor impacting the removal of pollutants therefore the catalytic performance of cofe ccb for pms activation to degrade rhb at different initial ph was examined as shown in fig 6b the degradation of rhb obviously increased with initial ph rising from 3 to 7 only about 82 of rhb was degraded within 15 min at initial ph 3 almost complete degradation of rhb was achieved within 15 min at initial ph 5 the reaction time for the complete removal of rhb was shorted to 10 min when the initial ph rose to 9 and 11 however the degradation efficiencies of rhb decreased to 70 and 10 within 15 min respectively to explain the phenomena the final ph and the point of zero charge pzc of cofe ccb were measured which were demonstrated in table s2 and in fig s5 respectively as pointed out in table s2 at initial ph 3 to 9 the final ph fell to a range of 3 26 to 5 98 lower than phpzc of cofe ccb 7 30 according to these data it can be inferred that the surface of cofe ccb carried with positively charge during the reaction initial ph 3 to 7 considering hso5 as main species of pms in the tested ph range the electrostatic attraction between cofe ccb and pms occurred improving the activation of pms for ros generation and leading to the rapid degradation of rhb nevertheless high h concentration in the solution may quench some radical reactions 38 on the other hand a relatively high concentration of h may restrain the formation of cooh on the surface of the catalyst as active sites for pms activation thus the degradation rate of rhb rose with initial ph increasing from 3 to 7 as for ph 9 despite the final ph 5 98 cofe ccb was negatively charged before the solution ph decreased to 7 30 during the reaction phase the electrostatic repulsion between cofe ccb and pms inhibited the removal of rhb when the initial ph was further enhanced to 11 the stronger electrostatic repulsion greatly limited pms activation by cofe ccb furthermore so4 could be converted into oh with lower oxidation capacity under alkaline condition 39 as a result the degradation of rhb was very poor at ph 11 in order to further reveal the effect of ph on the reaction the decomposition of pms at different initial ph was also investigated fig s6 which increased from 81 at ph 3 to 90 2 at ph 7 and decreased from 69 6 at ph 9 to 25 3 at ph 11 the tendency was well consistent with the degradation efficiency of rhb more decomposition of pms more production of ros resulting in faster removal of rhb 3 5 application potential of cofe ccb 3 5 1 stability and recovery of cofe ccb the stability of heterogeneous catalysts and their reusability is an important indicator to evaluate their catalytic performance thus cycling tests were conducted for 4 times without any regeneration treatment to investigate the practical application potential of cofe ccb as shown in fig s7 almost complete degradation of rhb could be achieved within 15 min through the first run to the third run even in the fourth run the removal of rhb still reached over 95 in addition the concentrations of leached co ions and fe ions in the solution were determined by the end of the reaction which were 0 63 and 0 09 mg l respectively these results fully prove that cofe ccb composite possessed rather high stability and reusability fig s8 shows the magnetization curve of cofe ccb the saturation magnetization of cofe ccb was high up to 89 15 emu g indicating that cofe ccb had strong magnetism this further confirmed that cofe ccb composite is easy to recovery and convenient to practical application 3 5 2 rhb degradation in real water matrixes in real water matrixes there are many interfering substances which may suppress the degradation of organic pollutants to further assess the application potential of cofe ccb the degradation of rhb in real water matrixes main parameters are listed in table s3 was investigated as shown in fig s9 no obvious difference of rhb degradation was observed in lake water and well water as compared with control deionized water although some anions ions and ha existed in these two natural waters the results testify that the combination of cofe ccb and pms held strong anti interference capacity in practical application 3 5 3 universality of cofe ccb pms system to verify the universality of the system of cofe ccb pms in this study the degradation of phenacetin pnt bisphenol a bpa sulfamethazine smz and 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d as the representatives of other organic pollutants was investigated and the results are illustrated in fig s10 it is observed that 5 mg l of smz was completely degraded within 10 min the degradation rates of pnt bpa and 2 4 d still reached over 90 within 15 min indicating that the cofe ccb pms system had a good universality in the removal of organic pollutants 3 6 activation mechanism of pms combining the identification of the produced ros in the reaction system with the characteristic analyses of cofe ccb composite before and after reaction the possible activation mechanism of pms could be speculated zvi could react with the dissolved oxygen to produce fe2 eq 4 which would participate in the subsequent redox reaction 40 in addition zvi could react directly with pms to generate so4 41 eq 5 so4 was produced by cooh activated pms eq 6 36 co2 and fe2 could directly activate pms to release so4 and oh according to eqs 7 and 8 42 in addition so4 would interact with h2o and oh to form oh 43 eqs 9 and 10 pms could cause the reduction of co3 and fe3 to the formation of co2 and fe2 coupled with the production of so5 eq 11 thus the cycle reactions between co3 co2 and fe3 fe2 were established in the reaction system the reactions could be further improved by the synergy effect of ccb and metal composites meanwhile so5 reacted with h2o to generate 1o2 eq 12 1o2 also resulted from the self decomposition of pms 44 eq 13 under the attack of ros including oh so4 and 1o2 rhb was gradually degraded to co2 and h2o eq 14 4 2fe0 o2 2h2o 2fe2 4oh 5 fe0 2hso5 fe2 2so4 2oh 6 cooh hso5 coo h2o so4 7 co2 fe2 hso5 co3 fe3 so4 oh 8 co2 fe2 hso5 co3 fe3 so4 2 oh 9 so4 h2o oh so4 2 h 10 so4 oh oh

pathways of rhb the intermediates resulted from degradation of rhb were detected by hplc hrms the related data are shown in fig s11 and table s4 based on the data the possible degradation pathways of rhb are proposed and illustrated in fig 7 first rhb was attacked by ros and p1 and p2 were produced through de ethylation 45 subsequently p1 further reacted with ros and the remaining three ethyl groups on the molecule were gradually removed to release p3 p4 and p5 3 46 p6 was obtained when p5 underwent deaminating accompanied by rings opening and oxidation the chromophore cleavage p2 and p6 gave rise to the formation of p7 and a series of monocyclic molecules p8 p11 furthermore p12 p15 single chain molecules were generated via cracking of benzene rings eventually these small molecules were mineralized into h2o and co2 4 conclusions the magnetic cobalt iron composite loaded on carbon derived from cigarette butts cofe ccb was successfully prepared and for the first time applied for the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms to degrade rhodamine b rhb cofe ccb showed excellent catalytic performance in a wide range of ph 5 7 due to the synergy of co fe and carbon materials which was confirmed by electrochemical tests the produced ros in the reaction system were identified to oh so4 and 1o2 by epr technology and quenching experiments whose contributions to the degradation of rhb were 17 20 44 28 and 27 11 respectively the practical application potential of cofe ccb was examined via cycling experiments and real water matrixes and the results prove that the material had high stability and reusability as well as strong anti interference capacity in addition the combination cofe ccb and pms held a good universality toward the degradation of other organic pollutants so

12493,stringent control of phosphorus concentration in effluent discharged into receiving water environment is a practical strategy for preventing eutrophication 1 hydroxy ethylidene 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp a typical phosphonate antiscalant is widely used in membrane concentrate to alleviate scaling transformation of hedp into orthophosphate through oxidation is an essential step to remove it efficiently a uv electrochemical oxidation uv eo system was used to convert hedp in saline water into orthophosphate without adding any oxidant the results showed that the uv eo system oxidized 90 of hedp while uv photolysis or eo alone only converted 20 of hedp respectively uv photolysis of chlorine from electrolysis of chloride at the anode formed hydroxyl radicals ho and reactive chlorine species rcs although the role of rcs was insignificant increasing the current density from 2 5 to 7 5 ma cm2 did not enhance the degradation of hedp despite the formation of higher concentrations of chlorine the degradation of hedp slightly decreased with the electrolyte concentration increasing from 2 5 to 10 0 g l but significantly decreased as the ph increased from 4 5 to 9 5 in order to optimize the degradation of hedp in the uv eo system we developed a kinetic model to simulate chlorine evolution under various experimental conditions overall this study provides an efficient and environmental friendly method for degrading hedp in saline water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords uv electrochemical oxidation system reactive oxygen chlorine species kinetic modeling phosphonates data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction eutrophication has been a global concern for several decades and has caused huge economic losses and environmental damages apart from engendering health risks for humans and other organisms in the ecosystem eutrophication leads to economic losses through affecting industries such as fishing water treatment recreation and tourism the total economic loss incurred from the algal bloom in the lake tai in 1998 was estimated at 46 5 billion yuan u s 6 5 billion in the catchment area 1 the degradation of ecosystem and deterioration of water quality due to eutrophication has been impacting economic development and living safety in many countries worldwide the limit of phosphorous p concentrations in the water bodies has been a successful strategy to control eutrophication regulations regarding the p discharge limits are getting stricter point source of p such as sewage effluent is the chief source for p loading in surface waters and easier to monitor and regulate compared to nonpoint sources from agriculture although orthophosphate o p is the only form of p that can be assimilated by living things in the water the phosphonates in surface waters also can be used through transformation into o p due to natural photo hydrolysis 2 4 phosphonates are often present in the textile industries wastewater 5 discharged circulating cooling water 6 and reverse osmosis concentrate roc 7 8 1 hydroxy ethylidene 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp a type of phosphonates antiscalant which are added in ro systems because of their superior performance in inhibiting scaling on ro membranes surface 9 their concentration in roc is several milligrams per liter which is enough to cause the risk of eutrophication 10 11 biodegradation is not an efficient method for phosphonate elimination due to slow biodegradation rate 12 traditional processes including adsorption and precipitation coagulation could efficiently remove o p but usually work ineffectively for phosphonate although excess coagulant and adsorbent are consumed 13 thus fast transformation of phosphonate into o p is the initiative key step to fulfil efficient removal of phosphonates advanced oxidation process aop is often used for converting phosphonate into o p a maximum of 20 polyphosphates can be converted to o p by fenton reaction at an excess dosage of h2o2 or fe ii 14 a hydrated iron oxide based fenton like reaction degraded 95 of tcep into o p with consuming 20 mm h2o2 over 4 h reaction time 15 in contrast uv aops enhanced oxidation of phosphonates to a higher extent with less oxidant such as uv fenton uv h2o2 16 uv persulfate 17 and uv chlorine compared to uv h2o2 oxidation uv chlorine process is more efficient for hedp transformation with the oxidant concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mm 18 the uv chlorine process produces various reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals ho and reactive chlorine species rcs however the role of reactive species for degradation of hedp is currently unclear in addition the uv eo process recently has been attracting attention for degrading organic pollutant in water in which chlorine was supplied by the anodic oxidation of chloride in an electrolytic system 19 20 the electrochemical process not only avoids risk from transport and management of oxidant e g chlorine but also operates conveniently especially for removing organic and inorganic pollutants in saline water 21 25 lang et al used a flow through eo system to treat marine aquaculture wastewater the removal of nh4 n and no2 n could reach 90 and antibiotics could be completely removed 24 iovino et al utilized electrochemical method to remove nitrogen compounds from saline wastewater the highest total nitrogen compound removal about 75 was achieved after 90 min of treatment operating with a nacl concentration of 250 mg l at an applied current intensity of 0 15 a 25 apart from the uv photolysis of active chlorine and its involved radical transformation the active chlorine is generated continuously in the uv eo system the oxidation of hedp in the uv eo system may differentiate from that in uv chlorine process under various conditions needs further investigation therefore in the present study the uv eo system was used to degrade hedp in saline water without adding oxidants more precisely the objectives of this investigation are to i identify primary radicals for oxidation of hedp ii evaluate the degradation performance of hedp under various conditions and gain insights into the importance of active chlorine and iii develop a kinetic model to simulate the active chlorine evolution in the uv eo process under specific conditions for optimization of the technology implementation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials 1 hydroxy ethylidene 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp 96 sodium chloride nacl nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob were purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical technology co ltd china the ultra pure water produced by a milli q instrument was used for preparing solution 2 2 experimental setup fig s1 shows the uv eo reactor in the reactor the low pressure uv mercury lamp λ 254 nm 1 21 mw cm2 was located in the center of the beaker and fixed parallelly between anode ruo2 iro2 ti 5 cm 8 cm and cathode stainless steel plate 5 cm 8 cm the dc power 60 v 2a suppled electric current for the reactor 2 3 uv electro chlorine experiment according to the antiscalant dosage and totals dissolved salt membrane concentrate the saline water containing hedp was prepared by adding various dosage of nacl and hedp in 0 2 m borate solution 5 μm of nb ba and dmob were added as probe compounds to determine the steady state concentration of ho cl and clo in the reaction process prior to experiment the ph of the reaction solution was adjusted to 4 5 9 5 by naoh and h2so4 solution and the reaction solution was kept stirring during the whole reaction period at predetermined time intervals i e 0 15 30 45 60 90 120 min sample was withdrawn from the reactor for chemical analysis before analyzing total phosphorus tp orthophosphate the residual reactive chlorine species and hydroxyl radicals were respectively quenched by excess nahso3 solution and methyl alcohol 2 times of stoichiometric ratio all experiments were carried out at least in duplicate and the standard deviations are shown as error bars in the figures 2 4 statistical analysis in order to validate the experimental results the statistical software spss was applied to construct the experimental model analysis of variance anova was investigated in this study to make sure that the outcome suitable with statistical model is valid the model included four different corresponding variables current density concentration of nacl initial ph value and apparent rate constants of hedp degradation anova analysis gave a significant term of the specific model by determined the probability f value calculated from the data exceed its theoretical value hence it surmised that when the p value increases the probability of the f value will decrease significant term could be deduced when the p value is 0 05 the results of anova analysis were displayed in table s1 2 5 analytical methods the active chlorine in solution were measured by dpd method apha 1989 with multi parameter water quality tester 5b 3b lianhua technology china total phosphorus tp and orthophosphate were analyzed using ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method according to national standard method of china because orthophosphate is the main oxidation product of phosphonate antiscalant the residual hedp concentration can be determined by the concentration difference between total phosphorus and orthophosphate a high performance liquid chromatography hplc alliance e2695 waters equipped with a waters symmetry c18 column and a uv vis detector was used to determine the concentrations of nb ba and dmob eluents of water mixed with 0 1 acetic acid and methanol 55 45 v v were used to separate these compounds at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the reference wavelengths of nb ba and dmob were 265 227 and 224 nm respectively 2 6 kinetics modeling according to a series of possible reactions in the system and their reaction rate constants we built a kinetic model using the software kintecus http www kintecus com which could predict the active chlorine at any reaction time by inputting reaction conditions i e current density initial chloride concentration ph reaction time etc at the same time we also determined the key reactions in the system by sensitivity analysis table s3 summarizes the reactions in the uv eo system the associated rate constants are generally obtained either from the literature or by fitting experimental data 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced degradation of hedp by uv eo system the degradation of hedp by electrochemical oxidation consisting of direct anodic and chlorine mediated oxidation uv irradiation and uv assisting electrochemical oxidation uv eo system were compared in fig 1a the conversion rate of hedp by uv irradiation alone and electro oxidation alone were relatively low with the conversion rate were only 21 and 24 at 120 min respectively in comparison the conversion rate of hedp reached 90 by uv assisting electrochemical oxidation showing significant synergistic effect the synergistic factor calculated by eq1 increased from 2 0 to 3 0 when reaction time extended from 15 min to 120 min 1 synergistic factor degradation rate uv eo degradation rate uv degradation rate eo the active chlorine was also detected during the three processes as shown in fig 1b no active chlorine was produced with uv irradiation alone expectedly active chlorine was formed in both electrochemical oxidation and uv eo process active chlorine concentration increased with reaction time in electrochemical oxidation process in comparison the chlorine concentration rose firstly and then stabilized after 30 min in the uv eo system in addition the stable active chlorine concentration in the uv eo system was far lower than electrochemical oxidation system which implied that chlorine was converted into other species under uv irradiation other species may play a key role for enhancing hedp oxidation rather than chlorination 3 2 active species for degradation of hedp in the uv eo system it is well known that active chlorine is converted into ho and rcs under uv irradiation 26 27 accordingly stable state concentration of ho cl and clo in the uv eo system were further quantified to confirm the generation of these radicals nb was used as ho probe k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 and ba was used as both ho k oh ba 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 and cl probe k cl ba 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 25 dmob acted as the probe of the three radicals k ho dmob 7 0 109 m 1 s 1 k cl dmob 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 and k clo dmob 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 28 29 the degradation of nb ba and dmob were investigated by electrochemical oxidation alone before the uv eo experiment as shown in fig 2a nb and ba were hardly degraded by eo however dmob decayed with reaction time and the apparent rate constants was 0 1057 min 1 fig s2 in the uv eo process the apparent rate constants k obs of the degradation of dmob ba and nb were 1 2600 0 2866 and 0 1168 min 1 respectively fig 2b using competitive kinetics text s1 steady state concentrations of ho and cl were calculated as 5 0 10 13 and 1 1 10 13 m respectively the contribution of eo to dmob degradation was basically negligible due to the much lower k obs 0 1057 min 1 fig s2 and the steady state concentration of clo in the uv eo system was calculated as 6 5 10 12 m to further confirm the roles of different radicals for degradation of hedp during the uv eo process nb was used as ho scavenger and ba was used as scavenger for both ho and cl in the presence of 0 5 mm nb the degradation of hedp was inhibited significantly and only 20 of hedp was oxidized in the uv eo system which confirmed the key role of ho for degrading hedp in the presence of 0 5 mm ba the degradation rate of hedp was similar as that in the presence of nb further excluding the contribution of cl for hedp degradation rcs including cl cl2 and clo for degrading pollutants were selective compared with ho which showed higher reactivity with olefins and benzene derivatives such as phenols anilines and alkyl alkoxybenzenes 28 whereas the absence of these chemical structures in hedp results in its lower reactivity with rcs previous research has demonstrated that the cp bond in hedp is susceptible to breakage upon attack by ho 30 therefore we speculate that the predominant factor driving hedp degradation in the uv eo system is the action of ho while the contribution of rcs is negligible 3 3 oxidation of hedp under different treatment conditions and water matrix components 3 3 1 effect of current density the current density is one of the key parameters for governing active chlorine concentration in eo system therefore the oxidation of hedp in uv eo system was investigated under various current density as shown in fig 3a the oxidation of hedp was enhanced significantly with the current density increasing form 1 0 ma cm2 to 2 5 ma cm2 the hedp oxidation rate increased from 52 to 91 within 120 min however the oxidation of hedp was slightly inhibited when the current density increased from 2 5 to 7 5 ma cm2 and the hedp oxidation rate within 120 min decreased from 91 to 88 the active chlorine concentration in the uv eo system was also detected for explaining the difference of hedp oxidation under various current density fig 3b active chlorine was negligible when the current density was set as 1 0 ma cm2 in contrast the active chlorine concentration increased with reaction time and stabilized after 30 min at the current density of 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 ma cm2 the stable chlorine concentrations were about 8 25 and 55 mg l at the current density of 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 ma cm2 respectively however the increase of chlorine concentration at higher current density did not promote the oxidation of hedp chlorine not only produced ho with uv photolysis eq 2 but also eliminate ho k hocl oh 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 k ocl oh 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 31 higher chlorine dosage in the uv chlorine process promoted the transformation from the primary radicals of ho to the secondary radical clo via eq 3 22 higher concentration of chlorine in the uv eo system produced more ho and simultaneously brought about significant consumption of ho nb was used as probe compound to quantify the steady state concentration of ho in the system at different current densities and the results were presented in table 1 a significant increase in ho concentration was observed i e increased from 1 46 10 13 to 5 92 10 13 m as the current density increased from 1 0 to 2 5 ma cm2 followed by a slight decrease as the current density was further increased the observed change in the ho concentration was consistent with the oxidation rule of hedp and further confirmed that ho was the primary active species in the uv eo system hence the degradation of hedp did not enhance at high current density with high power consumption despite of higher concentration of chlorine produced similar results were also observed in the uv chlorine system for degradation of hedp 18 2 hclo c lo hv hho clo k hclo 1 19 10 3 s 1 k clo 1 04 10 3 s 1 3 hclo c lo ho h 2 o o h clo k hclo 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 k clo 1 85 109 m 1 s 1 3 3 2 effect of chloride the chloride concentration in ro concentrate usually ranges from 800 to 9000 mg l 32 35 and it is a crucial factor in determining the types of reactive species in the uv eo system thus the hedp degradation in uv eo system was investigated under various chloride concentrations and the results were presented in fig 4a when the initial sodium chloride concentration was 2 5 g l the near complete hedp oxidation occurred within 120 min in contrast with the sodium chloride concentration increasing from 2 5 g l to 5 0 g l and 10 0 g l hedp oxidation rate decreased from 97 to 91 and 85 respectively this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that excess chloride would act as a scavenger of reactive radicals and decrease the destruction of hedp when the sodium chloride concentration increased from 2 5 g l to 5 0 g l active chlorine concentration in the uv eo system increased from 5 8 mg l to about 25 mg l however as sodium chloride concentration further increased to 10 0 g l active chlorine concentration almost did not increase continuously the above results indicated that increasing chlorine concentration from 8 mg l to 25 mg l had minimal impact on hedp oxidation in the uv eo system accordingly a reduction in hedp oxidation in the presence of 5 0 g l and 10 0 g l sodium chloride was observed which can be attributed to the existence of higher chlorine concentration and excess chloride the excess chloride will convert ho into low reactive radicals clo eq 3 and cloh eq 4 respectively 4 c l ho cloh 3 3 3 effect of ph ph is a crucial factor in the uv eo process as it impacts the distribution of active chlorine species typically the ph of membrane influent ranges from 6 5 to 7 2 for control scaling or silicate fouling on the membrane surface the ph was occasionally adjusted to acidity or alkalinity respectively thus the degradation of hedp under initial ph of 4 5 6 5 and 9 0 were evaluated and the results were shown in fig 5a the bulk solution ph did not deviate significantly from the initial ph during the electrolysis process due to borate buffering effect the oxidation of hedp in the uv eo process was found to be strongly ph dependent with the highest rate of degradation occurring at ph 4 5 hedp was almost degraded at 60 min when the initial ph was 4 5 while 30 and 77 of hedp remained in solution at the ph of 6 5 and 9 5 respectively the inhibitory effect of increasing ph on the oxidation of micropollutants has been observed in uv chlorine system 27 the ph affects the formation species distribution and decomposition of active chlorine the active chlorine concentrations at various ph of 4 5 6 5 and 9 5 were shown in fig 5b negligible active chlorine was determined in the uv eo system at the ph 9 5 and the degradation of hedp may be primarily attributed to ho oxidation as well as electrochemical direct oxidation and uv photolysis evolution of cl2 was favored at acidic ph whereas its formation is inhibited at alkaline ph 36 there was no obvious difference between the chlorine concentration at ph 6 5 and that at ph 4 5 as the pk a value of hclo is reported to be 7 5 hclo is the main chemical species at ph of 4 5 although the ph of 6 5 was lower than the pk a of hclo about 10 of active chlorine existed as clo in the solution radical production from clo photolysis is lower than that from hclo photolysis because of the lower quantum yield 0 9 vs 1 0 of clo 37 more importantly the radical scavenger effects of clo to ho is 3 4 times stronger than hclo eq 3 38 accordingly the inhibition of ho with the increasing ph is mainly attributed the higher scavenging effect of clo compared to hclo at higher ph the radical quantitative results table 1 showed that the ho concentration reached 8 25 10 13 m which was higher than 5 00 10 13 m at ph 6 5 and 1 25 10 13 m at ph 9 5 wu et al observed similar results that the concentrations of ho in the uv chlorine system decreased by 80 from ph 4 7 to 8 4 which resulted in 70 inhibition of pollutant degradation 27 the pk a values of hedp are 1 9 3 8 8 1 and 10 1 table s2 39 indicating that the deprotonation of hedp was promoted as the ph value increased from 4 5 to 9 5 during the uv eo process previous study reported an increase in the second order rate constants of ho and hedp from 6 74 108 to 1 38 109 m 1 s 1 as the ph value increases from 5 0 to 9 0 39 however the observed increase in the rate constant was not significant enough to compensate for the considerable decrease in the steady state concentration of ho leading to the inhibition of hedp degradation 3 4 kinetic modeling of active chlorine in the uv eo system the degradation rate of hedp in the uv eo system varied depending on factors such as current density chloride concentration and ph of the saline water the anova results table s1 showed that the initial ph value had the most significant impact on hedp degradation with a corresponding p value of 0 001 ho was the primary species responsible for hedp degradation and its generation and transformation were influenced by active chlorine concentration and species in the uv eo system on one hand ho derived from uv photolysis of active chlorine on the other hand active chlorine could convert ho into clo the active chlorine concentration in the uv eo system increased with increasing of current density and chloride concentration in the saline water ph of saline water affected both concentration of active chlorine and the species distribution of active chlorine as such hedp degradation rate under various conditions highly depended on active chlorine in the uv eo system accordingly understanding of active chlorine evolution under various current density sodium chloride concentration and ph is crucial for optimization of the uv eo system to degrade hedp efficiently kinetic modeling is an effective tool for gaining insight into the formation photolysis and transformation of active chlorine as well as its interaction with radicals we here in develop a mechanistically based kinetic model to describe the chlorine evolution in the uv eo system the core components of the model include i active chlorine evolution during the electrolysis of saline water reactions 1 5 in table s3 ii photolysis of active chlorine with uv reactions 6 7 in table s3 and iii radical chain reactions in the uv eo process reactions 8 61 in table s3 according to this mechanism cl is initially adsorbed on the anode and is transformed into the cl with the release of an electron reaction 1 the generated cl combines with the cl adjacent to the electrodes to yield cl2 reaction 2 alternatively the combination of two cl can also generates cl2 reaction 3 subsequently hclo generates from the hydrolysis of cl2 reactions 11 12 hclo is reduced to chloride ion at the cathode surface reaction 4 in the uv eo process the uv photolysis of hocl ocl produces reactive species such as ho and cl reactions 6 7 the conversion of radicals further complicates the uv eo process both ho and cl react with cl to form cloh reaction 19 and cl2 reaction 26 respectively cl and ho also consumed hocl ocl as clo is produced reactions 28 29 42 43 here above reactions are the key reactions that determine formation and decay of active chlorine the active chlorine concentrations were calculated using the kinetic model with the reactions shown in table s3 as can be seen from fig 6a d kinetic model has a good agreement with experimental data to satisfactorily describe the active chlorine evolution under various conditions such as current densities initial cl concentrations and ph of saline water active chlorine concentration increased linearly with reaction time in the eo system and increased with increasing of current density in the range of 2 5 7 5 ma cm2 by contrast active chlorine concentration first increased with reaction time and then has been stable since 30 min in the uv eo system stable concentration of active chlorine increased with increasing from 2 5 to 7 5 ma cm2 in the uv eo system the stable concentration of active chlorine also increased with chloride concentration increasing the stable concentration of active chlorine at ph 4 5 had no significant difference from that at ph 6 5 overall the active chlorine evolution in the uv eo system had similar trends with that in the presence of hedp under various conditions the stable concentration of active chlorine in the uv eo system also had little difference from that in the presence of hedp except at the current density of 7 5 ma cm2 the mechanistically based kinetic model developed here provides an effective method to both interpret the experimental data and determine optimal conditions for hedp oxidation according to the initial chloride and ph of saline water it was found that the hedp was oxidized cost effectively with the active chlorine in the range of 5 10 mg l even if an active chlorine concentraiton rose to 25 or 55 mg l hedp degradation did not improve this only results in a dramatic decrease in current efficiency and increase in power consumption it is easy to know the appropriate current density basing the model results according to the initial chloride and ph of saline water the designer or operator could make the uv eo system work optimally by only adjusting the current density 4 conclusion a uv eo system was built for degrading hedp in saline water without additional of oxidant it can be concluded that 1 ho derived from uv photolysis of active chlorine in situ generated electrochemically enhanced degradation of hedp in the uv eo system the degradation rate of hedp reached 90 in the uv eo system uv photolysis alone and electrochemical oxidation contributed 21 and 24 of hedp degradation respectively 2 the optimal current density was 2 5 ma cm2 for degradation hedp in the uv eo system when the current density was set as 1 0 ma cm2 the active chlorine was too scarce to produce ho on the other hand higher concentration of active chlorine produced more ho and also converted ho into clo as the current density increased to 5 0 or 7 5 ma cm2 about 40 mm cl 2 5 g l sodium chloride in saline water was enough for efficient degration of hedp in the uv eo system because both higher chloride content and higher chlorine consumed ho the degradation of hedp was efficient at the ph of 4 5 and 6 5 except 9 5 3 the mechanistically based kinetic could simulate the active chlorine evolution in the uv eo process and accurately predict active chlorine concentration according the initial chloride concentration and ph of the saline water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

optimize the degradation of hedp in the uv eo system we developed a kinetic model to simulate chlorine evolution under various experimental conditions overall this study provides an efficient and environmental friendly method for degrading hedp in saline water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords uv electrochemical oxidation system reactive oxygen chlorine species kinetic modeling phosphonates data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction eutrophication has been a global concern for several decades and has caused huge economic losses and environmental damages apart from engendering health risks for humans and other organisms in the ecosystem eutrophication leads to economic losses through affecting industries such as fishing water treatment recreation and tourism the total economic loss incurred from the algal bloom in the lake tai in 1998 was estimated at 46 5 billion yuan u s 6 5 billion in the catchment area 1 the degradation of ecosystem and deterioration of water quality due to eutrophication has been impacting economic development and living safety in many countries worldwide the limit of phosphorous p concentrations in the water bodies has been a successful strategy to control eutrophication regulations regarding the p discharge limits are getting stricter point source of p such as sewage effluent is the chief source for p loading in surface waters and easier to monitor and regulate compared to nonpoint sources from agriculture although orthophosphate o p is the only form of p that can be assimilated by living things in the water the phosphonates in surface waters also can be used through transformation into o p due to natural photo hydrolysis 2 4 phosphonates are often present in the textile industries wastewater 5 discharged circulating cooling water 6 and reverse osmosis concentrate roc 7 8 1 hydroxy ethylidene 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp a type of phosphonates antiscalant which are added in ro systems because of their superior performance in inhibiting scaling on ro membranes surface 9 their concentration in roc is several milligrams per liter which is enough to cause the risk of eutrophication 10 11 biodegradation is not an efficient method for phosphonate elimination due to slow biodegradation rate 12 traditional processes including adsorption and precipitation coagulation could efficiently remove o p but usually work ineffectively for phosphonate although excess coagulant and adsorbent are consumed 13 thus fast transformation of phosphonate into o p is the initiative key step to fulfil efficient removal of phosphonates advanced oxidation process aop is often used for converting phosphonate into o p a maximum of 20 polyphosphates can be converted to o p by fenton reaction at an excess dosage of h2o2 or fe ii 14 a hydrated iron oxide based fenton like reaction degraded 95 of tcep into o p with consuming 20 mm h2o2 over 4 h reaction time 15 in contrast uv aops enhanced oxidation of phosphonates to a higher extent with less oxidant such as uv fenton uv h2o2 16 uv persulfate 17 and uv chlorine compared to uv h2o2 oxidation uv chlorine process is more efficient for hedp transformation with the oxidant concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mm 18 the uv chlorine process produces various reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals ho and reactive chlorine species rcs however the role of reactive species for degradation of hedp is currently unclear in addition the uv eo process recently has been attracting attention for degrading organic pollutant in water in which chlorine was supplied by the anodic oxidation of chloride in an electrolytic system 19 20 the electrochemical process not only avoids risk from transport and management of oxidant e g chlorine but also operates conveniently especially for removing organic and inorganic pollutants in saline water 21 25 lang et al used a flow through eo system to treat marine aquaculture wastewater the removal of nh4 n and no2 n could reach 90 and antibiotics could be completely removed 24 iovino et al utilized electrochemical method to remove nitrogen compounds from saline wastewater the highest total nitrogen compound removal about 75 was achieved after 90 min of treatment operating with a nacl concentration of 250 mg l at an applied current intensity of 0 15 a 25 apart from the uv photolysis of active chlorine and its involved radical transformation the active chlorine is generated continuously in the uv eo system the oxidation of hedp in the uv eo system may differentiate from that in uv chlorine process under various conditions needs further investigation therefore in the present study the uv eo system was used to degrade hedp in saline water without adding oxidants more precisely the objectives of this investigation are to i identify primary radicals for oxidation of hedp ii evaluate the degradation performance of hedp under various conditions and gain insights into the importance of active chlorine and iii develop a kinetic model to simulate the active chlorine evolution in the uv eo process under specific conditions for optimization of the technology implementation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials 1 hydroxy ethylidene 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp 96 sodium chloride nacl nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob were purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical technology co ltd china the ultra pure water produced by a milli q instrument was used for preparing solution 2 2 experimental setup fig s1 shows the uv eo reactor in the reactor the low pressure uv mercury lamp λ 254 nm 1 21 mw cm2 was located in the center of the beaker and fixed parallelly between anode ruo2 iro2 ti 5 cm 8 cm and cathode stainless steel plate 5 cm 8 cm the dc power 60 v 2a suppled electric current for the reactor 2 3 uv electro chlorine experiment according to the antiscalant dosage and totals dissolved salt membrane concentrate the saline water containing hedp was prepared by adding various dosage of nacl and hedp in 0 2 m borate solution 5 μm of nb ba and dmob were added as probe compounds to determine the steady state concentration of ho cl and clo in the reaction process prior to experiment the ph of the reaction solution was adjusted to 4 5 9 5 by naoh and h2so4 solution and the reaction solution was kept stirring during the whole reaction period at predetermined time intervals i e 0 15 30 45 60 90 120 min sample was withdrawn from the reactor for chemical analysis before analyzing total phosphorus tp orthophosphate the residual reactive chlorine species and hydroxyl radicals were respectively quenched by excess nahso3 solution and methyl alcohol 2 times of stoichiometric ratio all experiments were carried out at least in duplicate and the standard deviations are shown as error bars in the figures 2 4 statistical analysis in order to validate the experimental results the statistical software spss was applied to construct the experimental model analysis of variance anova was investigated in this study to make sure that the outcome suitable with statistical model is valid the model included four different corresponding variables current density concentration of nacl initial ph value and apparent rate constants of hedp degradation anova analysis gave a significant term of the specific model by determined the probability f value calculated from the data exceed its theoretical value hence it surmised that when the p value increases the probability of the f value will decrease significant term could be deduced when the p value is 0 05 the results of anova analysis were displayed in table s1 2 5 analytical methods the active chlorine in solution were measured by dpd method apha 1989 with multi parameter water quality tester 5b 3b lianhua technology china total phosphorus tp and orthophosphate were analyzed using ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method according to national standard method of china because orthophosphate is the main oxidation product of phosphonate antiscalant the residual hedp concentration can be determined by the concentration difference between total phosphorus and orthophosphate a high performance liquid chromatography hplc alliance e2695 waters equipped with a waters symmetry c18 column and a uv vis detector was used to determine the concentrations of nb ba and dmob eluents of water mixed with 0 1 acetic acid and methanol 55 45 v v were used to separate these compounds at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the reference wavelengths of nb ba and dmob were 265 227 and 224 nm respectively 2 6 kinetics modeling according to a series of possible reactions in the system and their reaction rate constants we built a kinetic model using the software kintecus http www kintecus com which could predict the active chlorine at any reaction time by inputting reaction conditions i e current density initial chloride concentration ph reaction time etc at the same time we also determined the key reactions in the system by sensitivity analysis table s3 summarizes the reactions in the uv eo system the associated rate constants are generally obtained either from the literature or by fitting experimental data 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced degradation of hedp by uv eo system the degradation of hedp by electrochemical oxidation consisting of direct anodic and chlorine mediated oxidation uv irradiation and uv assisting electrochemical oxidation uv eo system were compared in fig 1a the conversion rate of hedp by uv irradiation alone and electro oxidation alone were relatively low with the conversion rate were only 21 and 24 at 120 min respectively in comparison the conversion rate of hedp reached 90 by uv assisting electrochemical oxidation showing significant synergistic effect the synergistic factor calculated by eq1 increased from 2 0 to 3 0 when reaction time extended from 15 min to 120 min 1 synergistic factor degradation rate uv eo degradation rate uv degradation rate eo the active chlorine was also detected during the three processes as shown in fig 1b no active chlorine was produced with uv irradiation alone expectedly active chlorine was formed in both electrochemical oxidation and uv eo process active chlorine concentration increased with reaction time in electrochemical oxidation process in comparison the chlorine concentration rose firstly and then stabilized after 30 min in the uv eo system in addition the stable active chlorine concentration in the uv eo system was far lower than electrochemical oxidation system which implied that chlorine was converted into other species under uv irradiation other species may play a key role for enhancing hedp oxidation rather than chlorination 3 2 active species for degradation of hedp in the uv eo system it is well known that active chlorine is converted into ho and rcs under uv irradiation 26 27 accordingly stable state concentration of ho cl and clo in the uv eo system were further quantified to confirm the generation of these radicals nb was used as ho probe k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 and ba was used as both ho k oh ba 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 and cl probe k cl ba 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 25 dmob acted as the probe of the three radicals k ho dmob 7 0 109 m 1 s 1 k cl dmob 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 and k clo dmob 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 28 29 the degradation of nb ba and dmob were investigated by electrochemical oxidation alone before the uv eo experiment as shown in fig 2a nb and ba were hardly degraded by eo however dmob decayed with reaction time and the apparent rate constants was 0 1057 min 1 fig s2 in the uv eo process the apparent rate constants k obs of the degradation of dmob ba and nb were 1 2600 0 2866 and 0 1168 min 1 respectively fig 2b using competitive kinetics text s1 steady state concentrations of ho and cl were calculated as 5 0 10 13 and 1 1 10 13 m respectively the contribution of eo to dmob degradation was basically negligible due to the much lower k obs 0 1057 min 1 fig s2 and the steady state concentration of clo in the uv eo system was calculated as 6 5 10 12 m to further confirm the roles of different radicals for degradation of hedp during the uv eo process nb was used as ho scavenger and ba was used as scavenger for both ho and cl in the presence of 0 5 mm nb the degradation of hedp was inhibited significantly and only 20 of hedp was oxidized in the uv eo system which confirmed the key role of ho for degrading hedp in the presence of 0 5 mm ba the degradation rate of hedp was similar as that in the presence of nb further excluding the contribution of cl for hedp degradation rcs including cl cl2 and clo for degrading pollutants were selective compared with ho which showed higher reactivity with olefins and benzene derivatives such as phenols anilines and alkyl alkoxybenzenes 28 whereas the absence of these chemical structures in hedp results in its lower reactivity with rcs previous research has demonstrated that the cp bond in hedp is susceptible to breakage upon attack by ho 30 therefore we speculate that the predominant factor driving hedp degradation in the uv eo system is the action of ho while the contribution of rcs is negligible 3 3 oxidation of hedp under different treatment conditions and water matrix components 3 3 1 effect of current density the current density is one of the key parameters for governing active chlorine concentration in eo system therefore the oxidation of hedp in uv eo system was investigated under various current density as shown in fig 3a the oxidation of hedp was enhanced significantly with the current density increasing form 1 0 ma cm2 to 2 5 ma cm2 the hedp oxidation rate increased from 52 to 91 within 120 min however the oxidation of hedp was slightly inhibited when the current density increased from 2 5 to 7 5 ma cm2 and the hedp oxidation rate within 120 min decreased from 91 to 88 the active chlorine concentration in the uv eo system was also detected for explaining the difference of hedp oxidation under various current density fig 3b active chlorine was negligible when the current density was set as 1 0 ma cm2 in contrast the active chlorine concentration increased with reaction time and stabilized after 30 min at the current density of 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 ma cm2 the stable chlorine concentrations were about 8 25 and 55 mg l at the current density of 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 ma cm2 respectively however the increase of chlorine concentration at higher current density did not promote the oxidation of hedp chlorine not only produced ho with uv photolysis eq 2 but also eliminate ho k hocl oh 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 k ocl oh 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 31 higher chlorine dosage in the uv chlorine process promoted the transformation from the primary radicals of ho to the secondary radical clo via eq 3 22 higher concentration of chlorine in the uv eo system produced more ho and simultaneously brought about significant consumption of ho nb was used as probe compound to quantify the steady state concentration of ho in the system at different current densities and the results were presented in table 1 a significant increase in ho concentration was observed i e increased from 1 46 10 13 to 5 92 10 13 m as the current density increased from 1 0 to 2 5 ma cm2 followed by a slight decrease as the current density was further increased the observed change in the ho concentration was consistent with the oxidation rule of hedp and further confirmed that ho was the primary active species in the uv eo system hence the degradation of hedp did not enhance at high current density with high power consumption despite of higher concentration of chlorine produced similar results were also observed in the uv chlorine system for degradation of hedp 18 2 hclo c lo hv hho clo k hclo 1 19 10 3 s 1 k clo 1 04 10 3 s 1 3 hclo c lo ho h 2 o o h clo k hclo 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 k clo 1 85 109 m 1 s 1 3 3 2 effect of chloride the chloride concentration in ro concentrate usually ranges from 800 to 9000 mg l 32 35 and it is a crucial factor in determining the types of reactive species in the uv eo system thus the hedp degradation in uv eo system was investigated under various chloride concentrations and the results were presented in fig 4a when the initial sodium chloride concentration was 2 5 g l the near complete hedp oxidation occurred within 120 min in contrast with the sodium chloride concentration increasing from 2 5 g l to 5 0 g l and 10 0 g l hedp oxidation rate decreased from 97 to 91 and 85 respectively this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that excess chloride would act as a scavenger of reactive radicals and decrease the destruction of hedp when the sodium chloride concentration increased from 2 5 g l to 5 0 g l active chlorine concentration in the uv eo system increased from 5 8 mg l to about 25 mg l however as sodium chloride concentration further increased to 10 0 g l active chlorine concentration almost did not increase continuously the above results indicated that increasing chlorine concentration from 8 mg l to 25 mg l had minimal impact on hedp oxidation in the uv eo system accordingly a reduction in hedp oxidation in the presence of 5 0 g l and 10 0 g l sodium chloride was observed which can be attributed to the existence of higher chlorine concentration and excess chloride the excess chloride will convert ho into low reactive radicals clo eq 3 and cloh eq 4 respectively 4 c l ho cloh 3 3 3 effect of ph ph is a crucial factor in the uv eo process as it impacts the distribution of active chlorine species typically the ph of membrane influent ranges from 6 5 to 7 2 for control scaling or silicate fouling on the membrane surface the ph was occasionally adjusted to acidity or alkalinity respectively thus the degradation of hedp under initial ph of 4 5 6 5 and 9 0 were evaluated and the results were shown in fig 5a the bulk solution ph did not deviate significantly from the initial ph during the electrolysis process due to borate buffering effect the oxidation of hedp in the uv eo process was found to be strongly ph dependent with the highest rate of degradation occurring at ph 4 5 hedp was almost degraded at 60 min when the initial ph was 4 5 while 30 and 77 of hedp remained in solution at the ph of 6 5 and 9 5 respectively the inhibitory effect of increasing ph on the oxidation of micropollutants has been observed in uv chlorine system 27 the ph affects the formation species distribution and decomposition of active chlorine the active chlorine concentrations at various ph of 4 5 6 5 and 9 5 were shown in fig 5b negligible active chlorine was determined in the uv eo system at the ph 9 5 and the degradation of hedp may be primarily attributed to ho oxidation as well as electrochemical direct oxidation and uv photolysis evolution of cl2 was favored at acidic ph whereas its formation is inhibited at alkaline ph 36 there was no obvious difference between the chlorine concentration at ph 6 5 and that at ph 4 5 as the pk a value of hclo is reported to be 7 5 hclo is the main chemical species at ph of 4 5 although the ph of 6 5 was lower than the pk a of hclo about 10 of active chlorine existed as clo in the solution radical production from clo photolysis is lower than that from hclo photolysis because of the lower quantum yield 0 9 vs 1 0 of clo 37 more importantly the radical scavenger effects of clo to ho is 3 4 times stronger than hclo eq 3 38 accordingly the inhibition of ho with the increasing ph is mainly attributed the higher scavenging effect of clo compared to hclo at higher ph the radical quantitative results table 1 showed that the ho concentration reached 8 25 10 13 m which was higher than 5 00 10 13 m at ph 6 5 and 1 25 10 13 m at ph 9 5 wu et al observed similar results that the concentrations of ho in the uv chlorine system decreased by 80 from ph 4 7 to 8 4 which resulted in 70 inhibition of pollutant degradation 27 the pk a values of hedp are 1 9 3 8 8 1 and 10 1 table s2 39 indicating that the deprotonation of hedp was promoted as the ph value increased from 4 5 to 9 5 during the uv eo process previous study reported an increase in the second order rate constants of ho and hedp from 6 74 108 to 1 38 109 m 1 s 1 as the ph value increases from 5 0 to 9 0 39 however the observed increase in the rate constant was not significant enough to compensate for the considerable decrease in the steady state concentration of ho leading to the inhibition of hedp degradation 3 4 kinetic modeling of active chlorine in the uv eo system the degradation rate of hedp in the uv eo system varied depending on factors such as current density chloride concentration and ph of the saline water the anova results table s1 showed that the initial ph value had the most significant impact on hedp degradation with a corresponding p value of 0 001 ho was the primary species responsible for hedp degradation and its generation and transformation were influenced by active chlorine concentration and species in the uv eo system on one hand ho derived from uv photolysis of active chlorine on the other hand active chlorine could convert ho into clo the active chlorine concentration in the uv eo system increased with increasing of current density and chloride concentration in the saline water ph of saline water affected both concentration of active chlorine and the species distribution of active chlorine as such hedp degradation rate under various conditions highly depended on active chlorine in the uv eo system accordingly understanding of active chlorine evolution under various current density sodium chloride concentration and ph is crucial for optimization of the uv eo system to degrade hedp efficiently kinetic modeling is an effective tool for gaining insight into the formation photolysis and transformation of active chlorine as well as its interaction with radicals we here in develop a mechanistically based kinetic model to describe the chlorine evolution in the uv eo system the core components of the model include i active chlorine evolution during the electrolysis of saline water reactions 1 5 in table s3 ii photolysis of active chlorine with uv reactions 6 7 in table s3 and iii radical chain reactions in the uv eo process reactions 8 61 in table s3 according to this mechanism cl is initially adsorbed on the anode and is transformed into the cl with the release of an electron reaction 1 the generated cl combines with the cl adjacent to the electrodes to yield cl2 reaction 2 alternatively the combination of two cl can also generates cl2 reaction 3 subsequently hclo generates from the hydrolysis of cl2 reactions 11 12 hclo is reduced to chloride ion at the cathode surface reaction 4 in the uv eo process the uv photolysis of hocl ocl produces reactive species such as ho and cl reactions 6 7 the conversion of radicals further complicates the uv eo process both ho and cl react with cl to form cloh reaction 19 and cl2 reaction 26 respectively cl and ho also consumed hocl ocl as clo is produced reactions 28 29 42 43 here above reactions are the key reactions that determine formation and decay of active chlorine the active chlorine concentrations were calculated using the kinetic model with the reactions shown in table s3 as can be seen from fig 6a d kinetic model has a good agreement with experimental data to satisfactorily describe the active chlorine evolution under various conditions such as current densities initial cl concentrations and ph of saline water active chlorine concentration increased linearly with reaction time in the eo system and increased with increasing of current density in the range of 2 5 7 5 ma cm2 by contrast active chlorine concentration first increased with reaction time and then has been stable since 30 min in the uv eo system stable concentration of active chlorine increased with increasing from 2 5 to 7 5 ma cm2 in the uv eo system the stable concentration of active chlorine also increased with chloride concentration increasing the stable concentration of active chlorine at ph 4 5 had no significant difference from that at ph 6 5 overall the active chlorine evolution in the uv eo system had similar trends with that in the presence of hedp under various conditions the stable concentration of active chlorine in the uv eo system also had little difference from that in the presence of hedp except at the current density of 7 5 ma cm2 the mechanistically based kinetic model developed here provides an effective method to both interpret the experimental data and determine optimal conditions for hedp oxidation according to the initial chloride and ph of saline water it was found that the hedp was oxidized cost effectively with the active chlorine in the range of 5 10 mg l even if an active chlorine concentraiton rose to 25 or 55 mg l hedp degradation did not improve this only results in a dramatic decrease in current efficiency and increase in power consumption it is easy to know the appropriate current density basing the model results according to the initial chloride and ph of saline water the designer or operator could make the uv eo system work optimally by only adjusting the current density 4 conclusion a uv eo system was built for degrading hedp in saline water without additional of oxidant it can be concluded that 1 ho derived from uv photolysis of active chlorine in situ generated electrochemically enhanced degradation of hedp in the uv eo system the degradation rate of hedp reached 90 in the uv eo system uv photolysis alone and electrochemical oxidation contributed 21 and 24 of hedp degradation respectively 2 the optimal current density was 2 5 ma cm2 for degradation hedp in the uv eo system when the current density was set as 1 0 ma cm2 the active chlorine was too scarce to produce ho on the other hand higher concentration of active chlorine produced more ho and also converted ho into clo as the current density increased to 5 0 or 7 5 ma cm2 about 40 mm cl 2 5 g l sodium chloride in saline water was enough for efficient degration of hedp in the uv eo system because both higher chloride content and higher chlorine consumed ho the degradation of hedp was efficient at the ph of 4 5 and 6 5 except 9 5 3 the mechanistically based kinetic could simulate the active chlorine evolution in the uv eo process and accurately predict active chlorine concentration according the initial chloride concentration and ph of the saline water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

12494,the generation of high amounts of soil sediment washing solutions is one of the main concerns faced in ex situ treatment techniques so in the present research we have demonstrated the suitability of an organic salt like sodium potassium tartrate to efficiently promote phase segregation in a model soil washing solution containing biodegradable non ionic surfactants tween 80 and tergitol 15s9 and heavy metals copper zinc and cadmium after a preliminary screening of the demixing effect of different inorganic and organic salts like ammonium nitrate ammonium acetate and sodium potassium tartrate the aqueous two phase systems were characterized in depth at room temperature by defining the immiscibility region and correlating the experimental data with three empirical equations and the results were discussed in the light of a thermodynamic function like the gibbs free energy of hydration then the applicability to extract the abovementioned metal ions was researched after tls determination observing high heavy metals extraction percentage over 80 in some cases the extraction process was included in the soil washing process at real scale and it was simulated by means of the software superpro designer that makes up a valuable tool to ease the analysis of the technical viability of the proposed strategy graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords non ionic surfactants heavy metals aqueous two phase systems organic salts process simulation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction heavy metal pollution is one of the significant environmental issues worldwide which poses severe threats to human health and the ecosystem industries such as mining metal finishing and electroplating are the primary sources of heavy metal pollution in soils and sediments 1 2 these pollutants are non biodegradable and have long term persistence in the environment so the development of effective tools to remove them is crucial several techniques have been developed for the remediation of heavy metal contaminated sediments and soils including physicochemical and biological methods 3 although the latter are known to be environmentally friendlier they are limited by the slow rate of remediation and are not suitable for highly contaminated sediments then physico chemical methods are set as a useful choice in specific cases 4 among the alternatives soil sediments washing assisted by industrial surfactants has been found effective in removing heavy metals from contaminated solid matrices as these surface active compounds may enhance the mobility of heavy metals by altering the surface properties of the soil sediment 5 surfactants can also form complexes with heavy metals by increasing their solubility making them more accessible for removal 6 several types of industrial surfactants have been used for heavy metal remediation from sediments including ionic and non ionic surfactants 7 ionic surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate sds or hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab have been used but negative aspects such as their high toxicity and environmental persistence have hindered their actual application 8 on the contrary non ionic surfactants like tween family entail a greater biocompatibility as their low toxicity and biodegradability has already been demonstrated 9 however even when biodegradable non ionic surfactants are employed for soil sediment washing the generation of vast volumes of wastewater effluents containing surfactants and heavy metals is a problem that should be faced by the academic community in this sense the existence of aqueous two phase systems atps opens up new opportunities to improve the polluted soil sediments treatment by extracting these pollutants from washing solutions and reducing the aqueous volumes to be managed atps are liquid liquid systems composed of two immiscible aqueous phases that form a clear two phase system in the presence of an appropriate concentration of a phase separating agent 10 the usefulness of atps for specific tasks like heavy metal extraction has been demonstrated in different research works as can be observed in table 1 1 3 11 23 the analysis of the data reveals that all of them require a minimum of three chemicals one polymer and two salts to get high removal percentages in this sense it is outstanding that triton x 100 surfactants are among the most frequently employed ones for heavy metals extraction however this chemical has been recently banned by the reach annex xiv european chemicals agency so the search of more sustainable alternatives must be pursued taking this into account the present research will focus on the selection of more biodegradable surfactants like polyalkoxylated families able to remove three model heavy metals copper zinc and cadmium ions commonly present in soil sediment washing streams among the possible candidates tween 80 and tergitol 15s9 stand out due to their high biodegradability and biocompatibility as well as suitable physical properties 24 26 nonetheless even when biodegradable compounds are employed in the washing strategy the impact of solutions with high concentrations in a specific environmental location should not be neglected so the idea of reusing the washing solution is crucial to warrant a true environmentally sustainable process in this work we have proposed the removal of three model heavy metals cu2 zn2 and cd2 by the addition of three salts ammonium nitrate ammonium acetate and sodium potassium tartrate to aqueous solutions containing two non ionic surfactants tween 80 and tergitol 15 s9 at room temperature a revision of relevant literature data indicates that this combination represents a new perspective in the field of soil sediments treatment to promote the reuse of surfactant containing washing effluents the experimental solubility curves and their empirical correlations have been carried out in order to corroborate the viability of this strategy in the same line the extractant potential of the abovementioned inorganic and organic salts has been previously assessed with the molar gibbs free energy of hydration δghyd and their adequacy has been experimentally confirmed heavy metal extraction has been experimentally evaluated after determining tie lines tl and two derived parameters tie line length tll and slope s a theoretical study of these experimental data has been included by using the bancroft and othmer tobias equations the extraction percentage of cu2 zn2 and cd2 in the presence and absence of a complexant agent kscn was investigated to corroborate the effectiveness of atps for reusing washing effluents finally superpro designer v8 5 was employed to simulate a flowsheet diagram to get hints about the technical viability of the proposed surfactant based atps 2 experimental section 2 1 materials tergitol 15s9 and tween 80 were the non ionic surfactants employed in the present work while potassium sodium tartrate ammonium acetate and ammonium nitrate were the salts used as segregation agents the formulas purity and provenance of all of them are compiled in table s1 together with those referred to the metal salts copper chloride cadmium chloride and zinc sulfate and complexing agent potassium thiocyanate 2 2 solubility curves and tie lines determination the cloud point titration method at room temperature was employed for solubility curves determination as reported previously 27 briefly saturated salt solutions with known concentrations were added to a glass tube containing the non ionic surfactants until a turbid mixture was attained which represents the presence of a biphasic mixture then distilled water was added up to a transparent solution was obtained which indicates the boundary of the biphasic region this operation scheme was repeated to get the complete mapping of the immiscibility region tie line tl data were obtained after preparation of a biphasic mixture in a glass decanter as indicated elsewhere 28 including an initial agitation step in a stirring plate followed by a 24 h period at room temperature until thermodynamic equilibrium was reached 2 3 metal extraction and quantification metal ion extraction was studied in aqueous effluents containing different concentrations of copper chloride cadmium chloride and zinc sulfate as indicated in table s2 these metal ions were present in aqueous solutions of non ionic surfactants prior to the addition of the salting out component appropriate amounts of segregation agent were weighed in a glass tube together with the non ionic surfactant aqueous solution up to a total weight of 3 g afterwards the mixture was agitated for 1 h at 400 rpm with a magnetic bar and left to settle for 24 h in a separation funnel like the procedure described for tl determination after segregation at the desired tl composition metal concentration was analysed in both the heavy and light layers by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes icap pro xp duo thermofisher once the appropriate operating conditions and background correction were performed samples were introduced through the cross flow nebulizer into the plasma torch including an echelle polychrometer and a preliminary calibration was carried out through a multi element standard solution vi merck by appropriate dilution in hno3 2 v v auxiliary gas nebulizer gas and cool gas ar flow rates were 0 5 l min 0 5 l min and 12 5 l min respectively and the radio frequency power is 1150 w the spectral line for copper is 327 396 nm for cadmium 226 502 nm and for zinc is 213 856 nm the limits of quantification and detection are included in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening the immiscibility region as surfactant assisted washing is one of the well known strategies for the ex situ remediation of heavy metals polluted soils one of the problems is the generation of a vast amount of wastewater that has to be effectively treated therefore solutions need to be addressed to reduce the volumes of wastewater including heavy metals and cleaning soil surfactants the first step of this research work included a preliminary screening of the segregation capacity of different inorganic and organic salts sodium potassium tartrate ammonium acetate and ammonium nitrate they were tentatively selected on the basis of the different gibbs free energy of hydration it has been reported that this thermodynamic function is a valuable tool to get hints of how a salt can establish hydrogen bonds with water molecules 29 which would ultimately be translated into a more efficient segregation in this sense the analysis of the interactions of these salts with aqueous solutions of model non ionic surfactants will be decisive as these compounds have been the most widely used in polluted soil washing up to our knowledge there are no data about the capacity of the selected salts to trigger phase disengagement in aqueous solutions of tergitol 15s9 and tween 80 so the cloud point method was employed to elucidate whether all these biphasic systems are viable the data presented in table 2 reveal that most of all the combinations five out of six allow obtaining an efficient demixing of both inorganic and organic salts especially when tergitol 15s9 was the selected surfactant in the case of tween 80 a gelling process occurs when ammonium nitrate is added which hinders the correct mapping of the immiscibility window based on these promising results the solubility data of the systems tween 80 ammonium acetate or sodium potassium tartrate h2o and tergitol 15s9 ammonium acetate or ammonium nitrate or sodium potassium tartrate h2o were determined at room temperature the data obtained can be visualized in fig 1 and are listed in tables s3 s5 additionally all the data were correlated with three empirical mathematical expressions that were previously used to successfully describe the binodal curves of surfactant based atps 28 30 1 w 1 a exp b w 2 0 5 c w 2 3 2 w 1 exp a b w 2 0 5 cw 2 d w 2 2 3 w 1 a exp bw 2 α c w 2 β being w 1 and w 2 the non ionic surfactant and salt mass fraction percentage respectively a b c d α and β are the adjustable parameters obtained after applying solver function in microsoft excel to minimize the standard deviation σ calculated as indicated below 4 σ i n dat z exp z adjust 2 n dat 1 2 where zexp and zadjust are the experimental and theoretical data respectively and ndat represent the total number of experimental points the values of the deviations compiled in table 3 reflect the suitability of the selected equations to describe the immiscibility region being the second model the one involving the most reliable description the solubility data can be analysed in terms of the surfactants hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb as they bear different abilities to be segregated to the upper phase hlb allows classifying surfactants from very hydrophilic to very hydrophobic varying between 20 and 0 respectively 31 thus this value could be employed as a tool to evaluate the capacity of a given surfactant to establish hydrogen bonds with water molecules which would ultimately define the strength of the intermolecular interplays that should be broken to further liquid liquid demixing the hlb values of tween 80 and tergitol 15s9 included in table s1 reveal the greater hydrophobicity of the latter which explains the existence of solubility curves closer to the origin when the inorganic and organic salts are added to aqueous solutions of tergitol 15s9 c f fig 1 a rational explanation of this fact can be obtained when comparing the chemical structure of tween and tergitol surfactants with a predominance of alkyl chains in the latter which hinders establishing hydrogen bonds with water molecules in line with previous conclusions 32 the analysis of the data in terms of δghyd of the segregation agents included in table s6 allows concluding that tartrate anion with δghyd 1102 kj mol 1 bears a capacity of interacting with water molecules more than three times higher than that of nitrate δghyd 300 kj mol 1 and acetate δghyd 365 kj mol 1 anions which correlates with the existence of binodal curves much more closer to the origin of the orthogonal phase diagram fig 1 regarding the comparison between ammonium and sodium potassium cations it is also noticeable that the latter involves much lower values δghyd nh4 285 kj mol 1 na 365 kj mol 1 k 295 kj mol 1 that are also reflected in the greater segregation capacity of sodium potassium tartrate regarding ammonium acetate and ammonium nitrate with very similar values of δghyd on the basis of these data sodium potassium tartrate was selected as the most effective segregation agent 3 2 heavy metals extraction once the separation agent was chosen the extraction capacity of the proposed systems must be characterized in depth to do that the tls were experimentally determined by means of the lever arm rule as follows 5 y 1 i y 1 f r 1 r r y 1 ii 6 x 2 i x 2 f r 1 r r x 2 i i being f the initial ternary mixture i the light layer ii the heavy layer y1 the non ionic surfactant mass fraction percentage y2 the sodium potassium tartrate mass fraction percentage and r is calculated through the following expression 7 r weight of the top phase weight of the mixture the experimental data obtained are compiled in table 4 and fig 2 together with relevant data like the tie line length tll and the slope of the tls s as they are useful to define how surfactant and salt are distributed between the two layers these data are inferred through the following equations 8 tll w 1 i w 1 ii 2 w 2 i w 2 ii 2 0 5 9 s w 1 i w 1 ii w 2 i w 2 ii where w 1 w 2 i and ii bear the same meaning as that indicated previously the analysis of the data reveals that higher tll values are obtained with greater salt concentrations in the heavy layer because more water is required to hydrate the salt to the detriment of the water content in the surfactant rich phase on the other hand it can be observed that no relevant variations can be noticed when analysing the tls slopes which value is always about 2 2 in line with the analysis carried out for solubility curves characterization tls were correlated with empirical equations like those by othmer tobias and bancroft 33 34 which linearly relate the composition of the light layer with that of the heavy layer in accordance with the following expressions 10 100 w 1 i w 1 i k 100 w 2 ii w 2 ii n 11 w 3 ii w 2 ii k w 3 i w 1 i r being w 1 w 2 i and ii have the same meaning as that indicated previously w 3 is water mass fraction percentage and n k and r are the model parameters the values of the optimized parameters and standard deviations are included in table 5 and reveal that the proposed models suitably describe the experimental data for both tween 80 and tergitol 15s9 the last step of the work consisted in applying the selected salt sodium potassium tartrate to cause phase disengagement in aqueous solutions of tween 80 and tergitol 15s9 containing three heavy metals cu2 cd2 and zn2 the metal ion removal was analysed in terms of extraction percentage ei and distribution ratio di by using the following expressions 12 e i m i ii m i 100 13 d i m i ii m i i where m i ii and m i i are the metal ions mass content in the heavy and light phases respectively and m i is the total metal ion content the data obtained are presented in fig 3 and table s7 and reflect that the proposed system is promising since 70 80 of extraction is recorded for the three contaminants under study as in previous studies focused on the application of atps for heavy metals extraction it can be checked that metal ions preferentially partition to the salt rich phase 8 and the different behaviour detected for each metal can be again explained based on the δghyd thus the extremely negative values of the gibbs free energy of hydration of metal ions table s6 explain the high metal extraction levels to the highly hydrated salt rich phase in line with previous studies 8 then the metals are directly bound to the water molecules through the first coordination sphere of hydration where oxygen provides the required pair of electrons and coordinated water may establish hydrogen bonds with other water molecules what would be the second sphere of hydration taking into account that cadmium oxygen interplay is weaker than zinc oxygen or copper oxygen ones bond dissociation enthalpy bde of cd o 98 kj mol 1 vs bde zn o 159 kj mol 1 and bde cu o 287 kj mol 1 35 it is clear that presence of sodium potassium tartrate is modifying the intermolecular forces to avoid the migration to the light layer additionally other valuable tool to reinforce the analysis of the separation strategy is the analysis of the distribution ratios the data presented in fig 3 evidence greater distribution ratios for tergitol 15s9 than for tween 80 which is also translated in higher extraction levels probably related to the greater hydrophobicity of tergitol 15s9 as previously mentioned besides it is also noticeable in fig 3 that although the distribution ratios are slightly modified when a typical complexing agent like kscn is added no important modifications are detected in the extraction levels which is interesting in terms of process economics and environment sustainability in this sense it can be observed that the equilibrium between metals m and tartrate or thiocyanate are the following 14 m aq 2 x c 4 h 4 o 6 aq 2 m c 4 h 4 o 6 x 2 x 2 aq 15 m aq 2 x scn aq m scn x x 2 aq from these reactions and the experimental data obtained it seems clear that tartrate complexes are preferentially formed over thiocyanate ones which would mean that the metal ions would migrate to the light phase therefore the results allow concluding the suitability of the proposed sodium tartrate salt to extract metals from heavy metals polluted effluents 3 3 simulation of the proposed soil washing strategy as many industrial installations often involve the generation of soil and sediments pollution the remediation process viability at industrial scale must be often evaluated to ease economic and environmental analysis which may include the recovery and recycling of pollutants and soil washing solutions 36 in the present proposal the extraction process designed to allow the recycling of washing solutions containing non ionic surfactant tergitol 15s9 was employed in a soil remediation process in this case superpro designer 8 5v software was employed to simulate a plant with a scale size of 109 000 tons year of soil polluted with 640 kg of cdcl2 130 tons of cucl2 and 410 tons of znso4 the reason for betting in this software is that it is one of the most powerful simulators for biotechnological and environmental processes the conceptual design using computer aided tools is included in fig 4 and was the basis for the process simulation after identifying unit operations feedstocks and products compositions etc from these data the mass and energy balances could be done as well as the gantt charts and the compositions of the most relevant streams are included in table 6 after considering the tls concentrations of sodium potassium tartrate and tergitol 15s9 that were demonstrated to be suitable for heavy metals extraction then four fixed roof tanks 100 m3 each and a silo 70 m3 for washing solution and polluted soil storage respectively were included in the process flowsheet diagram prior to two phase separator composed of a mixer 60 m3 and a settler 600 m3 that are fed through two washing belts treating 12 000 kg of polluted soil per h this plant would allow the treatment of 50 000 kg polluted soil per batch so 2172 batches were required to treat the abovementioned amount of polluted soil 110 000 tons year all in all the present data make up a valuable tool to support decision making on investing and research for recycling and reuse of soil washing solutions in soil sediments remediation processes 4 conclusion the present research work demonstrates the ability of an organic salt like sodium potassium tartrate to act as phase segregation agent in aqueous solutions of non ionic surfactants like tween 80 and tergitol 15s9 the immiscibility regions of these systems were experimentally characterized at room temperature and compared with those generated when other organic and inorganic salts were employed ammonium nitrate and ammonium acetate the data obtained were correlated with three empirical equations and they were the basis for applying the most promising atps those carried out with sodium potassium tartrate for heavy metals cd cu and zn extraction the tls of these systems were characterized and successfully correlated with othmer tobias and bancroft models and they were applied to learn about heavy metals partition it was concluded that all metals preferentially partition to the light phase at levels reaching over 80 in some cases without requiring the presence of a complexing agent so these promising values made up the starting point for simulating a plant able to treat 110 000 tons of polluted soil sediments per year declaration of competing interest the

12494,the generation of high amounts of soil sediment washing solutions is one of the main concerns faced in ex situ treatment techniques so in the present research we have demonstrated the suitability of an organic salt like sodium potassium tartrate to efficiently promote phase segregation in a model soil washing solution containing biodegradable non ionic surfactants tween 80 and tergitol 15s9 and heavy metals copper zinc and cadmium after a preliminary screening of the demixing effect of different inorganic and organic salts like ammonium nitrate ammonium acetate and sodium potassium tartrate the aqueous two phase systems were characterized in depth at room temperature by defining the immiscibility region and correlating the experimental data with three empirical equations and the results were discussed in the light of a thermodynamic function like the gibbs free energy of hydration then the applicability to extract the abovementioned metal ions was researched after tls determination observing high heavy metals extraction percentage over 80 in some cases the extraction process was included in the soil washing process at real scale and it was simulated by means of the software superpro designer that makes up a valuable tool to ease the analysis of the technical viability of the proposed strategy graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords non ionic surfactants heavy metals aqueous two phase systems organic salts process simulation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction heavy metal pollution is one of the significant environmental issues worldwide which poses severe threats to human health and the ecosystem industries such as mining metal finishing and electroplating are the primary sources of heavy metal pollution in soils and sediments 1 2 these pollutants are non biodegradable and have long term persistence in the environment so the development of effective tools to remove them is crucial several techniques have been developed for the remediation of heavy metal contaminated sediments and soils including physicochemical and biological methods 3 although the latter are known to be environmentally friendlier they are limited by the slow rate of remediation and are not suitable for highly contaminated sediments then physico chemical methods are set as a useful choice in specific cases 4 among the alternatives soil sediments washing assisted by industrial surfactants has been found effective in removing heavy metals from contaminated solid matrices as these surface active compounds may enhance the mobility of heavy metals by altering the surface properties of the soil sediment 5 surfactants can also form complexes with heavy metals by increasing their solubility making them more accessible for removal 6 several types of industrial surfactants have been used for heavy metal remediation from sediments including ionic and non ionic surfactants 7 ionic surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate sds or hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab have been used but negative aspects such as their high toxicity and environmental persistence have hindered their actual application 8 on the contrary non ionic surfactants like tween family entail a greater biocompatibility as their low toxicity and biodegradability has already been demonstrated 9 however even when biodegradable non ionic surfactants are employed for soil sediment washing the generation of vast volumes of wastewater effluents containing surfactants and heavy metals is a problem that should be faced by the academic community in this sense the existence of aqueous two phase systems atps opens up new opportunities to improve the polluted soil sediments treatment by extracting these pollutants from washing solutions and reducing the aqueous volumes to be managed atps are liquid liquid systems composed of two immiscible aqueous phases that form a clear two phase system in the presence of an appropriate concentration of a phase separating agent 10 the usefulness of atps for specific tasks like heavy metal extraction has been demonstrated in different research works as can be observed in table 1 1 3 11 23 the analysis of the data reveals that all of them require a minimum of three chemicals one polymer and two salts to get high removal percentages in this sense it is outstanding that triton x 100 surfactants are among the most frequently employed ones for heavy metals extraction however this chemical has been recently banned by the reach annex xiv european chemicals agency so the search of more sustainable alternatives must be pursued taking this into account the present research will focus on the selection of more biodegradable surfactants like polyalkoxylated families able to remove three model heavy metals copper zinc and cadmium ions commonly present in soil sediment washing streams among the possible candidates tween 80 and tergitol 15s9 stand out due to their high biodegradability and biocompatibility as well as suitable physical properties 24 26 nonetheless even when biodegradable compounds are employed in the washing strategy the impact of solutions with high concentrations in a specific environmental location should not be neglected so the idea of reusing the washing solution is crucial to warrant a true environmentally sustainable process in this work we have proposed the removal of three model heavy metals cu2 zn2 and cd2 by the addition of three salts ammonium nitrate ammonium acetate and sodium potassium tartrate to aqueous solutions containing two non ionic surfactants tween 80 and tergitol 15 s9 at room temperature a revision of relevant literature data indicates that this combination represents a new perspective in the field of soil sediments treatment to promote the reuse of surfactant containing washing effluents the experimental solubility curves and their empirical correlations have been carried out in order to corroborate the viability of this strategy in the same line the extractant potential of the abovementioned inorganic and organic salts has been previously assessed with the molar gibbs free energy of hydration δghyd and their adequacy has been experimentally confirmed heavy metal extraction has been experimentally evaluated after determining tie lines tl and two derived parameters tie line length tll and slope s a theoretical study of these experimental data has been included by using the bancroft and othmer tobias equations the extraction percentage of cu2 zn2 and cd2 in the presence and absence of a complexant agent kscn was investigated to corroborate the effectiveness of atps for reusing washing effluents finally superpro designer v8 5 was employed to simulate a flowsheet diagram to get hints about the technical viability of the proposed surfactant based atps 2 experimental section 2 1 materials tergitol 15s9 and tween 80 were the non ionic surfactants employed in the present work while potassium sodium tartrate ammonium acetate and ammonium nitrate were the salts used as segregation agents the formulas purity and provenance of all of them are compiled in table s1 together with those referred to the metal salts copper chloride cadmium chloride and zinc sulfate and complexing agent potassium thiocyanate 2 2 solubility curves and tie lines determination the cloud point titration method at room temperature was employed for solubility curves determination as reported previously 27 briefly saturated salt solutions with known concentrations were added to a glass tube containing the non ionic surfactants until a turbid mixture was attained which represents the presence of a biphasic mixture then distilled water was added up to a transparent solution was obtained which indicates the boundary of the biphasic region this operation scheme was repeated to get the complete mapping of the immiscibility region tie line tl data were obtained after preparation of a biphasic mixture in a glass decanter as indicated elsewhere 28 including an initial agitation step in a stirring plate followed by a 24 h period at room temperature until thermodynamic equilibrium was reached 2 3 metal extraction and quantification metal ion extraction was studied in aqueous effluents containing different concentrations of copper chloride cadmium chloride and zinc sulfate as indicated in table s2 these metal ions were present in aqueous solutions of non ionic surfactants prior to the addition of the salting out component appropriate amounts of segregation agent were weighed in a glass tube together with the non ionic surfactant aqueous solution up to a total weight of 3 g afterwards the mixture was agitated for 1 h at 400 rpm with a magnetic bar and left to settle for 24 h in a separation funnel like the procedure described for tl determination after segregation at the desired tl composition metal concentration was analysed in both the heavy and light layers by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes icap pro xp duo thermofisher once the appropriate operating conditions and background correction were performed samples were introduced through the cross flow nebulizer into the plasma torch including an echelle polychrometer and a preliminary calibration was carried out through a multi element standard solution vi merck by appropriate dilution in hno3 2 v v auxiliary gas nebulizer gas and cool gas ar flow rates were 0 5 l min 0 5 l min and 12 5 l min respectively and the radio frequency power is 1150 w the spectral line for copper is 327 396 nm for cadmium 226 502 nm and for zinc is 213 856 nm the limits of quantification and detection are included in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening the immiscibility region as surfactant assisted washing is one of the well known strategies for the ex situ remediation of heavy metals polluted soils one of the problems is the generation of a vast amount of wastewater that has to be effectively treated therefore solutions need to be addressed to reduce the volumes of wastewater including heavy metals and cleaning soil surfactants the first step of this research work included a preliminary screening of the segregation capacity of different inorganic and organic salts sodium potassium tartrate ammonium acetate and ammonium nitrate they were tentatively selected on the basis of the different gibbs free energy of hydration it has been reported that this thermodynamic function is a valuable tool to get

are viable the data presented in table 2 reveal that most of all the combinations five out of six allow obtaining an efficient demixing of both inorganic and organic salts especially when tergitol 15s9 was the selected surfactant in the case of tween 80 a gelling process occurs when ammonium nitrate is added which hinders the correct mapping of the immiscibility window based on these promising results the solubility data of the systems tween 80 ammonium acetate or sodium potassium tartrate h2o and tergitol 15s9 ammonium acetate or ammonium nitrate or sodium potassium tartrate h2o were determined at room temperature the data obtained can be visualized in fig 1 and are listed in tables s3 s5 additionally all the data were correlated with three empirical mathematical expressions that were previously used to successfully describe the binodal curves of surfactant based atps 28 30 1 w 1 a exp b w 2 0 5 c w 2 3 2 w 1 exp a b w 2 0 5 cw 2 d w 2 2 3 w 1 a exp bw 2 α c w 2 β being w 1

number of experimental points the values of the deviations compiled in table 3 reflect the suitability of the selected equations to describe the immiscibility region being the second model the one involving the most reliable description the solubility data can be analysed in terms of the surfactants hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb as they bear different abilities to be segregated to the upper phase hlb allows classifying surfactants from very hydrophilic to very hydrophobic varying between 20 and 0 respectively 31 thus this value could be employed as a tool to evaluate the capacity of a given surfactant to establish hydrogen bonds with water molecules which would ultimately define the strength of the intermolecular interplays that should be broken to further liquid liquid demixing the hlb values of tween 80 and tergitol 15s9 included in table s1 reveal the greater hydrophobicity of the latter which explains the existence of solubility curves closer to the origin when the inorganic and organic salts are added to aqueous solutions of tergitol 15s9 c f fig 1 a rational explanation of this fact can be obtained when comparing the chemical structure of tween and tergitol surfactants with a predominance of alkyl chains in the latter which hinders establishing hydrogen bonds with water molecules in line with previous conclusions 32 the analysis of the data in terms of δghyd of the segregation agents included in table s6 allows concluding that tartrate anion with δghyd 1102 kj mol 1 bears a capacity of interacting with water molecules more than three times higher than that of nitrate δghyd 300 kj mol 1 and acetate δghyd 365 kj mol 1 anions which correlates with the existence of binodal curves much more closer to the origin of the orthogonal phase diagram fig 1 regarding the comparison between ammonium and sodium potassium cations it is also noticeable that the latter involves much lower values δghyd nh4 285 kj mol 1 na 365 kj mol 1 k 295 kj mol 1 that are also reflected in the greater segregation capacity of sodium potassium tartrate regarding ammonium acetate and ammonium nitrate with very similar values of δghyd on the basis of these data sodium potassium tartrate was selected as the most effective segregation agent 3 2 heavy metals extraction once the separation agent was chosen the extraction capacity of the proposed systems must be characterized in depth to do that the tls were experimentally determined by means of the lever arm rule as follows 5 y 1 i y 1 f r 1 r r y 1 ii 6 x 2 i x 2 f r 1 r r x 2 i i being f the

the following expression 7 r weight of the top phase weight of the mixture the experimental data obtained are compiled in table 4 and fig 2 together with relevant data like the tie line length tll and the slope of the tls s as they are useful to define how surfactant and salt are distributed between the two layers these data are inferred through the following equations 8 tll w 1 i w 1 ii 2 w 2 i w 2 ii 2 0 5 9 s w 1 i w 1 ii w 2 i w 2 ii where w 1 w 2 i and ii bear the same meaning as that indicated previously the analysis of the data reveals that higher tll values are obtained with greater salt concentrations in the heavy layer because more water is required to hydrate the salt to the detriment of the water content in the surfactant rich phase on the other hand it can be observed that no relevant variations can be noticed when analysing the tls slopes which value is always about 2 2 in line with the analysis carried out for solubility curves characterization tls were correlated with empirical equations like those by othmer tobias and bancroft 33 34 which linearly relate the composition of the light layer with that of the heavy layer in accordance with the following expressions 10 100 w 1 i w 1 i k 100 w 2 ii w 2 ii n 11 w 3 ii w 2 ii k w 3 i w 1 i r being w 1 w 2 i and ii have the same meaning as that indicated previously w 3 is water mass fraction percentage and n k and r are the model parameters the values of the optimized parameters and standard deviations are included in table 5 and reveal that the proposed models suitably describe the experimental data for both tween 80 and tergitol 15s9 the last step of the work consisted in applying the selected salt sodium potassium tartrate to cause phase disengagement in aqueous solutions of tween 80 and tergitol 15s9 containing three heavy metals cu2 cd2 and zn2 the metal ion removal was analysed in terms of extraction percentage ei and distribution ratio di by using the following expressions 12 e i m i ii m i 100 13 d i m i ii m i i where m i ii and m i i are the metal ions mass content in the heavy and light phases respectively and m i is the total metal ion content the data obtained are presented in fig 3 and table s7 and reflect that the proposed system is promising since 70 80 of extraction is recorded for the three contaminants under study as in previous studies focused on the application of atps for heavy metals extraction it can be checked that metal ions preferentially partition to the salt rich phase 8 and the different behaviour detected for each metal can be again explained based on the δghyd thus the extremely negative values of the gibbs free energy of hydration of metal ions table s6 explain the high metal extraction levels to the highly hydrated salt rich phase in line with previous studies 8 then the metals are directly bound to the water molecules through the first coordination sphere of hydration where oxygen provides the required pair of electrons

or copper oxygen ones bond dissociation enthalpy bde of cd o 98 kj mol 1 vs bde zn o 159 kj mol 1 and bde cu o 287 kj mol 1 35 it is clear that presence of sodium potassium tartrate is modifying the intermolecular forces to avoid the migration to the light layer additionally other valuable tool to reinforce the analysis of the separation strategy is the analysis of the distribution ratios the data presented in fig 3 evidence greater distribution ratios for tergitol 15s9 than for tween 80 which is also translated in higher extraction levels probably related to the greater hydrophobicity of tergitol 15s9 as previously mentioned besides it is also noticeable in fig 3 that although the distribution ratios are slightly modified when a typical complexing agent like kscn is added no important modifications are detected in the extraction levels which is interesting in terms of process economics and environment sustainability in this sense it can be observed that the equilibrium between metals m and tartrate or thiocyanate are the following 14 m aq 2 x c 4 h 4 o 6 aq 2 m c 4 h 4 o 6 x 2 x 2 aq 15 m aq 2 x scn aq m scn x x 2 aq from these reactions and the experimental data obtained it seems clear that tartrate complexes are preferentially formed over thiocyanate ones which would mean that the metal ions would migrate to the light phase therefore the results allow concluding the suitability of the proposed sodium tartrate salt to extract metals from heavy metals polluted effluents 3 3 simulation of the proposed soil washing strategy as many industrial installations often

all in all the present data make up a valuable tool to support decision making on investing and research for recycling and reuse of soil washing solutions in soil sediments remediation processes 4 conclusion the present research work demonstrates the ability of an organic salt like sodium potassium tartrate to act as phase segregation agent in aqueous solutions of non ionic surfactants like
