9510,fresh water is a limited global resource water scarcity footprints wsf have been developed to guide the choices of consumers and supply chains to reduce unsustainable fresh water consumption the available water remaining aware method which is the only method to have gained global consensus assigns wsf for a commodity or product relative to the scarcity of water in the catchment in which production occurs this results in products from water stressed catchments that have a higher wsf than a similar product using a comparable amount of water in water abundant catchments the characterisation of water stress is developed using the watergap global hydrological model here we use the murray darling basin mdb to highlight how watergap does not reflect the impacts that legislation and infrastructure have on the relative volumes of water available for agriculture and the relationship between when and where water enters a catchment and when it is used for agriculture given that these issues are not unique to the mdb it is likely that the aware wsf misrepresents the water stress experienced in other regulated catchments around the world we conclude that for a wsf to be a useful indicator to guide consumer and supply chain decisions in supporting sustainable water consumption it needs to reflect responsible management such as setting aside water for the environment placing caps on extractions and the ability to hold water or transport water well beyond when and where it enters a catchment ultimately wsf should also include a mechanism to assess burden shifting especially if consumer or supply chain decisions were to mean that production moved to another catchment keywords water scarcity irrigated agriculture murray darling basin 1 introduction irrigation of agricultural lands to produce food fibre and biofuel is a key consumer of water siebert et al 2013 reported that globally 307 million ha of agricultural land is used for irrigation with water primarily sourced from surface water i e rivers and lakes the majority of irrigated agricultural land can be found in asia 69 with australia irrigating on average 2 5 m ha annually in australia over two thirds of all irrigated agriculture occurs in the murray darling basin mdb which covers an area of 1 06 million ha and produces 24 billion worth of food and fibre dawe 2020 irrigation water is extracted from rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers or diverted from overland flows extracting water from these sources can be associated with negative environmental impacts such as changes to wetland ecology kingsford 2000 and a decline in waterbird populations kingsford and thomas 2004 impacts such as these have resulted in consumers and businesses becoming increasingly aware of the effects their consumption has on the environment these concerns have led to the development of indicators such as water scarcity footprints to assess impacts with the intention of guiding purchases and procurement to more sustainable products footprints have been advocated as a method for assessing environmental impacts of products and supply chains with the most recently developed aware water scarcity footprint wsf the preferred approach to assess water impacts boulay et al 2018 recent work has re calculated the wsf of mdb with a focus on cotton production bontinck et al 2022 however in this paper we provide additional critique of the aware water scarcity index in the context of its suitability to assess the sustainability of irrigated agricultural products that are produced in the mdb with respect to water impacts we first provide an overview of the aware wsf and explore how accurately this sustainability indicator reflects real world water use where legislation regulates water extractions for agriculture and water infrastructure regulates river flows we also discuss the need for prospective analyses to inform consumer decisions with a focus on key issues that make retrospective analyses unsuitable these points are discussed within the context of a corporation using the water scarcity footprint of two or more substitutable agricultural products e g dairy milk and soy milk to inform a purchasing decision based on reducing the water impacts associated with their supply chain 2 the aware water scarcity footprint assessing water impacts in life cycle assessment has been through many iterations moving from withdrawal to availability and consumption to availability ratios to ecosystem and human demand to availability ratio and finally a global consensus that ultimately resulted in the aware method to characterise water scarcity the purpose and development of the aware method can be found in boulay et al 2018 aware represents the relative available water remaining per area in a watershed after the demand of humans and aquatic ecosystems has been met it assesses the potential of water deprivation to either humans or ecosystems building on the assumption that the less water remaining available per area the more likely another user will be deprived global consensus was that this approach is a more appropriate indicator of impacts than consumption or withdrawal based methods a key component of the aware method is the development of a characterisation factor cf aware which represents the inverse of the availability of water minus demand i e water required for ecological purposes and consumed by humans on an area basis normalised for global values a catchment where demand availability is given a maximum cf aware of 100 while a catchment where water is abundant is given the minimum cf aware of 0 1 calculating the wsf of an agricultural commodity is achieved by multiplying the water used in the production of an agricultural product by the relevant cf aware with the result indicating the scarcity of the water used relative to global water availability a more in depth overview of the data inputs used to calculate cf aware is provided in bontinck et al 2022 just one example of this is that cotton grown in the northern part of the mdb with 8 ml of water per ha would have a water scarcity impact wsf of 800 m3 h2o e due to the maximum cf aware being applied to this catchment whilst cotton grown with the same amount of water in the ganges catchment in india would have a water scarcity impact of 141 m3 h2o e these results suggests that sourcing cotton grown in the ganges river catchment for a supply chain would result in superior environmental performance than sourcing cotton from australia despite rivers in the mdb receiving an environmental water allocation discussed below and the ganges river experiencing regular summer no flow events in recent years mukherjee et al 2018 this apparent inconsistency is because the watergap model does not adequately estimate water supply and demand for these catchments briefly watergap estimates water availability based on the rain that falls over a river catchment and extractions for agriculture based on land use derived from monthly satellite images of agricultural land the flow of water through the system is validated by measured water flows in the system this short communication highlights how the method to determine availability and extractions in the watergap model and therefore the calculation of cf aware misses some of the fundamental processes that determine water availability and extractions in the mdb we argue that this can lead to erroneous conclusions on the sustainability of agricultural production that relies on water extractions in this catchment 3 water legislation 3 1 extraction caps legislation is used to manage water extraction in many countries and one key method to regulate water extraction is the use of a cap and trade c t system cap and trade systems are commonly used to limit environmental damage by limiting the emissions of pollutants to the environment in the context of irrigated agriculture however a c t system places a maximum upper limit on the water that can be extracted from a system a water market then allows users to trade water within the system with the intention that the water will be directed to the highest value use in some locations the cap is fixed e g the ord river scheme australia which has abundant water flows and is capped at 348 gl annually or 8 of total water available or as is the case for the mdb the cap can be adjusted annually based on inflows to the system an example of how this adjustment occurs for the gwydir river basin a sub catchment of the mdb is that only once inflows have been sufficient fulfil environmental requirements and supply essential users e g livestock domestic use and high security water users such as permanent agricultural crops such as nuts for a period of 24 months is water allocated to general security users such as cotton dairy and rice producers although not considered environmental flows the delivery of water to water users can sustain base environmental flows between the release and extraction points and avoid the need to use water dedicated to the environment issues around the aware method considering c t legislation is not limited to the mdb globally many other irrigation sources have c t mechanisms in place notable examples include the ord river scheme in australia aflaj irrigation systems of oman the texas edwards and fox canyon aquifers and the colorado big thompson c bt irrigation project in the united states all hydrological systems in south africa and the shiyang river basin in china of particular note the success of the c t programme in limiting extractions from the shiyang river basin has resulted in the chinese central government implementing a nation wide water rights and water market system wang et al 2019 boulay et al 2018 state that where demand availability then the maximum cf aware of 100 is given to the catchment however this does not consider the purpose of legislation in water management of c t systems for example the mdb where all available water is allocated to either the environment conveyancing or extraction we argue that where demand availability and where a cap on extractions for human use including agricultural production is in place then cf aware does not accurately reflect the sustainability of water use in that catchment this is because a cap on extractions means that any additional production in a system that operates under a c t scheme must come at the expense of other production not an increase in extractions for that purpose hence demand will necessarily equal availability in any system that operates under a c t scheme contrary to the aware method we argue that production that occurs in a system that operates under a c t scheme is more sustainable than production in a catchment where no cap on extractions exists the example of the mdb vs the ganges river catchment is a case in point whilst some rivers in the mdb cease to flow only in times of drought the ganges river has experienced regular periodic drying under normal rainfall conditions in recent years due to over extraction mukherjee et al 2018 yet based on cf aware irrigated agricultural production in the ganges river catchment is classified as being more sustainable than the mdb we propose that any catchment that operates under a c t scheme and where water is allocated to the environment should receive the minimum cf aware possible 3 2 carryover another element of legislation that potentially impacts the usefulness of current wsf methodologies is the concept of carryover carryover is the ability to retain at least some undelivered water allocations in an upstream impoundment i e dam from one year to another when the water is required in the year after the water is captured the water is released from the impoundment and flows to the point of extraction this is an available mechanism in regulated rivers of the mdb the effect of carryover is that w avai l in dry years can be vastly underestimated when based on extractions and irrigated crop production as estimated by the watergap model this discrepancy would be greatest when a very dry year follows a very wet year during which little to no allocations were used resulting in the water stress of a catchment being overestimated for example the holders of general security water entitlements in the murray river sub catchment of the mdb were given no extraction allocations for 2019 2020 due to in flows being extremely low however the official water accounts for the catchment burrell et al 2020 show that 313 978 ml or enough water to grow 35 000 ha of cotton were available to farmers who had carryover water from the previous year as such the method used by the watergap model overestimates the cf aware because the watergap model does not consider carryover in the water balance of a catchment integrating carryover into the watergap model would be challenging because it would require the incorporation of not only the timing of releases from impoundments but also the location of extractions from the system associated with each release 3 3 monthly cf aware in regulated river systems the issue of monthly values for cf aware in regulated rivers face a similar issue to carryover in unregulated river systems a relatively large area of irrigated crop being grown during months of low w avail i e periods of low inflow would strongly suggest that the river system from which the water was being extracted would be stressed however calculating a monthly cf aware is problematic in regulated river systems because inflows are captured in an impoundment when they are highest and released to users when required usually at times of low inflows hence irrigated crops grown in periods of low w avail using water that was stored in impoundments would result in an overestimate of cf aware for those periods 3 4 water transfer schemes cf aware is calculated based on a water balance of a catchment using the watergap model a key deficiency in using the watergap model to calculate cf aware is that the watergap model does not necessarily include water that is transferred between catchments or systems in the final water balance müller schmied 2021 pers comm in the watergap model global hydrology is simulated in 55 55 km grids at the equator and water from a neighbouring grid can be used to satisfy water use even if it is outside the catchment in some instances such as the snowy mountains scheme in australia where water is transferred between the snowy catchment and the mdb water is transferred via existing rivers over distances of hundreds of km so the watergap model does not have the capacity to consider these transfers this is critical as in some instances e g 2019 2020 financial year water transfers from the snowy river can provide nearly 50 of the water used to irrigate agricultural crops in the mdb abares 2020 snowy hydro 2020 the effect of this is to overestimate the cf aware in the system that receives the water because extractions are greater than w avail and underestimate cf aware in the system that provides the water because w avail is over estimated this issue with respect to the aware method is not limited to the mdb as there are other extremely large transfer systems such as the south north water transfer in china and pattiseema lift irrigation projects in india where the distance of water transfers exceed the grid size used in watergap 3 5 prospective analysis the aware method was developed to assess impacts associated with water consumption the implication being that an irrigated agricultural product that is produced with a relatively low wsf results in less water stress than a similar product with a higher wsf we have demonstrated above that this may not hold true for existing production in regulated catchments because the watergap model used to develop cf aware misses fundamental aspects of water use and consumption in these catchments it is even less likely however to represent the consequences of an increase in consumer demand for products with a relatively low wsf produced in catchments with a low cf aware for example if cotton production were to increase in a catchment with a low cf aware and where no c t system was in place then we could expect an increase in environmental impacts due to an increase in demand because additional extractions are allowed in contrast increasing demand for cotton grown in the mdb cotton would not result in an increase of environmental impacts associated with increased water extractions in that catchment because due to legislated cap on extractions no additional water can be extracted in addition the aware method does not consider the market effects that may occur in response to an increase in demand for an irrigated agricultural product that is produced in a catchment with a c t system in place market effects have been integrated into recent research assessing the environmental impacts of changes to agricultural production with a focus on land transformation simmons et al 2020 smith et al 2019 the need to do so was identified for biofuel when it was recognised that if agricultural land a constrained input used to produce food or fibre was instead used to produce biofuel feedstocks then additional agricultural land would be required to ensure production of food and fibre were maintained further the shifting of burdens associated with this agricultural production could result in greater overall impacts and is the basis of the argument that not including market effects results in misleading conclusions being drawn brandão et al 2021 plevin et al 2013 like agricultural land water is a constrained input in irrigated agricultural systems so we can therefore conclude that using wsfs that do not consider the market effects of changes to demand for irrigation water to guide procurement may also result in misleading conclusion 3 6 climate change the watergap model is based on 30 year averages of historical climate and water use data so current cf aware values represent historic impacts not impacts that can be expected in the future climate change has already reduced inflows into the mdb and is expected to continue to reduce inflows in coming years adamson et al 2009 globally other catchments are also expected to experience changes in inflows as a result of climate change arnell 2005 li et al 2016 if a method were to attempt to assess prospective indicators of water stress then there would need to be a consideration where relevant of water that is derived from precipitation and water that is derived from a loss of glacial mass ragettli et al 2016 as for current circumstances however catchments with a c t system that limits extractions will be more sustainable under any changes in inflows associated with climate change than those without 4 conclusions the aware wsf method is not suitable to assess the water scarcity impacts of irrigated agriculture in the mdb the issues highlighted here are not unique to the mdb so it would be prudent that they are also considered when assessing the wsf of other regulated catchments the watergap model is not suitable to be used to inform water scarcity in regulated systems because the model does not assess the issues discussed above this is not a criticism rather the inherent limitations of the watergap require close consideration when using it to develop a globally relevant product labelling to reliably reflect environmental impacts the aware wsf methodology is not suitable to inform consumers or policy makers on the sustainability of irrigated agricultural products produced in the mdb we propose that a new indicator to convey the responsible management of water that includes the impacts of legislation on water sustainability and burden shifting is developed to support decisions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

9511,directly measuring plant transpiration of field crops and determining water use efficiency are difficult but essential to understand plant water relations in this study we aimed to quantify plant transpiration and water use efficiency at diurnal and daily bases using sap flow measurements in cotton growing under plastic film cover and drip irrigation in relation to row configurations and chemical topping field experiment was carried out in 2020 2021 in xinjiang china the experiment included two topping treatments chemical topping using heavy amount of mepiquat chloride and traditional manual topping and two typical row spacing for machine harvesting equal row spacing 76 cm and narrow wide row spacing 10 cm 66 cm sap flow was measured using a heat ratio method after cotton first flowering stage and then calculated to transpiration per plant and per unit ground area chemical topping increased cotton plant height by 12 leaf area index by 13 and stem diameter by 9 but did not

sfm1 ict international armidale australia from 8 july first flowering stage to 30 august in 2020 boll open stage and 13 july to 30 august in 2021 the sfm1 uses heat ratio method hrm to determine sap velocity in a plant by measuring temperature ratios caused by upwards and downwards sap movements the temperatures were measured by thermistors in measuring probes schoppach et al 2021 the positions of probe installation and thermistors in a plant were shown in fig 2 one plant for each treatment was selected to install one sfm1 only outer points of the thermistors in a plant stem were used to calculate transpiration and the 20 25 mm tail of the probe inner points was left outside of the stem and was wrapped by tin paper to prevent direct radiation for avoiding possible errors from instant heating the sfm1 is not suitable for cotton seedling because of the installation requirement of minimum stem during the installation of sfm1 handle driller was used to keep precisely level of drilling holes to avoid heating damage of stem the drill fillings were frequently removed to keep low temperature of the driller to check if the plant suffers water stress two stem water potential sensors psy1 ict international armidale australia were installed in main stem close to the sfm1 in a plant in 2021 before installation of psy1 the plant was trimmed off stem bark with a knife water potential probe was fixed and sealed with silicone and probe was wrapped by tinfoil to prevent radiation the data for both sfm1 and psy1 were recorded at a time interval of 30 min the heat ratio method hrm measures the ratio of temperature increases of two thermistors between downstream and upstream at the points in same distance after release of a heat pulse heat pulse velocity is calculated as follows 1 v h k x ln v 1 v 2 3600 where k is thermal diffusivity of green wood setting to 0 0025 cm2 s 1 in the study marshall 1958 x is the distance between the heater needles and either probe fixed to 0 5 cm and v 1 and v 2 are the increase of temperatures in paired thermistors burgess et al 2001 cotton daily transpiration dtr mm d 1 per unit ground area was calculated by plant transpiration tr and the plant

generally begins after 32 months in most woody species santos et al 2021 all cotton stem is considered as sapwood zhang et al 2020 thus the sa is calculated using measured stem diameter equ 4 stem diameters d cm was measured at the first internode where the sfm1 was installed after first flowering stage the stem diameter at the bottom node stopped growth the total transpiration during a period is the sum up of dtr in this study from the flowering to boll open 2 dtr tr ppd 3 tr v h s a 24 4 s a 3 14 d 2 2 where v h is the average sap velocity per hour that calculates from the measurements of 30 min interval the sap flow meter was powered by a solar panel because of the problem of power supply some data of narrow wide row spacing were missing in 2021 2 5 data analysis we used a beta function with three stable parameters to fit cotton growth mao et al 2018 according to the equation the daily growth rate dw dt of aboveground dry matter was calculated directly by using the first derivative of the equation 5 w w max 1 t e t t e t m t t e t e t e t m 6 dw dt c m t e t t e t m t t m t m t e t m 7 c m w max 2 t e t m t e t e t m t m t e t m t e t m where t e d is the days after sowing das when reaching the maximum aboveground dry matter w max g m 2 the t m d is das when reaching maximum growth rate c m g m 2 d 1 to determine variation of water use efficiency wue kg m 3 during cotton growth season we calculated the wue at a daily base as the ratio of daily growth rate g m 2 d 1 and dtr mm d 1 8 wue dw dt dtr where dw dt is fitted daily growth rate for each treatment and dtr is measured by sap flow meter the overall wue during flowering to boll open stages was the slope in a linear regression between accumulative aboveground dry matter and total transpiration accumulative dtr during a period 2 6 statistical analysis the cotton growth was fitted by nonlinear regression in spss the main and interactive effects of fitting parameters w max t m and t e were analyzed by using the general linear model program in spss putting treatments and year as fixed factors and replicating as a random factor least significant differences lsd were used to separate treatment mean differences at 0 05 level 3 results 3 1 yield and plant traits lint yield was not significantly p 0 05 affected by topping and row spacing treatments but significantly interacted with year there was no interactions between topping treatment and row configuration p 0 05 however lint yield was significantly p 0 05 affected by year with an average yield of 2 7 ton ha 1 in 2021 and 2 1 ton ha 1 in 2020 table 1 chemical topping significantly increased plant height by 12 and stem diameter of the first internode by 9 comparing with manual topping table 1 row configuration did not affect p 0 05 plant height and stem diameter there was a significant difference in plant height and stem diameter between the two years table 1 the maximal lai was significantly affected by topping treatment and row configuration table 1 the lai in chemical topping was 4 64 0 84 13 higher than in manual topping 4 11 0 72 while that in narrow wide row spacing was 4 88 0 46 and was 26 higher in equal row spacing 3 87 0 72 in 2021 lai was higher than that in 2020 especially in equal row spacing 3 2 growth dynamics cotton growth course captured well with the beta function fig 3 with an r 2 above 0 88 for all treatments and years maximum aboveground dry matter w m was across two years and two row spacing 13 1 greater p 0 05 in chemical topping than in manual topping the w m was 19 9 higher p 0 01 in narrow wide row spacing than in equal row spacing table 2 the w m varied significantly p 0 01 in two years topping method and row spacing did not affect t e the time of reaching maximum w m the effects of topping and row spacing treatments on the maximum daily growth rate c m were significantly different p 0 05 table 2 fig 4 chemical topping delayed the time of reaching maximum daily growth rate t m by 1 4 days on average 3 3 sap velocity and stem water potential the sap velocity in chemical topping on average 15 6 cm hr 1 was higher than in manual topping 13 5 cm hr

was much higher than zero for example in the periods from 77 to 80 das in 2020 which was probably caused by a high night air temperature above 20 c fig 5a and b stem water potential in cotton showed an opposite trend with sap velocity that was close to zero at the nighttime and reached a peak value of 2 to 2 5 mpa at noontime dislike sap flow the water potential did not have a plate during daytime fig 6 3 4 daily and total transpirations the daily transpiration per unit ground area dtr differed significantly between topping treatments except for the equal row spacing in 2021 fig 7 the dtr in chemical topping on average was 4 69 mm d 1 during flowing to boll open period in 2020 and 6 45 mm d 1 in 2021 while the dtr in manual topping was 3 78 mm d 1 in 2020 and 5 93 mm d 1 in 2021 the mean daily transpiration in equal row spacing across two years was 4 35 mm d 1 significantly lower than in narrow wide rows 6 42 mm d 1 the dtr in all treatments showed a high seasonal variation ranging from 2 to 12 mm d 1 fig 7 likely because of the variation of climate factors the total transpiration during flowering to boll open period was higher in chemical topping than in manual topping in both row configurations and years especially in 2020 fig 8 3 5 water use efficiency at a daily base water use efficiency for aboveground dry matter varied largely during cotton reproductive period and reached the maximum value of 8 13 kg m 3 in 27 july 2020 and 11 4 kg m 3 in 31 july 2021 fig 9 chemical topping had no significant effect on daily wue except for that in narrow wide rows in 2020 daily wue of cotton differed significantly between years on average 5 70 kg m 3 in 2021 and 4 80 kg m 3 in 2020 the linear regression between aboveground dry matter and total transpiration during flowering to boll open period showed strong linear relationships for all treatments and years with r 2 above 0 84 the overall wue the slope of the regression lines was 5 64 kg m 3 across all years and treatments fig 10 and showed no difference 4 discussion compared with manual topping chemical topping increased leaf area index by 13 but did not affect cotton yield the cotton yield also showed no difference between two row spacing treatments the sap velocity of drip irrigated cotton ranged from 20 to 45 cm hr 1 at the daytime and 0 10 cm hr 1 at the nighttime the daily transpiration in chemical topping was 14 8 higher than in manual topping the wue during cotton flowering to boll open period showed no significant difference between all treatments and years in well irrigated cotton thus our hypothesis was denied however daily wue showed a high seasonal variation chemical topping did not affect wue in cotton because it enhanced both biomass and plant transpiration proportionately due to the increase in lai however the wue in chemical topping was higher than in manual topping in narrow wide row spacing in 2020 fig 9b in narrow wide row spacing the chemical topping might lead to a more compact architecture than manual topping because of denser canopy tung et al 2019 than in equal row spacing that allows more light penetrating to the lower canopy and increases photosynthetic area mao et al 2014 and results in a better light capture and use efficiency the water potential during the daytime was above 2 5 mpa and well recovered to zero during the night fig 6 which showed plants were in a good water supply cochard et al 1992 this confirms that cotton in the experiments especially in 2021 suffers no water stress in the absence of water stress the wue of crops is mainly determined by lai and biomass growth kato et al 2004 the high dry matter is mainly caused by high transpiration kobata et al 1996 making a consistent wue of a crop for high variation of daily wue the peak values occurred in july because of the decrease in plant transpiration probably due to sharp decreases in air temperatures and radiation however it might not affect cotton growth quickly because buffer pool would supplied assimilates for crop growth during a short period when daily photosynthesis was insufficient zhang et al 2008b plant growth is affected by plant population and mepiquat chloride compared to manual topping chemical topping increased plant height number of fruiting branches and reduced internode length of fruiting branches that would cause a compact canopy and likely increased light capture biomass accumulation and the proportion of reproductive organs thus increased plant transpiration and yield the plant transpiration measured by sap flow meter in chemical topping was higher than that in manual topping in two years and two row spacing the increasing plant transpiration occurs almost simultaneously with leaf expansion fernandez et al 1992 suggesting that plant transpiration in chemical topping is mainly determined by leaf area index after chemical topping the cotton plant would grow little bit further 2 3 more leaves in a short period and lead to a larger lai than in manual topping the newly appeared young leaves might have high transpiration pantin et al 2013 because leaves that exposure to light have high transpiration due to favorable ambient temperature and radiation intensity fernandez et al 1992 colaizzi et al 2014 mepiquat chloride increases the stomatal conductance and nitrate reductase activity of plants and promotes water uptake and root growth by increasing lateral root formation through endogenous hormones wu et al 2019 this is likely another reason for the explanation of high transpiration in chemical topping plant transpiration is affected not only by internal factors such as canopy structure and root systems but also by external factors such as climatic and soil conditions in this study soil moisture was always abundant due to drip irrigation and plastic film cover therefore the factors that affecting plant transpiration could mainly be climate factors e g air temperature humidity radiation and weed speed the relationship between plant daily transpiration and climate factors requires a further study the sap flow measured by hrm showed a similar course with the evapotranspiration that estimated using penman monteith method and was closely related to air temperature and photosynthetic active radiation wei et al 2020 our result for plant transpiration 4 3 6 5 mm d 1 was close to previous estimation of potential evapotranspiration etc in cotton during reproductive growth period 5 9 mm d 1 based on bowen ratio and penman monteith methods bezerra et al 2010 but higher than etc based on remote sensing and sebal algorithms 3 5 mm d 1 jose et al 2020 to our knowledge our study is the first time to directly quantify sap flow and plant transpiration in cotton with high accuracy however due to the limitation of instruments we only measured one plant per treatment it existed certain limitations the hrm only measures sap flow of a single plant and likely causes an error when calculating to plant transpiration per unit ground area if the stem diameter and plant population density are not well identified zhang et al 2014 to minimize the limitations in sap flow measurements we measured three plants per plot for stem diameter and aboveground dry matter for calculating the transpiration per plant and per unit ground area and did same measurements in two years to draw reliable conclusions 5 conclusions the heat ratio method was used to determine sap flow transpiration and water use efficiency with high accuracy in cotton chemical topping increased cotton growth and transpiration comparing with manual topping under drip irrigation and film cover cotton growing in machine harvesting row spacing showed same water use efficiency in all testing topping and row spacing treatments our results demonstrate that direct measurement of sap flow is a powerful tool to optimize irrigation managements the quantitatively determining transpiration at field conditions is

holes to avoid heating damage of stem the drill fillings were frequently removed to keep low temperature of the driller to check if the plant suffers water stress two stem water potential sensors psy1 ict international armidale australia were installed in main stem close to the sfm1 in a plant in 2021 before installation of psy1 the plant was trimmed off stem bark with a knife water potential probe was fixed and sealed with silicone and probe was wrapped by tinfoil to prevent radiation the data for both sfm1 and psy1 were recorded at a time interval of 30 min the heat ratio method hrm measures the ratio of temperature increases of two thermistors between downstream and upstream at the points in same distance after release of a heat pulse heat pulse velocity is calculated as follows 1 v h k x ln v 1 v 2 3600 where k is thermal diffusivity of green wood setting to 0 0025 cm2 s 1 in the study marshall 1958 x is the distance between the heater needles and either probe fixed to 0 5 cm and v 1 and v 2 are the increase of temperatures in paired thermistors burgess et al 2001 cotton daily transpiration dtr mm d 1 per unit ground area was calculated by plant transpiration tr and the plant population density ppd plant m 2 in equ 2 the tr cm3 d 1 plant 1 is the production of daily average sap velocity v h cm hr 1 within 24 h and sap area of a plant sa cm2 since heartwood formation generally begins after 32 months in most woody species santos et al 2021 all cotton stem is considered as sapwood zhang et al 2020 thus the sa is calculated using measured stem diameter equ 4 stem diameters d cm was measured at the first internode where the sfm1 was installed after first flowering stage the stem diameter at the bottom node stopped growth the total transpiration during a period is the sum up of dtr in this study from the flowering to boll open 2 dtr tr ppd 3 tr v h s a 24 4 s a 3 14 d 2 2 where v h is the average sap velocity per hour that calculates from the measurements of 30 min interval the sap flow meter was powered by a solar panel because of the problem of power supply some data of narrow wide row spacing were missing in 2021 2 5 data analysis we used a beta function with three stable parameters to fit cotton growth mao et al 2018 according to the equation the daily growth rate dw dt of aboveground dry matter was calculated directly by using the first derivative of the equation 5 w w max 1 t e t t e t m t t e t e t e t m 6 dw dt c m t e t t e t m t t m t m t e t m 7 c m w max 2 t e t m t e t e t m t m t e t m t e t m where t e d is the days after sowing das when reaching the maximum aboveground dry matter w max g m 2 the t m d is das when reaching maximum growth rate c m g m 2 d 1 to determine variation of water use efficiency wue kg m 3 during cotton growth season we calculated the wue at a daily base as the ratio of daily growth rate g m 2 d 1 and dtr mm d 1 8 wue dw dt dtr where dw dt is fitted daily growth rate for each treatment and dtr is measured by sap flow meter the overall wue during flowering to boll open stages was the slope in a linear regression between accumulative aboveground dry matter and total transpiration accumulative dtr during a period 2 6 statistical analysis the cotton growth was fitted by nonlinear regression in spss the main and interactive effects of fitting parameters w max t m and t e were analyzed by using the general linear model program in spss putting treatments and year as fixed factors and replicating as a random factor least significant differences lsd were used to separate treatment mean differences at 0 05 level 3 results 3 1 yield and plant traits lint yield was not significantly p 0 05 affected by topping and row spacing treatments but significantly interacted with year there was no interactions between topping treatment and row configuration p 0 05 however lint yield was significantly p 0 05 affected by year with an average yield of 2 7 ton ha 1 in 2021 and 2 1 ton ha 1 in 2020 table 1 chemical topping significantly increased plant height by 12 and stem diameter of the first internode by 9 comparing with manual topping table 1 row configuration did not affect p 0 05 plant height and stem diameter there was a significant difference in plant height and stem diameter between the two years table 1 the maximal lai was significantly affected by topping treatment and row configuration table 1 the lai in chemical topping was 4 64 0 84 13 higher than in manual topping 4 11 0 72 while that in narrow wide row spacing was 4 88 0 46 and was 26 higher in equal row spacing 3 87 0 72 in 2021 lai was higher than that in 2020 especially in equal row spacing 3 2 growth dynamics cotton growth course captured well with the beta function fig 3 with an r 2 above 0 88 for all treatments and years maximum aboveground dry matter w m was across two years and two row spacing 13 1 greater p 0 05 in chemical topping than in manual topping the w m was 19 9 higher p 0 01 in narrow wide row spacing than in equal row spacing table 2 the w m varied significantly p 0 01 in two years topping method and row spacing did not affect t e the time of reaching maximum w m the effects of topping and row spacing treatments on the maximum daily growth rate c m were significantly different p 0 05 table 2 fig 4 chemical topping delayed the time of reaching maximum daily growth rate t m by 1 4 days on average 3 3 sap velocity and stem water potential the sap velocity in chemical topping on average 15 6 cm hr 1 was higher than in manual topping 13 5 cm hr 1 especially in 2020 the mean sap velocity in equal row spacing was 14 3 cm hr 1 while that in narrow wide rows was 15 2 cm hr 1 fig 5 sap velocity was generally close to zero at night but sometimes was much higher than zero for example in the periods from 77 to 80 das in 2020 which was probably caused by a high night air temperature above 20 c fig 5a and b stem water potential in cotton showed an opposite trend with sap velocity that was close to zero at the nighttime and reached a peak value of 2 to 2 5 mpa at noontime dislike sap flow the water potential did not have a plate during daytime fig 6 3 4 daily and total transpirations the daily transpiration per unit ground area dtr differed significantly between topping treatments except for the equal row spacing in 2021 fig 7 the dtr in chemical topping on average was 4 69 mm d 1 during flowing to boll open period in 2020 and 6 45 mm d 1 in 2021 while the dtr in manual topping was 3 78 mm d 1 in 2020 and 5 93 mm d 1 in 2021 the mean daily transpiration in equal row spacing across two years was 4 35 mm d 1 significantly lower than in narrow wide rows 6 42 mm d 1 the dtr in all treatments showed a high seasonal variation ranging from 2 to 12 mm d 1 fig 7 likely because of the variation of climate factors the total transpiration during flowering to boll open period was higher in chemical topping than in manual topping in both row configurations and years especially in 2020 fig 8 3 5 water use efficiency at a daily base water use efficiency for aboveground dry matter varied largely during cotton reproductive period and reached the maximum value of 8 13 kg m 3 in 27 july 2020 and 11 4 kg m 3 in 31 july 2021 fig 9 chemical topping had no significant effect on daily wue except for that in narrow wide rows in 2020 daily wue of cotton differed significantly between years on average 5 70 kg m 3 in 2021 and 4 80 kg m 3 in 2020 the linear regression between aboveground dry matter and total transpiration during flowering to boll open period showed strong linear relationships for all treatments and years with r 2 above 0 84 the overall wue the slope of the regression lines was 5 64 kg m 3 across all years and treatments fig 10 and showed no difference 4 discussion compared with manual topping chemical topping increased leaf area index by 13 but did not affect cotton yield the cotton yield also showed no difference between two row spacing treatments the sap velocity of drip irrigated cotton ranged from 20 to 45 cm hr 1 at the daytime and 0 10 cm hr 1 at the nighttime the daily transpiration in chemical topping was 14 8 higher than in manual topping the wue during cotton flowering to boll open period showed no significant difference between all treatments and years in well irrigated cotton thus our hypothesis was denied however daily wue showed a high seasonal variation chemical topping did not affect wue in cotton because it enhanced both biomass and plant transpiration proportionately due to the increase in lai however the wue in chemical topping was higher than in manual topping in narrow wide row spacing in 2020 fig 9b in narrow wide row spacing the chemical topping might lead to a more compact architecture than manual topping because of denser canopy tung et al 2019 than in equal row spacing that allows more light penetrating to the lower canopy and increases photosynthetic area mao et al 2014 and results in a better light capture and use efficiency the water potential during the daytime was above 2 5 mpa and well recovered to zero during the night fig 6 which showed plants were in a good water supply cochard et al 1992 this confirms that cotton in the experiments especially in 2021 suffers no water stress in the absence of water stress the wue of crops is mainly determined by lai and biomass growth kato et al 2004 the high dry matter is mainly caused by high transpiration kobata et al 1996 making a consistent wue of a crop for high variation of daily wue the peak values occurred in july because of the decrease in plant transpiration probably due to sharp decreases in air temperatures and radiation however it might not affect cotton growth quickly because buffer pool would supplied assimilates for crop growth during a short period when daily photosynthesis was insufficient zhang et al 2008b plant growth is affected by plant population and mepiquat chloride compared to manual topping chemical topping increased plant height number of fruiting branches and reduced internode length of fruiting branches that would cause a compact canopy and likely increased light capture biomass accumulation and the proportion of reproductive organs thus increased plant transpiration and yield the plant transpiration measured by sap flow meter in chemical topping was higher than that in manual topping in two years and two row spacing the increasing plant transpiration occurs almost simultaneously with leaf expansion fernandez et al 1992 suggesting that plant transpiration in chemical topping is mainly determined by leaf area index after chemical topping the cotton plant would grow little bit further 2 3 more leaves in a short period and lead to a larger lai than in manual topping the newly appeared young leaves might have high transpiration pantin et al 2013 because leaves that exposure to light have high transpiration due to favorable ambient temperature and radiation intensity fernandez et al 1992 colaizzi et al 2014 mepiquat chloride increases the stomatal conductance and nitrate reductase activity of plants and promotes water uptake and root growth by increasing lateral root formation through endogenous hormones wu et al 2019 this is likely another reason for the explanation of high transpiration in chemical topping plant transpiration is affected not only by internal factors such as canopy structure and root systems but also by external factors such as climatic and soil conditions in this study soil moisture was always abundant due to drip irrigation and plastic film cover therefore the factors that affecting plant transpiration could mainly be climate factors e g air temperature humidity radiation and weed speed the relationship between plant daily transpiration and climate factors requires a further study the sap flow measured by hrm showed a similar course with the evapotranspiration that estimated using penman monteith method and was closely related to air temperature and photosynthetic active radiation wei et al 2020 our result for plant transpiration 4 3 6 5 mm d 1 was close to previous estimation of potential evapotranspiration etc in cotton during reproductive growth period 5 9 mm d 1 based on bowen ratio and penman monteith methods bezerra et al 2010 but higher than etc based on remote sensing and sebal algorithms 3 5 mm d 1 jose et al 2020 to our knowledge our study is the first time to directly quantify sap flow and plant transpiration in cotton with high accuracy however due to the limitation of instruments we only measured one plant per treatment it existed certain limitations the hrm only measures sap flow of a single plant and likely causes an error when calculating to plant transpiration per unit ground area if the stem diameter and plant population density are not well identified zhang et al 2014 to minimize the limitations in sap flow measurements we measured three plants per plot for stem diameter and aboveground dry matter for calculating the transpiration per plant and per unit ground area and did same measurements in two years to draw reliable conclusions 5 conclusions the heat ratio method was used to determine sap flow transpiration and water use efficiency with high accuracy in cotton chemical topping increased cotton growth and transpiration comparing with manual topping under drip irrigation and film cover cotton growing in machine harvesting row spacing showed same water use efficiency in all testing topping and row spacing treatments our results demonstrate that direct measurement of sap flow is a powerful tool to optimize irrigation managements the quantitatively determining transpiration at field conditions is

9512,to improve the calculation applicability and operability of regional water saving potential rwsp for paddy rice a calculation method based on remote sensing rwsp rs was proposed rwsp rs consists of three sections a paddy rice mapping by the decision tree algorithm b rice evapotranspiration et inversion under different irrigation modes by the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal and c wsp based on et wspe and irrigation wspi calculation by coupling water balance models for paddy fields the rwsp rs was applied in the zhanghe irrigation district in southern china in 2018 and 2019 the results showed that the three sections of rwsp rs had high precision paddy rice mapping errors ranged from 2 to 16 wspe of paddy rice errors were 26 mm and 5 mm for 2018 and 2019 respectively and wspi errors were 5 mm and 23 mm for 2018 and 2019 respectively the wspi of paddy rice in the whole region was 44 52 million m3 and 99 12 million m3 for 2018 and 2019 respectively rwsp rs has the characteristics of solid operability good regional applicability and time and labor savings making it a recommended method for calculating the rwsp of paddy rice and contributing to regional water resource management keywords paddy rice remote sensing regional water saving potential 1 introduction with the increase in population and nonagricultural water consumption agricultural water is undergoing a severe crisis liu et al 2019 simons et al 2020 siyal et al 2016 over a decade more than 61 of freshwater was consumed by agriculture in china which exceeds 360 billion m3 per year national bureau of statistics 2022 as one of the most water intensive crops and having the most expansive planting area of crops more than 290 thousand km2 per year in china tuong et al 2005 zhang et al 2011 ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2022 paddy rice heavily influences water consumption in china therefore maintaining rice yield and reducing irrigation water consumption has become an urgent problem to be solved in recent decades various water saving irrigation modes for paddy rice have been managed in china these methods are distinguished from flooding irrigation fi including intermittent irrigation ii controlled irrigation and shallow wet sun irrigation liu et al 2019 pan et al 2017 peng et al 2011 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2015 in which ii has attracted extensive attention khepar et al 2000 qiu et al 2015 yuan et al 2008 agricultural water saving potential wsp refers to the amount of water that can be conserved in an irrigation system by adopting one or more water saving approaches he et al 2020 yue et al 2018 wu et al 2019 which can be further subdivided into wsp based on irrigation water wspi and wsp based on evapotranspiration wspe the difference between the irrigation water use before and after the application of water saving approaches is known as wspi when the difference of evapotranspiration et was considered the wspe was defined regional wsp rwsp refers to the water saving potential on a regional scale e g irrigation area basin not point scale e g crop field agricultural water savings can be implemented through the adjustment of cropping systems water saving irrigation practices and efficient water management pfeiffer and lin 2014 to quantify the water saving effect of different irrigation modes several wsp calculation methods have been introduced including evaluating wspi by in situ experiments fu et al 2003 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 zhai et al 2021 although the method offers precise wspi information at the field or smaller scale it cannot describe the spatial variations in wspi on a regional scale and is time consuming and labor intensive based on statistical data duan et al 2002 fu et al 2001 liu et al 2011 rwsp can be obtained accurately in addition to an independent analysis of rwsp zhang and guo 2016 combined statistical data and mathematical models to quantify rwsp under water integrated optimal management and analyzed the economic increment of rwsp however the challenges of statistical data collection and the time lag make this method difficult to popularize additionally crop growth models have been introduced to estimate rwsp fang et al 2011 liu et al 2017 yang et al 2015 which have overcome the statistical data dependence problem reduced costs and improved calculation efficiency however the method inputs point scale data to analyze the regional wspi resulting in spatial errors in the wspi wu et al 2019 2021 proposed a method to estimate rwsp considering the reuse of return flow and implemented it by modifying a hydrological model which can simulate various water saving scenarios but requires too much input data due to the characteristics of comprehensive coverage continuous spatiotemporal coverage and low cost the remote sensing rs technique has been widely used in agriculture kibria et al 2021 mulla 2013 shi et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 regional wspe can be estimated effectively through rs li 2014 peng et al 2009 the approach can embody the actual et distribution of the region and be used to analyze the spatial variation in wspe nonetheless the method aims to analyze the entire underlying surface of the region and does not distinguish ground objects or crop types thus it cannot reflect the regional wspe of different crops only regional et not irrigation water can be presented by the method meaning the method is not directly applicable to regional water resource management to improve the applicability and operability of the wsp calculation method on a regional scale this study proposed an rwsp calculation method for paddy rice based on rs rwsp rs the ultimate results of rwsp rs were presented as paddy rice et and regional irrigation water which can embody the wsp of the region and can be directly applied to regional water use planning and water rights management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study

area and hubei irrigation experiment central station hiecs the study area was partitioned into three subregions for analysis to verify the effect of rwsp rs ground experiments were carried out at hiecs from 2018 to 2019 and 10 groups of paddy fields were selected in the study area 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiments were conducted at the hiecs in 2018 and 2019 to measure the

seepage otherwise the rainfall was collected by the self rated rain gauge at the hiecs in addition to the experimental plots ten groups of paddy rice fields were selected to verify the difference in paddy rice et under different irrigation modes each group contains two adjacent fields which conducted fi and ii respectively the rice growth period rgp was divided into six stages table 1 the criteria of field water depth under fi and ii in each growth stage of paddy rice are shown in table 1 2 3 datasets 2 3 1 meteorological data the meteorological datasets used in this study were acquired from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn and hiecs databases from the jingzhou station zhongxiang station and experimental plots in 2018 and 2019 were collected including

collect data in various formats upload them to the server and then download them ensuring the security and validity of data gathering the contents of the field survey include on the ground objects crop types corresponding latitude and longitude and crop planting time the field survey was conducted in the study area from september 7 9 2019 to avoid mixed pixels and only samples with an area over 90 90 m were selected finally 307 samples were collected which were used to form a decision tree 153 307 and for verification 154 307 the distribution of field survey points is shown in fig 1 2 4 paddy rice mapping the decision tree algorithm is a commonly used data mining method for establishing a classifier song and lu 2015 which is nonparametric and can efficiently deal with large complicated datasets without a complex structure especially for remote sensing classification therefore it was used to map paddy rice and extract rice paddy areas based on the enhanced vegetation index evi and land surface water index lswi the specific processes are described as follows 1 remote sensing image preprocessing the environment for visualizing images envi was used to preprocess landsat 7 and 8 primary images in the sequence of radiometric calibration atmospheric correction and image clipping improving calculation efficiency since the raw images of hj 1a were not corrected precisely by ground control points geographical registration was required in addition to the above procedures 2 key parameter calculations the evi and lswi were calculated by envi and the formulas are described as follows 1 evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ red ρ nir 6 0 ρ red 7 5 ρ bleu 1 2 lswi ρ nir ρ swir ρ nir ρ swir where ρnir ρred ρblue and ρswir are the surface reflectances of the near infrared red blue and shortwave infrared bands respectively obtained through radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction 3 time series spectral profile plotting according to the field survey results the locations of survey points in the remote sensing images were calibrated and the mean evi and lswi of different ground objects were extracted to construct the corresponding time series spectral profile 4 decision tree construction the key features of ground objects were collected according to the time series spectral profile and the decision trees of ground objects were constructed based on the key features 5 rice paddy area extraction according to the decision tree constructed in step 4 the paddy rice was mapped and the rice paddy area was extracted in 2018 and 2019 6 mapping verification two methods were used to assess the accuracy of the resultant paddy rice maps 1 154 regions of interest were generated directly according to the field investigation samples and the confusion matrix based on the region of interest was introduced to evaluate the mapping accuracy the geographical location accuracy of the mapping results was verified by the method 2 the rice paddy area extracted by the decision tree was compared with statistical data to verify the overall mapping results 2 5 paddy rice et inversion the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal a single source energy balance model was proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 it uses a near surface temperature gradient to eliminate the need for absolute surface temperature calibration a major stumbling block in et retrieval sebal was validated by many scholars lee and kim 2016 mhawej et al 2020a 2020b and selected to retrieve paddy rice et in this study 3 l e r n h g where le is the latent heat flux w m2 r n is the surface net

dimensionless since the initial calculation of the linear parameters cannot assure whether the assumed atmospheric condition is in a stable state it is necessary to determine whether the atmosphere is in a stable state according to the obukhov stability length richard et al 2007 if unstable the coefficients a and b need to be recalculated to obtain a new h and then judge whether the atmosphere is stable cycling until h becomes stable 2 5 3 soil heat flux g soil heat flux g refers to the exchange of heat flux caused by multiple factors in shallow soil li et al 2015 described as eq 14

needs to be upgraded to et24 since the evaporative fraction remained constant over 24 h hoedjes et al 2008 it was widely used in et24 computation wang et al 2019 xia et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 which can be obtained as follows 14 e f inst l e inst r n inst g ins t 15 e f 24 e f inst 16 e t 24 86400 e f 24 r n 24 g 24 λ where inst is the instantaneous data 24 is the daily data ef is the evaporative

coefficient kc does not fluctuate sharply over a short time allen et al 1998 and the interpolation method based on kc and reference evapotranspiration et0 was selected to interpolate the calculation results according to the field survey there is no significant difference in paddy rice sowing time and climate in one subregion therefore the same kc value of all rice pixels was adopted in one subregion on the same day the specific steps are listed 1 daily et0 was calculated based on meteorological data in the rice growth period 2 the rice kc corresponding to remote sensing images was calculated 3 rice kc of the day without remote sensing images was attained by linear interpolation 4 the continuous et24 of rice was computed by et0 calculated in 1 and kc calculated in 3 2 6 regional water saving potential for the paddy rice calculation method concentrating on paddy rice irrigation water the wspi of paddy rice under different irrigation modes fi and ii was calculated according to the positions of the meteorological stations and hiecs the study area was partitioned into three subregions fig 1 the input parameters of each subregion were provided by the corresponding meteorological station and remote sensing images based on the results of paddy rice mapping paddy rice et by sebal was extracted due to cloud pollution of clouds and cloud shadows the paddy rice et of some pixels was unrealistic the outliers with a corresponding kc greater than 2 0 or less than 0 5 liu et al 2016 montazar et al 2017 allen et al 1998 were eliminated in the study area taking ten groups of rice paddies under fi and ii as samples the difference of rice et under different irrigation modes was validated the et was coupled to the traditional water balance model of paddy fields and the daily water balance components and wspi were obtained combined with the results of paddy rice mapping and the water balance components the rwsp of paddy rice under different irrigation modes was

fig 3 the evi of plants paddy rice forest and upland in june and july was greater than that of other ground objects over 0 5 in addition the lswi of the forest was higher than that of paddy rice after august which can be selected to distinguish between forest and paddy rice since the paddy field always maintains a mixed condition of water and rice during the rice growth period rgp the lswi of paddy rice is significantly higher than that of the upland crop at the corresponding time based on the above features of the time series spectral profile the decision tree of paddy rice mapping was plotted as shown in fig 4 the spatial distribution of rice paddies derived from the decision trees in 2018 and 2019 is shown in fig 5 rice paddies were concentrated in the central and southern regions with fewer paddies in the north where altitude and topography prohibited rice growth good irrigation conditions and adequate water resources are required by paddy rice which is more suitable on plains dong et al 2016 in 2018 and 2019 the rice paddy areas were 155 510 hm2 54 430 hm2 68 570 hm2 and 32 510 hm2 for subregions and 166 630 hm2 56 600 hm2 82 590 hm2 and 27 440 hm2 for subregions respectively the confusion matrix generated from the region of interest was used to evaluate the accuracy of the resultant paddy rice mapping in 2018 and 2019 the overall classification accuracy values were 89 and 92 respectively and the kappa coefficients were 0 87 and 0 90 respectively in the study area duodao district and shayang county jingmen bureau of statistics 2021 were selected as the verification areas for paddy rice mapping table 2 and the relative errors were 2 16 therefore whether for the geographical location or the general rice paddy area paddy rice mapping can reflect the actual situation of rice in the study area 3 2 paddy rice et inversion sebal was used to quantify the paddy rice et of the rgp during 2018 2019 according to the field survey almost all paddy fields in the study area adopt the fi therefore except for the ten selected sample points the other paddy fields defaulted to fi fig 6 shows that the regional distribution of paddy rice et did not represent apparent regularity but the high value was always concentrated in the central region in 2018 and 2019 the mean values of paddy rice et of the rgp in the study area were 490 mm and 439 mm table 3 respectively as shown in fig 7 during the rgp et under ii was slightly lower than fi most of the time but higher than fi in others under the two irrigation modes there was no temporal consistency in the water condition change in the paddy field so the irrigation behavior was not synchronized resulting in the paddy rice et under ii being more remarkable than that under fi at times the results showed that the paddy rice et of the rgp under ii was 1 2 and 3 3 less than that under fi in 2018 and 2019 respectively this finding was consistent with previous studies cheng et al 2006 cui et al 2001 deng et al 2020 indicating that sebal can reflect the difference in paddy rice et under different irrigation modes the 10 day measured et of paddy rice under different irrigation modes in hiecs from 2018 to 2019 was used to check the validity of sebal fig 8 the 10 day rice et under fi and ii inversed by sebal agreed well with the measured value the average absolute error mae average relative error mre root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r2 of paddy rice et under fi were 4 51 mm 10 day 9 5 88 mm 10 day and 0 74 respectively and those under ii were 6 10 mm 10 day 12 5 34 mm 10 day and 0 64 respectively the inversion error under ii was slightly larger than that under fi due to the more complex water condition change in the paddy field under ii azevedo et al 2008 borin et al 2016 cheng et al 2006 cui et al 2001 deng et al 2020 peng et al 2006 the et inversion errors of the rgp were less than 7 table 4 fig 8 shows that the fitting results under the two irrigation modes were close to the 1 1 line indicating that the inversion results agreed with the measurements 3 3 the water saving potential of paddy rice the wspi from rwsp rs was similar to the measured values table 4 and the water balance component values of the two remained highly consistent in 2018 and 2019 the wspe errors were 26 mm and 5 mm respectively in 2018 the wspi calculated by the rwsp rs and the value measured was 27 mm and 32 mm respectively and the error was only 5 mm the error in 2019 was higher than that in 2018 reaching 23 mm because the wspi in 2019 was high reaching 73 mm so the absolute error exceeded that in 2018 the mean wspe calculated by rwsp rs over the two years was lower than wspi 12 mm vs 39 mm respectively and the wsre was also lower than wsri 2 vs 15 respectively there are differences in the water saving methods between wspe and wspi the mechanism of wspe is that when there is no water layer in the paddy field soil evaporation will decrease sharply however rice transpiration will not be affected heavily because the lower limit of water depth during the rgp except ly and yr is not lower than 80 of the saturated soil moisture content wang et al 2013 zhang and xue 2001 considering the two water consumption methods of soil evaporation and plant transpiration the wspe will not be very high however the wspi is generated from et leakage li et al 1998 and drainage reduction so the wspi is more significant than the wspe the primary method of wspi was the reduction in seepage because under ii the paddy field will not maintain the water layer condition for a long time compared with fi and the total seepage will be significantly less than the latter 108 mm vs 138 mm respectively overall the wspi can partly reflect the information contained in the wspe which could be better applied to regional water resource management from table 5 the differences in paddy rice wspi between years in the same subregion were apparent reaching 58 mm in subregion 3 which is mainly due to significant discrepancies in rainfall during the rgp 2018 375 mm 2019 289 mm leading to the tremendous difference in water conditions in 2019 compared to 2018 thus irrigation water under ii decreased more in 2019 than in 2018 the spatial distribution of wspi in the different years was disparate showing a downward trend from north to south in 2019 and a reverse trend in 2018 the mean wspi of subregion 3 was higher than that of subregion 2 and subregion 1 56 mm 39 mm and 34 mm respectively and the wspi showed the same pattern the leading cause is that the rainfall of subregion 1 during rgp in 2019 is far less than the average rainfall of other regions 289 mm vs 375 mm respectively although the subregions were geographically adjacent and in the same irrigated district the difference in paddy rice wspi between subregions in one year reached a maximum of 51 mm indicating that the wspi has apparent spatial heterogeneity consequently it is not suitable to obtain the rwspi by field experiments or crop models with point scale data as input which makes it challenging to reflect the actual situation of the whole region since remote sensing has the characteristics of comprehensive coverage and high spatial and temporal resolution rswp rs can reflect the spatial variation in rwsp in addition the rswp rs exports the wspi and wspe not just the wspe providing a scientific basis for regional water resource management the results showed that the total wspi of paddy rice in the study area in 2018 and 2019 reached 44 52 million m3 and 99 12 million m3 respectively indicating that ii of paddy rice in the study area can sharply reduce irrigation water compared with fi and provide the possibility for efficient allocation of water resources 4 discussion 4 1 calculating water saving potential using rwsp rs the regional water saving potential calculation method for paddy rice based on remote sensing rwsp rs not only solves the time consuming labor intensive and spatial limitations of traditional methods but also overcomes the crop model method limitation of data input to estimate wspi which cannot reflect the actual situation of the region the validation of measured data indicated that the rwsp rs was reliable and could meet the requirements of rwsp analysis compared with the traditional in situ experiment horst et al 2005 zhai et al 2021 the rwsp rs introduced remote sensing to calculate the wspi for the first time representing the actual spatial and temporal characteristics of the region due to the small study area and the input data limitation the study area was divided into three subregions in subsequent studies further subdivisions can be made according to the actual situation and combined with the water intake process to analyze the spatial distribution and variation mechanism of the rwsp the rwsp rs takes rice as an example to calculate the wspi and has a good generalization ability and regional adaptability in practical applications the research object can be replaced or increased according to the actual ground conditions in the study area by changing only the paddy rice mapping and the basic principle is consistent with the original zhuang et al 2019 pointed out that approximately 94 19 of paddy fields are suitable for water saving irrigation in china and li et al 2022 illustrated that the wsp for potatoes is large in china hence the rwsp rs has a good application prospect in the future rwsp rs results show that paddy rice under ii needs less irrigation water than under fi in the same area which coincides with a previous study ishfaq et al 2020 but shows a smaller wsp the discrepancy in field water depth criteria and climate might cause the difference in wsp in different studies but most of the studies have a consistent law the results showed that the interannual variation in the wspi of rice in one region with different rainfall events exceeded 100 with the increase in rainfall the wspi shows an inverted u shaped change when rainfall is low ii can improve the utilization rate of rainfall and reduce seepage resulting in the wspi increasing gradually when the rainfall reaches the threshold the wspi reaches its peak the paddy field will maintain the water layer state if the rainfall is increasing decreasing the difference in field moisture conditions under ii and fi and the wspi eventually trends toward zero in future follow up studies the rwsp rs can be applied to estimate the wspi of a time series to analyze its temporal variation and response mechanism 4 2 uncertainty of the rwsps although the rwsp rs can estimate the rwsp for paddy rice quantifying the wsp in macroregions could still be a challenging task for a few reasons the decision tree was adopted in rwsp rs to generate a rice map for its operability and convenience bad pixels caused by clouds still exist so some rice pixels might be omitted synthetic aperture radar data which are not affected by cloudy conditions may be applied to map paddy rice to overcome the shortage of optical images inoue et al 2014 bazzi et al 2019 due to the discrepancy in the paddy rice growth stage in a large region province level or continent level paddy rice mapping could be inefficient using the decision tree algorithm when rwsp rs was applied in macroregions the decision tree algorithm could be replaced by other specific methods wei et al 2022 xiao et al 2005 sebal has high accuracy in et inversion but some limitations still occur the optical sensor is always affected by clouds and shadows especially in humid tropical and subtropical areas so some images are missing to obtain more accurate et multi source remote sensing data can be applied in the following study in one day the same kc was applied to all rice pixels in one subregion in this study the climate and sowing habits could be significantly different in a macroregion therefore the same kc is not suitable for the whole study area more substudy areas should be generated through dividing rules to improve calculation accuracy taking advantage of the raster climate products e g era5 to calculate kc for each rice pixel is another feasible method 5 conclusions the wspe and wspi were obtained accurately by rwsp rs on a regional scale which has the characteristics of solid operability good regional applicability and time and labor savings 1 the decision tree algorithm can be used to map paddy rice with high precision the paddy rice in the study area was mainly distributed in the central and southern regions the kappa coefficient and total classification accuracy of the confusion matrix were higher than 0 87 and 89 respectively and the accuracy of the estimated rice paddy area was higher than 84 2 the sebal effectively retrieved paddy rice et under different irrigation modes meeting the calculation requirements the mae mre and rmse of the ten day paddy rice et were lower than 6 10 mm 10 day 12 and 5 34 mm 10 day respectively r2 was higher than 0 64 and the relative error over the whole growth period was lower than 7 the error under the intermittent irrigation mode is more remarkable than that under the flooding irrigation mode due to the complex change in water conditions 3 rwsp rs can reflect the spatial variation in wsp and wspi has apparent spatial heterogeneity the differences in rice wspi subregions were noticeable with a maximum of 51 mm the wspe errors of paddy rice in 2018 were greater than those in 2019 26 mm vs 5 mm respectively and the opposite was true for wspi 5 mm vs 23 mm respectively the rice wspi in 2018 and 2019 in the study area was 44 52 million m3 and 99 12 million m3 respectively therefore compared with the rice under fi adopting ii in the study area can

9512,to improve the calculation applicability and operability of regional water saving potential rwsp for paddy rice a calculation method based on remote sensing rwsp rs was proposed rwsp rs consists of three sections a paddy rice mapping by the decision tree algorithm b rice evapotranspiration et inversion under different irrigation modes by the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal and c wsp based on et wspe and irrigation wspi calculation by coupling water balance models for paddy fields the rwsp rs was applied in the zhanghe irrigation district in southern china in 2018 and 2019 the results showed that the three sections of rwsp rs had high precision paddy rice mapping errors ranged from 2 to 16 wspe of paddy rice errors were 26 mm and 5 mm for 2018 and 2019 respectively and wspi errors were 5 mm and 23 mm for 2018 and 2019 respectively the wspi of paddy rice in the whole region was 44 52 million m3 and 99 12 million m3 for 2018 and 2019 respectively rwsp rs has the characteristics of solid operability good regional applicability and time and labor savings making it a recommended method for calculating the rwsp of paddy rice and contributing to regional water resource management keywords paddy rice remote sensing regional water saving potential 1 introduction with the increase in population and nonagricultural water consumption agricultural water is undergoing a severe crisis liu et al 2019 simons et al 2020 siyal et al 2016 over a decade more than 61 of freshwater was consumed by agriculture in china which exceeds 360 billion m3 per year national bureau of statistics 2022 as one of the most water intensive crops and having the most expansive planting area of crops more than 290 thousand km2 per year in china tuong et al 2005 zhang et al 2011 ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2022 paddy rice heavily influences water consumption in china therefore maintaining rice yield and reducing irrigation water consumption has become an urgent problem to be solved in recent decades various water saving irrigation modes for paddy rice have been managed in china these methods are distinguished from flooding irrigation fi including intermittent irrigation ii controlled irrigation and shallow wet sun irrigation liu et al 2019 pan et al 2017 peng et al 2011 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2015 in which ii has attracted extensive attention khepar et al 2000 qiu et al 2015 yuan et al 2008 agricultural water saving potential wsp refers to the amount of water that can be conserved in an irrigation system by adopting one or more water saving approaches he et al 2020 yue et al 2018 wu et al 2019 which can be further subdivided into wsp based on irrigation water wspi and wsp based on evapotranspiration wspe the difference between the irrigation water use before and after the application of water saving approaches is known as wspi when the difference of evapotranspiration et was considered the wspe was defined regional wsp rwsp refers to the water saving potential on a regional scale e g irrigation area basin not point scale e g crop field agricultural water savings can be implemented through the adjustment of cropping systems water saving irrigation practices and efficient water management pfeiffer and lin 2014 to quantify the water saving effect of different irrigation modes several wsp calculation methods have been introduced including evaluating wspi by in situ experiments fu et al 2003 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 zhai et al 2021 although the method offers precise wspi information at the field or smaller scale it cannot describe the spatial variations in wspi on a regional scale and is time consuming and labor intensive based on statistical data duan et al 2002 fu et al 2001 liu et al 2011 rwsp can be obtained accurately in addition to an independent analysis of rwsp zhang and guo 2016 combined statistical data and mathematical models to quantify rwsp under water integrated optimal management and analyzed the economic increment of rwsp however the challenges of statistical data collection and the time lag make this method difficult to popularize additionally crop growth models have been introduced to estimate rwsp fang et al 2011 liu et al 2017 yang et al 2015 which have overcome the statistical data dependence problem reduced costs and improved calculation efficiency however the method inputs point scale data to analyze the regional wspi resulting in spatial errors in the wspi wu et al 2019 2021 proposed a method to estimate rwsp considering the reuse of return flow and implemented it by modifying a hydrological model which can simulate various water saving scenarios but requires too much input data due to the characteristics of comprehensive coverage continuous spatiotemporal coverage and low cost the remote sensing rs technique has been widely used in agriculture kibria et al 2021 mulla 2013 shi et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 regional wspe can be estimated effectively through rs li 2014 peng et al 2009 the approach can embody the actual et distribution of the region and be used to analyze the spatial variation in wspe nonetheless the method aims to analyze the entire underlying surface of the region and does not distinguish ground objects or crop types thus it cannot reflect the regional wspe of different crops only regional et not irrigation water can be presented by the method meaning the method is not directly applicable to regional water resource management to improve the applicability and operability of the wsp calculation method on a regional scale this study proposed an rwsp calculation method for paddy rice based on rs rwsp rs the ultimate results of rwsp rs were presented as paddy rice et and regional irrigation water which can embody the wsp of the region and can be directly applied to regional water use planning and water rights management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the zhanghe irrigation district 30 00 31 42 n 111 28 111 53 e an irrigation district dominated by paddy rice and rape in hubei province china fig 1 the natural and irrigation areas are 554 400 hm2 and 173 700 hm2 respectively including 144 460 hm2 of paddy fields from 2013 2019 an average of more than 179 million m3 of water was supplied for irrigation per year in zhanghe irrigation district the annual average temperature was 16 c and the highest and lowest monthly average temperatures occurred in august and january 27 7 c and 3 9 c respectively the annual rainfall ranged from 700 to 1100 mm with an average annual rainfall of 947 mm the annual average evaporation 20 cm pan ranged from 1300 to 1800 mm according to the locations of meteorological stations in or near the study area and hubei irrigation experiment central station hiecs the study area was partitioned into three subregions for analysis to verify the effect of rwsp rs ground experiments were carried out at hiecs from 2018 to 2019 and 10 groups of paddy fields were selected in the study area 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiments were conducted at the hiecs in 2018 and 2019 to measure the water balance components of paddy fields under flooding irrigation mode fi and intermittent irrigation mode ii including irrigation surface drainage seepage rainfall and et the fi and ii experimental plot areas were 1350 m2 45 m 30 m and 2856 m2 42 m 68 m respectively the water depth was obtained by water level loggers u20l 04 onset inc usa and rulers and a water table probe was used to measure seepage otherwise the rainfall was collected by the self rated rain gauge at the hiecs in addition to the experimental plots ten groups of paddy rice fields were selected to verify the difference in paddy rice et under different irrigation modes each group contains two adjacent fields which conducted fi and ii respectively the rice growth period rgp was divided into six stages table 1 the criteria of field water depth under fi and ii in each growth stage of paddy rice are shown in table 1 2 3 datasets 2 3 1 meteorological data the meteorological datasets used in this study were acquired from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn and hiecs databases from the jingzhou station zhongxiang station and experimental plots in 2018 and 2019 were collected including the daily maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature average wind speed sunshine duration and precipitation 2 3 2 digital elevation model data the 30 meter shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model dem datasets were used in the sebal algorithms which were acquired from the united states geological survey https www usgs gov centers eros 2 3 3 remote sensing images the cloudless remote sensing images of landsat 7 and 8 row 38 39 path 124 total 24 scenes were used for paddy rice mapping and et inversion they provided 30 meter spatial resolution images with a revisit time of 16 days including visible light near infrared shortwave infrared thermal infrared and cirrus bands which were downloaded from the united states geological survey website http earthexplorer usgs gov the clear sky day images of hj 1a total 4 scenes were used to supplement landsat 7 and 8 for paddy rice mapping they were 30 meter spatial resolution images with a revisit time of 4 days including visible and near infrared bands attained by the china centre for resource satellite data and application http 36 112 130 153 77 77 dssplatform index html the remote sensing images adopted in this study covered the whole growing season of paddy rice 2 3 4 field survey data field survey data collection was carried out by the open data kit anokwa et al 2009 enabling users to collect data in various formats upload them to the server and then download them ensuring the security and validity of data gathering the contents of the field survey include on the ground objects crop types corresponding latitude and longitude and crop planting time the field survey was conducted in the study area from september 7 9 2019 to avoid mixed pixels and only samples with an area over 90 90 m were selected finally 307 samples were collected which were used to form a decision tree 153 307 and for verification 154 307 the distribution of field survey points is shown in fig 1 2 4 paddy rice mapping the decision tree algorithm is a commonly used data mining method for establishing a classifier song and lu 2015 which is nonparametric and can efficiently deal with large complicated datasets without a complex structure especially for remote sensing classification therefore it was used to map paddy rice and extract rice paddy areas based on the enhanced vegetation index evi and land surface water index lswi the specific processes are described as follows 1 remote sensing image preprocessing the environment for visualizing images envi was used to preprocess landsat 7 and 8 primary images in the sequence of radiometric calibration atmospheric correction and image clipping improving calculation efficiency since the raw images of hj 1a were not corrected precisely by ground control points geographical registration was required in addition to the above procedures 2 key parameter calculations the evi and lswi were calculated by envi and the formulas are described as follows 1 evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ red ρ nir 6 0 ρ red 7 5 ρ bleu 1 2 lswi ρ nir ρ swir ρ nir ρ swir where ρnir ρred ρblue and ρswir are the surface reflectances of the near infrared red blue and shortwave infrared bands respectively obtained through radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction 3 time series spectral profile plotting according to the field survey results the locations of survey points in the remote sensing images were calibrated and the mean evi and lswi of different ground objects were extracted to construct the corresponding time series spectral profile 4 decision tree construction the key features of ground objects were collected according to the time series spectral profile and the decision trees of ground objects were constructed based on the key features 5 rice paddy area extraction according to the decision tree constructed in step 4 the paddy rice was mapped and the rice paddy area was extracted in 2018 and 2019 6 mapping verification two methods were used to assess the accuracy of the resultant paddy rice maps 1 154 regions of interest were generated directly according to the field investigation samples and the confusion matrix based on the region of interest was introduced to evaluate the mapping accuracy the geographical location accuracy of the mapping results was verified by the method 2 the rice paddy area extracted by the decision tree was compared with statistical data to verify the overall mapping results 2 5 paddy rice et inversion the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal a single source energy balance model was proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 it uses a near surface temperature gradient to eliminate the need for absolute surface temperature calibration a major stumbling block in et retrieval sebal was validated by many scholars lee and kim 2016 mhawej et al 2020a 2020b and selected to retrieve paddy rice et in this study 3 l e r n h g where le is the latent heat flux w m2 r n is the surface net

in a stable state according to the obukhov stability length richard et al 2007 if unstable the coefficients a and b need to be recalculated to obtain a new h and then judge whether the atmosphere is stable cycling until h becomes stable 2 5 3 soil heat flux g soil heat flux g refers to the exchange of heat flux caused by multiple factors in shallow soil li et al 2015 described as eq 14

needs to be upgraded to et24 since the evaporative fraction remained constant over 24 h hoedjes et al 2008 it was widely used in et24 computation wang et al 2019 xia et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 which can be obtained as follows 14 e f inst l e inst r n inst g ins t 15 e f 24 e f inst 16 e t 24 86400 e f 24 r n 24 g 24 λ where inst is the instantaneous data 24 is the daily data ef is the evaporative fraction λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 j kg 1 and the others are consistent with the above information to acquire continuous et24 the preliminary results need to be interpolated the crop coefficient kc does not fluctuate sharply over a short time allen et al 1998 and the interpolation method based on kc and reference evapotranspiration et0 was selected to interpolate the calculation results according to the field survey there is no significant difference in paddy rice sowing time and climate in one subregion therefore the same kc value of all rice pixels was adopted in one subregion on the same day the specific steps are listed 1 daily et0 was calculated based on meteorological data in the rice growth period 2 the rice kc corresponding to remote sensing images was calculated 3 rice kc of the day without remote sensing images was attained by linear interpolation 4 the continuous et24 of rice was computed by et0 calculated in 1 and kc calculated in 3 2 6 regional water saving potential for the paddy rice calculation method concentrating on paddy rice irrigation water the wspi of paddy rice under different irrigation modes fi and ii was calculated according to the positions of the meteorological stations and hiecs the study area was partitioned into three subregions fig 1 the input parameters of each subregion were provided by the corresponding meteorological station and remote sensing images based on the results of paddy rice mapping paddy rice et by sebal was extracted due to cloud pollution of clouds and cloud shadows the paddy rice et of

groups of rice paddies under fi and ii as samples the difference of rice et under different irrigation modes was validated the et was coupled to the traditional water balance model of paddy fields and the daily water balance components and wspi were obtained combined with the results of paddy rice mapping and the water balance components the rwsp of paddy rice under different irrigation modes was

fig 3 the evi of plants paddy rice forest and upland in june and july was greater than that of other ground objects over 0 5 in addition the lswi of the forest was higher than that of paddy rice after august which can be selected to distinguish between forest and paddy rice since the paddy field always maintains a mixed condition of water and rice during the rice growth period rgp the lswi of paddy rice is significantly higher than that of the upland crop at the corresponding time based on the above features of the time series spectral profile the decision tree of paddy rice mapping was plotted as shown in fig 4 the spatial distribution of rice paddies derived from the decision trees in 2018 and 2019 is shown in fig 5 rice paddies were concentrated in the central and southern regions with fewer paddies in the north where altitude and topography prohibited rice growth good irrigation conditions and adequate water resources are required by paddy rice which is more suitable on plains dong et al 2016 in 2018 and 2019 the rice paddy areas were 155 510 hm2 54 430 hm2 68 570 hm2 and 32 510 hm2 for subregions and 166 630 hm2 56 600 hm2 82 590 hm2 and 27 440 hm2 for subregions respectively the confusion matrix generated from the region of interest was used to evaluate the accuracy of the resultant paddy rice mapping in 2018 and 2019 the overall classification accuracy values were 89 and 92 respectively and the kappa coefficients were 0 87 and 0 90 respectively in the study area duodao district and shayang county jingmen bureau of statistics 2021 were selected as the verification areas for paddy rice mapping table 2 and the relative errors were 2 16 therefore whether for the geographical location or the general rice paddy area paddy rice mapping can reflect the actual situation of rice in the study area 3 2 paddy rice et inversion sebal was used to quantify the paddy rice et of the rgp during 2018 2019 according to the field survey almost all paddy fields in the study area adopt the fi therefore except for the ten selected sample points the other paddy fields defaulted to fi fig 6 shows that the regional distribution of paddy rice et did not represent apparent regularity but the high value was always concentrated in the central region in 2018 and 2019 the mean values of paddy rice et of the rgp in the study area were 490 mm and 439 mm table 3 respectively as shown in fig 7 during the rgp et under ii was slightly lower than fi most of the time but higher than fi in others under the two irrigation modes there was no temporal consistency in the water condition change in the paddy field so the irrigation behavior was not synchronized resulting in the paddy rice et under ii being more remarkable than that under fi at times the results showed that the paddy rice et of the rgp under ii was 1 2 and 3 3 less than that under fi in 2018 and 2019 respectively this finding was consistent with previous studies cheng et al 2006 cui et al 2001 deng et al 2020 indicating that sebal can reflect the difference in paddy rice et under different irrigation modes the 10 day measured et of paddy rice under different irrigation modes in hiecs from 2018 to 2019 was used to check the validity of sebal fig 8 the 10 day rice et under fi and ii inversed by sebal agreed well with the measured value the average absolute error mae average relative error mre root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r2 of paddy rice et under fi were 4 51 mm 10 day 9 5 88 mm 10 day and 0 74 respectively and those under ii were 6 10 mm 10 day 12 5 34 mm 10 day and 0 64 respectively the inversion error under ii was slightly larger than that under fi due to the more complex water condition change in the paddy field under ii azevedo et al 2008 borin et al 2016 cheng et al 2006 cui et al 2001 deng et al 2020 peng et al 2006 the et inversion errors of the rgp were less than 7 table 4 fig 8 shows that the fitting results under the two irrigation modes were close to the 1 1 line indicating that the inversion results agreed with the measurements 3 3 the water saving potential of paddy rice the wspi from rwsp rs was similar to the measured values table 4 and the water balance component values of the two remained highly consistent in 2018 and 2019 the wspe errors were 26 mm and 5 mm respectively in 2018 the wspi calculated by the rwsp rs and the value measured was 27 mm and 32 mm respectively and the error was only 5 mm the error in 2019 was higher than that in 2018 reaching 23 mm because the wspi in 2019 was high reaching 73 mm so the absolute error exceeded that in 2018 the mean wspe calculated by rwsp rs over the two years was lower than wspi 12 mm vs 39 mm respectively and the wsre was also lower than wsri 2 vs 15 respectively there are differences in the water saving methods between wspe and wspi the mechanism of wspe is that when there is no water layer in the paddy field soil evaporation will decrease sharply however rice transpiration will not be affected heavily because the lower limit of water depth during the rgp except ly and yr is not lower than 80 of the saturated soil moisture content wang et al 2013 zhang and xue 2001 considering the two water consumption methods of soil evaporation and plant transpiration the wspe will not be very high however the wspi is generated from et leakage li et al 1998 and drainage reduction so the wspi is more significant than the wspe the primary method of wspi was the reduction in seepage because under ii the paddy field will not maintain the water layer condition for a long time compared with fi and the total seepage will be significantly less than the latter 108 mm vs 138 mm respectively overall the wspi can partly reflect the information contained in the wspe which could be better applied to regional water resource management from table 5 the differences in paddy rice wspi between years in the same subregion were apparent reaching 58 mm in subregion 3 which is mainly due to significant discrepancies in rainfall during the rgp 2018 375 mm 2019 289 mm leading to the tremendous difference in water conditions in 2019 compared to 2018 thus irrigation water under ii decreased more in 2019 than in 2018 the spatial distribution of wspi in the different years was disparate showing a downward trend from north to south in 2019 and a reverse trend in 2018 the mean wspi of subregion 3 was higher than that of subregion 2 and subregion 1 56 mm 39 mm and 34 mm respectively and the wspi showed the same pattern the leading cause is that the rainfall of subregion 1 during rgp in 2019 is far less than the average rainfall of other regions 289 mm vs 375 mm respectively although the subregions were geographically adjacent and in the same irrigated district the difference in paddy rice wspi between subregions in one year reached a maximum of 51 mm indicating that the wspi has apparent spatial heterogeneity consequently it is not suitable to obtain the rwspi by field experiments or crop models with point scale data as input which makes it challenging to reflect the actual situation of the whole region since remote sensing has the characteristics of comprehensive coverage and high spatial and temporal resolution rswp rs can reflect the spatial variation in rwsp in addition the rswp rs exports the wspi and wspe not just the wspe providing a scientific basis for regional water resource management the results showed that the total wspi of paddy rice in the study area in 2018 and 2019 reached 44 52 million m3 and 99 12 million m3 respectively indicating that ii of paddy rice in the study area can sharply reduce irrigation water compared with fi and provide the possibility for efficient allocation of water resources 4 discussion 4 1 calculating water saving potential using rwsp rs the regional water saving potential calculation method for paddy rice based on remote sensing rwsp rs not only solves the time consuming labor intensive and spatial limitations of traditional methods but also overcomes the crop model method limitation of data input to estimate wspi which cannot reflect the actual situation of the region the validation of measured data indicated that the rwsp rs was reliable and could meet the requirements of rwsp analysis compared with the traditional in situ experiment horst et al 2005 zhai et al 2021 the rwsp rs introduced remote sensing to calculate the wspi for the first time representing the actual spatial and temporal characteristics of the region due to the small study area and the input data limitation the study area was divided into three subregions in subsequent studies further subdivisions can be made according to the actual situation and combined with the water intake process to analyze the spatial distribution and variation mechanism of the rwsp the rwsp rs takes rice as an example to calculate the wspi and has a good generalization ability and regional adaptability in practical applications the research object can be replaced or increased according to the actual ground conditions in the study area by changing only the paddy rice mapping and the basic principle is consistent with the original zhuang et al 2019 pointed out that approximately 94 19 of paddy fields are suitable for water saving irrigation in china and li et al 2022 illustrated that the wsp for potatoes is large in china hence the rwsp rs has a good application prospect in the future rwsp rs results show that paddy rice under ii needs less irrigation water than under fi in the same area which coincides with a previous study ishfaq et al 2020 but shows a smaller wsp the discrepancy in field water depth criteria and climate might cause the difference in wsp in different studies but most of the studies have a consistent law the results showed that the interannual variation in the wspi of rice in one region with different rainfall events exceeded 100 with the increase in rainfall the wspi shows an inverted u shaped change when rainfall is low ii can improve the utilization rate of rainfall and reduce seepage resulting in the wspi increasing gradually when the rainfall reaches the threshold the wspi reaches its peak the paddy field will maintain the water layer state if the rainfall is increasing decreasing the difference in field moisture conditions under ii and fi and the wspi eventually trends toward zero in future follow up studies the rwsp rs can be applied to estimate the wspi of a time series to analyze its temporal variation and response mechanism 4 2 uncertainty of the rwsps although the rwsp rs can estimate the rwsp for paddy rice quantifying the wsp in macroregions could still be a challenging task for a few reasons the decision tree was adopted in rwsp rs to generate a rice map for its operability and convenience bad pixels caused by clouds still exist so some rice pixels might be omitted synthetic aperture radar data which are not affected by cloudy conditions may be applied to map paddy rice to overcome the shortage of optical images inoue et al 2014 bazzi et al 2019 due to the discrepancy in the paddy rice growth stage in a large region province level or continent level paddy rice mapping could be inefficient using the decision tree algorithm when rwsp rs was applied in macroregions the decision tree algorithm could be replaced by other specific methods wei et al 2022 xiao et al 2005 sebal has high accuracy in et inversion but some limitations still occur the optical sensor is always affected by clouds and shadows especially in humid tropical and subtropical areas so some images are missing to obtain more accurate et multi source remote sensing data can be applied in the following study in one day the same kc was applied to all rice pixels in one subregion in this study the climate and sowing habits could be significantly different in a macroregion therefore the same kc is not suitable for the whole study area more substudy areas should be generated through dividing rules to improve calculation accuracy taking advantage of the raster climate products e g era5 to calculate kc for each rice pixel is another feasible method 5 conclusions the wspe and wspi were obtained accurately by rwsp rs on a regional scale which has the characteristics of solid operability good regional applicability and time and labor savings 1 the decision tree algorithm can be used to map paddy rice with high precision the paddy rice in the study area was mainly distributed in the central and southern regions the kappa coefficient and total classification accuracy of the confusion matrix were higher than 0 87 and 89 respectively and the accuracy of the estimated rice paddy area was higher than 84 2 the sebal effectively retrieved paddy rice et under different irrigation modes meeting the calculation requirements the mae mre and rmse of the ten day paddy rice et were lower than 6 10 mm 10 day 12 and 5 34 mm 10 day respectively r2 was higher than 0 64 and the relative error over the whole growth period was lower than 7 the error under the intermittent irrigation mode is more remarkable than that under the flooding irrigation mode due to the complex change in water conditions 3 rwsp rs can reflect the spatial variation in wsp and wspi has apparent spatial heterogeneity the differences in rice wspi subregions were noticeable with a maximum of 51 mm the wspe errors of paddy rice in 2018 were greater than those in 2019 26 mm vs 5 mm respectively and the opposite was true for wspi 5 mm vs 23 mm respectively the rice wspi in 2018 and 2019 in the study area was 44 52 million m3 and 99 12 million m3 respectively therefore compared with the rice under fi adopting ii in the study area can significantly reduce irrigation water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

9514,to design a suitable drip irrigation strategies for tomato production an experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design six treatments which completely combined with three drip irrigation frequencies and two drip times were carried out in 2020 and 2021 with the variety heshengfeilong tomatoes in the greenhouse four single comprehensive evaluation methods pca topsis mfa and gra were used to comprehensively evaluate the fruit quality fuzzy borda combined evaluation was performed on each comprehensive evaluation result that passed the pre consistency test kendall w we found that mfa is the most suitable for evaluating the comprehensive fruit quality because its ranking results have the highest correlation coefficient with fuzzy borda in 2020 and 2021 namely 0 989 and 0 994 respectively total soluble solids tss can be used as a single indicator representing the comprehensive fruit quality because it has a significant positive correlation with the comprehensive quality score in two years the results of the topsis evaluation of the tss and the yield show that the optimal treatment in this experiment is for drip irrigation at 9 00 11 00 13 00 15 00 and 17 00 the k means clustering algorithm was used to determine the change in moisture content corresponding to different temperature ranges and further determine the irrigation strategy which is the drip irrigation frequency of 5 times day and the drip irrigation volume was obtained according to the change in moisture content during the day 9 00 19 00 the change in the substrate moisture content is divided into three temperature ranges namely 5 90 23 98 c 23 98 37 42 c and 37 42 53 58 c corresponding to 0 44 2 h 40 ml 2 h 1 34 2 h 121 ml 2 h 2 26 2 h 203 ml 2 h respectively during the night 19 00 9 00 the next day the change in the substrate moisture content is 0 19 2 h 17 ml 2 h keywords tomato drip irrigation strategy fuzzy borda comprehensive model 1 introduction tomato solanum lycopersicum l is one of the widely consumed vegetables and a main vegetable crop cultivated in a greenhouse du et al 2017 with the improvement of living standards people are paying increasing attention to the quality of tomatoes while pursuing yield chen et al 2013 adjusting the drip irrigation and fertilization system is an important agricultural management method for improving the quality and yield of vegetables drip irrigation can achieve a good balance between the high yield and superior quality of tomato fruits while reducing the pressure on the environment caused by horticultural production bo et al 2021a and saving water bo et al 2021b drip irrigation frequency and volume are the two main factors that seriously affect the yield and quality of crops drip irrigation frequency can affect the water absorption of plant roots by changing the water content temperature and nutrient of the rhizosphere environment which in turn affects crop growth and yield el hendawy et al 2010 within a certain range increasing irrigation frequency and reducing the irrigation amount each time can reduce the loss of soil water dispersion and increase the water use efficiency of crops ethan et al 2014 luca et al 2014 insufficient and excessive irrigation will alter the yield and quality of crops lin et al 2004 elena et al 2019 lu et al 2019 at present crop water demand is mostly quantified based on the reference crop evapotranspiration eto hadi et al 2017 ramiro and luciano 2021 and field capacity zhang et al 2021 all of these methods require many environmental monitoring equipment to obtain relevant environmental data allen et al 1998 proposed a robust model namely the penman monteith pm fao 56 based on the original pm equation to calculate the eto however the pm method needs substantial sets of data including solar radiation wind speed minimum temperature maximum temperature and relative humidity milad and mehdi 2018 at present simplified empirical equations still require a huge amount of data sevim 2021 fan et al 2019 sanikhani et al 2019 and such comprehensive datasets may be unavailable or of poor quality jensen et al 1997 trajkovic 2005 and increase the input cost due to the addition of many monitoring equipment hence a simple and convenient method must be explored to determine the water demand of crops moreover the irrigation strategy is mainly determined by the drip irrigation time frequency and volume however most of irrigation strategies are based on the water demand of the crop to irrigate but ignore the impact of irrigation time and frequency on crops the yield and fruit quality indicators of crops are a direct reflection of the rational irrigation strategy however fruit quality is a comprehensive index including reducing sugar rs total soluble sugar content tssc vitamin c vc total soluble solids tss sugar acid ratio sar lycopene and soluble protein sp chittaranjan 2007 the response of each index to water and fertilizer varies and a single index cannot reflect the fruit quality in addition a simple quality indicator representing tomato s comprehensive fruit quality must be identified therefore a comprehensive evaluation of quality is required mathematical statistical methods such as principal component analysis pca entropy weight the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis membership function analysis mfa and grey relation analysis gra are widely used in multi index comprehensive evaluation research li et al 2016 he et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however due to different calculation methods or human interference the evaluation results of these methods vary to solve the inconsistency of single evaluation models and obtain highly objective and accurate evaluation results the combinational evaluation model must be used for evaluation compared with other combined evaluation models the fuzzy borda combinational evaluation model simultaneously considers the evaluation value and the ranking of single comprehensive evaluation methods cui et al 2018 du and gao 2021 which means that its evaluation result is more objective than those of the other models at present the fuzzy borda combinational evaluation model has relatively few applications in the agricultural field especially in the comprehensive evaluation of multiple indicators of tomatoes the purpose of this study is as follows 1 we will investigate the effects of different drip irrigation frequencies and times on the yield and quality of tomatoes 2 we will construct a comprehensive evaluation model of tomato quality by the fuzzy borda combinational evaluation and obtain the characteristic quality index that can quickly evaluate the comprehensive quality of tomatoes in addition we will investigate the optimal drip irrigation frequency and time that can achieve a trade off between the yield and the fruit quality by using topsis 3 we will use the k means clustering algorithm to determine the change in moisture content corresponding to different temperature ranges and obtain the drip irrigation volume according to the change in moisture content 4 we will design a tomato drip irrigation strategy that determines the drip irrigation frequency time and volume and provide an agricultural irrigation method based on modern technology 2 materials and methods introduction 2 1 experimental site and materials the experiment was carried out over two consecutive growing seasons august november of 2020 and march july of 2021 in greenhouse in yangling shaanxi province china 34 28 n 108 07 e the greenhouse is 80 m long and 20 m wide with a double layer polyethylene sheet placed on the surface and an east west orientation greenhouse data were recorded by an environmental monitoring instrument hobo event data logger onset computer corp usa in the greenhouse the temperature c was simultaneously logged every 15 min the environmental indexes during the experimental period are shown in fig 1 the tomato variety heshengfeilong excellent resistance to tomato virus disease was used for experiment the seedlings of fully unfolded fourth leaf were transferred to a plastic bag 90 cm 20 cm 16 cm two plants per bag with a substrate volume of 18 l bag the row spacing is 0 90 m and the plant spacing is 0 40 m the physical and chemical properties of the substrate of the two seasons were as follows the bulk density was 0 27 g cm3 the total porosity was 72 69 the water holding porosity was 53 40 the air porosity was 19 29 the organic matter was 197 65 g kg the available n was 1731 73 mg kg the available p was 711 40 mg kg the available k was 2929 68 mg kg the ph was 6 52 and the electrical conductivity ec was 2 37 ms cm according to the agronomic measures of local farmers we retained the fruits of the 4th and 5th tomato panicles in 2020 and 2021 respectively fig 2 2 2 experimental design the experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with combinations of three drip irrigation frequencies and two drip irrigation times based on previous studies nareth et al 2019 we set three drip irrigation frequencies which were once time day 3 times day 5 times day and the start drip irrigation were 8 00 and 9 00 table 1 the time for local farmers to start drip irrigation was 8 00 ultimately this experiment has six treatments in substrate bag culture the decreasing value of substrate moisture content is considered as the water demand of the crop by analyzing the relationship between the change in substrate moisture content and the environment of the optimal treatment and then converting the change in substrate moisture into moisture volume we could determine the drip irrigation volume each time to analyze the relationship between the change in substrate moisture content and the environment in detail the average environmental temperature every two hours and the difference between the substrate moisture content before drip irrigation and the next drip irrigation start the difference is considered to be caused by tomato water consumption was analyzed the water demands of crops during the day and at night are different due to photosynthesis so we have two time periods namely 9 00 19 00 and 19 00 9 00 the next day each treatment has 40 plants per repetition the treatments started when the plants entered the fruiting stage the irrigation before the fruiting stage was relying on the experience of farmers for unified management irrigation and fertilization were carried out by an integrated water and fertilizer fertilization system with a programmable logic control plc remote control device the daily nutrient solution supply of each tomato plant in each treatment was the same the amount of drip irrigation per day during the fruiting stage was 2 l plant the formula and dosage of the nutrient solution were based on the preliminary laboratory research results zhang 2020 2 3 measurements and construction of comprehensive evaluation models 2 3 1 greenhouse environmental data and moisture content of substrate the greenhouse has a small weather station hobo incident recorder onset computer corporation usa which can record the temperature the relative humidity and the light radiation intensity lux the experiment used a guangzhou sciento technology co ltd st tr ws series moisture sensor with a working voltage of dc 12 v the matrix moisture sensor uses the frequency domain reflectometry fdr method to detect the volumetric water content the range is 0 100 the accuracy is 3 and the resolution is 0 1 the sensor has three stainless steel probes with a probe length of 60 mm a diameter of 3 mm and a probe spacing of 12 mm the moisture sensor was placed approximately 10 cm away from the root and at 6 cm depth keeping the sensor stationary throughout the fruit period the changes in the moisture content of the substrate were monitored in real time and uploaded to the cloud through gateway st ds200 guangzhou sciento technology corporation ltd every 15 min 2 3 2 yield date for each treatment 5 plants were labeled to determine the yield of the tomato when the fruit maturity was consistent the yield was recorded at intervals of 3 4 days for each fruit picking an electronic balance je1002 shanghai puchun metrology instrument co ltd precision 0 001 g was used to determine the weight of a single fruit the number of fruits per plant was recorded and the yield per plant was calculated 2 3 3 quality of fruit the quality indicators measured include the reducing sugar rs the total soluble sugar tssc the vitamin c vc the total soluble solids tss the sugar acid ratio sar the lycopene and the soluble protein sp the rs was measured by the 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid dns method li 2000 the tssc was measured through anthrone colorimetry the vc concentrations were determined via molybdenum blue colorimetry sundriyal and sundriyal 2001 the tss and the sar were determined using a digital pal easy acid3 tonic system atago japan and the sp concentrations were measured by coomassie g 250 staining akubor and ogbadu 2003 to determine the lycopene concentrations we first extracted the yellow pigment from the fruit with methanol and then discarded the supernatant the lycopene in the precipitate was extracted using toluene and the supernatant was retained to measure its absorbance at 485 nm using a spectrophotometer uv 2500 shimadzu corporation japan 2 4 construction of comprehensive quality evaluation model four single comprehensive evaluation methods namely pca topsis mfa and gra were used to evaluate seven quality indicators i e rs tssc vc tss sar lycopene and sp the pre compatibility test was performed on the ranking results obtained by the four single comprehensive evaluation methods that is the kendall w consistency test hong et al 2019 if the results of the four single evaluation methods do not pass the test they would be screened until the consistency test was passed under the condition of passing the consistency test fuzzy borda combined evaluation was performed on the results of the single comprehensive evaluation methods to construct a comprehensive evaluation system for fruit quality the steps of fuzzy borda combinational evaluation method are as follows first the goodness of membership of each single evaluation method score μ ij is calculated 1 μ i j x i j min x i j max x i j min x i j 0 9 0 1 where x ij is the score of the treatment i evaluated by the j method and μ ij is the membership degree of the i treatment evaluated by the j method as good second the fuzzy frequency ρ hi and normalized fuzzy frequency w ij of the i treatment processing in the h st are calculated ρ h i j 1 m δ i h μ i j h 1 2 n 2 δ i h 1 treatment i rankin h st 0 treatment i doesnotrankin h st 3 w h i ρ h i h 1 n ρ h i where m is the number of single evaluation methods used and n is the number of treatments in this experiment m 4 and n 6 then transforming the ranking into scores q hi j is defined as the score of the treatment i rank in the h st evaluated by the j method 4 q h i j n h n h 1 2 finally the fuzzy borda number b i for each treatment is calculated 5 b i j 1 m w h i q h i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m the larger the bi value is the better the comprehensive evaluation of tomato quality of the treatment is 2 5 k means clustering algorithm the k means clustering algorithm which was proposed by kanungo et al 2002 is an unsupervised algorithm which is usually used to classify an area clustering takes k points in the space as the centroid and minimizes the sum of the squares of the distance from each data point to its assigned cluster center chen et al 2021 using an iterative optimization procedure the centroid value of each cluster is updated successively until the best clustering result is obtained the calculation process of the algorithm is as follows 1 randomly select k points as the initial center ci i 1 2 3 k 2 the distance from any sample point p t t 1 2 3 n to ci is calculated and n is the number of sample points 6 d t i p t c i 2 3 the sample point is classified into the cluster with the centroid with the smallest distance 4 the mean is used to update the centroid value of each cluster 7 c i 1 n i t 1 n i p i t i 1 2 k 5 steps 2 to 4 are repeated until the centroid value of each cluster stops changing in this study the k means clustering algorithm was used to classify the changes in the substrate moisture content in different temperature ranges 2 6 calculation of drip irrigation volume we can calculate the water demand of tomatoes based on the change in substrate moisture content and then determine the drip irrigation volume the volume of the substrate bag was 18 l bag and there were 2 plants in each bag the calculation process of the drip irrigation volume per plant is as follows 8 dripirrigationvolume changeinsubstratemoisturecontent substratebagvolume 2 2 7 date analysis microsoft excel office 2018 microsoft corp usa was used to calculate the fuzzy borda number and topsis mfa and gra were performed spss version 23 0 spss ibm chicago usa was used to execute the k means clustering algorithm and perform pca and spearman and kendall correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 yield in 2020 the drip irrigation frequency had no significant effect on yield while at the same drip irrigation frequency condition the yields of the treatments that started drip irrigation later were higher than that of the drip irrigation that started early in 2021 at the same start drip irrigation time the yield increased with the drip irrigation frequency while at the same drip irrigation frequency only when the drip irrigation frequency was once day the yield of the treatment that started drip irrigation early was significantly higher than that of the treatment that started drip irrigation later at other drip irrigation frequencies drip irrigation time did not have a significant effect on the yield in this experiment the t6 treatment had the highest yield in 2020 and 2021 3 2 four single comprehensive evaluation models of fruit quality the treatments corresponding to each best single quality indicator were different appendix a therefore comprehensive evaluation models of fruit quality must be constructed and each treatment must be ranked to obtain the optimal treatment four single comprehensive evaluation methods namely pca gra mfa and topsis were used to comprehensively evaluate seven quality indicators the comprehensive scores and rankings are shown in table 2 the ranking results of the four methods were not completely consistent table 2 hence a combination evaluation model was constructed to obtain a highly accurate ranking result 3 3 fuzzy borda combinational evaluation model of fruit quality 3 3 1 pre compatibility test of four single comprehensive evaluation methods kendall correlation coefficient calculation was performed on the ranking results of the four methods table 3 the average value of the kendall correlation coefficients in two years between the evaluation results of each single method and the other three methods were within 0 711 0 800 indicating a certain correlation between the ranking results obtained by every single model the gra comprehensive evaluation method had the lowest average correlation coefficient i e 0 711 with the other methods furthermore pca and mfa had the highest average correlation coefficient i e 0 800 with the other analysis method table 3 the kendall w coefficient consistency test was performed on the results of the four single comprehensive evaluation methods the kendall w concord coefficients were 0 921 and 0 864 in 2020 and 2021 respectively therefore χ2 m n 1 w were 18 429 and 17 256 respectively which are both larger than χ2 0 05 5 11 07 indicating that the ranking results of the four single comprehensive evaluation methods had a certain degree of compatibility hence these four methods could be combined the results of the fuzzy borda comprehensive evaluation show that the best treatments for comprehensive quality in 2020 and 2021 were t6 and t5 respectively table 2 in 2020 when the drip irrigation frequencies were 3 times day and 5 times day the treatment with that started drip irrigation later was better than the treatment that started drip irrigation early under the same drip irrigation frequency the treatment with that started drip irrigation early in 2021 was better than the treatment that started drip irrigation later 3 3 2 evaluation of fruit quality based on fuzzy borda combinational evaluation model spearman s correlation test was performed between the ranking results of the fuzzy borda combined evaluation model table 2 and the four single evaluation models table 4 the spearman correlation coefficients were between 0 782 and 0 989 indicating that the ranking results of the fuzzy borda combination evaluation were highly correlated with the those of the four single evaluation methods and could be used to construct a fruit quality combination evaluation model according to the score of the fuzzy borda combination evaluation the optimal treatments were t6 and t5 in 2020 and 2021 respectively in addition t2 treatment was the worst treatment in both years moreover the ranking results of mfa and the fuzzy borda method had the highest correlation coefficients in 2020 and 2021 namely 0 989 and 0 994 respectively indicating that mfa might be a suitable model for evaluating the comprehensive fruit quality table 4 in addition we also found a significant positive correlation between the tss and the comprehensive quality score fig 3 in both years indicating that the tss could be used as an ideal index to represent the tomato comprehensive fruit quality 3 4 comprehensive evaluation of quality and yield fruit quality and yield should have an equal effect in evaluating treatments but fruit quality is composed of seven indicators so we selected the representative quality index tss and the yield to be comprehensively evaluated by topsis the t6 treatment obtained the highest scores and thus the optimal treatment 1 000 and 0 818 in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 5 3 5 effects of temperature on substrate moisture content the results show that the t6 treatment was the optimal treatment in 2020 and 2021 table 5 the drip irrigation frequency of the t6 treatment is 5 times day and the drip irrigation times are 9 00 11 00 13 00 15 00 and 17 00 the relationship between the substrate moisture content change and the temperature is shown in fig 4 the change in the substrate moisture content at 9 00 19 00 had an upward trend with the increase of temperature fig 4 a the average change is 1 20 2 h r2 0 5932 indicating that the change in the substrate moisture content had no obvious linear relationship with the temperature therefore the k means clustering algorithm was selected to analyze the data at 9 00 19 00 setting k 2 3 4 fig 5 when k 2 3 4 the specific parameters of each cluster are as shown in table 4 when k 2 the temperature range was extremely large and the corresponding temperature interval difference with the same changing substrate moisture content reached 30 c when k 4 the average substrate moisture content changes of the first and second clusters were 0 62 2 h and 0 42 2 h respectively but the difference was extremely small that it was negligible when k 3 the hierarchy was clear and the classification effect was the best therefore we use the divided temperature range and the average change in substrate moisture content by k 3 as a guide to determine the demand of tomato drip irrigation the trend line of the relationships between the change of moisture content and temperature during 19 00 9 00 the next day was flat indicating that temperature had no obvious effect on the change in substrate moisture content during this period fig 4 b hence the change in substrate moisture content during this time could be replaced by the average value 0 19 2 h the drip irrigation volume can be determined by the calculation in 2 6 4 discussion a complete drip irrigation strategy must be able to determine the drip irrigation time frequency and volume we found the optimal coupling treatment by setting different drip irrigation frequencies and times in substrate bag culture the decreasing value of substrate moisture content can be considered as the water demand of the crop we determined the water demand of tomato in different temperature range by analyzing the relationship between the temperature and the change in substrate moisture content and then determined the drip irrigation volume by conversion studies have shown that increasing the irrigation frequency within a certain range is beneficial to increase crop yields liu et al 2019 nareth et al 2019 in 2021 there was the same conclusion but in 2020 increasing the drip irrigation frequency did not significantly improve yields when the planting stubble was different the irrigation frequency had different effects on cucumber yield increasing irrigation frequency increased the yield of winter spring stubble but resulted in a decrease in yield in autumn winter stubble it was believed that the reason for this was that the temperature in autumn and winter was low and frequent irrigation could reduce the temperature of the root environment and the temperature was not easy to restore which had a great impact on crops our experiment in 2020 was mainly concentrated in october to november the temperature was low fig 1 increasing the drip irrigation frequency did not significantly improve the yield which may be the same reason at the same drip irrigation frequency the effect of drip irrigation time on the yield was also different in two years which might be caused by the different planting environments fig 1 in 2020 the yields of the treatments that started drip irrigation later were higher than that of the drip irrigation that started early in 2021 drip irrigation time did not have a significant effect on the yield in this experiment the t6 treatment had the highest yield in 2020 and 2021 fig 2 tomato fruit quality is comprehensively determined by multiple quality indexes and different treatments have different effects on a single quality index which is not conducive to determining the optimal treatment therefore a comprehensive quality evaluation model of tomatoes must be constructed to determine the best management plan given the differences in the evaluation information and calculation methods and the existence of human factors differences exist between the evaluation results of multiple single evaluation methods table 2 resulting in the inaccurate judgments of objective facts therefore the combined evaluation method combines the results obtained by these single evaluation methods to solve the inconsistency of the results of multiple single evaluation methods and avoids the one sidedness of a single evaluation method the results of the evaluation by pca gra mfa and topsis varied so the fuzzy borda combined evaluation method was introduced to evaluate the four methods the fuzzy borda combined evaluation model simultaneously considers the evaluation and ranking values and does not involve the weight of the conclusion of a single evaluation model so the evaluation result is highly objective the rankings evaluated by fuzzy borda were different in 2020 and 2021 which might be caused by the growth environment just like the yield the evaluation results of pca gra mfa and topsis had relatively high correlations the average value of the correlation coefficient was between 0 711 and 0 800 table 3 and the concordance coefficient of the kendall w consistency test was 0 920 satisfying the fuzzy borda combination evaluation condition the correlation coefficients between the ranking results of the fuzzy borda combination evaluation and the mfa method were the highest in 2020 and 2021 namely 0 988 and 0994 respectively table 4 therefore we recommend using mfa to quickly obtain accurate evaluation results by linearly analyzing the score evaluated by mfa and the values of the quality indicators in 2020 and 2021 we found that the correlation coefficient between the tss value and the mfa score was the highest that is 0 8239 fig 3 indicating that the tss could be used as an indicator to represent the comprehensive fruit quality of tomatoes which is consistent with the result of a previous study li et al 2021 we performed topsis analysis on quality and yield and the t6 treatment was the optimal treatment in 2020 and 2021 table 5 when the drip irrigation frequencies were 3 times day and 5 times day the comprehensive score for quality and yield of the treatments that started drip irrigation later were higher than that of the drip irrigation that started early and the situation was the opposite when the drip irrigation frequency was once day based on the t6 treatment we analyzed the relationship between the temperature and the change in substrate moisture content and opted to use the k means clustering algorithm for analysis the classification level was clear when k 3 fig 5 b which is consistent with the actual application the centroid coordinate of the first cluster was 17 01 0 44 and the temperature was 5 90 23 98 c this cluster had the lowest temperature range and the lowest change in substrate moisture content with an average value of 0 44 2 h indicating that when the temperature was low the growth and development of the tomatoes were relatively slow and the water demand of the crops was low the centroid coordinate of the second cluster was 31 06 1 34 the temperature range was 23 98 37 42 c the change in substrate moisture content increased significantly with an average value of 1 34 the increase from the first cluster indicated that the water demand of tomatoes increased significantly with the temperature promoting tomato growth the centroid coordinate of the third cluster was 34 80 2 26 the temperature range was 37 42 53 58 c and the average value of substrate moisture content change was 2 26 2 h which is the largest in the three clusters table 6 during the 19 00 9 00 the next day the average value of the substrate moisture content change was 0 19 2 h and the trend line was very flat fig 4 b this result shows that at this time temperature might not be the main factor affecting the tomato water demand 5 conclusion 1 drip irrigation frequency and time had different effects on the yield of tomato with different cultivation seasons and environments 2 comprehensively evaluating the yield and quality of tomato under high frequency drip irrigation 3 times day and 5 times day condition the comprehensive score of started drip irrigation later treatment was higher than that of the drip irrigation that started early treatment and the situation was the opposite when the drip irrigation frequency was once day 3 mfa is a single evaluation method suitable for evaluating the comprehensive quality of tomato the tss can be used as an index to quickly judge the comprehensive fruit quality 4 through the comprehensive evaluation of fruit quality and yield the drip irrigation strategy is as follows the drip irrigation frequency is 5 times day and the drip irrigation volume is determined according to the change in moisture content during the day 9 00 19 00 the change in substrate moisture content is divided into three temperature ranges namely 5 90 23 98 c 23 98 37 42 c and 37 42 53 58 c which correspond to 0 44 2 h 40 ml 2 h 1 34 2 h 121 ml 2 h and 2 26 2 h 203 ml 2 h respectively during the night 19 00 9 00 the next day the change in substrate moisture content is 0 19 2 h 17 ml 2 h declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

9514,to design a suitable drip irrigation strategies for tomato production an experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design six treatments which completely combined with three drip irrigation frequencies and two drip times were carried out in 2020 and 2021 with the variety heshengfeilong tomatoes in the greenhouse four single comprehensive evaluation methods pca topsis mfa and gra were used to comprehensively evaluate the fruit quality fuzzy borda combined evaluation was performed on each comprehensive evaluation result that passed the pre consistency test kendall w we found that mfa is the most suitable for evaluating the comprehensive fruit quality because its ranking results have the highest correlation coefficient with fuzzy borda in 2020 and 2021 namely 0 989 and 0 994 respectively total soluble solids tss can be used as a single indicator representing the comprehensive fruit quality because it has a significant positive correlation with the comprehensive quality score in two years the results of the topsis evaluation of the tss and the yield show that the optimal treatment in this experiment is for drip irrigation at 9 00 11 00 13 00 15 00 and 17 00 the k means clustering algorithm was used to determine the change in moisture content corresponding to different temperature ranges and further determine the irrigation strategy which is the drip irrigation frequency of 5 times day and the drip irrigation volume was obtained according to the change in moisture content during the day 9 00 19 00 the change in the substrate moisture content is divided into three temperature ranges namely 5 90 23 98 c 23 98 37 42 c and 37 42 53 58 c corresponding to 0 44 2 h 40 ml 2 h 1 34 2 h 121 ml 2 h 2 26 2 h 203 ml 2 h respectively during the night 19 00 9 00 the next day the change in the substrate moisture content is 0 19 2 h 17 ml 2 h keywords tomato drip irrigation strategy fuzzy borda comprehensive model 1 introduction tomato solanum lycopersicum l is one of the widely consumed vegetables and a main vegetable crop cultivated in a greenhouse du et al 2017 with the improvement of living standards people are paying increasing attention to the quality of tomatoes while pursuing yield chen et al 2013 adjusting the drip irrigation and fertilization system is an important agricultural management method for improving the quality and yield of vegetables drip irrigation can achieve a good balance between the high yield and superior quality of tomato fruits while reducing the pressure on the environment caused by horticultural production bo et al 2021a and saving water bo et al 2021b drip irrigation frequency and volume are the two main factors that seriously affect the yield and quality of crops drip irrigation frequency can affect the water absorption of plant roots by changing the water content temperature and nutrient of the rhizosphere environment which in turn affects crop growth and yield el hendawy et al 2010 within a certain range increasing irrigation frequency and reducing the irrigation amount each time can reduce the loss of soil water dispersion and increase the water use efficiency of crops ethan et al 2014 luca et al 2014 insufficient and excessive irrigation will alter the yield and quality of crops lin et al 2004 elena et al 2019 lu et al 2019 at present crop water demand is mostly quantified based on the reference crop evapotranspiration eto hadi et al 2017 ramiro and luciano 2021 and field capacity zhang et al 2021 all of these methods require many environmental monitoring equipment to obtain relevant environmental data allen et al 1998 proposed a robust model namely the penman monteith pm fao 56 based on the original pm equation to calculate the eto however the pm method needs substantial sets of data including solar radiation wind speed minimum temperature maximum temperature and relative humidity milad and mehdi 2018 at present simplified empirical equations still require a huge amount of data sevim 2021 fan et al 2019 sanikhani et al 2019 and such comprehensive datasets may be unavailable or of poor quality jensen et al 1997 trajkovic 2005 and increase the input cost due to the addition of many monitoring equipment hence a simple and convenient method must be explored to determine the water demand of crops moreover the irrigation strategy is mainly determined by the drip irrigation time frequency and volume however most of irrigation strategies are based on the water demand of the crop to irrigate but ignore the impact of irrigation time and frequency on crops the yield and fruit quality indicators of crops are a direct reflection of the rational irrigation strategy however fruit quality is a comprehensive index including reducing sugar rs total soluble sugar content tssc vitamin c vc total soluble solids tss sugar acid ratio sar lycopene and soluble protein sp chittaranjan 2007 the response of each index to water and fertilizer varies and a single index cannot reflect the fruit quality in addition a simple quality indicator representing tomato s comprehensive fruit quality must be identified therefore a comprehensive evaluation of quality is required mathematical statistical methods such as principal component analysis pca entropy weight the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis membership function analysis mfa and grey relation analysis gra are widely used in multi index comprehensive evaluation research li et al 2016 he et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however due to different calculation methods or human interference the evaluation results of these methods vary to solve the inconsistency of single evaluation models and obtain highly objective and accurate evaluation results the combinational evaluation model must be used for evaluation compared with other combined evaluation models the fuzzy borda combinational evaluation model simultaneously considers the evaluation value and the ranking of single comprehensive evaluation methods cui et al 2018 du and gao 2021 which means that its evaluation result is more objective than those of the other models at present the fuzzy borda combinational evaluation model has relatively few applications in the agricultural field especially in the comprehensive evaluation of multiple indicators of tomatoes the purpose of this study is as follows 1 we will investigate the effects of different drip irrigation frequencies and times on the yield and quality of tomatoes 2 we will construct a comprehensive evaluation model of tomato quality by the fuzzy borda combinational evaluation and obtain the characteristic quality index that can quickly evaluate the comprehensive quality of tomatoes in addition we will investigate the optimal drip irrigation frequency and time that can achieve a trade off between the yield and the fruit quality by using topsis 3 we will use the k means clustering algorithm to determine the change in moisture content corresponding to different temperature ranges and obtain the drip irrigation volume according to the change in moisture content 4 we will design a tomato drip irrigation strategy that determines the drip irrigation frequency time and volume and provide an agricultural irrigation method based on modern technology 2 materials and methods introduction 2 1 experimental site and materials the experiment was carried out over two consecutive growing seasons august november of 2020 and march july of 2021 in greenhouse in yangling shaanxi province china 34 28 n 108 07 e the greenhouse is 80 m long and 20 m wide with a double layer polyethylene sheet placed on the surface and an east west orientation greenhouse data were recorded by an environmental monitoring instrument hobo event data logger onset computer corp usa in the greenhouse the temperature c was simultaneously logged every 15 min the environmental indexes during the experimental period are shown in fig 1 the tomato variety heshengfeilong excellent resistance to tomato virus disease was used for experiment the seedlings of fully unfolded fourth leaf were transferred to a plastic bag 90 cm 20 cm 16 cm two plants per bag with a substrate volume of 18 l bag the row spacing is 0 90 m and the plant spacing is 0 40 m the physical and chemical properties of the substrate of the two seasons were as follows the bulk density was 0 27 g cm3 the total porosity was 72 69 the water holding porosity was 53 40 the air porosity was 19 29 the organic matter was 197 65 g kg the available n was 1731 73 mg kg the available p was 711 40 mg kg the available k was 2929 68 mg kg the ph was 6 52 and the electrical conductivity ec was 2 37 ms cm according to the agronomic measures of local farmers we retained the fruits of the 4th and 5th tomato panicles in 2020 and 2021 respectively fig 2 2 2 experimental design the experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with combinations of three drip irrigation frequencies and two drip irrigation times based on previous studies nareth et al 2019 we set three drip irrigation frequencies which were once time day 3 times day 5 times day and the start drip irrigation were 8 00 and 9 00 table 1 the time for local farmers to start drip irrigation was 8 00 ultimately this experiment has six treatments in substrate bag culture the decreasing value of substrate moisture content is considered as the water demand of the crop by analyzing the relationship between the change in substrate moisture content and the environment of the optimal treatment and then converting the change in substrate moisture into moisture volume we could determine the drip irrigation volume each time to analyze the relationship between the change in substrate moisture content and the environment in detail the average environmental temperature every two hours and the difference between the substrate moisture content before drip irrigation and the next drip irrigation start the difference is considered to be caused by tomato water consumption was analyzed the water demands of crops during the day and at night are different due to photosynthesis so we have two time periods namely 9 00 19 00 and 19 00 9 00 the next day each treatment has 40 plants per repetition the treatments started when the plants entered the fruiting stage the irrigation before the fruiting stage was relying on the experience of farmers for unified management irrigation and fertilization were carried out by an integrated water and fertilizer fertilization system with a programmable logic control plc remote control device the daily nutrient solution supply of each tomato plant in each treatment was the same the amount of drip irrigation per day during the fruiting stage was 2 l plant the formula and dosage of the nutrient solution were based on the preliminary laboratory research results zhang 2020 2 3 measurements and construction of comprehensive evaluation models 2 3 1 greenhouse environmental data and moisture content of substrate the greenhouse has a small weather station hobo incident recorder onset computer corporation usa which can record the temperature the relative humidity and the light radiation intensity lux the experiment used a guangzhou sciento technology co ltd st tr ws series moisture sensor with a working voltage of dc 12 v the matrix moisture sensor uses the frequency domain reflectometry fdr method to detect the volumetric water content the range is 0 100 the accuracy is 3 and the resolution is 0 1 the sensor has three stainless steel probes with a probe length of 60 mm a diameter of 3 mm and a probe spacing of 12 mm the moisture sensor was placed approximately 10 cm away from the root and at 6 cm depth keeping the sensor stationary throughout the fruit period the changes in the moisture content of the substrate were monitored in real time and uploaded to the cloud through gateway st ds200 guangzhou sciento technology corporation ltd every 15 min 2 3 2 yield date for each treatment 5 plants were labeled to determine the yield of the tomato when the fruit maturity was consistent the yield was recorded at intervals of 3 4 days for each fruit picking an electronic balance je1002 shanghai puchun metrology instrument co ltd precision 0 001 g was used to determine the weight of a single fruit the number of fruits per plant was recorded and the yield per plant was calculated 2 3 3 quality of fruit the quality indicators measured include the reducing sugar rs the total soluble sugar tssc the vitamin c vc the total soluble solids tss the sugar acid ratio sar the lycopene and the soluble protein sp the rs was measured by the 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid dns method li 2000 the tssc was measured through anthrone colorimetry the vc concentrations were determined via molybdenum blue colorimetry sundriyal and sundriyal 2001 the tss and the sar were determined using a digital pal easy acid3 tonic system atago japan and the sp concentrations were measured by coomassie g 250 staining akubor and ogbadu 2003 to determine the lycopene concentrations we first extracted the yellow pigment from the fruit with methanol and then discarded the supernatant the lycopene in the precipitate was extracted using toluene and the supernatant was retained to measure its absorbance at 485 nm using a spectrophotometer uv 2500 shimadzu corporation japan 2 4 construction of comprehensive quality evaluation model four single comprehensive evaluation methods namely pca topsis mfa and gra were used to evaluate seven quality indicators i e rs tssc vc tss sar lycopene and sp the pre compatibility test was performed on the ranking results obtained by the four single comprehensive evaluation methods that is the kendall w consistency test hong et al 2019 if the results of the four single evaluation methods do not pass the test they would be screened until the consistency test was passed under the condition of passing the consistency test fuzzy borda combined evaluation was performed on the results of the single comprehensive evaluation methods to construct a comprehensive evaluation system for fruit quality the steps of fuzzy borda combinational evaluation method are as follows first the goodness of membership of each single evaluation method score μ ij is calculated 1 μ i j x i j min x i j max x i j min x i j 0 9 0 1 where x ij is the score of the treatment i evaluated by the j method and μ ij is the membership degree of the i treatment evaluated by the j method as good second the fuzzy frequency ρ hi and normalized fuzzy frequency w ij of the i treatment processing in the h st are calculated ρ h i j 1 m δ i h μ i j h 1 2 n 2 δ i h 1 treatment i rankin h st 0 treatment i doesnotrankin h st 3 w h i ρ h i h 1 n ρ h i where m is the number of single evaluation methods used and n is the number of treatments in this experiment m 4 and n 6 then transforming the ranking into scores q hi j is defined as the score of the treatment i rank in the h st evaluated by the j method 4 q h i j n h n h 1 2 finally the fuzzy borda number b i for each treatment is calculated 5 b i j 1 m w h i q h i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m the larger the bi value is the better the comprehensive evaluation of tomato quality of the treatment is 2 5 k means clustering algorithm the k means clustering algorithm which was proposed by kanungo et al 2002 is an unsupervised algorithm which is usually used to classify an area clustering takes k points in the space as the centroid and minimizes the sum of the squares of the distance from each data point to its assigned cluster center chen et al 2021 using an iterative optimization procedure the centroid value of each cluster is updated successively until the best clustering result is obtained the calculation process of the algorithm is as follows 1 randomly select k points as the initial center ci i 1 2 3 k 2 the distance from any sample point p t t 1 2 3 n to ci is calculated and n is the number of sample points 6 d t i p t c i 2 3 the sample point is classified into the cluster with the centroid with the smallest distance 4 the mean is used to update the centroid value of each cluster 7 c i 1 n i t 1 n i p i t i 1 2 k 5 steps 2 to 4 are repeated until the centroid value of each cluster stops changing in this study the k means clustering algorithm was used to classify the changes in the substrate moisture content in different temperature ranges 2 6 calculation of drip irrigation volume we can calculate the water demand of tomatoes based on the change in substrate moisture content and then determine the drip irrigation volume the volume of the substrate bag was 18 l bag and there were 2 plants in each bag the calculation process of the drip irrigation volume per plant is as follows 8 dripirrigationvolume changeinsubstratemoisturecontent substratebagvolume 2 2 7 date analysis microsoft excel office 2018 microsoft corp usa was used to calculate the fuzzy borda number and topsis mfa and gra were performed spss version 23 0 spss ibm chicago usa was used to execute the k means clustering algorithm and perform pca and spearman and kendall correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 yield in 2020 the drip irrigation frequency had no significant effect on yield while at the same drip irrigation frequency condition the yields of the treatments that started drip irrigation later were higher than that of the drip irrigation that started early in 2021 at the same start drip irrigation time the yield increased with the drip irrigation frequency while at the same drip irrigation frequency only when the drip irrigation frequency was once day the yield of the treatment that started drip irrigation early was significantly higher than that of the treatment that started drip irrigation later at other drip irrigation frequencies drip irrigation time did not have a significant effect on the yield in this experiment the t6 treatment had the highest yield in 2020 and 2021 3 2 four single comprehensive evaluation models of fruit quality the treatments corresponding to each best single quality indicator were different appendix a therefore comprehensive evaluation models of fruit quality must be constructed and each treatment must be ranked to obtain the optimal treatment four single comprehensive evaluation methods namely pca gra mfa and topsis were used to comprehensively evaluate seven quality indicators the comprehensive scores and rankings are shown in table 2 the ranking results of the four methods were not completely consistent table 2 hence a combination evaluation model was constructed to obtain a highly accurate ranking result 3 3 fuzzy borda combinational evaluation model of fruit quality 3 3 1 pre compatibility test of four single comprehensive evaluation methods kendall correlation coefficient calculation was performed on the ranking results of the four methods table 3 the average value of the kendall correlation coefficients in two years between the evaluation results of each single method and the other three methods were within 0 711 0 800 indicating a certain correlation between the ranking results obtained by every single model the gra comprehensive evaluation method had the lowest average correlation coefficient i e 0 711 with the other methods furthermore pca and mfa had the highest average correlation coefficient i e 0 800 with the other analysis method table 3 the kendall w coefficient consistency test was performed on the results of the four single comprehensive evaluation methods the kendall w concord coefficients were 0 921 and 0 864 in 2020 and 2021 respectively therefore χ2 m n 1 w were 18 429 and 17 256 respectively which are both larger than χ2 0 05 5 11 07 indicating that the ranking results of the four single comprehensive evaluation methods had a certain degree of compatibility hence these four methods could be combined the results of the fuzzy borda comprehensive evaluation show that the best treatments for comprehensive quality in 2020 and 2021 were t6 and t5 respectively table 2 in 2020 when the drip irrigation frequencies were 3 times day and 5 times day the treatment with that started drip irrigation later was better than the treatment that started drip irrigation early under the same drip irrigation frequency the treatment with that started drip irrigation early in 2021 was better than the treatment that started drip irrigation later 3 3 2 evaluation of fruit quality based on fuzzy borda combinational evaluation model spearman s correlation test was performed between the ranking results of the fuzzy borda combined evaluation model table 2 and the four single evaluation models table 4 the spearman correlation coefficients were between 0 782 and 0 989 indicating that the ranking results of the fuzzy borda combination evaluation were highly correlated with the those of the four single evaluation methods and could be used to construct a fruit quality combination evaluation model according to the score of the fuzzy borda combination evaluation the optimal treatments were t6 and t5 in 2020 and 2021 respectively in addition t2 treatment was the worst treatment in both years moreover the ranking results of mfa and the fuzzy borda method had the highest correlation coefficients in 2020 and 2021 namely 0 989 and 0 994 respectively indicating that mfa might be a suitable model for evaluating the comprehensive fruit quality table 4 in addition we also found a significant positive correlation between the tss and the comprehensive quality score fig 3 in both years indicating that the tss could be used as an ideal index to represent the tomato comprehensive fruit quality 3 4 comprehensive evaluation of quality and yield fruit quality and yield should have an equal effect in evaluating treatments but fruit quality is composed of seven indicators so we selected the representative quality index tss and the yield to be comprehensively evaluated by topsis the t6 treatment obtained the highest scores and thus the optimal treatment 1 000 and 0 818 in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 5 3 5 effects of temperature on substrate moisture content the results show that the t6 treatment was the optimal treatment in 2020 and 2021 table 5 the drip irrigation frequency of the t6 treatment is 5 times day and the drip irrigation times are 9 00 11 00 13 00 15 00 and 17 00 the relationship between the substrate moisture content change and the temperature is shown in fig 4 the change in the substrate moisture content at 9 00 19 00 had an upward trend with the increase of temperature fig 4 a the average change is 1 20 2 h r2 0 5932 indicating that the change in the substrate moisture content had no obvious linear relationship with the temperature therefore the k means clustering algorithm was selected to analyze the data at 9 00 19 00 setting k 2 3 4 fig 5 when k 2 3 4 the specific parameters of each cluster are as shown in table 4 when k 2 the temperature range was extremely large and the corresponding temperature interval difference with the same changing substrate moisture content reached 30 c when k 4 the average substrate moisture content changes of the first and second clusters were 0 62 2 h and 0 42 2 h respectively but the difference was extremely small that it was negligible when k 3 the hierarchy was clear and the classification effect was the best therefore we use the divided temperature range and the average change in substrate moisture content by k 3 as a guide to determine the demand of tomato drip irrigation the trend line of the relationships between the change of moisture content and temperature during 19 00 9 00 the next day was flat indicating that temperature had no obvious effect on the change in substrate moisture content during this period fig 4 b hence the change in substrate moisture content during this time could be replaced by the average value 0 19 2 h the drip irrigation volume can be determined by the calculation in 2 6 4 discussion a complete drip irrigation strategy must be able to determine the drip irrigation time frequency and volume we found the optimal coupling treatment by setting different drip irrigation frequencies and times in substrate bag culture the decreasing value of substrate moisture content can be considered as the water demand of the crop we determined the water demand of tomato in different temperature range by analyzing the relationship between the temperature and the change in substrate moisture content and then determined the drip irrigation volume by conversion studies have shown that increasing the irrigation frequency within a certain range is beneficial to increase crop yields liu et al 2019 nareth et al 2019 in 2021 there was the same conclusion but in 2020 increasing the drip irrigation frequency did not significantly improve yields when the planting stubble was different the irrigation frequency had different effects on cucumber yield increasing irrigation frequency increased the yield of winter spring stubble but resulted in a decrease in yield in autumn winter stubble it was believed that the reason for this was that the temperature in autumn and winter was low and frequent irrigation could reduce the temperature of the root environment and the temperature was not easy to restore which had a great impact on crops our experiment in 2020 was mainly concentrated in october to november the temperature was low fig 1 increasing the drip irrigation frequency did not significantly improve the yield which may be the same reason at the same drip irrigation frequency the effect of drip irrigation time on the yield was also different in two years which might be caused by the different planting environments fig 1 in 2020 the yields of the treatments that started drip irrigation later were higher than that of the drip irrigation that started early in 2021 drip irrigation time did not have a significant effect on the yield in this experiment the t6 treatment had the highest yield in 2020 and 2021 fig 2 tomato fruit quality is comprehensively determined by multiple quality indexes and different treatments have different effects on a single quality index which is not conducive to determining the optimal treatment therefore a comprehensive quality evaluation model of tomatoes must be constructed to determine the best management plan given the differences in the evaluation information and calculation methods and the existence of human factors differences exist between the evaluation results of multiple single evaluation methods table 2 resulting in the inaccurate judgments of objective facts therefore the combined evaluation method combines the results obtained by these single evaluation methods to solve the inconsistency of the results of multiple single evaluation methods and avoids the one sidedness of a single evaluation method the results of the evaluation by pca gra mfa and topsis varied so the fuzzy borda combined evaluation method was introduced to evaluate the four methods the fuzzy borda combined evaluation model simultaneously considers the evaluation and ranking values and does not involve the weight of the conclusion of a single evaluation model so the evaluation result is highly objective the rankings evaluated by fuzzy borda were different in 2020 and 2021 which might be caused by the growth environment just like the yield the evaluation results of pca gra mfa and topsis had relatively high correlations the average value of the correlation coefficient was between 0 711 and 0 800 table 3 and the concordance coefficient of the kendall w consistency test was 0 920 satisfying the fuzzy borda combination evaluation condition the correlation coefficients between the ranking results of the fuzzy borda combination evaluation and the mfa method were the highest in 2020 and 2021 namely 0 988 and 0994 respectively table 4 therefore we recommend using mfa to quickly obtain accurate evaluation results by linearly analyzing the score evaluated by mfa and the values of the quality indicators in 2020 and 2021 we found that the correlation coefficient between the tss value and the mfa score was the highest that is 0 8239 fig 3 indicating that the tss could be used as an indicator to represent the comprehensive fruit quality of tomatoes which is consistent with the result of a previous study li et al 2021 we performed topsis analysis on quality and yield and the t6 treatment was the optimal treatment in 2020 and 2021 table 5 when the drip irrigation frequencies were 3 times day and 5 times day the comprehensive score for quality and yield of the treatments that started drip irrigation later were higher than that of the drip irrigation that started early and the situation was the opposite when the drip irrigation frequency was once day based on the t6 treatment we analyzed the relationship between the temperature and the change in substrate moisture content and opted to use the k means clustering algorithm for analysis the classification level was clear when k 3 fig 5 b which is consistent with the actual application the centroid coordinate of the first cluster was 17 01 0 44 and the temperature was 5 90 23 98 c this cluster had the lowest temperature range and the lowest change in substrate moisture content with an average value of 0 44 2 h indicating that when the temperature was low the growth and development of the tomatoes were relatively slow and the water demand of the crops was low the centroid coordinate of the second cluster was 31 06 1 34 the temperature range was 23 98 37 42 c the change in substrate moisture content increased significantly with an average value of 1 34 the increase from the first cluster indicated that the water demand of tomatoes increased significantly with the temperature promoting tomato growth the centroid coordinate of the third cluster was 34 80 2 26 the temperature range was 37 42 53 58 c and the average value of substrate moisture content change was 2 26 2 h which is the largest in the three clusters table 6 during the 19 00 9 00 the next day the average value of the substrate moisture content change was 0 19 2 h and the trend line was very flat fig 4 b this result shows that at this time temperature might not be the main factor affecting the tomato water demand 5 conclusion 1 drip irrigation frequency and time had different effects on the yield of tomato with different cultivation seasons and environments 2 comprehensively evaluating the yield and quality of tomato under high frequency drip irrigation 3 times day and 5 times day condition the comprehensive score of started drip irrigation later treatment was higher than that of the drip irrigation that started early treatment and the situation was the opposite when the drip irrigation frequency was once day 3 mfa is a single evaluation method suitable for evaluating the comprehensive quality of tomato the tss can be used as an index to quickly judge the comprehensive fruit quality 4 through the comprehensive evaluation of fruit quality and yield the drip irrigation strategy is as follows the drip irrigation frequency is 5 times day and the drip irrigation volume is determined according to the change in moisture content during the day 9 00 19 00 the change in substrate moisture content is divided into three temperature ranges namely 5 90 23 98 c 23 98 37 42 c and 37 42 53 58 c which correspond to 0 44 2 h 40 ml 2 h 1 34 2 h 121 ml 2 h and 2 26 2 h 203 ml 2 h respectively during the night 19 00 9 00 the next day the change in substrate moisture content is 0 19 2 h 17 ml 2 h declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
