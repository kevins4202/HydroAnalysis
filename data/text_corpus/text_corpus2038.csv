10190,to address the on site and off site salt load impact associated with non saline and water logged irrigated fields a well considered strategy is required this implies minimal salt mobilisation and additions through irrigation no crop yield losses due to excessive salt in the root zone and minimal irrigation induced drainage and leaching the aim was to formulate best water and salt management practices to achieve this strategy and conduct an extensive assessment on whether they are implemented before problems appear weekly and seasonal data 2 years from 19 fields 28 measuring sites were used crops included barley wheat groundnuts maize and lucerne grown in a semi arid climate dominant soils were sandy loam loamy sand and sandy with lateral moving shallow groundwater tables depth 1 2 m and electrical conductivity 250msm 1 while electrical conductivity of primary water sources is 100msm 1 good decisions included the use of centre pivot compared to flood irrigation irrigation schedules that ensured soil matric potential for maximum crop transpiration and limited yield losses due to water logging and soil salinity poor decisions were incorrect sprinkler design and excessive pumping pressure and limited use of rainfall and capillary rise to irrigate less growing season rainfall plus irrigation were a mean 55 more than the quota annual water allocated to farmers and 35 39 60 106 and 67 more than a conservative estimate of barley wheat groundnuts maize and lucerne transpiration respectively the magnitude of variation in this oversupply were similar than the mean values approximately all salts applied through irrigation were leached from the root zone while minimal re use of drainage water was made only 3 fields in terms of resource use efficiency and preventing environmental degradation the evidence is overwhelming for improved decisions at field level however given sufficient supply of water continuation of the status quo might be sustainable in the long term keywords crop production irrigation farming soil salinity water logging water quality 1 introduction the salt load associated with irrigation remains arguable the most studied problem in arid and semi arid crop production regions of the world in most cases soil salinity coincides with water logging because of the presence of shallow groundwater tables a vast amount of knowledge is available regarding the causes and management methods and investments required wichelns and qadir 2015 of salt affected soils and shallow groundwater tables as are estimates regarding the magnitude of the problem united states salinity laboratory staff 1954 ayers and westcot 1985 van schilfgaarde 1990 rhoades 1997 hillel 2000 hillel and vlek 2005 letey et al 2011 singh 2014 wichelns and qadir 2015 ritzema 2016 singh 2018 for irrigated fields with no apparent problems of salinity and water logging a strategy that proactively not only address on site problems but also off site issues of water conservation and degradation of groundwater and river water sources are also required from current knowledge such a well considered strategy is to minimise salt mobilisation and additions through irrigation water prevent decreases in crop yield due to excessive salt in the root zone and minimise irrigation induced drainage and leaching in fact according to wichelns and qadir 2015 prof hilgard as early as 1893 passionately urged farmers and public officials to use irrigation water sparingly and build regional drainage systems the authors emphasising that his prescription for achieving sustainable irrigation is as valid in the 21st century as it was in the 19th the question however is whether the 21st century farmers are implementing such a well considered strategy for proactive water and salt management or are they only responding once problems appear especially in semi arid developing regions with generally good quality irrigation water like for example in central south africa where there is no clear shift from ensuring production through irrigation to preventing off site environmental degradation the aim of this paper was first to formulate from literature best on farm water and salt management practices i e methods or techniques to achieve this well considered strategy secondly to assess over four growing seasons 2years in a semi arid region the extend that these formulated best on farm water and salt management practices are implemented by farmers on 19 irrigated fields in two irrigation schemes with no apparent salt related problems specifically we want to establish whether crop yield variation between fields could be ascribed possibly to mean seasonal water logging matric stress and osmotic stress the efficiencies of the centre pivots on the fields were also evaluated since they are integral to irrigation farming furthermore a comparison was done between the measured and allocated water for irrigation and based on seasonal transpiration whether rainfall and shallow groundwater tables contribute to water use of the crops or not an estimation was done to determine whether salts added through irrigation are leached from the root zone and do not accumulate in the groundwater table we argue that such an extensive assessment will provide valuable insight into current practices and possible benchmarks after decades of researching the old enemy 2 formulating best on farm water and salt management practices in the design of an irrigation project many regional salt sources and control factors should be considered inter alia i suitability of the soils for irrigation ii residual salt content of the soils iii irrigation water quality iv topography and its effect on subsurface drainage v type of system and amount of irrigation vi climatic conditions and reliability of the irrigation water supply vii environmental impact of drainage water and viii interception and possible re use of drainage water many of the past irrigation developments however took place without proper consideration of these factors du preez and van huyssteen 2020 argue that in countries like south africa where commercial and communal farming are practiced this is worse under the latter hence farmers across the globe are exposed to various levels of design and operation of regional irrigation and drainage infrastructure despite these constraints farmers should still aim to implement best on farm water and salt management practices the choice of an efficient irrigation system can be regarded as the first important decision by farmers this is crucial in reducing the amount of applied salts and decreasing the mobilisation of salts by reducing water loss from drainage and surface runoff abrol et al 1988 minhas 1996 kruse et al 1996 hillel 2000 oron et al 2002 hanson and may 2004 according to reinders 2011 the system should apply water at the desired amount at an accurate application rate and uniformly over the entire field at the precise time with the smallest amount of non beneficial water consumption and should operate as economically as possible likewise with continuous good decisions on when and how much to irrigate salt additions through irrigation excessive drainage and leaching from the root zone and mobilisation of salts through excessive drainage and runoff can be reduced it is well documented that these decisions should be based on scientific based measurements quiñones et al 1999 leib et al 2002 annandale et al 2011 barnard et al 2017 and or transient soil crop water mathematical model based evaluation of alternative irrigation practices tenreiro et al 2020 provides an extensive review of popular crop growth for example dssat daisy apsim stics aquacrop and monica and hydrology based for example hydrus1d swap and swim models that can be used in irrigation decision making atmospheric based quantification of evapotranspiration soil water content measurements crop based monitoring and an integrated soil water balance approach which encompasses real time and pre programmed techniques are some of the methods that can be used to quantify crop water requirements where possible rainfall and capillary rise from shallow groundwater tables should be used as water sources for crop water requirements ayars et al 2006 jhorar et al 2009 annandale et al 2011 isidoro and grattan 2011 singh 2013 when this is done then monitoring of salts in the root zone will be necessary especially in soils with restricted natural and or artificial subsurface drainage as a best practice continuous monitoring of root zone salinity is important to determine the possibility for a reduction in crop growth and yield due to the presence of excessive salt irrigation induced leaching is recommended when a reduction in crop yield is expected and not during every irrigation event research have shown that the efficiency of salt leaching will increase at higher soil salinities i e the percentage of excess salt removed per unit drainage from the root zone monteleone et al 2004 barnard et al 2010 letey and feng 2007 and letey et al 2011 showed that ideally a transient state compared to a steady state approach must be used to quantifying the leaching requirement a state state quantification overestimate the leaching requirement the worldwide quest for developing relatively salt tolerant varieties qadir and oster 2004 rozema and flowers 2008 rozema et al 2015 signify the best practice of applying irrigation induced leaching only when necessary farmers also have the opportunity to select crops that will produce satisfactorily in expected higher root zone salt conditions during the growing season this is primarily because crops differ in their tolerance to high salt concentrations in the root zone maas and hoffman 1977 maas 1990 rozema and flowers 2008 rozema et al 2015 van straten et al 2019 the socio economic aspect of selecting crops and the fact that crop salt tolerance can be modified by different fertiliser applications irrigation methods and frequencies and a combination of soil water and environmental factors meiri and plaut 1985 can however complicate this practice lastly it has also been proposed and confirmed that even saline water re use of drainage water treated waste water treated water from unconventional gas developments etc can be safely used to irrigate certain crop varieties under specific soil and climatic conditions using specific water and salt management practices rhoades 1992 minhas 1996 sheng and xiuling 1997 singh 2004 malash et al 2005 sharma and minhas 2005 phogat et al 2020 however emphasised with a long term modelling study that adequate management is needed when recycled water is used in order to minimise the associated adverse impacts on crop yield and soil chemical properties when the above mentioned practices fail to proactively manage water and salt successfully because of poor implementation or due to uncontrolled highly site specific factors productive soils become unproductive reclamation of saline and or sodic soils is possible through controlled strategic leaching as well as soil and water amendments and bioremediation calcareous soils are reclaimed without the application of amendments through the cultivation of certain salt tolerant crops qadir and oster 2002 fig 1 shows the formulated best on farm water and salt management practices 3 assessing best on farm water and salt management practices 3 1 methodology 3 1 1 study fields the research was conducted on 19 fields 10 60 ha located within the orange riet 17 000 ha and vaalharts 40 000 ha irrigation schemes the largest two schemes in the lower vaal river basin central south africa fig 2 orange riet receives its water from the vanderkloof dam situated in the orange river from where it is conveyed and distributed along the orange riet canal section 120 km of the scheme to jacobsdal tail end and drainage water from the settlement section of the scheme at jacobsdal is transferred into the riet river which is conveyed downstream in an easterly direction to the lower riet river section of the scheme and the vaal river vaalharts weir on the vaal river just upstream of warrenton diverts water into the vaalharts main canal which supplies vaalharts irrigation scheme located at jan kempdorp and hartswater 1176 km of concrete line canals in addition 314 km of concrete line drainage canals were built to convey both storm water and subsurface drainage water out of the irrigation scheme via the harts river in a south westerly direction towards spitskop dam orange riet and vaalharts are located in a semi arid zone long term mean rainfall is 397 and 427 mm per year for orange riet and vaalharts respectively with aridity indexes of 0 23 eto 1740 mm and 0 26 eto 1647 mm respectively table 1 rainfall mainly occurs in the form of thunder showers during the summer months october to april at both schemes the warmest months at both schemes are november december and january with a long term mean monthly maximum temperature of around 30 c the coldest months are june and july with a long term mean minimum temperature of around 0 c the fields were selected to include a variety of bio physical conditions as well as agronomic and water and salt management practices table 2 the irrigation systems at the fields were primarily over head sprinklers centre pivot or linear flood irrigation was practiced at two fields during the first year of measurements and then replaced with centre pivot irrigation during the second year only selected areas within thirteen of the fields were artificially drained the winter crops grown during the study period of 2years july 2007 to july 2009 at the fields were wheat and barley while maize and groundnuts were planted in the summer table 2 one season of peas cotton and seed sunflower were also grown at three different fields crop rotation systems employed by farmers consisted mainly of double and fallow cropping with double cropping a wheat maize rotation was planted alternately for two years or only for one year where after either wheat or maize were replaced by barley and groundnuts respectively in the second year at some fields lucerne was also part of the rotation system fallow crop rotation systems consisted mainly of producing three crops combined with one fallow period over two years the planting date seeding densities together with nitrogen phosphorous and potassium applications compared well to recommended guidelines for the area table 3 fertasa 2016 popular soil cultivations during a total 46 plantings of either wheat barley maize or groundnuts included burning the residue before planting 63 disking 54 wonder till 48 shallow tined roller seedbed preparation ploughing 38 bailing the residue of the previous crop before planting 28 and ripping the soil 22 table 3 a total of 28 sites 16 m2 for taking measurements were set up in the fields ten of the fields had two measuring sites this was done as some farmers indicated that specific areas of their field are problem areas for example not being artificially drained poor natural drainage different soil type shallow root zone etc it was decided to include only one extra measuring site under these circumstances the authors recognise that the soil will vary within fields the focus of the research was however not on the spatial quantification of soil water and salt balances but rather on how water and salt management practices affected the processes involved the measuring sites are dominated 75 by relatively homogenous deep aeolian sandy to loamy sand soils table 4 the mean measured clay percentage pipette method of day 1965 over a depth of 1 8 m at these sites were equal to or less than 10 and a standard deviation stdev equal to or less than 2 at 5 of the sites the clay percentage was more than 30 while two sites had a mean clay percentage of 17 at ten of the measuring sites the bulk density η over the root zone was determined mean η for the sandy to loamy sand and clayey soils were 1 65 and 1 62 g cm 3 respectively the measured sand silt and clay percentage together with η where measurements were available were used to estimate the volumetric soil water content θ v and hydraulic conductivity k at a matric potential ψ m of 6 and 30kpa with the retc software package version 6 02 van genuchten et al 1991 the default van genuchten m 1 1 n retention curve model and mualem conductivity model of retc were used i e the neural network

permeability at the various fields were low sar 6 data not shown le roux et al 2007 and therefore not included in the assessment fig 3a shows the grain yield at each measuring site relative to the mean of each crop 1 representing the mean the mean grain yield for wheat and barley were similar about 6 tonha 1 while the mean grain yield for maize groundnuts and lucerne amounted to approximately 13 3 and 24tonha 1 respectively barley had the lowest variation in grain yield coefficient of variation cv 19 followed by maize cv 23 groundnuts cv 25 wheat cv 25 and lucerne cv 30 the mean measured θ v 0 1 8 m and zgwt over the growing season at each measuring site are shown in fig 3b and c respectively fig 3d shows the mean ece over the growing season for each crop relative to the salinity threshold maas 1990 of the specific crop 1 representing the threshold fig 4 provides biplots of the first two pcs for a wheat barely b maize and c all relative yields for a combination of wheat barely and maize the qualitative fig 3b assessment revealed that the various crops were probably not subjected to matric stress due to a water shortage during the cropping seasons in general the mean θ v 0 1 8 m over the growing season for all measuring sites were close to or above the estimated θ v at 6 and 30kpa the θ v 0 1 8 m at all the measuring sites were also kept relatively constant as shown by the low stdev the authors acknowledge that the comparison between measured and estimated θ v is not crop specific taylor and ashcroft 1972 wesseling et al 1991 at five fields 2 6 7 12 and 14 the mean zgwt was less than 1 m from the surface during the different growing seasons fig 3c only at fields 2 7 and 14 water logging might have caused grain yield losses considering that for these soils the capillary fringe is near the soil surface with zgwt 1 m ehlers et al 2003 showed that the height of capillary rise under steady state conditions for similar soils with silt plus clay contents between 8 and 28 range from about 0 6 0 9 m respectively at five fields the mean ece above the shallow groundwater table at the start of the measuring period were more than 200msm 1 fig 3d the rest of the fields had an ece close to or below 100msm 1 at the start of the measuring period root zone salinity during the measuring period of 2years at the fields planted with barley wheat and groundnuts were close to or below the threshold salinity level of the specific crop 800 600 and 320msm 1 respectively ayers and westcot 1985 and hence were not subjected to osmotic stress maize grown at fields 2 3 and 7 might have experienced some yield losses due to high ece values i e the ece was 1 42 1 93 and 1 78 times the threshold salinity level 170msm 1 ayers and westcot 1985 in addition root zone ece of lucerne grown at fields 3 4 and 9 were 1 58 1 28 and 1 35 times the threshold salinity level 200msm 1 ayers and westcot 1985 according to fig 4a the first two pcs explain 36 5 and 27 4 of the total variation in the data the variables with the highest loading in pcs are yield mean θ v 0 1 8 m and mean zgwt although loading for mean ece is not as high as for the other variables mean ece does have a negative correlation to yield for maize fig 4b show that the first two pcs explain 35 8 and 24 7 of the variation in the data the variables with the highest loadings are yield and mean ece followed by mean θ v 0 1 8 m and mean zgwt there was a very low correlation between yield and mean ece but collinearity negative correlation between yield and mean θ v 0 1 8 m the final biplot for all the crops fig 4c indicate that the first two pcs explain 29 6 and 25 4 of the variation in the data yield mean θ v 0 1 8 m and mean ece has the highest loadings in pcs similar to the results from wheat barley yield and mean ece are collinear overall it is evident that there is limited structure between the variables and that the measured mean θ v 0 1 8 m zgwt and ece do not explain the variation in measured yield 3 2 2 irrigation fig 5 shows a box and whisker plot of the centre pivot evaluation done at the various fields the lower and upper line of the box represent the 1st quartile 25 of data lie below q1 and 3rd quartile 75 of data lie below q3 while the solid line is the median and the cross the mean the difference between q3 and q1 represent the interquartile range iqr i e within which 50 of the values falls the mean measured duig and ae for the centre pivots was high 90 with an iqr of 6 and 9 respectively there was however a considerable variation iqr 19 in the se for the various centre pivots with a mean value of 78 on average the centre pivots applied 6 mm when set at a 100 mean 12 h to complete a circle and a mean 26 mm with a speed of 20 mean 60 h to complete a circle the measured irrigation collected in rain gauges at each field was divided by the corresponding measured se to determine the amount of irrigation abstracted isource from the water source fig 6 the mean annual isource for lucerne amounted to about 1000 mm with an excessive variation iqr 400 mm the two winter crops wheat and barley received a similar mean isource 600 mm with a similar variation 215 mm while maize received a mean isource of 511 mm and groundnuts 424 mm the variation in isource of maize and groundnuts were also similar 220 mm the sum of mean isource for a winter and summer crop sequence i e either wheat maize barley maize wheat groundnuts or barley groundnuts or annual growing season of lucerne amounts to 1000 mm farmers located within the orange riet and vaalharts irrigation schemes receives an annual irrigation quota irrigation water allocated to farmers of about 1100 and 914 mm respectively at 59 of the measuring sites 34 in total isource during the measuring period were more than the allocated irrigation quota a mean 34 more when total rainfall over the growing season was added to isource 100 of the measuring sites received more water than the irrigation quota during the measuring period a mean 55 more seasonal transpiration of the various crops grown at each field were estimated from the measured biomass and a normalised water productivity parameter wp which is also at the core of the aquacrop model this is possible because of the linear relationship ben gal et al 2003 that exists between biomass production and transpiration and the fact that when wp is normalised for evaporative demand eto it behaves conservatively i e wp remains virtually constant over a range of environments steduto et al 2007 for barley wheat groundnuts maize and lucerne wp values of 150 150 130 330 and 150 kg m 2 were used together with the mean eto over the growing season to estimate a conservative transpiration value for each crop grown at each field the percentage over or under supply of these estimated transpiration values through irrigation and rainfall plus irrigation collected in rain gauges are shown in fig 7 an assumption can be made that the oversupply of water indicates evaporation and drainage losses from the root zone because fig 3 showed that change in soil water content was small an undersupply of water indicates that there was except from irrigation and rainfall plus irrigation additional sources of water to meet transpiration and evaporation namely capillary rise from shallow groundwater table or decrease in soil water content which if occurred was small as shown in fig 3 only during the groundnuts growing season there was a mean 10 undersupply of transpiration through irrigation the variation was excessively high i e iqr 61 during the growing seasons of barley wheat maize and lucerne there was a mean 19 16 15 and 1 oversupply of transpiration with a variation of 65 for barley and about 30 for wheat maize and lucerne the wilcoxon nonparametric test lehmann 1975 showed no significant difference between estimated transpiration and irrigation collected in rain gauges p 0 3908 when rainfall during the growing season is added to irrigation the mean percentage in oversupply of estimated transpiration amounted to 35 39 60 106 and 67 for barley wheat groundnuts maize and lucerne respectively the wilcoxon nonparametric test showed that the total rainfall plus irrigation over the growing seasons were significantly more than the estimated transpiration p 0 0000 3 2 3 salt additions and leaching the water sources used for irrigation at the various fields were mainly from the orange 5 fields and vaal 8 fields rivers fig 8 fields irrigated with orange river water received a mean eci of 21msm 1 over the four growing seasons with an iqr of 2msm 1 while the fields irrigated with vaal river water received a mean eci of 65msm 1 over the growing seasons with an iqr of 5msm 1 the remaining fields received blended water either from orange and or lower riet and or modder and or artificial drainage or vaal and or artificial drainage mean 85msm 1 with an iqr of 45msm 1 the highest eci of this blended water was 249msm 1 none of the irrigation water was sodic as the sodium adsorption ratio was below 5 data not shown a mean of 869 1846 and 3070 kgsaltha 1 si were added to the root zone per growing season at the fields irrigated with orange river vaal river and blended water respectively iqr amounted to 436 825 and 2330 kg ha 1 respectively if a field volumetric soil water content at saturation of 0 36 mm mm 1 is assumed and no salt leaching then these mean salt additions should increase the mean ece over a depth of 1 m by 32 68 and 114msm 1 per growing season respectively over a period of two years or four growing seasons t1 and t5 at four fields the mean ece of the root zone increased by more than 30msm 1 mean of 53msm 1 while at three fields the increase in mean ece of the root zone was more than 90msm 1 at the rest of the fields the mean ece of the root zone decreased with a mean of 10msm 1 hence it can be deduced that most of the salts added through irrigation at the various fields were leached from the root zone barnard et al 2010 showed that for sandy to sandy loam soils fields 4 19 between 0 2 and 0 3 pore volume of drainage from the root zone removed 70 of excess salts salts that are removed until an equilibrium ec under specific soil irrigation water drainage conditions is reached in general at the fields where a shallow groundwater table is present within or just below a depth of 2 m the leached salts did not accumulate in the groundwater table except maybe at fields 2 3 4 and 9 at these fields the mean weekly ecgwt over four growing seasons amounted to 378msm 1 with a stdev of 160msm 1 the fields were also associated with poor natural and or artificial drainage conditions the weekly mean ecgwt of the fields irrigated with orange and vaal river water was 140 and 180msm 1 with a stdev of 40 and 48msm 1 respectively the measured dad over the growing season varied considerable from field to field with a mean low of 3 l min 1 to a high of 425 l min 1 fig 8 fields located in the orange riet irrigation scheme had a mean dad of 21 l min 1 and ecad of 170msm 1 over a growing season for vaalharts irrigation scheme the mean dad and ecad amounted to 132 l min 1 and 213msm 1 over the growing season at both irrigation schemes the variation in dad per growing season over the different fields were excessive i e the cv amounted to 104 and 90 respectively the variation in ecad per growing season over the various fields at both irrigation schemes were however much less namely 27 and 35 respectively fig 9 3 3 discussion water losses associated with an irrigated field can be categorised as i atmospheric loss drift and droplet evaporation ii canopy loss canopy evaporation and foliage interception iii surface loss surface water evaporation surface runoff and soil evaporation iv deep loss drainage beyond the root zone and v crop transpiration according to the generally adopted framework of perry 2007 and batchelor et al 2016 drift droplet evaporation canopy evaporation foliage interception surface water evaporation and soil evaporation are consumptive water comprising non beneficial use conversion of water into water vapour hence theoretically when more water is used from a source due to increases in non beneficial consumption salt addition to fields will be increased because salt does not evaporate as a first decision by farmers to reduce non beneficial consumption an efficient irrigation system should be used the centre pivot evaluations done at 19 fields showed that the mean magnitude of the distribution problem was low dulq 85 for most of the centre pivots more than 85 ae of the water pumped into the system were measured in rain gauges below the system without the presence of a crop however when considering the combined effect product of ae and dulq there was a high variation in se iqr 17 with a low mean value of 78 these irrigation water losses are attributed to drift and droplet evaporation factors that contribute to increased atmospheric loss include incorrect sprinkler design and and or excessive pressure non beneficial consumption due to canopy evaporation foliage interception and surface water evaporation fell beyond the scope of this study crop transpiration is regarded as consumptive beneficial water use it is widely reported in literature that for a specific crop grown in a specific agro climatic condition the relationship between transpiration and biomass production is linear especially for field crops steduto et al 2007 vadez et al 2014 perry and steduto 2017 this conservative relationship implies that in general good decisions on when and how much to irrigate irrigation scheduling should aim to manage matric and osmotic potentials in the root zone to ensure maximum transpiration data over four growing seasons from 19 fields where either wheat barley maize groundnuts or lucerne where grown revealed that this is precisely what farmers accomplished the matric potential of the root zone during the various growing seasons was kept consistently at a value higher than 30kpa evidence of water logging due to a groundwater table 1 m from the soil surface was limited only at three fields furthermore at the majority of fields root zone salinity osmotic potential was kept below a level that might have caused a reduction in transpiration and yield at only two fields one where maize was grown and one field of lucerne measured root zone salinity were higher than the threshold level ayers and westcot 1985 with an associated measured reduction in yield non consumptive water use comprising non recoverable flows are associated with water flowing to the sea or other economically unviable sink in terms of this study surface runoff and drainage beyond the root zone can be considered as non consumptive use comprising recoverable flows returning to a river or aquifer for potential reuse perry 2007 batchelor et al 2016 irrigation scheduling is central not only to ensure optimal crop transpiration as discussed above but also to reduce non beneficial consumption and non consumptive recoverable water some might argue that the latter case cannot meaningfully inform irrigation scheduling decisions by farmers for example in water footprint accounting the irrigation process and whether the water is applied efficiently by farmers are not addressed because surface runoff and drainage beyond the root zone are considered recoverable it will be shown below that in terms of implementing best on farm water and salt management practices this viewpoint might be short sighted results in this paper indicated that growing season rainfall plus isource i source i se summed over the various growing seasons at all fields were more than the allocated irrigation quota during the same time period a mean 55 more in addition mean growing season rainfall plus irrigation collected in rain gauges at the fields planted with barley wheat groundnuts maize and lucerne respectively were 35 39 60 106 and 67 more than a conservative estimate of crop transpiration during the specific season measured biomass and eto values were used the magnitude of variation in oversupply of transpiration through growing season rainfall plus irrigation during the various growing seasons at the fields were similar than the mean values iqr of 42 31 36 89 and 60 respectively these values provide an indication of water loss through evaporation and drainage beyond the root zone changes in soil water content at all the fields during each growing season was minimal fig 3 clearly farmers in the region does not objectively utilise rainfall as a source of water for crop transpiration best practice fig 1 furthermore at the fields where a shallow groundwater table is present there were no conclusive evidence that farmers objectively apply less water through rainfall plus irrigation during 92 of the growing seasons there was a mean 72 oversupply of transpiration in order to utilise capillary rise as an additional source of water for crop transpiration literature section 2 show that this is a viable option especially considering that soils are generally very wet at these fields fig 3 in addition zgwt remain relatively constant over a growing season when deeper than 1 5 m from the soil surface during 19 30 and 51 of the growing seasons where a shallow groundwater table was present the mean zgwt over a growing season were 1 m mean 0 784 m between 1 and 1 5 m mean 1 283 m and 1 5 m mean 1 722 m respectively the corresponding cv were 34 15 and 8 respectively according to barnard et al 2017 percolation from the unsaturated zone above the capillary fringe excess rainfall plus irrigation or upward capillary rise from the saturated zone recharges crop water uptake from the capillary zone correspondingly lateral groundwater inflow from high laying areas or vertical percolation from the capillary zone recharges the saturated zone when the depth of the groundwater table decreases uptake from the capillary fringe and or lateral groundwater drainage to lower laying areas is less than vertical percolation from the unsaturated zone and or lateral groundwater inflow from high laying areas and vice versa another realisation why farmers do not objectively utilise these water sources might be the fact that irrigation quotas were based on flood irrigation du preez et al 2000 while mean measured yields 5 8 6 1 3 2 12 9 and 24 4tonha 1 respectively achieved under more efficient sprinkler irrigation corresponds to much lower transpiration this oversupply of water to crops and wet soils causes a considerable amount of drainage and leaching beyond the root zone approximately all of the salts applied through irrigation mean 0 87 1 8 and 3 1tonha 1 per growing season for mean eci of 21 65 and 85msm 1 respectively were leached from the root zone rainfall between growing seasons probably contributed significantly to this salt leaching especially during fallow periods when farmers produce 3 crops in 4 growing seasons fields where the leached salts from the root zone might accumulate in the shallow groundwater table were limited in general lateral flow of shallow groundwater tables to lower laying areas were sufficient to remove these leached salts to an unknown sink variation in salinity of artificial drainage water ecad was generally low hence the excessive variation in salt removed is attributed to a large variation in flow rate dad lmin 1 theoretically artificial drainage water can be intercepted and re used with a mean ecad value of 170 and 213msm 1 for the fields located at orange riet and vaalharts respectively at three fields fields 1 18 and 19 this practice was implemented by the farmers during the measuring period of two years the mean eci was about 100msm 1 reaching values of more than 200msm 1 during specific periods while the yields were generally above average noticeably despite decades of research that extend to farmers with no apparent salt related problems implement best on farm water and salt practices before problems appear are generally low the gain in terms of resource use efficiency and prevention of environmental degradation is obvious as shown by this data and decades of research whether this low implementation of best on farm water and salt management practices are truly problematic remains debatable it seems from this paper that continuation with the status quo might be sustainable in the long term status quo referring to the conditions and practices studied in this paper according to perry and steduto 2017 introducing high tech irrigation more efficient irrigation systems in the absence of controls on water allocations to farmers will usually make the situation worse the reasons provided include an increase in consumption per unit area increase in irrigated area and the fact that farmers tend to pump more water from ever deeper sources wichelns and qadir 2015 proposes assigning responsibility for salt to farmers through a deposit or bond the idea is similar to providing consumers incentives to return reusable containers rather than disposing them the authors concluded that proper economic incentives to farmers financial commitments and political will are required to manage the salt load associated with irrigation 4 conclusions to address the on site and off site impact of the salt load associated with non saline and water logged irrigated fields a strategy is required this implies to minimise salt mobilisation and additions through irrigation prevent decreases in crop yield due to excessive salt in root zones and minimise irrigation induced drainage and leaching using this strategy on farm water and salt management practices were formulated and an extensive assessment conducted on whether farmers implement these practices the results revealed a mean measured centre pivot system efficiency of 78 and that well designed irrigation systems are vital to ensure efficient water application and salt management irrigation schedules by farmers at all fields ensured matric potentials more than 30kpa in root zones while fields with a mean groundwater table depth 1 m from the surface and mean root zone salinity close to threshold levels were limited regardless of this mean yields for barley wheat groundnuts maize and lucerne were 84 67 76 70 and 70 of the maximum yields attained respectively no significant evidence was found that mean volumetric soil water content over a depth of 1 8 m groundwater table depth and root zone salinity explain the variation in yields at all fields irrigation abstracted from the source plus rainfall were on average 55 more than the water allocated to farmers irrigation quota over the various growing seasons the estimated seasonal crop transpiration and irrigation collected in rain gauges did not differ significantly which was not true for seasonal rainfall plus irrigation the utilisation of rainfall for crop transpiration should be incorporated in irrigation schedules irrigation schedules also did not account for capillary rise from shallow groundwater tables as an additional water source between 0 9 and 3 tonha 1 of salt added through irrigation were leached seasonally from the root zone where shallow groundwater tables move laterally to lower laying areas the leached salts did not accumulate in the groundwater table the re use of drainage water was possible which was done at three fields where above average yields were obtained under these conditions it was found that a fallow period where no crop is grown was an important practice to leach excessive salt from the root zone the evidence is overwhelming for 21st century farmers to improve on farm water and salt management decisions and not only respond once problems appear especially in terms of contributing to increasing resource use efficiency and preventing environmental degradation arguable economic incentives and environmental regulation remain an important incentive for farmers to adopt best water and salt management practices declaration

10190,to address the on site and off site salt load impact associated with non saline and water logged irrigated fields a well considered strategy is required this implies minimal salt mobilisation and additions through irrigation no crop yield losses due to excessive salt in the root zone and minimal irrigation induced drainage and leaching the aim was to formulate best water and salt management practices to achieve this strategy and conduct an extensive assessment on whether they are implemented before problems appear weekly and seasonal data 2 years from 19 fields 28 measuring sites were used crops included barley wheat groundnuts maize and lucerne grown in a semi arid climate dominant soils were sandy loam loamy sand and sandy with lateral moving shallow groundwater tables depth 1 2 m and electrical conductivity 250msm 1 while electrical conductivity of primary water sources is 100msm 1 good decisions included the use of centre pivot compared to flood irrigation irrigation schedules that ensured soil matric potential for maximum crop transpiration and limited yield losses due to water logging and soil salinity poor decisions were incorrect sprinkler design and excessive pumping pressure and limited use of rainfall and capillary rise to irrigate less growing season rainfall plus irrigation were a mean 55 more than the quota annual water allocated to farmers and 35 39 60 106 and 67 more than a conservative estimate of barley wheat groundnuts maize and lucerne transpiration respectively the magnitude of variation in this oversupply were similar than the mean values approximately all salts applied through irrigation were leached from the root zone while minimal re use of drainage water was made only 3 fields in terms of resource use efficiency and preventing environmental degradation the evidence is overwhelming for improved decisions at field level however given sufficient supply of water continuation of the status quo might be sustainable in the long term keywords crop production irrigation farming soil salinity water logging water quality 1 introduction the salt load associated with irrigation remains arguable the most studied problem in arid and semi arid crop production regions of the world in most cases soil salinity coincides with water logging because of the presence of shallow groundwater tables a vast amount of knowledge is available regarding the causes and management methods and investments required wichelns and qadir 2015 of salt affected soils and shallow groundwater tables as are estimates regarding the magnitude of the problem united states salinity laboratory staff 1954 ayers and westcot 1985 van schilfgaarde 1990 rhoades 1997 hillel 2000 hillel and vlek 2005 letey et al 2011 singh 2014 wichelns and qadir 2015 ritzema 2016 singh 2018 for irrigated fields with no apparent problems of salinity and water logging a strategy that proactively not only address on site problems but also off site issues of water conservation and degradation of groundwater and river water sources are also required from current knowledge such a well considered strategy is to minimise salt mobilisation and additions through irrigation water prevent decreases in crop yield due to excessive salt in the root zone and minimise irrigation induced drainage and leaching in fact according to wichelns and qadir 2015 prof hilgard as early as 1893 passionately urged farmers and public officials to use irrigation water sparingly and build regional drainage systems the authors emphasising that his prescription for achieving sustainable irrigation is as valid in the 21st century as it was in the 19th the question however is whether the 21st century farmers are implementing such a well considered strategy for proactive water and salt management or are they only responding once problems appear especially in semi arid developing regions with generally good quality irrigation water like for example in central south africa where there is no clear shift from ensuring production through irrigation to preventing off site environmental degradation the aim of this paper was first to formulate from literature best on farm water and salt management practices i e methods or techniques to achieve this well considered strategy secondly to assess over four growing seasons 2years in a semi arid region the extend that these formulated best on farm water and salt management practices are implemented by farmers on 19 irrigated fields in two irrigation schemes with no apparent salt related problems specifically we want to establish whether crop yield variation between fields could be ascribed possibly to mean seasonal water logging matric stress and osmotic stress the efficiencies of the centre pivots on the fields were also evaluated since they are integral to irrigation farming furthermore a comparison was done between the measured and allocated water for irrigation and based on seasonal transpiration whether rainfall and shallow groundwater tables contribute to water use of the crops or not an estimation was done to determine whether salts added through irrigation are leached from the root zone and do not accumulate in the groundwater table we argue that such an extensive assessment will provide valuable insight into current practices and possible benchmarks after decades of researching the old enemy 2 formulating best on farm water and salt management practices in the design of an irrigation project many regional salt sources and control factors should be considered inter alia i suitability of the soils for irrigation ii residual salt content of the soils iii irrigation water quality iv topography and its effect on subsurface drainage v type of system and amount of irrigation vi climatic conditions and reliability of the irrigation water supply vii environmental impact of drainage water and viii interception and possible re use of drainage water many of the past irrigation developments however took place without proper consideration of these factors du preez and van huyssteen 2020 argue that in countries like south africa where commercial and communal farming are practiced this is worse under the latter hence farmers across the globe are exposed to various levels of design and operation of regional irrigation and drainage infrastructure despite these constraints farmers should still aim to implement best on farm water and salt management practices the choice of an efficient irrigation system can be regarded as the first important decision by farmers this is crucial in reducing the amount of applied salts and decreasing the mobilisation of salts by reducing water loss from drainage and surface runoff abrol et al 1988 minhas 1996 kruse et al 1996 hillel 2000 oron et al 2002 hanson and may 2004 according to reinders 2011 the system should apply water at the desired amount at an accurate application rate and uniformly over the entire field at the precise time with the smallest amount of non beneficial water consumption and should operate as economically as possible likewise with continuous good decisions on when and how much to irrigate salt additions through irrigation excessive drainage and leaching from the root zone and mobilisation of salts through excessive drainage and runoff can be reduced it is well documented that these decisions should be based on scientific based measurements quiñones et al 1999 leib et al 2002 annandale et al 2011 barnard et al 2017 and or transient soil crop water mathematical model based evaluation of alternative irrigation practices tenreiro et al 2020 provides an extensive review of popular crop growth for example dssat daisy apsim stics aquacrop and monica and hydrology based for example hydrus1d swap and swim models that can be used in irrigation decision making atmospheric based quantification of evapotranspiration soil water content measurements crop based monitoring and an integrated soil water balance approach which encompasses real time and pre programmed techniques are some of the methods that can be used to quantify crop water requirements where possible rainfall and capillary rise from shallow groundwater tables should be used as water sources for crop water requirements ayars et al 2006 jhorar et al 2009 annandale et al 2011 isidoro and grattan 2011 singh 2013 when this is done then monitoring of salts in the root zone will be necessary especially in soils with restricted natural and or artificial subsurface drainage as a best practice continuous monitoring of root zone salinity is important to determine the possibility for a reduction in crop growth and yield due to the presence of excessive salt irrigation induced leaching is recommended when a reduction in crop yield is expected and not during every irrigation event research have shown that the efficiency of salt leaching will increase at higher soil salinities i e the percentage of excess salt removed per unit drainage from the root zone monteleone et al 2004 barnard et al 2010 letey and feng 2007 and letey et al 2011 showed that ideally a transient state compared to a steady state approach must be used to quantifying the leaching requirement a state state quantification overestimate the leaching requirement the worldwide quest for developing relatively salt tolerant varieties qadir and oster 2004 rozema and flowers 2008 rozema et al 2015 signify the best practice of applying irrigation induced leaching only when necessary farmers also have the opportunity to select crops that will produce satisfactorily in expected higher root zone salt conditions during the growing season this is primarily because crops differ in their tolerance to high salt concentrations in the root zone maas and hoffman 1977 maas 1990 rozema and flowers 2008 rozema et al 2015 van straten et al 2019 the socio economic aspect of selecting crops and the fact that crop salt tolerance can be modified by different fertiliser applications irrigation methods and frequencies and a combination of soil water and environmental factors meiri and plaut 1985 can however complicate this practice lastly it has also been proposed and confirmed that even saline water re use of drainage water treated waste water treated water from unconventional gas developments etc can be safely used to irrigate certain crop varieties under specific soil and climatic conditions using specific water and salt management practices rhoades 1992 minhas 1996 sheng and xiuling 1997 singh 2004 malash et al 2005 sharma and minhas 2005 phogat et al 2020 however emphasised with a long term modelling study that adequate management is needed when recycled water is used in order to minimise the associated adverse impacts on crop yield and soil chemical properties when the above mentioned practices fail to proactively manage water and salt successfully because of poor implementation or due to uncontrolled highly site specific factors productive soils become unproductive reclamation of saline and or sodic soils is possible through controlled strategic leaching as well as soil and water amendments and bioremediation calcareous soils are reclaimed without the application of amendments through the cultivation of certain salt tolerant crops qadir and oster 2002 fig 1 shows the formulated best on farm water and salt management practices 3 assessing best on farm water and salt management practices 3 1 methodology 3 1 1 study fields the research was conducted on 19 fields 10 60 ha located within the orange riet 17 000 ha and vaalharts 40 000 ha irrigation schemes the largest two schemes in the lower vaal river basin central south africa fig 2 orange riet receives its water from the vanderkloof dam situated in the orange river from where it is conveyed and distributed along the orange riet canal section 120 km of the scheme to jacobsdal tail end and drainage water from the settlement section of the scheme at jacobsdal is transferred into the riet river which is conveyed downstream in an easterly direction to the lower riet river section of the scheme and the vaal river vaalharts weir on the vaal river just upstream of warrenton diverts water into the vaalharts main canal which supplies vaalharts irrigation scheme located at jan kempdorp and hartswater 1176 km of concrete line canals in addition 314 km of concrete line drainage canals were built to convey both storm water and subsurface drainage water out of the irrigation scheme via the harts river in a south westerly direction towards spitskop dam orange riet and vaalharts are located in a semi arid zone long term mean rainfall is 397 and 427 mm per year for orange riet and vaalharts respectively with aridity indexes of 0 23 eto 1740 mm and 0 26 eto 1647 mm respectively table 1 rainfall mainly occurs in the form of thunder showers during the summer months october to april at both schemes the warmest months at both schemes are november december and january with a long term mean monthly maximum temperature of around 30 c the coldest months are june and july with a long term mean minimum temperature of around 0 c the fields were selected to include a variety of bio physical conditions as well as agronomic and water and salt management practices table 2 the irrigation systems at the fields were primarily over head sprinklers centre pivot or linear flood irrigation was practiced at two fields during the first year of measurements and then replaced with centre pivot irrigation during the second year only selected areas within thirteen of the fields were artificially drained the winter crops grown during the study period of 2years july 2007 to july 2009 at the fields were wheat and barley while maize and groundnuts were planted in the summer table 2 one season of peas cotton and seed sunflower were also grown at three different fields crop rotation systems employed by farmers consisted mainly of double and fallow cropping with double cropping a wheat maize rotation was planted alternately for two years or only for one year where after either wheat or maize were replaced by barley and groundnuts respectively in the second year at some fields lucerne was also part of the rotation system fallow crop rotation systems consisted mainly of producing three crops combined with one fallow period over two years the planting date seeding densities together with nitrogen phosphorous and potassium applications compared well to recommended guidelines for the area table 3 fertasa 2016 popular soil cultivations during a total 46 plantings of either wheat barley maize or groundnuts included burning the residue before planting 63 disking 54 wonder till 48 shallow tined roller seedbed preparation ploughing 38 bailing the residue of the previous crop before planting 28 and ripping the soil 22 table 3 a total of 28 sites 16 m2 for taking measurements were set up in the fields ten of the fields had two measuring sites this was done as some farmers indicated that specific areas of their field are problem areas for example not being artificially drained poor natural drainage different soil type shallow root zone etc it was decided to include only one extra measuring site under these circumstances the authors recognise that the soil will vary within fields the focus of the research was however not on the spatial quantification of soil water and salt balances but rather on how water and salt management practices affected the processes involved the measuring sites are dominated 75 by relatively homogenous deep aeolian sandy to loamy sand soils table 4 the mean measured clay percentage pipette method of day 1965 over a depth of 1 8 m at these sites were equal to or less than 10 and a standard deviation stdev equal to or less than 2 at 5 of the sites the clay percentage was more than 30 while two sites had a mean clay percentage of 17 at ten of the measuring sites the bulk density η over the root zone was determined mean η for the sandy to loamy sand and clayey soils were 1 65 and 1 62 g cm 3 respectively the measured sand silt and clay percentage together with η where measurements were available were used to estimate the volumetric soil water content θ v and hydraulic conductivity k at a matric potential ψ m of 6 and 30kpa with

permeability at the various fields were low sar 6 data not shown le roux et al 2007 and therefore not included in the assessment fig 3a shows the grain yield at each measuring site relative to the mean of each crop 1 representing the mean the mean grain yield for wheat and barley were similar about 6 tonha 1 while the mean grain yield for maize groundnuts and lucerne amounted to approximately 13 3 and 24tonha 1 respectively barley had the lowest variation in grain yield coefficient of variation cv 19 followed by maize cv 23 groundnuts cv 25 wheat cv 25 and lucerne cv 30 the mean measured θ

and maize the qualitative fig 3b assessment revealed that the various crops were probably not subjected to matric stress due to a water shortage during the cropping seasons in general the mean θ v 0 1 8 m over the growing season for all measuring sites were close to or above the estimated θ v at 6 and 30kpa the θ v 0 1 8 m at all the measuring sites were also kept relatively constant as shown by the low stdev the authors acknowledge that the comparison between measured and estimated θ v is not crop specific taylor and ashcroft 1972 wesseling et al 1991 at five fields 2 6 7 12 and 14 the mean zgwt was less than 1 m from the surface during the different growing seasons fig 3c only at fields 2 7 and 14 water logging might have caused grain yield losses considering that for these soils the capillary fringe is near the soil surface with zgwt 1 m ehlers et al 2003 showed that the height of capillary rise under steady state conditions for similar soils with silt plus clay contents between 8 and 28 range from about 0 6 0 9 m respectively at five fields the mean ece above the shallow groundwater table at the start of the measuring period were more than 200msm 1 fig 3d the rest of the fields had an ece close to or below 100msm 1 at the start of the measuring period root zone salinity during the measuring period of 2years at the fields planted with barley wheat and groundnuts were close to or below the threshold salinity level of the specific crop 800 600 and 320msm 1 respectively ayers and westcot 1985 and hence were not subjected to osmotic stress maize grown at fields 2 3 and 7 might have experienced some yield losses due to high ece values i e the ece was 1 42 1 93 and 1 78 times the threshold salinity level 170msm 1 ayers and westcot 1985 in addition root zone ece of lucerne grown at fields 3 4 and 9 were 1 58 1 28 and 1 35 times the threshold salinity level 200msm 1 ayers and westcot 1985 according to fig 4a the first two pcs explain 36 5 and 27 4 of the total variation in the data the variables with the highest loading in pcs are yield mean θ v 0 1 8 m and mean zgwt although loading for mean ece is not as high as for the other variables mean ece does have a negative correlation to yield for maize fig 4b show that the first two pcs explain 35 8 and 24 7 of the variation in the data the variables with the highest loadings are yield and mean ece followed by mean θ v 0 1 8 m and mean zgwt there was a very low correlation between yield and mean ece but collinearity negative correlation between yield and mean θ v 0 1 8 m the final biplot for all the crops fig 4c indicate that the first two pcs explain 29 6 and 25 4 of the variation in the data yield mean θ v 0 1 8 m and mean ece has the highest loadings in pcs similar to the results from wheat barley yield and mean ece are collinear overall it is evident that there is limited structure between the variables and that the measured mean θ v 0 1 8 m zgwt and ece do not explain the variation in measured yield 3 2 2 irrigation fig 5 shows a box and whisker plot of the centre pivot evaluation done at the various fields the lower and upper line of the box represent the 1st quartile 25 of data

50 of the values falls the mean measured duig and ae for the centre pivots was high 90 with an iqr of 6 and 9 respectively there was however a considerable variation iqr 19 in the se for the various centre pivots with a mean value of 78 on average the centre pivots applied 6 mm when set at a 100 mean 12 h to complete a circle and a mean 26 mm with a speed of 20 mean 60 h to complete a circle the measured irrigation collected in rain gauges at each field was divided by the corresponding measured se to determine the amount of irrigation abstracted isource from the water source fig 6 the mean annual isource for lucerne amounted to about 1000 mm with an excessive variation iqr 400 mm the two winter crops wheat and barley received a similar mean isource 600 mm with a similar variation 215 mm while maize received a mean isource of 511 mm and groundnuts 424 mm the variation in isource of maize and groundnuts were also similar 220 mm the sum of mean isource for a winter and summer crop sequence i e either wheat maize barley maize wheat groundnuts or barley groundnuts or annual growing season of lucerne amounts to 1000 mm farmers located within the orange riet and vaalharts irrigation schemes receives an annual irrigation quota irrigation water allocated to farmers of about 1100 and 914 mm respectively at 59 of the measuring sites 34 in total isource during the measuring period were more than the allocated irrigation quota a mean 34 more when total rainfall over the growing season was added to isource 100 of the measuring sites received more water than the irrigation quota during the measuring period a mean 55 more seasonal transpiration of the various crops grown at each field were estimated from the measured biomass and a normalised water productivity parameter wp which is also at the core of the aquacrop model this is possible because of the linear relationship ben gal et al 2003 that exists between biomass production and transpiration and the fact that when wp is normalised for evaporative demand eto it behaves conservatively i e wp remains virtually constant over a range of environments steduto et al 2007 for barley wheat groundnuts maize and lucerne wp values of 150 150 130 330 and 150 kg m 2 were used together with the mean eto over the growing season to estimate a conservative transpiration value for each crop grown at each field the percentage over or under supply of these estimated transpiration values through irrigation and rainfall plus irrigation collected in rain gauges are shown in fig 7 an assumption can be made that the oversupply of water indicates evaporation and drainage losses from the root zone because fig 3 showed that change in soil water content was small an undersupply of water indicates that there was except from irrigation and rainfall plus irrigation additional sources of water to meet transpiration and evaporation namely capillary rise from shallow groundwater table or decrease in soil water content which if occurred was small as shown in fig 3 only during the groundnuts growing season there was a mean 10 undersupply of transpiration through irrigation the variation was excessively high i e iqr 61 during the growing seasons of barley wheat maize and lucerne there was a mean 19 16 15 and 1 oversupply of transpiration with a variation of 65 for barley and about 30 for wheat maize and lucerne the wilcoxon nonparametric test lehmann 1975 showed no significant difference between estimated transpiration and irrigation collected in rain gauges p 0 3908 when rainfall during the growing season is added to irrigation the mean percentage in oversupply of estimated transpiration amounted to 35 39 60 106 and 67 for barley wheat groundnuts maize and lucerne respectively the wilcoxon nonparametric test showed that the total rainfall plus irrigation over the growing seasons were significantly more than the estimated transpiration p 0 0000 3 2 3 salt additions and leaching the water sources used for irrigation at the various fields were mainly from the orange 5 fields and vaal 8 fields rivers fig 8 fields irrigated with orange river water received a mean eci of 21msm 1 over the four growing seasons with an iqr of 2msm 1 while the fields irrigated with vaal river water received a mean eci of 65msm 1 over the growing seasons with an iqr of 5msm 1 the remaining fields received blended water either from orange and or lower riet and or modder and or artificial drainage or vaal and or artificial drainage mean 85msm 1 with an iqr of 45msm 1 the highest eci of this blended water was 249msm 1 none of the irrigation water was sodic as the sodium adsorption ratio was below 5 data not shown a mean of 869 1846 and 3070 kgsaltha 1 si were added to the root zone per growing season at the fields irrigated with orange river vaal river and blended water respectively iqr amounted to 436 825 and 2330 kg ha 1 respectively if a field volumetric soil water content at saturation of 0 36 mm mm 1 is assumed and no salt leaching then these mean salt additions should increase the mean ece over a depth of 1 m by 32 68 and 114msm 1 per growing season respectively over a period of two years or four growing seasons t1 and t5 at four fields the mean ece of the root zone increased by more than 30msm 1 mean of 53msm 1 while at three fields the increase in mean ece of the root zone was more than 90msm 1 at the rest of the fields the mean ece of the root zone decreased with a mean of 10msm 1 hence it can be deduced that most of the salts added through irrigation at the various fields were leached from the root zone barnard et al 2010 showed that for sandy to sandy loam soils fields 4 19 between 0 2 and 0 3 pore volume of drainage from the root zone removed 70 of excess salts salts that are removed until an equilibrium ec under specific soil irrigation water drainage conditions is reached in general at the fields where a shallow groundwater table is present within or just below a depth of 2 m the leached salts did not accumulate in the groundwater table except maybe at fields 2 3 4 and 9 at these fields the mean weekly ecgwt over four growing seasons amounted to 378msm 1 with a stdev of 160msm 1 the fields were also associated with poor natural and or artificial drainage conditions the weekly mean ecgwt of the fields irrigated with orange and vaal river water was 140 and 180msm 1 with a stdev of 40 and 48msm 1 respectively the measured dad over the growing season varied considerable from field to field with a mean low of 3 l min 1 to a high of 425 l min 1 fig 8 fields located in the orange riet irrigation scheme had a mean dad of 21 l min 1 and ecad of 170msm 1 over a growing season for vaalharts irrigation scheme the mean dad and ecad amounted to 132 l min 1 and 213msm 1 over the growing season at both irrigation schemes the variation in dad per growing season over the different fields were excessive i e the cv amounted to 104 and 90 respectively the variation in ecad per growing season over the various fields at both irrigation schemes were however much less namely 27 and 35 respectively fig 9 3 3 discussion water losses associated with an irrigated field can be categorised as i atmospheric loss drift and droplet evaporation ii canopy loss canopy evaporation and foliage interception iii surface loss surface water evaporation surface runoff and soil evaporation iv deep loss drainage beyond the root zone and v crop transpiration according to the generally adopted framework of perry 2007 and batchelor et al 2016 drift droplet evaporation canopy evaporation foliage interception surface water evaporation and soil evaporation are consumptive water comprising non beneficial use conversion of water into water vapour hence theoretically when more water is used from a source due to increases in non beneficial consumption salt addition to fields will be increased because salt does not evaporate as a first decision by farmers to reduce non beneficial consumption an efficient irrigation system should be used the centre pivot evaluations done at 19 fields showed that the mean magnitude of the distribution problem was low dulq 85 for most of the centre pivots more than 85 ae of the water pumped into the system were measured in rain gauges below the system without the presence of a crop however when considering the combined effect product of ae and dulq there was a high variation in se iqr 17 with a low mean value of 78 these irrigation water losses are attributed to drift and droplet evaporation factors that contribute to increased atmospheric loss include incorrect sprinkler design and and or excessive pressure non beneficial consumption due to canopy evaporation foliage interception and surface water evaporation fell beyond the scope of this study crop transpiration is regarded as consumptive beneficial water use it is widely reported in literature that for a specific crop grown in a specific agro climatic condition the relationship between transpiration and biomass production is linear especially for field crops steduto et al 2007 vadez et al 2014 perry and steduto 2017 this conservative relationship implies that in general good decisions on when and how much to irrigate irrigation scheduling should aim to manage matric and osmotic potentials in the root zone to ensure maximum transpiration data over four growing seasons from 19 fields where either wheat barley maize groundnuts or lucerne where grown revealed that this is precisely what farmers accomplished the matric potential of the root zone during the various growing seasons was kept consistently at a value higher than 30kpa evidence of water logging due to a groundwater table 1 m from the soil surface was limited only at three fields furthermore at the majority of fields root zone salinity osmotic potential was kept below a level that might have caused a reduction in transpiration and yield at only two fields one where maize was grown and one field of lucerne measured root zone salinity were higher than the threshold level ayers and westcot 1985 with an associated measured reduction in yield non consumptive water use comprising non recoverable flows are associated with water flowing to the sea or other economically unviable sink in terms of this study surface runoff and drainage beyond the root zone can be considered as non consumptive use comprising recoverable flows returning to a river or aquifer for potential reuse perry 2007 batchelor et al 2016 irrigation scheduling is central not only to ensure optimal crop transpiration as discussed above but also to reduce non beneficial consumption and non consumptive recoverable water some might argue that the latter case cannot meaningfully inform irrigation scheduling decisions by farmers for example in water footprint accounting the irrigation process and whether the water is applied efficiently by farmers are not addressed because surface runoff and drainage beyond the root zone are considered recoverable it will be shown below that in terms of implementing best on farm water and salt management practices this viewpoint might be short sighted results in this paper indicated that growing season rainfall plus isource i source i se summed over the various growing seasons at all fields were more than the allocated irrigation quota during the same time period a mean 55 more in addition mean growing season rainfall plus irrigation collected in rain gauges at the fields planted with barley wheat groundnuts maize and lucerne respectively were 35 39 60 106 and 67 more than a conservative estimate of crop transpiration during the specific season measured biomass and eto values were used the magnitude of variation in oversupply of transpiration through growing season rainfall plus irrigation during the various growing seasons at the fields were similar than the mean values iqr of 42 31 36 89 and 60 respectively these values provide an indication of water loss through evaporation and drainage beyond the root zone changes in soil water content at all the fields during each growing season was minimal fig 3 clearly farmers in the region does not objectively utilise rainfall as a source of water for crop transpiration best practice fig 1 furthermore at the fields where a shallow groundwater table is present there were no conclusive evidence that farmers objectively apply less water through rainfall plus irrigation during 92 of the growing seasons there was a mean 72 oversupply of transpiration in order to utilise capillary rise as an additional source of water for crop transpiration literature section 2 show that this is a viable option especially considering that soils are generally very wet at these fields fig 3 in addition zgwt remain relatively constant over a growing season when deeper than 1 5 m from the soil surface during 19 30 and 51 of the growing seasons where a shallow groundwater table was present the mean zgwt over a growing season were 1 m mean 0 784 m between 1 and 1 5 m mean 1 283 m and 1 5 m mean 1 722 m respectively the corresponding cv were 34 15 and 8 respectively according to barnard et al 2017 percolation from the unsaturated zone above the capillary fringe excess rainfall plus irrigation or upward capillary rise from the saturated zone recharges crop water uptake from the capillary zone correspondingly lateral groundwater inflow from high laying areas or vertical percolation from the capillary zone recharges the saturated zone when the depth of the groundwater table decreases uptake from the capillary fringe and or lateral groundwater drainage to lower laying areas is less than vertical percolation from the unsaturated zone and or lateral groundwater inflow from high laying areas and vice versa another realisation why farmers do not objectively utilise these water sources might be the fact that irrigation quotas were based on flood irrigation du preez et al 2000 while mean measured yields 5 8 6 1 3 2 12 9 and 24 4tonha 1 respectively achieved under more efficient sprinkler irrigation corresponds to much lower transpiration this oversupply of water to crops and wet soils causes a considerable amount of drainage and leaching beyond the root zone approximately all of the salts applied through irrigation mean 0 87 1 8 and 3 1tonha 1 per growing season for mean eci of 21 65 and 85msm 1 respectively were leached from the root zone rainfall between growing seasons probably contributed significantly to this salt leaching especially during fallow periods when farmers produce 3 crops in 4 growing seasons fields where the leached salts from the root zone might accumulate in the shallow groundwater table were limited in general lateral flow of shallow groundwater tables to lower laying areas were sufficient to remove these leached salts to an unknown sink variation in salinity of artificial drainage water ecad was generally low hence the excessive variation in salt removed is attributed to a large variation in flow rate dad lmin 1 theoretically artificial drainage water can be intercepted and re used with a mean ecad value of 170 and 213msm 1 for the fields located at orange riet and vaalharts respectively at three fields fields 1 18 and 19 this practice was implemented by the farmers during the measuring period of two years the mean eci was about 100msm 1 reaching values of more than 200msm 1 during specific periods while the yields were generally above average noticeably despite decades of research that extend to farmers with no apparent salt related problems implement best on farm water and salt practices before problems appear are generally low the gain in terms of resource use efficiency and prevention of environmental degradation is obvious as shown by this data and decades of research whether this low implementation of best on farm water and salt management practices are truly problematic remains debatable it seems from this paper that continuation with the status quo might be sustainable in the long term status quo referring to the conditions and practices studied in this paper according to perry and steduto 2017 introducing high tech irrigation more efficient irrigation systems in the absence of controls on water allocations to farmers will usually make the situation worse the reasons provided include an increase in consumption per unit area increase in irrigated area and the fact that farmers tend to pump more water from ever deeper sources wichelns and qadir 2015 proposes assigning responsibility for salt to farmers through a deposit or bond the idea is similar to providing consumers incentives to return reusable containers rather than disposing them the authors concluded that proper economic incentives to farmers financial commitments and political will are required to manage the salt load associated with irrigation 4 conclusions to address the on site and off site impact of the salt load associated with non saline and water logged irrigated fields a strategy is required this implies to minimise salt mobilisation and additions through irrigation prevent decreases in crop yield due to excessive salt in root zones and minimise irrigation induced drainage and leaching using this strategy on farm water and salt management practices were formulated and an extensive assessment conducted on whether farmers implement these practices the results revealed a mean measured centre pivot system efficiency of 78 and that well designed irrigation systems are vital to ensure efficient water application and salt management irrigation schedules by farmers at all fields ensured matric potentials more than 30kpa in root zones while fields with a mean groundwater table depth 1 m from the surface and mean root zone salinity close to threshold levels were limited regardless of this mean yields for barley wheat groundnuts maize and lucerne were 84 67 76 70 and 70 of the maximum yields attained respectively no significant evidence was found that mean volumetric soil water content over a depth of 1 8 m groundwater table depth and root zone salinity explain the variation in yields at all fields irrigation abstracted from the source plus rainfall were on average 55 more than the water allocated to farmers irrigation quota over the various growing seasons the estimated seasonal crop transpiration and irrigation collected in rain gauges did not differ significantly which was not true for seasonal rainfall plus irrigation the utilisation of rainfall for crop transpiration should be incorporated in irrigation schedules irrigation schedules also did not account for capillary rise from shallow groundwater tables as an additional water source between 0 9 and 3 tonha 1 of salt added through irrigation were leached seasonally from the root zone where shallow groundwater tables move laterally to lower laying areas the leached salts did not accumulate in the groundwater table the re use of drainage water was possible which was done at three fields where above average yields were obtained under these conditions it was found that a fallow period where no crop is grown was an important practice to leach excessive salt from the root zone the evidence is overwhelming for 21st century farmers to improve on farm water and salt management decisions and not only respond once problems appear especially in terms of contributing to increasing resource use efficiency and preventing environmental degradation arguable economic incentives and environmental regulation remain an important incentive for farmers to adopt best water and salt management practices declaration

10191,scenario analysis is the basis of developing rational water management practices wmps for watersheds how to predict future hydrological responses on a regional scale is still a challenge for modeling work in irrigated watersheds with shallow groundwater environments therefore this paper presents an efficient realization of predicting regional agroecosystem responses and searching for appropriate wmps through using a water balance based semi distributed hydrological model swat ag the scenario case study is carried out in the jiyuan irrigation system located in the hetao of upper yellow river basin based on the calibrated and validated modeling work in our previous companion paper eight scenarios of water saving practices wsps are proposed with consideration for reducing irrigation depth and controlling initial groundwater depth then the coupled responses of agroecosystem processes to various wsps are predicted for the case study region in 2012 and 2013 mainly related to the groundwater depth root zone soil water and salinity and crop yield natural vegetation biomass based on the analysis for proposed scenarios the 100 of present irrigation depth combined with increasing initial gwd by 50 cm are recommended as appropriate wsps for dry years and the 80 of present irrigation depth combined with increasing initial gwd by 100 cm are recommended for wet years in order to maintain good environmental conditions for both crops and natural vegetation in addition results show that swat ag could overcome the scale function limitations of traditional soil crop models and also avoid computational issues of numerical models we further point out that the scenarios in reality will be more complicated and comprehensive in time and space and thus the predictions should be updated accordingly overall this case study fully presents the feasibility and practicality of using the swat ag model to realize the scenario response analysis and water management decision making on a region scale for irrigated watersheds with shallow groundwater environments keywords ago ecohydrological modeling agroecosystem processes scenario analysis irrigated watershed water saving management 1 introduction excessive irrigation and induced secondary salinization have been common issues faced by many arid irrigated watersheds with shallow groundwater e g in northwest china pakistan and northwest india south australia and northern iran doble et al 2006 kahlown et al 2005 noory et al 2011 qureshi et al 2008 ren et al 2016 singh et al 2010 water saving practices wsps are thus necessary for regulating the agroecosystem processes and improving the soil water salt environments in such watersheds khan et al 2009 pereira et al 2007 the adopted wsps typically involve two aspects promoting canal conveyance service and improving field irrigation the application of wsps could efficiently save irrigation water meanwhile it also causes a decline of groundwater table to alleviate the salinity problem however the over application of wsps may lead to excessive lowering of water table and possible drought risk because shallow groundwater exerts strong effects on supporting crops and natural vegetation during the water deficit period nosetto et al 2009 ren et al 2016 previous research demonstrated that inappropriate wsps have resulted in negative impacts on agroecosystems and degradation of non irrigated natural vegetation bai et al 2017 karimov et al 2014 porhemmat et al 2018 ren et al 2017 xu et al 2011 xue and ren 2017 yang et al 2012 therefore a thorough and accurate understanding is needed of the agroecosystem responses to various wsps for arid agricultural watersheds with shallow groundwater simulation models are quantitative and powerful tools for scenario prediction and analysis which is very helpful to understand the effects of water management practices wmps on agroecosystem processes ahmadzadeh et al 2016 hanson et al 2008 toumi et al 2016 these modeling cases for optimizing water management practices are mainly related to the soil crop model field scale or distributed regional scale groundwater model and watershed hydrological model ahmadzadeh et al 2016 singh et al 2006 xu et al 2019 2011 nevertheless for scenario prediction in arid regions with shallow groundwater there are some obvious deficiencies or limitations for these models typically scenario analysis using soil crop model is generally based on user specified changes of water table depths pereira et al 2007 ren et al 2018 because the model could not provide the predictions of regional shallow groundwater tables this greatly restricts its actual applicability in scenario predictions for regional scale issues meanwhile the application of groundwater modeling is more focused on groundwater dynamics and water table management especially two important terms groundwater recharge evaporation are over simplified or empirically treated in scenario simulation doble et al 2006 xu et al 2010 they are actually closely related to vadose zone moisture conditions while they are not reflected in previous prediction studies xu et al 2011 thus the limited functions of groundwater model may largely affect its prediction accuracy and practical use in scenario analysis moreover from the previous literature the wmp scenario predictions with watershed scale hydrological models are rarely reported for irrigated watersheds with shallow groundwater this is primarily due to ago ecohydrological processes are often oversimplified or not considered for shallow water table areas xiong et al 2019 therefore how to achieve a reasonable prediction of wmp scenarios on a regional scale is necessary to be investigated under arid and shallow water table environments taking into account the considerations above the paper aims at proposing and presenting a reasonable realization with swat ag for predicting regional agroecosystem responses to wsps in arid irrigated regions with shallow groundwater swat ag is a watershed scale hydrological model proposed in our companion paper xiong et al 2019 it is specifically enhanced to be able to simulate the complicated agroecosystem processes in arid and shallow groundwater conditions mainly including the interactions of the vadose zone water groundwater salt and plant growth moreover swat ag as a balanced model is more practical and efficient for regional issues compared with numerical models as it could avoid the problems of model stability and computation burden a case study using prediction modeling work is conducted in this work in a typical irrigated region of the arid upper yellow river basin on the basis of our previous calibrated validated modeling case xiong et al 2019 various wsps scenarios were considered involving reducing irrigation amount and increasing initial groundwater depth the agroecosystem responses were then predicted and analyzed to identify appropriate wsps that can promote crop production and maintain natural vegetation growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 swat ag model swat ag is a physically based distributed hydrological model that especially includes enhanced capability for simulating regional agro and eco hydrological processes it was proposed by xiong et al 2019 with significant modifications on the basis of the swat framework the original swat model was developed for predicting the impact of management practices on hydrological processes and related processes in complex watersheds with varying slopes soils and land use conditions neitsch et al 2009 however the swat model is far from sufficient when applied in agricultural watersheds with shallow water table environments the swat ag enhances modeling capability for simulation in agricultural watersheds with shallow groundwater the swat ag model inherits the capability i e hydrological modeling and assessment and the advantages e g modeling robustness effectiveness and comprehensiveness of swat it is based on a water balance based mechanism and adopts the framework of subbasin and hru hydrological response unit division thus it is efficient and robust in handling complex regional modeling meanwhile the swat ag enhances the capability of regional agro hydrological process simulation in watersheds with shallow groundwater in swat ag the soil water balance module is improved to describe the effect of capillary rise on soil profile above shallow groundwater the modules of soil salt balance and salt stress are developed for quantifying soil salt dynamics and the effects on crop vegetation growth which is not contained in the swat a necessary modification is also made for groundwater modelling by changing from the original hru based calculation to subbasin based one this is more reasonable in irrigated areas with shallow groundwater where lateral exchanges of groundwater are frequent the effects of water management infrastructures are also quantified in groundwater modelling by calculating canal seepage and ditch drainage in addition some functions are incorporated into the swat ag to consider the field practices of soil bunds and surface mulching these make swat ag able to capture the complex interactions among agroecosystem processes e g plant growth soil water salt dynamic and groundwater depth fluctuation especially for arid climatic and shallow groundwater environments additional description of swat ag can be found in xiong et al 2019 2 2 case study area and modeling the case study was built on the previously calibrated validated modeling work of the jiyuan irrigation system jiyuan in hetao irrigation district hetao of the upper yellow river basin hetao is a typical arid irrigated watershed with shallow groundwater environments long term flood irrigation has resulted in shallow water depths mostly varying at 0 5 3 0 m during the year and secondary soil salinization jiyuan is located in the western region of hetao 40 45 40 52 n 106 59 107 07 e fig 1 it has an area of 8490 ha where 60 7 and 30 3 are farmland and natural land respectively the topography is very flat varying from 1036 to 1043 m above mean sea level msl small elevation differences 0 50 cm exist among different land covers the natural land is usually distributed in the lower elevation compared with nearby farmland usually with shallower groundwater tables the average annual precipitation is about 140 mm and the mean annual evaporation for a 20 cm pan reaches approximately 2000 mm the mean annual temperature is about 7 c with monthly average of 10 and 24 c in january and july respectively ren et al 2016 the irrigation and drainage system in jiyuan primarily consists of 1 two main canals which allocate irrigation water from south to north through tributary canals and 2 two main drainage ditches located in the middle part and on the east boundary and discontinuous ditches in the west part fig 1 major crops in jiyuan include sunflower and maize taking up nearly 90 of farmland area in recent years the natural vegetation is mainly shrubs and sparse grass which is affected with varying degrees of salinization the tamarisk tamarix chinensis lour is the main species of shrubs according to the on site survey the land use of jiyuan changed little while the crop pattern was adjusted according to the willingness of local farmers the land use maps for 2012 and 2013 are presented in fig 2 the land use map was obtained from the remote sensing result of landsat satellite images while crop pattern was generated from the manual visual interpretation of google earth images about 0 5 m resolution the crops in jiyuan are irrigated by surface basin irrigation with water from the yellow river including six water diversions during the crop growing season from may to september and the seventh diversion called autumn irrigation after crop harvest ren et al 2016 the autumn irrigation is applied for salt leaching and water storage allowing it to support crop growth in the early stage of the next year table 1 shows the recorded cropping and irrigation schedules for a wet year 2012 and a dry year 2013 respectively on the basis of the two year observation experiments and multi source data collection the swat ag modeling work for jiyuan was carried out xiong et al 2019 jiyuan was divided into 28 subbasins based on the irrigation and drainage system in swat ag fig 2 and the subbasins are further subdivided into 290 hrus and 350 hrus in 2012 and 2013 respectively through the combination of land use crop pattern soil type and slope 2 3 model calibration and validation the swat ag model has been calibrated and validated in jiyuan based on the observed data in 2013 and 2012 respectively xiong et al 2019 the observations included soil water storage and salinity concentration 0 100 cm depth leaf area index lai and groundwater depth gwd they were collected from 28 sampling points and 39 groundwater monitoring wells in jiyuan fig 1 the model calibration was first conducted on the basis of detailed canal scale data in yca fig 1 using sufi2 algorithm in sawt cup swat calibration uncertainty procedures abbaspour et al 2004 regional data sets in jiyuan were then used to further calibrate the model by trial and error method meanwhile the model performance was also evaluated by comparing simulated results with remote sensing et a yang et al 2012 and the results in our previous studies ren et al 2016 2017 2018 the calibrated values of sensitive parameters are presented in table 2 the calibrated swat ag well captured the soil water salt dynamics groundwater level fluctuations and crop growth process the simulation of et a was also reasonable compared with the remote sensing et a in croplands and natural lands the fitness indicators for model performance were all in acceptable ranges as compared with the canal scale and region scale observations table 3 a more detailed description about model calibration validation could be found in xiong et al 2019 2 4 using the model for predicting the wsps scenarios in order to show the advantages of swat ag in prediction capability the wsps scenarios proposed involve the adoption of water saving irrigation and changes of initial gwds table 4 the present and two reduced irrigation strategies i e 80 and 60 of present irrigation amount are considered in scenario creation noted as ir1 0 ir0 8 and ir0 6 respectively improving the irrigation and drainage system may lead to the lowering of the present water tables note that the initial gwd may have a significant effect on the subsequent hydrological dynamics processes thus the present and two increased initial gwd strategies i e increased by 50 cm and 100 cm are set in scenarios noted as gwd0 gwd50 and gwd100 respectively summarizing a total of nine scenarios i e three initial gwds combining three irrigation strategies table 4 are proposed to predict the possible agroecosystem responses in jiyuan during the plant growing season from may to september scenario s1 represents the present conditions the climatic data in scenarios were set the same as in 2012 wet year and 2013 dry year the changes in gwd conditions soil moisture and salt balance terms in the 0 100 cm soil profile and crop yield natural vegetation biomass were comprehensively evaluated for the case study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 responses of gwd dynamics to various wsps scenarios the average gwd during the simulation period agwdsp at the subbasin scale was calculated for various scenarios as presented in fig 3 in hetao classes of gwd could be defined as very shallow 1 0 m shallow 1 0 1 5 m reasonable 1 5 2 0 m deep 2 0 2 5 m and very deep 2 5 m according to previous studies xu et al 2013 ren et al 2017 2018 our results showed that reducing irrigation depth and increasing initial gwds resulted in the lowering of water tables but only to a limited degree the agwdsp was not increased significantly for scenarios s1 5 and s7 mostly varying between 1 0 and 1 5 m for the combination scenarios of s6 and s8 the agwdsp increased markedly and fluctuated in the reasonable range of 1 5 2 0 m for many subbasins however the agwdsp was deeper than 2 0 m in some subbasins for scenario s9 that is the most intensive wsps when looking further at the spatial distribution of agwdsp i e on hru scale results demonstrated that wsps brought both positive and negative responses in aspects of gwd changes the spatial distributions of agwdsp for scenarios s1 s5 and s9 in 2013 are selected and provided in fig 4a results showed that the gwds were very shallow or shallow in most hrus for the baseline scenario s1 additionally for the moderate scenario s5 fewer hrus had very shallow gwd but there were a number of hrus with shallow and reasonable gwd however the deep and very deep gwd were widely distributed in scenario s9 which was mutually supported with the gwd changes at the subbasin scale fig 3 therefore it implied that there were some risky responses of gwds to the very intensive wsps especially in dry years 3 2 responses of soil water and salt conditions to various wsps scenarios 3 2 1 soil water the average soil water content of the root zone during the simulation period aswcsp was calculated at a subbasin scale as shown in fig 5 results showed that the aswcsp were both decreased when reducing irrigation depth or increasing initial gwd it decreased to a limited degree in the wet year 2012 and maintained relatively high levels with 0 3 0 35 mm mm and 0 35 0 40 mm mm for farmland and natural land respectively by comparison the aswcsp showed a more pronounced decline in the dry year 2013 despite that the aswcsp is still around 0 30 0 35 mm mm for some mild moderate wsps scenarios e g s2 5 and s7 for the intensive wsps scenarios e g s6 s8 and s9 aswcsp has dropped lower than 0 30 mm mm both for farmland and natural land in many subbasins therefore in terms of soil moisture these responses indicated that most wsps scenarios were acceptable for the wet year however some intensive scenarios may result in drought risk in some cases during dry years to further illustrate the soil water response to wsps in the dry year the spatial distribution of aswcsp on hru scale for scenarios s1 s5 and s9 in 2013 are selected and provided in fig 4b the results of scenario s5 confirmed that aswcsp maintained a relatively high level with moderate wsps meanwhile the spatial distribution of aswcsp was not dissimilar to that in the baseline scenario s1 this indicated that the moderate wsps strategies should be acceptable in the dry year however the aswcsp was dramatically decreased in scenario s9 fig 4b there were a number of hrus having relatively lower aswcsp which demonstrated that intensive wsps would cause drought risk during the dry year 3 2 2 soil salt the average soil salt content of the root zone during the simulation period asscsp was calculated at a subbasin scale as shown in fig 6 the asscsp for farmland increased with reduced irrigation contrarily it decreased with increasing initial gwd therefore the asscsp for farmland was decreased with increasing initial gwd alone i e s4 and s7 meanwhile when combined wsps were applied the increase of asscsp for farmland was relatively insignificant in some scenarios i e s5 and s8 9 with less than 0 15 g kg however note that the asscsp for farmland could still be increased significantly with ir0 6 strategies i e s3 and s6 with the increase of over 0 2 g kg this indicated that scenarios s3 and s6 may result in severe salinity problems for farmland moreover results showed that the asscsp change for natural land was insignificant in wsps scenarios fig 6 the average electrical conductivity of saturated soil paste extract for the root zone during the simulation period i e asecsp was further calculated its spatial distribution on hru scale for the selected scenarios s1 s5 and s9 is provided in fig 4c the results of scenarios s5 and s9 were not dissimilar to that of the baseline scenario s1 confirming that the proposed wsps strategies may have insignificant influences on the salinity conditions in the root zone just a few hrus underwent a significant increase of asecsp in scenarios s5 and s9 3 3 responses of plant growth to various wsps scenarios 3 3 1 crop yield the relative change of crop yield δry was calculated for each crop type on the subbasin scale as shown in fig 7 the crop yield showed similar responses to wsps in wet year 2012 and dry year 2013 results showed that crop yield decreased with reduced irrigation depth alone in s2 and s3 ir0 8 and ir0 6 could result in about 5 8 and 11 14 reduction of crop yield in 2012 and 2013 respectively similar responses were also obtained for scenarios s4 s6 or s7 s9 note that the significant decrease of crop yield took place in some subbasins where salinity was the critical stress factor due to the severe root zone salinity problem with adopting the ir0 6 strategy in contrast the crop yield was slightly increased with δry not greater than 3 when only lowering the initial water tables e g according to the comparisons of s1 s4 and s7 or s3 s6 and s9 in fig 7 it was found that the combined strategies could not only save irrigation water but also maintain acceptable yields e g scenario s8 with ir0 8 and gwd100 the water salt stress during the crop growth period was further calculated with lower values indicating larger stress conditions the results of maize growth for scenarios s1 s5 and s9 were selected and provided in fig 8 the water salt stress was gradually alleviated for scenarios s1 s5 and s9 for the initial period may and early june when no irrigation was applied for maize this meant that increasing initial gwd was beneficial to alleviate the root zone salinity problem during the initial season by comparison for the period after june water salt stress gradually became more severe with changing scenarios s1 to s5 and s9 which implied the negative impacts from the reduced irrigation moreover we reason that the salinity problem was the critical factor for some cases of significant crop yield decrease under wsps scenarios fig 9 plots the spatial results of δry for hrus under scenarios s5 and s9 in the dry year of 2013 by comparing the spatial results of asecsp fig 4 it was evident that the hrus with low δry were identical to the hrus with significant increase of asecsp 3 3 2 natural vegetation biomass fig 7 presents the results of relative change of natural vegetation biomass δrb for subbasins under wsps scenarios in 2012 and 2013 respectively the natural vegetation biomass had different responses to wsps between the wet year 2012 and the dry year 2013 in the wet year natural vegetation biomass could be maintained and even slightly increased for most wsps scenarios with δrb 5 only a slight decrease was observed in very intensive scenario s9 in addition the water salt stress during the growth period is presented in fig 8 taking s1 s5 and s9 as examples the stress value under scenario s5 was a little higher than that for scenario s1 with both of them higher than that in scenario s9 this further shows wsps may not affect natural vegetation growth in the wet year however in contrast natural vegetation biomass mainly showed a decreased trend in the dry year while only increasing in some subbasins for mild scenarios i e s4 and s5 the δrb values reached ranges between 10 and 15 for some scenarios e g s6 s8 and s9 we also noted that the water salt stress became more severe in s9 compared with s1 and s5 fig 8 due to less groundwater contribution the analysis indicates severe negative effects on natural vegetation growth may occur for some proposed wsps during dry years in addition the responses of natural vegetation biomass are strikingly different in space in the dry year which was attributed to the different responses of soil moisture conditions fig 9 plots the spatial distribution of δrb on hru scale in scenarios s5 and s9 in the dry year 2013 we observed the hrus that had a significant decrease of natural biomass fig 9 were mainly identical to those with relatively lower aswcsp but not with higher asecsp fig 4 this implied that the change of moisture conditions rather than salt conditions should be the critical factor to cause the natural biomass decrease in wsps scenarios 3 4 discussion our predictions provided comprehensive agroecosystem responses to the proposed wsps in the case of jiyuan results indicated that several scenarios s4 s5 and s7 and s8 were feasible to maintain relatively good environments of soil water and groundwater for plant growth during the wet year other scenarios s2 s3 s6 and s9 may result in some different agroecosystem problems and the reduction of crop yields s3 and s6 mainly caused a significant increase of soil salinity while s9 brought the risk of drought problem for plant growth furthermore in the above mentioned feasible scenarios the scenario of s8 ir0 8 gwd100 can not only reduce irrigation water but also maintain acceptable yield and natural vegetation biomass which could be recommended as the appropriate wsps for the wet years however during dry years the scenarios related to reducing irrigation depth would all result in significant reduction for both crop yield and natural vegetation biomass only scenario s4 ir1 0 gwd50 could maintain good growth both for crops and natural vegetation therefore scenarios s4 and s8 are suggested as appropriate wsps in jiyuan for dry years and wet years respectively compared with other scenarios moreover the response analyses showed that the averaged salt content in the root zone had an increasing trend when reducing the current irrigation water amount this implied that it was necessary to increase extra fraction of irrigation water for leaching salts during crop growing in some local areas some other practical agronomic measures can also be adopted to alleviate the salinity effects such as the ridge tillage surface residue cover and organic fertilizer application in addition another flood irrigation event is often applied to leach salt after harvest in irrigation districts of upper yellow river basin e g between october and november in hetao this is efficient to reduce the accumulated salt during crop growth season and to prevent the inter annual salt accumulation in the long term in this study we used a group of case studies to search for the appropriate wsps using swat ag the scenario analysis with swat ag can provide a full understanding of regional agroecosystem responses in irrigated watersheds with shallow groundwater which could significantly outperform and broaden the previous research in scenario prediction to the regional scale compared with studies of pereira et al 2007 and ren et al 2018 that relied on user specified presumptive gwds our study captured groundwater responses and thus allowed us to predict regional responses to wsps directly without specifying groundwater conditions compared with studies of doble et al 2006 and xu et al 2010 that oversimplified groundwater recharge evaporation terms our study simulated vadose zone water dynamics and thus predicted the groundwater responses from a realistic perspective in fact practical regional water saving management could be much more complex because the management varied in both space and time even through the overall responses were positive there were some poor soil water conditions and decrease of crop yield and natural vegetation biomass in some local areas when designing the real wsps more factors and responses should be considered for increasing the water use efficiency and economic benefits the real application should be based on more realistic water saving scenarios taking the spatial variation of management into consideration e g crop pattern adjustment and spatially different irrigation schedules moreover swat ag can also be applied for timely scenario simulation and water management with integration of big data technology in investigations that follow 4 conclusions this study provided an efficient realization of scenario prediction on a regional scale and identification of appropriate water saving practices wsps for arid irrigated watersheds using a water balance based semi distributed hydrological model the swat ag model proposed in our previous companion paper was employed to predict wsps scenarios considering strategies of reducing irrigation depth and controlling initial groundwater depth gwd the scenario case study was conducted based on the previous calibrated validated modeling work in the jiyuan irrigation system located in the hetao of the upper yellow river basin results indicated that scenario prediction with swat ag could provide a full understanding of regional agroecosystem responses involve gwd and soil water salt conditions in root zone and crop natural vegetation growth results showed that reducing irrigation depth and increasing initial gwd both caused the lowering of water tables but only to a limited degree agwdsp would not exceed 2 0 m for wsps scenarios other than the most intensive scenario s9 ir0 6 gwd100 although the wsps resulted in a decrease of soil moisture in the root zone the aswcsp was still relatively high during the wet year while it can maintain an acceptable level 0 3 mm mm for mild moderate wsps scenarios e g s2 5 and s7 but may cause drought risk for some intensive scenarios e g s9 during the dry year meanwhile the changes of root zone salinity for farmland was insignificant less than 0 15 g kg for most wsps scenarios with only a marked increase for the ir0 6 strategy there were also insignificant changes of root zone salinity for natural land correspondingly the crop yield showed similar responses during the wet year and dry year i e decreased with reducing irrigation while slightly increased with increasing initial gwd the ir0 6 strategies could result in 11 14 reduction of crop yields natural vegetation biomass could maintain and even slightly increase for most wsps scenarios in wet years however it had a 10 15 reduction in some intensive scenarios during the dry year on the basis of scenario analysis the 100 of present irrigation depth combined with increasing initial gwd by 50 cm are recommended as appropriate wsps for dry years and the 80 of present irrigation depth combined with increasing initial gwd by 100 cm are recommended for wet years in order to reduce irrigation water and maintain crop yield plant biomass in addition there were also negative effects occurring in some local areas due to the spatial variance of agroecosystem responses more comprehensive and complicated strategies should be considered in realistic scenario predictions moreover the simulation case studies showed that swat ag could overcome the scale function limitations of traditional soil crop models and avoid computation issues of numerical models in scenario prediction overall our study

10191,scenario analysis is the basis of developing rational water management practices wmps for watersheds how to predict future hydrological responses on a regional scale is still a challenge for modeling work in irrigated watersheds with shallow groundwater environments therefore this paper presents an efficient realization of predicting regional agroecosystem responses and searching for appropriate wmps through using a water balance based semi distributed hydrological model swat ag the scenario case study is carried out in the jiyuan irrigation system located in the hetao of upper yellow river basin based on the calibrated and validated modeling work in our previous companion paper eight scenarios of water saving practices wsps are proposed with consideration for reducing irrigation depth and controlling initial groundwater depth then the coupled responses of agroecosystem processes to various wsps are predicted for the case study region in 2012 and 2013 mainly related to the groundwater depth root zone soil water and salinity and crop yield natural vegetation biomass based on the analysis for proposed scenarios the 100 of present irrigation depth combined with increasing initial gwd by 50 cm are recommended as appropriate wsps for dry years and the 80 of present irrigation depth combined with increasing initial gwd by 100 cm are recommended for wet years in order to maintain good environmental conditions for both crops and natural vegetation in addition results show that swat ag could overcome the scale function limitations of traditional soil crop models and also avoid computational issues of numerical models we further point out that the scenarios in reality will be more complicated and comprehensive in time and space and thus the predictions should be updated accordingly overall this case study fully presents the feasibility and practicality of using the swat ag model to realize the scenario response analysis and water management decision making on a region scale for irrigated watersheds with shallow groundwater environments keywords ago ecohydrological modeling agroecosystem processes scenario analysis irrigated watershed water saving management 1 introduction excessive irrigation and induced secondary salinization have been common issues faced by many arid irrigated watersheds with shallow groundwater e g in northwest china pakistan and northwest india south australia and northern iran doble et al 2006 kahlown et al 2005 noory et al 2011 qureshi et al 2008 ren et al 2016 singh et al 2010 water saving practices wsps are thus necessary for regulating the agroecosystem processes and improving the soil water salt environments in such watersheds khan et al 2009 pereira et al 2007 the adopted wsps typically involve two aspects promoting canal conveyance service and improving field irrigation the application of wsps could efficiently save irrigation water meanwhile it also causes a decline of groundwater table to alleviate the salinity problem however the over application of wsps may lead to excessive lowering of water table and possible drought risk because shallow groundwater exerts strong effects on supporting crops and natural vegetation during the water deficit period nosetto et al 2009 ren et al 2016 previous research demonstrated that inappropriate wsps have resulted in negative impacts on agroecosystems and degradation of non irrigated natural vegetation bai et al 2017 karimov et al 2014 porhemmat et al 2018 ren et al 2017 xu et al 2011 xue and ren 2017 yang et al 2012 therefore a thorough and accurate understanding is needed of the agroecosystem responses to various wsps for arid agricultural watersheds with shallow groundwater simulation models are quantitative and powerful tools for scenario prediction and analysis which is very helpful to understand the effects of water management practices wmps on agroecosystem processes ahmadzadeh et al 2016 hanson et al 2008 toumi et al 2016 these modeling cases for optimizing water management practices are mainly related to the soil crop model field scale or distributed regional scale groundwater model and watershed hydrological model ahmadzadeh et al 2016 singh et al 2006 xu et al 2019 2011 nevertheless for scenario prediction in arid regions with shallow groundwater there are some obvious deficiencies or limitations for these models typically scenario analysis using soil crop model is generally based on user specified changes of water table depths pereira et al 2007 ren et al 2018 because the model could not provide the predictions of regional shallow groundwater tables this greatly restricts its actual applicability in scenario predictions for regional scale issues meanwhile the application of groundwater modeling is more focused on groundwater dynamics and water table management especially two important terms groundwater recharge evaporation are over simplified or empirically treated in scenario simulation doble et al 2006 xu et al 2010 they are actually closely related to vadose zone moisture conditions while they are not reflected in previous prediction studies xu et al 2011 thus the limited functions of groundwater model may largely affect its prediction accuracy and practical use in scenario analysis moreover from the previous literature the wmp scenario predictions with watershed scale hydrological models are rarely reported for irrigated watersheds with shallow groundwater this is primarily due to ago ecohydrological processes are often oversimplified or not considered for shallow water table areas xiong et al 2019 therefore how to achieve a reasonable prediction of wmp scenarios on a regional scale is necessary to be investigated under arid and shallow water table environments taking into account the considerations above the paper aims at proposing and presenting a reasonable realization with swat ag for predicting regional agroecosystem responses to wsps in arid irrigated regions with shallow groundwater swat ag is a watershed scale hydrological model proposed in our companion paper xiong et al 2019 it is specifically enhanced to be able to simulate the complicated agroecosystem processes in arid and shallow groundwater conditions mainly including the interactions of the vadose zone water groundwater salt and plant growth moreover swat ag as a balanced model is more practical and efficient for regional issues compared with numerical models as it could avoid the problems of model stability and computation burden a case study using prediction modeling work is conducted in this work in a typical irrigated region of the arid upper yellow river basin on the basis of our previous calibrated validated modeling case xiong et al 2019 various wsps scenarios were considered involving reducing irrigation amount and increasing initial groundwater depth the agroecosystem responses were then predicted and analyzed to identify appropriate wsps that can promote crop production and maintain natural vegetation growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 swat ag model swat ag is a physically based distributed hydrological model that especially includes enhanced capability for simulating regional agro and eco hydrological processes it was proposed by xiong et al 2019 with significant modifications on the basis of the swat framework the original swat model was developed for predicting the impact of management practices on hydrological processes and related processes in complex watersheds with varying slopes soils and land use conditions neitsch et al 2009 however the swat model is far from sufficient when applied in agricultural watersheds with shallow water table environments the swat ag enhances modeling capability for simulation in agricultural watersheds with shallow groundwater the swat ag model inherits the capability i e hydrological modeling and assessment and the advantages e g modeling robustness effectiveness and comprehensiveness of swat it is based on a water balance based mechanism and adopts the framework of subbasin and hru hydrological response unit division thus it is efficient and robust in handling complex regional modeling meanwhile the swat ag enhances the capability of regional agro hydrological process simulation in watersheds with shallow groundwater in swat ag the soil water balance module is improved to describe the effect of capillary rise on soil profile above shallow groundwater the modules of soil salt balance and salt stress are developed for quantifying soil salt dynamics and the effects on crop vegetation growth which is not contained in the swat a necessary modification is also made for groundwater modelling by changing from the original hru based calculation to subbasin based one this is more reasonable in irrigated areas with shallow groundwater where lateral exchanges of groundwater are frequent the effects of water management infrastructures are also quantified in groundwater modelling by calculating canal seepage and ditch drainage in addition some functions are incorporated into the swat ag to consider the field practices of soil bunds and surface mulching these make swat ag able to capture the complex interactions among agroecosystem processes e g plant growth soil water salt dynamic and groundwater depth fluctuation especially for arid climatic and shallow groundwater environments additional description of swat ag can be found in xiong et al 2019 2 2 case study area and modeling the case study was built on the previously calibrated validated modeling work of the jiyuan irrigation system jiyuan in hetao irrigation district hetao of the upper yellow river basin hetao is a typical arid irrigated watershed with shallow groundwater environments long term flood irrigation has resulted in shallow water depths mostly varying at 0 5 3 0 m during the year and secondary soil salinization jiyuan is located in the western region of hetao 40 45 40 52 n 106 59 107 07 e fig 1 it has an area of 8490 ha where 60 7 and 30 3 are farmland and natural land respectively the topography is very flat varying from 1036 to 1043 m above mean sea level msl small elevation differences 0 50 cm exist among different land covers the natural land is usually distributed in the lower elevation compared with nearby farmland usually with shallower groundwater tables the average annual precipitation is about 140 mm and the mean annual evaporation for a 20 cm pan reaches approximately 2000 mm the mean annual temperature is about 7 c with monthly average of 10 and 24 c in january and july respectively ren et al 2016 the irrigation and drainage system in jiyuan primarily consists of 1 two main canals which allocate irrigation water from south to north through tributary canals and 2 two main drainage ditches located in the middle part and on the east boundary and discontinuous ditches in the west part fig 1 major crops in jiyuan include sunflower and maize taking up nearly 90 of farmland area in recent years the natural vegetation is mainly shrubs and sparse grass which is affected with varying degrees of salinization the tamarisk tamarix chinensis lour is the main species of shrubs according to the on site survey the land use of jiyuan changed little while the crop pattern was adjusted according to the willingness of local farmers the land use maps for 2012 and 2013 are presented in fig 2 the land use map was obtained from the remote sensing result of landsat satellite images while crop pattern was generated from the manual visual interpretation of google earth images about 0 5 m resolution the crops in jiyuan are irrigated by surface basin irrigation with water from the yellow river including six water diversions during the crop growing season from may to september and the seventh diversion called autumn irrigation after crop harvest ren et al 2016 the autumn irrigation is applied for salt leaching and water storage allowing it to support crop growth in the early stage of the next year table 1 shows the recorded cropping and irrigation schedules for a wet year 2012 and a dry year 2013 respectively on the basis of the two year observation experiments and multi source data collection the swat ag modeling work for jiyuan was carried out xiong et al 2019 jiyuan was divided into 28 subbasins based on the irrigation and drainage system in swat ag fig 2 and the subbasins are further subdivided into 290 hrus and 350 hrus in 2012 and 2013 respectively through the combination of land use crop pattern soil type and slope 2 3 model calibration and validation the swat ag model has been calibrated and validated in jiyuan based on the observed data in 2013 and 2012 respectively xiong et al 2019 the observations included soil water storage and salinity concentration 0 100 cm depth leaf area index lai and groundwater depth gwd they were collected from 28 sampling points and 39 groundwater monitoring wells in jiyuan fig 1 the model calibration was first conducted on the basis of detailed canal scale data in yca fig 1 using sufi2 algorithm in sawt cup swat calibration uncertainty procedures abbaspour et al 2004 regional data sets in jiyuan were then used to further calibrate the model by trial and error method meanwhile the model performance was also evaluated by comparing simulated results with remote sensing et a yang et al 2012 and the results in our previous studies ren et al 2016 2017 2018 the calibrated values of sensitive parameters are presented in table 2 the calibrated swat ag well captured the soil water salt dynamics groundwater level fluctuations and crop growth process the simulation of et a was also reasonable compared with the remote sensing et a in croplands and natural lands the fitness indicators for model performance were all in acceptable ranges as compared with the canal scale and region scale observations table 3 a more detailed description about model calibration validation could be found in xiong et al 2019 2 4 using the model for predicting the wsps scenarios in order to show the advantages of swat ag in prediction capability the wsps scenarios proposed involve the adoption of water saving irrigation and changes of initial gwds table 4 the present and two reduced irrigation strategies i e 80 and 60 of present irrigation amount are considered in scenario creation noted as ir1 0 ir0 8 and ir0 6 respectively improving the irrigation and drainage system may lead to the lowering of the present water tables note that the initial gwd may have a significant effect on the subsequent hydrological dynamics processes thus the present and two increased initial gwd strategies i e increased by 50 cm and 100 cm are set in scenarios noted as gwd0 gwd50 and gwd100 respectively summarizing a total of nine scenarios i e three initial gwds combining three irrigation strategies table 4 are proposed to predict the possible agroecosystem responses in jiyuan during the plant growing season from may to september scenario s1 represents the present conditions the climatic data in scenarios were set the same as in 2012 wet year and 2013 dry year the changes in gwd conditions soil moisture and salt balance terms in the 0 100 cm soil profile and crop yield natural vegetation biomass were comprehensively evaluated for the case study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 responses of gwd dynamics to various wsps scenarios the average gwd during the simulation period agwdsp at the subbasin scale was calculated for various scenarios as presented in fig 3 in hetao classes of gwd could be defined as very shallow 1 0 m shallow 1 0 1 5 m reasonable 1 5 2 0 m deep 2 0 2 5 m and very deep 2 5 m according to previous studies xu et al 2013 ren et al 2017 2018 our results showed that reducing irrigation depth and increasing initial gwds resulted in the lowering of water tables but only to a limited degree the agwdsp was not increased significantly for scenarios s1 5 and s7 mostly varying between 1 0 and 1 5 m for the combination scenarios of s6 and s8 the agwdsp increased markedly and fluctuated in the reasonable range of 1 5 2 0 m for many subbasins however the agwdsp was deeper than 2 0 m in some subbasins for scenario s9 that is the most intensive wsps when looking further at the spatial distribution of agwdsp i e on hru scale results demonstrated that wsps brought both positive and negative responses in aspects of gwd changes the spatial distributions of agwdsp for scenarios s1 s5 and s9 in 2013 are selected and provided in fig 4a results showed that the gwds were very shallow or shallow in most hrus for the baseline scenario s1 additionally for the moderate scenario s5 fewer hrus had very shallow gwd but there were a number of hrus with shallow and reasonable gwd however the deep and very deep gwd were widely distributed in scenario s9 which was mutually supported with the gwd changes at the subbasin scale fig 3 therefore it implied that there were some risky responses of gwds to the very intensive wsps especially in dry years 3 2 responses of soil water and salt conditions to various wsps scenarios 3 2 1 soil water the average soil water content of the root zone during the simulation period aswcsp was calculated at a subbasin scale as shown in fig 5 results showed that the aswcsp were both decreased when reducing irrigation depth or increasing initial gwd it decreased to a limited degree in the wet year 2012 and maintained relatively high levels with 0 3 0 35 mm mm and 0 35 0 40 mm mm for farmland and natural land respectively by comparison the aswcsp showed a more pronounced decline in the dry year 2013 despite that the aswcsp is still around 0 30 0 35 mm mm for some mild moderate wsps scenarios e g s2 5 and s7 for the intensive wsps scenarios e g s6 s8 and s9 aswcsp has dropped lower than 0 30 mm mm both for farmland and natural land in many subbasins therefore in terms of soil moisture these responses indicated that most wsps scenarios were acceptable for the wet year however some intensive scenarios may result in drought risk in some cases during dry years to further illustrate the soil water response to wsps in the dry year the spatial distribution of aswcsp on hru scale for scenarios s1 s5 and s9 in 2013 are selected and provided in fig 4b the results of scenario s5 confirmed that aswcsp maintained a relatively high level with moderate wsps meanwhile the spatial distribution of aswcsp was not dissimilar to that in the baseline scenario s1 this indicated that the moderate wsps strategies should be acceptable in the dry year however the aswcsp was dramatically decreased in scenario s9 fig 4b there were a number of hrus having relatively lower aswcsp which demonstrated that intensive wsps would cause drought risk during the dry year 3 2 2 soil salt the average soil salt content of the root zone during the simulation period asscsp was calculated at a subbasin scale as shown in fig 6 the asscsp for farmland increased with reduced irrigation contrarily it decreased with increasing initial gwd therefore the asscsp for farmland was decreased with increasing initial gwd alone i e s4 and s7 meanwhile when combined wsps were applied the increase of asscsp for farmland was relatively insignificant in some scenarios i e s5 and s8 9 with less than 0 15 g kg however note that the asscsp for farmland could still be increased significantly with ir0 6 strategies i e s3 and s6 with the increase of over 0 2 g kg this indicated that scenarios s3 and s6 may result in severe salinity problems for farmland moreover results showed that the asscsp change for natural land was insignificant in wsps scenarios fig 6 the average electrical conductivity of saturated soil paste extract for the root zone during the simulation period i e asecsp was further calculated its spatial distribution on hru scale for the selected scenarios s1 s5 and s9 is provided in fig 4c the results of scenarios s5 and s9 were not dissimilar to that of the baseline scenario s1 confirming that the proposed wsps strategies may have insignificant influences on the salinity conditions in the root zone just a few hrus underwent a significant increase of asecsp in scenarios s5 and s9 3 3 responses of plant growth to various wsps scenarios 3 3 1 crop yield the relative change of crop yield δry was calculated for each crop type on the subbasin scale as shown in fig 7 the crop yield showed similar responses to wsps in wet year 2012 and dry year 2013 results showed that crop yield decreased with reduced irrigation depth alone in s2 and s3 ir0 8 and ir0 6 could result in about 5 8 and 11 14 reduction of crop yield in 2012 and 2013 respectively similar responses were also obtained for scenarios s4 s6 or s7 s9 note that the significant decrease of crop yield took place in some subbasins where salinity was the critical stress factor due to the severe root zone salinity problem with adopting the ir0 6 strategy in contrast the crop yield was slightly increased with δry not greater than 3 when only lowering the initial water tables e g according to the comparisons of s1 s4 and s7 or s3 s6 and s9 in fig 7 it was found that the combined strategies could not only save irrigation water but also maintain acceptable yields e g scenario s8 with ir0 8 and gwd100 the water salt stress during the crop growth period was further calculated with lower values indicating larger stress conditions the results of maize growth for scenarios s1 s5 and s9 were selected and provided in fig 8 the water salt stress was gradually alleviated for scenarios s1 s5 and s9 for the initial period may and early june when no irrigation was applied for maize this meant that increasing initial gwd was beneficial to alleviate the root zone salinity problem during the initial season by comparison for the period after june water salt stress gradually became more severe with changing scenarios s1 to s5 and s9 which implied the negative impacts from the reduced irrigation moreover we reason that the salinity problem was the critical factor for some cases of significant crop yield decrease under wsps scenarios fig 9 plots the spatial results of δry for hrus under scenarios s5 and s9 in the dry year of 2013 by comparing the spatial results of asecsp fig 4 it was evident that the hrus with low δry were identical to the hrus with significant increase of asecsp 3 3 2 natural vegetation biomass fig 7 presents the results of relative change of natural vegetation biomass δrb for subbasins under wsps scenarios in 2012 and 2013 respectively the natural vegetation biomass had different responses to wsps between the wet year 2012 and the dry year 2013 in the wet year natural vegetation biomass could be maintained and even slightly increased for most wsps scenarios with δrb 5 only a slight decrease was observed in very intensive scenario s9 in addition the water salt stress during the growth period is presented in fig 8 taking s1 s5 and s9 as examples the stress value under scenario s5 was a little higher than that for scenario s1 with both of them higher than that in scenario s9 this further shows wsps may not affect natural vegetation growth in the wet year however in contrast natural vegetation biomass mainly showed a decreased trend in the dry year while only increasing in some subbasins for mild scenarios i e s4 and s5 the δrb values reached ranges between 10 and 15 for some scenarios e g s6 s8 and s9 we also noted that the water salt stress became more severe in s9 compared with s1 and s5 fig 8 due to less groundwater contribution the analysis indicates severe negative effects on natural vegetation growth may occur for some proposed wsps during dry years in addition the responses of natural vegetation biomass are strikingly different in space in the dry year which was attributed to the different responses of soil moisture conditions fig 9 plots the spatial distribution of δrb on hru scale in scenarios s5 and s9 in the dry year 2013 we observed the hrus that had a significant decrease of natural biomass fig 9 were mainly identical to those with relatively lower aswcsp but not with higher asecsp fig 4 this implied that the change of moisture conditions rather than salt conditions should be the critical factor to cause the natural biomass decrease in wsps scenarios 3 4 discussion our predictions provided comprehensive agroecosystem responses to the proposed wsps in the case of jiyuan results indicated that several scenarios s4 s5 and s7 and s8 were feasible to maintain relatively good environments of soil water and groundwater for plant growth during the wet year other scenarios s2 s3 s6 and s9 may result in some different agroecosystem problems and the reduction of crop yields s3 and s6 mainly caused a significant increase of soil salinity while s9 brought the risk of drought problem for plant growth furthermore in the above mentioned feasible scenarios the scenario of s8 ir0 8 gwd100 can not only reduce irrigation water but also maintain acceptable yield and natural vegetation biomass which could be recommended as the appropriate wsps for the wet years however during dry years the scenarios related to reducing irrigation depth would all result in significant reduction for both crop yield and natural vegetation biomass only scenario s4 ir1 0 gwd50 could maintain good growth both for crops and natural vegetation therefore scenarios s4 and s8 are suggested as appropriate wsps in jiyuan for dry years and wet years respectively compared with other scenarios moreover the response analyses showed that the averaged salt content in the root zone had an increasing trend when reducing the current irrigation water amount this implied that it was necessary to increase extra fraction of irrigation water for leaching salts during crop growing in some local areas some other practical agronomic measures can also be adopted to alleviate the salinity effects such as the ridge tillage surface residue cover and organic fertilizer application in addition another flood irrigation event is often applied to leach salt after harvest in irrigation districts of upper yellow river basin e g between october and november in hetao this is efficient to reduce the accumulated salt during crop growth season and to prevent the inter annual salt accumulation in the long term in this study we used a group of case studies to search for the appropriate wsps using swat ag the scenario analysis with swat ag can provide a full understanding of regional agroecosystem responses in irrigated watersheds with shallow groundwater which could significantly outperform and broaden the previous research in scenario prediction to the regional scale compared with studies of pereira et al 2007 and ren et al 2018 that relied on user specified presumptive gwds our study captured groundwater responses and thus allowed us to predict regional responses to wsps directly without specifying groundwater conditions compared with studies of doble et al 2006 and xu et al 2010 that oversimplified groundwater recharge evaporation terms our study simulated vadose zone water dynamics and thus predicted the groundwater responses from a realistic perspective in fact practical regional water saving management could be much more complex because the management varied in both space and time even through the overall responses were positive there were some poor soil water conditions and decrease of crop yield and natural vegetation biomass in some local areas when designing the real wsps more factors and responses should be considered for increasing the water use efficiency and economic benefits the real application should be based on more realistic water saving scenarios taking the spatial variation of management into consideration e g crop pattern adjustment and spatially different irrigation schedules moreover swat ag can also be applied for timely scenario simulation and water management with integration of big data technology in investigations that follow 4 conclusions this study provided an efficient realization of scenario prediction on a regional scale and identification of appropriate water saving practices wsps for arid irrigated watersheds using a water balance based semi distributed hydrological model the swat ag model proposed in our previous companion paper was employed to predict wsps scenarios considering strategies of reducing irrigation depth and controlling initial groundwater depth gwd the scenario case study was conducted based on the previous calibrated validated modeling work in the jiyuan irrigation system located in the hetao of the upper yellow river basin results indicated that scenario prediction with swat ag could provide a full understanding of regional agroecosystem responses involve gwd and soil water salt conditions in root zone and crop natural vegetation growth results showed that reducing irrigation depth and increasing initial gwd both caused the lowering of water tables but only to a limited degree agwdsp would not exceed 2 0 m for wsps scenarios other than the most intensive scenario s9 ir0 6 gwd100 although the wsps resulted in a decrease of soil moisture in the root zone the aswcsp was still relatively high during the wet year while it can maintain an acceptable level 0 3 mm mm for mild moderate wsps scenarios e g s2 5 and s7 but may cause drought risk for some intensive scenarios e g s9 during the dry year meanwhile the changes of root zone salinity for farmland was insignificant less than 0 15 g kg for most wsps scenarios with only a marked increase for the ir0 6 strategy there were also insignificant changes of root zone salinity for natural land correspondingly the crop yield showed similar responses during the wet year and dry year i e decreased with reducing irrigation while slightly increased with increasing initial gwd the ir0 6 strategies could result in 11 14 reduction of crop yields natural vegetation biomass could maintain and even slightly increase for most wsps scenarios in wet years however it had a 10 15 reduction in some intensive scenarios during the dry year on the basis of scenario analysis the 100 of present irrigation depth combined with increasing initial gwd by 50 cm are recommended as appropriate wsps for dry years and the 80 of present irrigation depth combined with increasing initial gwd by 100 cm are recommended for wet years in order to reduce irrigation water and maintain crop yield plant biomass in addition there were also negative effects occurring in some local areas due to the spatial variance of agroecosystem responses more comprehensive and complicated strategies should be considered in realistic scenario predictions moreover the simulation case studies showed that swat ag could overcome the scale function limitations of traditional soil crop models and avoid computation issues of numerical models in scenario prediction overall our study

10192,fertigation of crops with untreated wastewater predominates in developing countries use of wastewater for crop irrigation poses a potential risk of food chain poisoning with toxicants however direct and indirect interaction of wastewater with soil properties and crop productivity has been rarely investigated the current work was therefore planned to quantify the impact of canal water biologically treated and untreated wastewater on soil properties growth biochemical nutrient turnover and yield of pea pisum sativum l plants seeds of p sativum were sown in soil filled pots irrigated with five different water types canal water cw biologically treated wastewater btw 50 75 and 100 wastewater ww50 ww75 and ww100 the plant samples were collected after 35 days for biochemical analysis while yield parameters were recorded at maturity the results revealed a significantly higher growth and yield of pea plants irrigated with btw followed by ww50 and cw irrigated plants as compared to other wastewater treatment types application of untreated wastewater ww75 and ww100 resulted in stunted growth due to decrease in total chlorophylls carotenoids activities of sod and pod enzymes and increase in lipid peroxidation mda and h2o2 as compared to cw btw and ww50 pre and post harvest soil analysis revealed that application of concentrated wastewater caused soil alkalinization and subsequently limited the nutrient absorption by p sativum plants growth enhancement of p sativum under btw might be a direct consequence of balanced accumulation of nutrients owing to alteration of soil properties it was concluded that wastewater must be treated biologically or diluted with 50 of fresh canal water before application to agricultural fields in order to maintain soil nutrient level and sustainable crop productivity in the areas with less availability of fresh canal water keywords antioxidative enzymes wastewater fertigation nutrient uptake pea 1 introduction the agricultural sector mainstay of pakistan s economy 18 5 of gdp in 2019 20 ensures food safety and poverty alleviation it engages 37 4 of manpower employment and is one of the chief sources of profit for rural society agriculture statistics of pakistan 2020 pakistan is amongst the countries which are facing severe water scarcity and per capita available water was 1000 m3 in 2016 which is estimated to be decreased up to 700 m3 in 2025 akhtar et al 2018 about 93 of total freshwater available in pakistan is utilized for crop irrigation therefore it is necessary to seek water recycling sources to ensure sustainable water supply for crop productivity sleet 2019 moreover urban and industrial wastewater production is 6 8 billion m3 per annum out of which 0 876 billion m3 was directly used for crop production on an agricultural land area of 32500 ha khan et al 2020 besides about 26 of total vegetables production is based upon wastewater fertigation in the country naz et al 2016 increasing scarcity and continuous pollution of freshwater sources compelled the farming communities to increase the urban and industrial wastewater utilization for crop irrigation ashraf et al 2018 judicious use of wastewater in agriculture especially in areas where underground water is unsuitable for irrigation may be helpful in nutrients recycling cost reduction water conservation and reduction in water pollution up to some extent ahmed et al 2016 kausar et al 2017 however its long term application reported to modify soil properties and be noxious for plant growth development and productivity alderson et al 2015 wastewater fertigation to crops may change physico chemical characteristics of soil its fertility and elevation in concentrations of salts which subsequently alter the osmotic pressure in the rhizosphere elgallal et al 2016 farhadkhani et al 2018 these salts include salts of trace elements i e cu mn cd as pb zn cr mo b co polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs organic pollutants detergents fertilizers and pesticides which are non essential and highly poisonous to plants together with animals and humans egbuikwem et al 2020 besides use of wastewater raises the levels of toxicants in soil which may subsequently enter into edible plant parts such as vegetables and cereals and imposes health hazard to consumers ghosh et al 2012 libutti et al 2018 a continuous use of untreated wastewater is not only hazardous for efficient plant metabolism but also harmful for humans due to contaminated food in planta it affects photosynthesis respiration and water balance together with mineral unbalance high production of reactive oxygen species and or altered enzymatic activities has been reported by singh and laura 2014 and ain et al 2019 furthermore the adverse effects arisen from reuse of industrial wastewater are species specific and depend upon plant nutrient uptake capabilities and patterns of applied wastewater ayoub et al 2016 ain et al 2019 in vigna radiate l and pisum sativum l the fertigation with industrial and sewage wastewater decreased nutrient uptake biomass accumulation enzymatic activities rate of photosynthesis and yield as compared to biological treated wastewater irrigation yasmeen et al 2014 singh and laura 2014 diminished growth and yield was the result of less photosynthesis and less mineral acquisition by the plants hajihashemi et al 2020 pea pisum sativum l is an important legume vegetable which is cultivated for food and fodder purposes in pakistan the average yield is 55 t per ha and the cultivated area is 26 600 ha irrigation of p sativum crop with municipal wastewater is a common practice in the peripheral areas of various industrially centered cities of pakistan seeds of p sativum are composed of essential proteins but wastewater irrigation may result in uptake of toxicants posing serious risks to the consumers the present study is investigating the effect of canal water biologically treated

relationships among morpho physio biochemical attributes of pea plants grown under five waste water types by using xlstat software version 2016 1 3 results 3 1 physico chemical properties of wastewater the average values of physico chemical characteristics measured for canal water cw biological treated wastewater btw 50 75 100 wastewater ww50 ww75 and ww100 dilutions are given in table 1 the observed ph values were slightly acidic in cw moderately alkaline in btw and ww50 while ph above 8 was recorded for ww75 outside who recommended values and ww100 outside neqs and who recommended values analysis of water used for irrigation showed moderate levels of total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec for btw ww50 and significantly higher amounts for ww75 beyond who permissible limits and ww100 beyond neqs and who permissible limits the mean concentrations of cr cu and ni showed significantly higher levels in ww75 and ww100 as compared to cw btw and ww50 heavy metals concentrations of ww100 were found above the threshold levels recommended by neqs and who in comparison to cw and btw which might have caused the reduction in plant growth the average concentration of so4 2 k and zn2 in ww75 and ww100 was significantly higher as compared to cw btw and ww50 the ww75 and ww100 exhibited ph over 8 and their physico chemical properties were ranging outside the permissible levels recommended either by neqs and or who for irrigational waters 3 2 physiochemical characteristics of soil soil organic matter om ph as well as the concentrations of n p k zn ca and mg before and after plant cultivation varied considerably after application of various wastewater types table 2 soil ph was slightly over 7 before cultivation whereas cw btw and ww50 application caused soil acidification and ww75 and ww100 significantly enhanced the alkalinization of soil after pea plants harvesting soil treated with ww75 and ww100 showed maximum alkalinization values soil analysis before cultivation revealed higher mean values of n p zn ca mg and k ions as compared to post harvest soil irrigated with cw btw and ww50 table 2 however ww75 and ww100 changed the soil characteristics and resulted in significant increase in n p zn ca mg and k concentrations table 2 the maximum value of nutrient level was reported in ww100 treated soil see fig 1 3 3 effect of different wastewater types on biochemical attributes of pea plant the impact of different wastewater types used for irrigation on pea plant growth and biochemical attributes is presented in table 3 the results indicated that plants fertigated with btw showed 16 4 increase in chlorophyll contents as compared to plants grown with cw furthermore plants fertigated with ww50 ww75 and ww100 also depicted a significant reduction of 3 15 7 and 27 3 in chlorophyll contents in comparison to cw application moreover leaf carotenoid contents were significantly varied in pea plants cultivated with different ww treatments in comparison to cw treatment pea plants exhibited reduction in carotenoid contents in the order of ww100 41 4 ww75 31 4 ww50 12 8 while a significant increase of 7 1 was observed in btw treated plants our findings revealed that the cw btw and ww50 fertigation caused a significantly higher production of pea plants in terms of photosynthetic pigments fig 2 plants treated with btw exhibited 3 3 decrease in mda and 9 increase in h2o2 levels respectively as compared to cw treated plants moreover the plants fertigated with ww100 ww75 and ww50 showed 93 65 2 45 4 increase in mda content respectively and 93 2 63 7 21 2 enhanced production of h2o2 levels in comparison to cw irrigated plants activities of antioxidant enzymes sod and pod of plants irrigated with ww75 and ww100 were minimum whereas increased enzyme activity was recorded in plants treated with cw btw and ww50 table 3 furthermore plants fertigated with btw resulted in enhanced production of sod 15 2 and pod 0 56 activity in comparison with plants irrigated with cw however the ww100 and ww75 fertigated plants exhibited decrease in sod 31 1 18 5 and pod 35 8 27 4 respectively as compared to cw treated plants the plants fertigated with ww50 showed 5 9 enhanced sod production meanwhile 4 5 decrease in pod production as compared to cw treated plants 3 4 effect of different wastewater types on nutrient acquisition of pea plant variations in root and shoot k mg ca fe and zn contents of pea plant fertigated with cw btw and different wastewater concentrations ww50 ww75 and ww100 were recorded fig 1 the maximum reduction in root uptake of k mg ca fe and zn contents was recorded by 33 30 2 28 32 3 and 33 6 in roots and 30 2 42 38 7 34 3 and 33 6 in shoots respectively for ww100 fertigated plants as compared to cw meanwhile maximum increase of k mg ca fe and zn contents by 15 12 4 15 8 7 4 and 19 9 in roots and 20 5 8 4 8 15 6 and 17 5 in shoots was observed in plants fertigated with btw in comparison with cw further the ww50 fertigated plants showed varying response as compared to cw treatment the uptake of k in roots was enhanced by 3 6 and 5 9 in shoots while the non significant increase in mg ca and zn was recorded in root and shoot uptake as compared to cw application however the significant reduction of fe uptake in root 3 8 and shoot 5 7 was recorded in plants fertigated with ww50 as compared to cw in comparison to other wastewater types the highest increase in accumulation of minerals was recorded for btw fertigated plants followed by ww50 as compared to cw moreover ww75 treated plants also exhibited significant reduction of nutrients accumulation in roots and shoots as compared to cw but this reduction was lesser than ww100 3 5 effects of different wastewater treatments on yield components of pea plants the yield components are reported for plants treated with cw btw and varying levels of ww in table 4 number of leaves in btw treated plants depicted 21 2 increase while ww50 irrigated plants showed 6 1 increase as compared to cw treated plants however ww100 and ww75 fertigation showed reduction of 33 3 and 15 1 respectively in number of leaves as compared to cw the impact of different irrigation water on yield was apparent with reference to number of pods as btw fertigated plants led to higher yield of pods per plants where 4 8 increase was observed as compared to cw however the plants fertigated with all other water type depicted a reduction in number of pods per plant when compared with cw the order of decrease was depicted as ww100 31 ww75 16 7 ww50 2 4 the results obtained for pod weight in ww100 treated plants showed 34 4 and ww 75 showed 16 2 decrease as compared to cw the maximum increase of 8 7 in pod weight was observed in btw treated plants whereas ww50 showed non significant increase or decrease as compared to cw in btw fertigated plants grain yield showed 20 increase as compared to cw fertigated plants however ww100 and ww75 exhibited 24 and 16 decrease respectively while ww50 showed no significant change of grain yield in comparison with cw the cw btw and ww50 treatments significantly affected the yield in terms of seed weight and 1000 seed weight with significant higher yields than ww100 and ww75 treated plants in btw and ww50 treated plants seed weight plant and 1000 seed weight depicted an increase of 12 9 8 2 and 13 7 3 8 respectively as compared to cw while a significant reduction of 32 8 31 5 in ww100 and 7 1 14 7 reduction in seed weight plant and 1000 seed weight was recoded as compared to cw treated plants the ww75 and ww100 treatments showed least yield as compared to cw btw and ww50 for all the recorded parameters 3 6 relationship between growth and yield of pea with different types of irrigation water alteration in physiological and biochemical attributes of pea plants with different irrigation types resulted in an increase or decrease of biomass accumulation together with grain yield growth and yield attributes of pea plants were positively correlated with nutrient contents biomass production photosynthetic pigments and antioxidants while negatively with the components of lipid peroxidation h2o2 and mda fig 2 3 7 principal component analysis in order to evaluate the effect of different irrigation types on important attributes of pea plants score and loading plots of principal component analysis pca were synthesized fig 3 all five irrigation types were successfully dispersed by first two principal components fig 3a the maximum variance among all the components was based on extracted components i e pc1 dim1 and pc2 dim2 where component dim1 contributed 96 while the contribution of dim2 was 3 2 fig 3b such treatment distribution clearly indicated that application of biological treated and ww50 had a significant growth promoting effect in terms of studied pea plant attributes as compared to ww100 and ww75 irrigation the ww100 and ww75 4 and 5 were more separated from canal water irrigation 1 and biological treated and ww50 irrigations 2 and 3 fig 3a which indicated that ww100 and ww75 wastewater irrigation exerted hazardous effects on growth and yield of pea plants 4 discussion 4 1 assessment of water and soil physico chemical properties in order to verify the quality of water used for experimental irrigation treatments physical and chemical properties of used wastewater were analyzed table 1 and compared with neqs and who standards to assess the fitness of water sources for agriculture irrigation results depicted that three water sources cw btw and ww50 were acidic than ww75 and ww100 average values for tss tds and ec were found higher in ww75 and ww100 as compared to cw and btw our results are in agreement with previous work yasmeen et al 2014 in which higher values of ph tss tds and ec were reported in ww as compared to btw in the present study heavy metal concentration in ww75 and ww100 were found higher as compared to cw btw and ww50 but were within permissible limits of neqs mahmood and malik 2014 yasmeen et al 2014 based upon the results it was perceived that wastewater irrigation of agricultural soils may lead to toxic metals retention in top layers of soil which may vary depending on soil ph texture irrigation management practices effluent concentration climatic conditions as well as soil and crop types higher soil accumulation of metals ultimately reached to food crops and vegetables and thereby likely to pose serious health hazard to the consumers mahmood and malik 2014 three cw btw and ww50 out of five water types exhibited physico chemical properties which met the neqs criteria for use in irrigation soil om ph and concentrations of mineral nutrients are closely related while determining plant performance therefore it is imperative to evaluate these properties before and after crop cultivation soil ph is an important factor because it can interfere with exchange of nutrients and toxic heavy metals thereby enhancing or reducing their availability to plants osakwe 2012 the average soil ph at post harvest implies that treatment of wastewater triggered soil basification furthermore ww100 irrigation increased heavy metal retention in the soils in comparison with cw btw and ww50 table 2 the variation in soil ph to basification was in accordance with earlier findings which envisioned that the increased soil ph under wastewater treatment resulted in diminished nutrient availability to plants thapliyal et al 2011 yasmeen et al 2014 it was corroborated that increase in soil ph after ww100 application can be associated with proton consuming decarboxylation and deamination amino acid and organic anions processes as well as n mineralization and denitrification favored by high soil ph of used calcareous soil in present study which requires one mole of protons for each mole of denitrified no3 abegunrin et al 2016 soil fertigation with wastewater can also cause medium basification in response to presence of free alkaline cations javed et al 2013 the current study revealed an increase in soil om at post harvest after addition of concentrated wastewater ww100 as compared to other water types probably an effect arising from the presence of higher contents of total soluble solids in effluent wastewater levy et al 2014 organic matters constituted of humic acid are negatively charged and it attracts cations abegunrin et al 2016 hence application of ww50 caused moderately restrained effect on soil organic matter which is likely to counteract the uptake of toxic elements due to balanced cation exchange and thereby influenced the plant growth libutti et al 2018 soil mineral contents were assessed before and after plant cultivation soil zn ca mg k and cu contents were significantly higher in ww75 and ww100 fertigated soils when compared with btw cw and ww50 which retained optimum nutrient levels for plant uptake table 2 yasmeen et al 2014 reported an increase of mineral nutrients in ww treated soils as compared to plants exposed to btw it was inferred previously that secondary treated wastewater and 100 ww have higher contents of mineral nutrients when agricultural soils were fertigated with such waters matheyarasu et al 2016 libutti et al 2018 it was envisaged that enhanced concentrations of available nutrients might be correlated with improved plant growth in ww50 as compared to ww75 and ww100 where nutrient availability diminished under soil alkalinization soil health and its nutrient status is a major factor in determining plant growth and yield high soil ph significantly influenced mineral availability nutrient acquisition and impaired root growth which ultimately negatively impacted plant development sirisuntornlak et al 2020 the higher levels of heavy metals in wastewater can contribute to soil micronutrients pool but their surplus levels in soil may cause abiotic stress moreover an increase in soil ph may lead to higher adsorption of nutrient ions onto clay soil colloids keren et al 1985 kumar et al 2017 4 2 impact of different irrigation waters on physio biochemical attributes of pea plant significant differences in pisum sativum photosynthetic pigments were recorded under different fertigation regimes table 3 chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were significantly increased in plants fertigated with btw and decreased in descending order for ww100 ww75 and ww50 as compared to cw lower chlorophyll and carotenoid levels might originate from disrupted transpiration rate due to impaired stomatal closure and preeminent levels of degrading enzyme chlorophyllase due to the presence of heavy metals in wastewater javed et al 2017 increase in photosynthetic pigments owing to biological treated wastewater might be associated with optimum supply of mineral nutrients as btw maintain the rhizospheric ph in optimum range for nutrient acquisition furthermore an increase in photosynthetic attributes was assessed after fertigation with ww50 which might be associated with maintained nutrient levels and reduced ros production by plants due to moderate level of wastewater induced toxicity in pea plants it was in agreement that biomass of v radiata plant increased when fertigated with diluted wastewater but plant growth was abridged when irrigated with untreated wastewater baskaran et al 2009 our results also corroborated the findings of helaly et al 2018 who described an increment in photosynthetic pigments of mango plants under treated wastewater fertigation the p sativum plants fertigated with untreated ww100 and ww75 revealed higher levels of lipid peroxidation in terms of mda and h2o2 in comparison to btw and cw table 3 higher concentrations of mda and h2o2 probably resulted from oxidative stress mediated by increased uptake of toxic elements from wastewater which negatively affected the plant growth and yield yasmeen et al 2014 javed et al 2017 it was envisaged that increased level of lipid peroxidation and h2o2 might have induced impaired cellular membrane activities due to interference and uptake of heavy metals with mineral nutrients in soil fertigated with wastewater hashem et al 2013 plants fertigated with btw and cw maintained lower levels of mda and h2o2 as compared to other wastewater treatments table 3 which is likely to be linked with optimal ph range and improved mineral uptake ali and ashraf 2011 severe levels of toxic conditions trigger production of ros and increased ion leakage in plants however those treated with ww50 exhibited lower levels of ros which obliterated p sativum plants form oxidative damage libutti et al 2018 the antioxidative machinery safeguards plants under oxidative stress by regulating ros production a substantial decline in the activities of sod and pod was observed when plants were fertigated with untreated wastewater table 3 decrease in sod and pod activities indicates that plants encountered increased lipid peroxidation h2o2 and their derivative ros which are resulting from inhibition of biosynthesis of enzymes due to toxicities coming from waste water irrigation xu et al 2010 in the current study plants fertigated with ww50 showed moderate levels while btw and cw treated ones exhibited maximum levels of sod and pod activities a significant increase in activities of sod and pod in ww50 treated plants validates the previous finding of daud et al 2016 who reported that enhanced levels of antioxidant activities prevailed in plants maintained under treated wastewater application 4 3 effect of wastewater irrigations on root and shoot mineral uptake of pea plant accumulation and uptake of nutrient ions was used as screening criteria for plant growth augmentation by using p sativum as a model plant after different wastewater applications in the current study concentrations of k mg ca fe and zn in roots and shoots of p sativum showed substantial increase after btw ww50 and cw treatments in comparison to other wastewater treatments fig 1 the enhanced uptake of these nutrients by p sativum plants was prominent and can be related to optimal supply of these nutrients under btw and cw application yasmeen et al 2014 increased influx of mineral nutrients as a result of treated wastewater application might be attributed to higher mineral nutrient contents which resulted in increased plant growth khalid et al 2017 furthermore outcomes of the current study indicated that ww50 application significantly up regulated the k and fe influx into roots and shoots in comparison to cw which corroborates with the results of anwar et al 2016 who reported the improvement of nutrient contents of mentha arvensis l and trigonella foenum l after fertigation with wastewater our finding also corroborates the findings that brassica napus plants showed elevated levels of nutrients when irrigated with 50 diluted industrial wastewater hajihashemi et al 2019 4 4 effect of different irrigation waters on yield attributes of pea plant results revealed that number of pods per plant pod weight number of seeds and seed weight increased when pea plants were fertigated with btw which corroborates the previous findings of yasmeen et al 2014 in the present study increase in plant growth and yield might be linked with higher light absorption optimal nutrient status as well as enhanced photosynthetic activity of p sativum plants hassena et al 2018 stimulatingly the yield attributes in ww50 fertigated plants maintained a prominent level in comparison to cw ww75 and ww100 treated plants table 4 therefore it was perceived that ww50 application increased the availability of mineral ions k ca mg in the rhizosphere which positively affected the nutrient uptake through plants roots rusan et al 2016 have reported identical that 50 diluted wastewater from olive mill enhanced maize growth by maintaining nutrient balance our findings also corroborate with the study of hajihashemi et al 2019 who reported that 50 diluted industrial wastewater acted as fertilizer where brassica napus plant performance was markedly increased due to augmented nutrient level photosynthetic activity and morpho anatomical traits in leguminous plants soil ph may affect nitrogen fixation capacity where nodule size and activity of nitrogenase enzyme as well as cross talk between rhizobia and host plant is disrupted under very low ph regimes ferreira et al 2016 ferreira et al 2016 suggested that nitrogen fixation increased at slightly acidic ph 6 7 which in turn likely to increase the plant n contents and growth as observed in present study under btw and ww50 application the decrease in number of pods per plant pod weight number of seeds and seed weight in ww100 is likely due to competition for nutrient uptake as heavy metal bioavailability to plants exceeded in untreated wastewater hashem et al 2013 in the current study decrease in plant growth and yield might be associated with nutrient deficiency and presence of different toxic elements which are peculiar to plant growth abegunrin et al 2016 our findings are in agreement with khan et al 2010 who reported that sorghum bicolor yield attributes were reduced when treated with municipal wastewater untreated wastewater usually have higher accumulation of toxic metals which imposes modulations in essential nutrient uptake and can be a possible reason for reduced growth and plant yield yasmeen et al 2014 we concluded that pea plants fertigated with ww75 and ww100 having high alkaline ph ranges revealed reduced growth and yield performance in comparison to cw and ww50 table 3 table 4 in alkaline calcareous soil nodule formation and their functionality as well as nitrogen uptake by legumes is limited by reduced availability of nutrients necessary for the establishment of proper nitrogen fixation system khan et al 2014 accumulation of nitrogen by plants i e ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 increases at neutral ph ranges across root interface neina 2019 therefore it was anticipated that n uptake and fixation by pea plant increased due to slightly acidic soil ph regimes after btw and ww50 application which confer growth and yield enhancement effects fan et al 2018 5 conclusion application of treated wastewater attained global attention as an economical and environmental friendly water management practice to cope with increased demand of fresh water resources for crop irrigation the present study aimed at elucidating the relative efficacy of five various water types canal water cw biologically treated wastewater btw 50 75 and 100 wastewater ww50 ww75 and ww100 on the basis of their physico chemical properties and explored their potential by applying to pisum sativum l as a test plant the water analysis of btw cw and ww50 indicated that these waters lie under the permissible ranges of irrigational waters set by neqs and who it was concluded that irrigation with btw increased the growth of p sativum together with biochemical parameters and yield attributes by maintaining a balance in uptake of nutrients and toxic elements from the rhizosphere furthermore cw and ww50 treatment also conferred growth enhancement but the effect was lower than btw fertigation while unbalanced nutrient accumulation contributed to poor growth and yield in plants fertigated with ww75 and ww100 therefore it is inferred that ww50 can be applied for pea plant fertigation when cw and or btw is unavailable because of its cost effectiveness it will also help in reduction of wastewater pollution originating from heavy metals contaminated wastewater irrigation however further studies should explore the use of ww50 in crop irrigation particularly its synergistic effects on plant growth and yield credit authorship contributions statement muhammad tariq javed muhammad sohail akram and kashif tanwir planning of study

10192,fertigation of crops with untreated wastewater predominates in developing countries use of wastewater for crop irrigation poses a potential risk of food chain poisoning with toxicants however direct and indirect interaction of wastewater with soil properties and crop productivity has been rarely investigated the current work was therefore planned to quantify the impact of canal water biologically treated and untreated wastewater on soil properties growth biochemical nutrient turnover and yield of pea pisum sativum l plants seeds of p sativum were sown in soil filled pots irrigated with five different water types canal water cw biologically treated wastewater btw 50 75 and 100 wastewater ww50 ww75 and ww100 the plant samples were collected after 35 days for biochemical analysis while yield parameters were recorded at maturity the results revealed a significantly higher growth and yield of pea plants irrigated with btw followed by ww50 and cw irrigated plants as compared to other wastewater treatment types application of untreated wastewater ww75 and ww100 resulted in stunted growth due to decrease in total chlorophylls carotenoids activities of sod and pod enzymes and increase in lipid peroxidation mda and h2o2 as compared to cw btw and ww50 pre and post harvest soil analysis revealed that application of concentrated wastewater caused soil alkalinization and subsequently limited the nutrient absorption by p sativum plants growth enhancement of p sativum under btw might be a direct consequence of balanced accumulation of nutrients owing to alteration of soil properties it was concluded that wastewater must be treated biologically or diluted with 50 of fresh canal water before application to agricultural fields in order to maintain soil nutrient level and sustainable crop productivity in the areas with less availability of fresh canal water keywords antioxidative enzymes wastewater fertigation nutrient uptake pea 1 introduction the agricultural sector mainstay of pakistan s economy 18 5 of gdp in 2019 20 ensures food safety and poverty alleviation it engages 37 4 of manpower employment and is one of the chief sources of profit for rural society agriculture statistics of pakistan 2020 pakistan is amongst the countries which are facing severe water scarcity and per capita available water was 1000 m3 in 2016 which is estimated to be decreased up to 700 m3 in 2025 akhtar et al 2018 about 93 of total freshwater available in pakistan is utilized for crop irrigation therefore it is necessary to seek water recycling sources to ensure sustainable water supply for crop productivity sleet 2019 moreover urban and industrial wastewater production is 6 8 billion m3 per annum out of which 0 876 billion m3 was directly used for crop production on an agricultural land area of 32500 ha khan et al 2020 besides about 26 of total vegetables production is based upon wastewater fertigation in the country naz et al 2016 increasing scarcity and continuous pollution of freshwater sources compelled the farming communities to increase the urban and industrial wastewater utilization for crop irrigation ashraf et al 2018 judicious use of wastewater in agriculture especially in areas where underground water is unsuitable for irrigation may be helpful in nutrients recycling cost reduction water conservation and reduction in water pollution up to some extent ahmed et al 2016 kausar et al 2017 however its long term application reported to modify soil properties and be noxious for plant growth development and productivity alderson et al 2015 wastewater fertigation to crops may change physico chemical characteristics of soil its fertility and elevation in concentrations of salts which subsequently alter the osmotic pressure in the rhizosphere elgallal et al 2016 farhadkhani et al 2018 these salts include salts of trace elements i e cu mn cd as pb zn cr mo b co polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs organic pollutants detergents fertilizers and pesticides which are non essential and highly poisonous to plants together with animals and humans egbuikwem et al 2020 besides use of wastewater raises the levels of toxicants in soil which may subsequently enter into edible plant parts such as vegetables and cereals and imposes health hazard to consumers ghosh et al 2012 libutti et al 2018 a continuous use of untreated wastewater is not only hazardous for efficient plant metabolism but also harmful for humans due to contaminated food in planta it affects photosynthesis respiration and water balance together with mineral unbalance high production of reactive oxygen species and or altered enzymatic activities has been reported by singh and laura 2014 and ain et al 2019 furthermore the adverse effects arisen from reuse of industrial wastewater are species specific and depend upon plant nutrient uptake capabilities and patterns of applied wastewater ayoub et al 2016 ain et al 2019 in vigna radiate l and pisum sativum l the fertigation with industrial and sewage wastewater decreased nutrient uptake biomass accumulation enzymatic activities rate of photosynthesis and yield as compared to biological treated wastewater irrigation yasmeen et al 2014 singh and laura 2014 diminished growth and yield was the result of less photosynthesis and less mineral acquisition by the plants hajihashemi et al 2020 pea pisum sativum l is an important legume vegetable which is cultivated for food and fodder purposes in pakistan the average yield is 55 t per ha and the cultivated area is 26 600 ha irrigation of p sativum crop with municipal wastewater is a common practice in the peripheral areas of various industrially centered cities of pakistan seeds of p sativum are composed of essential proteins but wastewater irrigation may result in uptake of toxicants posing serious risks to the consumers the present study is investigating the effect of canal water biologically treated

were a to monitor the changes in physico chemical properties of soil under various wastewater fertigation regimes b to establish correlations among plant s morpho physio biochemical attributes to find out which parameters in biomass production and yield are affected by the treatments by using p sativum as a test plant and c finally to determine the applicable dilution levels for municipal effluents

wastewater the average values of physico chemical characteristics measured for canal water cw biological treated wastewater btw 50 75 100 wastewater ww50 ww75 and ww100 dilutions are given in table 1 the observed ph values were slightly acidic in cw moderately alkaline in btw and ww50 while ph above 8 was recorded for ww75 outside who recommended values and ww100 outside neqs and who recommended values analysis of water used for irrigation showed moderate levels of total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec for btw ww50 and significantly higher amounts for ww75 beyond who permissible limits and ww100 beyond neqs and who permissible limits the mean concentrations of cr cu and ni showed significantly higher levels in ww75 and ww100 as compared to cw btw and ww50 heavy metals concentrations of ww100 were found above the threshold levels recommended by neqs and who in comparison to cw and btw which might have caused the reduction in plant growth the average concentration of so4 2 k and zn2 in ww75 and ww100 was significantly higher as compared to cw btw and ww50 the ww75 and ww100 exhibited ph over 8 and their physico chemical properties were ranging outside the permissible levels recommended either by neqs and or who for irrigational waters 3 2 physiochemical characteristics of soil soil organic matter om ph as well as the concentrations of n p k zn ca and mg before and after plant cultivation varied considerably after application of various wastewater types table 2 soil ph was slightly over 7 before cultivation whereas cw btw and ww50 application caused soil acidification and ww75 and ww100 significantly enhanced the alkalinization of soil after pea plants harvesting soil treated with ww75 and ww100 showed maximum alkalinization values soil analysis before cultivation revealed higher mean values of n p zn ca mg and k ions as compared to post harvest soil irrigated with cw btw and ww50 table 2 however ww75 and ww100 changed the soil characteristics and resulted in significant increase in n p zn ca mg and k concentrations table 2 the maximum value of nutrient level was reported in ww100 treated soil see fig 1 3 3 effect of different wastewater types on biochemical attributes of pea plant the impact of different wastewater types used for irrigation on pea plant growth and biochemical attributes is presented in table 3 the results indicated that plants fertigated with btw showed 16 4 increase in chlorophyll contents as compared to plants grown with cw furthermore plants fertigated with ww50 ww75 and ww100 also depicted a significant reduction of 3 15 7 and 27 3 in chlorophyll contents in comparison to cw application moreover leaf carotenoid contents were significantly varied in pea plants cultivated with different ww treatments in comparison to cw treatment pea plants exhibited reduction in carotenoid contents in the order of ww100 41 4 ww75 31 4 ww50 12 8 while a significant increase of 7 1 was observed in btw treated plants our findings revealed that the cw btw and ww50 fertigation caused a significantly higher production of pea plants in terms of photosynthetic pigments fig 2 plants treated with btw exhibited 3 3 decrease in mda and 9 increase in h2o2 levels respectively as compared to cw treated plants moreover the plants fertigated with ww100 ww75 and ww50 showed 93 65 2 45 4 increase in mda content respectively and 93 2 63 7 21 2 enhanced production of h2o2 levels in comparison to cw irrigated plants activities of antioxidant enzymes sod and pod of plants irrigated with ww75 and ww100 were minimum whereas increased enzyme activity was recorded in plants treated with cw btw and ww50 table 3 furthermore plants fertigated with btw resulted in enhanced production of sod 15 2 and pod 0 56 activity in comparison with plants irrigated with cw however the ww100 and ww75 fertigated plants exhibited decrease in sod 31 1 18 5 and pod 35 8 27 4 respectively as compared to cw treated plants the plants fertigated with ww50 showed 5 9 enhanced sod production meanwhile 4 5 decrease in pod production as compared to cw treated plants 3 4 effect of different wastewater types on nutrient acquisition of pea plant variations in root and shoot k mg ca fe and zn contents of pea plant fertigated with cw btw and different wastewater concentrations ww50 ww75 and ww100 were recorded fig 1 the maximum reduction in root uptake of k mg ca fe and zn contents was recorded by 33 30 2 28 32 3 and 33 6 in roots and 30 2 42 38 7 34 3 and 33 6 in shoots respectively for ww100 fertigated plants as compared to cw meanwhile maximum increase of k mg ca fe and zn contents by 15 12 4 15 8 7 4 and 19 9 in roots and 20 5 8 4 8 15 6 and 17 5 in shoots was observed in plants fertigated with btw in comparison with cw further the ww50 fertigated plants showed varying response as compared to cw treatment the uptake of k in roots was enhanced by 3 6 and 5 9 in shoots while the non significant increase in mg ca and zn was recorded in root and shoot uptake as compared to cw application however the significant reduction of fe uptake in root 3 8 and shoot 5 7 was recorded in plants fertigated with ww50 as compared to cw in comparison to other wastewater types the highest increase in accumulation of minerals was recorded for btw fertigated plants followed by ww50 as compared to cw moreover ww75 treated plants also exhibited significant reduction of nutrients accumulation in roots and shoots as compared to cw but this reduction was lesser than ww100 3 5 effects of different wastewater treatments on yield components of pea plants the yield components are reported for plants treated with cw btw and varying levels of ww in table 4 number of leaves in btw treated plants depicted 21 2 increase while ww50 irrigated plants showed 6 1 increase as compared to cw treated plants however ww100 and ww75 fertigation showed reduction of 33 3 and 15 1 respectively in number of leaves as compared to cw the impact of different irrigation water on yield was apparent with reference to number of pods as btw fertigated plants led to higher yield of pods per plants where 4 8 increase was observed as compared to cw however the plants fertigated with all other water type depicted a reduction in number of pods per plant when compared with cw the order of decrease was depicted as ww100 31 ww75 16 7 ww50 2 4 the results obtained for pod weight in ww100 treated plants showed 34 4 and ww 75 showed 16 2 decrease as compared to cw the maximum increase of 8 7 in pod weight was observed in btw treated plants whereas ww50 showed non significant increase or decrease as compared to cw in btw fertigated plants grain yield showed 20 increase as compared to cw fertigated plants however ww100 and ww75 exhibited 24 and 16 decrease respectively while ww50 showed no significant change of grain yield in comparison with cw the cw btw and ww50 treatments significantly affected the yield in terms of seed weight and 1000 seed weight with significant higher yields than ww100 and ww75 treated plants in btw and ww50 treated plants seed weight plant and 1000 seed weight depicted an increase of 12 9 8 2 and 13 7 3 8 respectively as compared to cw while a significant reduction of 32 8 31 5 in ww100 and 7 1 14 7 reduction in seed weight plant and 1000 seed weight was recoded as compared to cw treated plants the ww75 and ww100 treatments showed least yield as compared to cw btw and ww50 for all the recorded parameters 3 6 relationship between growth and yield of pea with different types of irrigation water alteration in physiological and biochemical attributes of pea plants with different irrigation types resulted in an increase or decrease of biomass accumulation together with grain yield growth and yield attributes of pea plants were positively correlated with nutrient contents biomass production photosynthetic pigments and antioxidants while negatively with the components of lipid peroxidation h2o2 and mda fig 2 3 7 principal component analysis in order to evaluate the effect of different irrigation types on important attributes of pea plants score and loading plots of principal component analysis pca were synthesized fig 3 all five irrigation types were successfully dispersed by first two principal components fig 3a the maximum variance among all the components was based on extracted components i e pc1 dim1 and pc2 dim2 where component dim1 contributed 96 while the contribution of dim2 was 3 2 fig 3b such treatment distribution clearly indicated that application of biological treated and ww50 had a significant growth promoting effect in terms of studied pea plant attributes as compared to ww100 and ww75 irrigation the ww100 and ww75 4 and 5 were more separated from canal water irrigation 1 and biological treated and ww50 irrigations 2 and 3 fig 3a which indicated that ww100 and ww75 wastewater irrigation exerted hazardous effects on growth and yield of pea plants 4 discussion 4 1 assessment of water and soil physico chemical properties in order to verify the quality of water used for experimental irrigation treatments physical and chemical properties of used wastewater were analyzed table 1 and compared with neqs and who standards to assess the fitness of water sources for agriculture irrigation results depicted that three water sources cw btw and ww50 were acidic than ww75 and ww100 average values for tss tds and ec were found higher in ww75 and ww100 as compared to cw and btw our results are in agreement with previous work yasmeen et al 2014 in which higher values of ph tss tds and ec were reported in ww as compared to btw in the present study heavy metal concentration in ww75 and ww100 were found higher as compared to cw btw and ww50 but were within permissible limits of neqs mahmood and malik 2014 yasmeen et al 2014 based upon the results it was perceived that wastewater irrigation of agricultural soils may lead to toxic metals retention in top layers of soil which may vary depending on soil ph texture irrigation management practices effluent concentration climatic conditions as well as soil and crop types higher soil accumulation of metals ultimately reached to food crops and vegetables and thereby likely to pose serious health hazard to the consumers mahmood and malik 2014 three cw btw and ww50 out of five water types exhibited physico chemical properties which met the neqs criteria for use in irrigation soil om ph and concentrations of mineral nutrients are closely related while determining plant performance therefore it is imperative to evaluate these properties before and after crop cultivation soil ph is an important factor because it can interfere with exchange of nutrients and toxic heavy metals thereby enhancing or reducing their availability to plants osakwe 2012 the average soil ph at post harvest implies that treatment of wastewater triggered soil basification furthermore ww100 irrigation increased heavy metal retention in the soils in comparison with cw btw and ww50 table 2 the variation in soil ph to basification was in accordance with earlier findings which envisioned that the increased soil ph under wastewater treatment resulted in diminished nutrient availability to plants thapliyal et al 2011 yasmeen et al 2014 it was corroborated that increase in soil ph after ww100 application can be associated with proton consuming decarboxylation and deamination amino acid and organic anions processes as well as n mineralization and denitrification favored by high soil ph of used calcareous soil in present study which requires one mole of protons for each mole of denitrified no3 abegunrin et al 2016 soil fertigation with wastewater can also cause medium basification in response to presence of free alkaline cations javed et al 2013 the current study revealed an increase in soil om at post harvest after addition of concentrated wastewater ww100 as compared to other water types probably an effect arising from the presence of higher contents of total soluble solids in effluent wastewater levy et al 2014 organic matters constituted of humic acid are negatively charged and it attracts cations abegunrin et al 2016 hence application of ww50 caused moderately restrained effect on soil organic matter which is likely to counteract the uptake of toxic elements due to balanced cation exchange and thereby influenced the plant growth libutti et al 2018 soil mineral contents were assessed before and after plant cultivation soil zn ca mg k and cu contents were significantly higher in ww75 and ww100 fertigated soils when compared with btw cw and ww50 which retained optimum nutrient levels for plant uptake table 2 yasmeen et al 2014 reported an increase of mineral nutrients in ww treated soils as compared to plants exposed to btw it was inferred previously that secondary treated wastewater and 100 ww have higher contents of mineral nutrients when agricultural soils were fertigated with such waters matheyarasu et al 2016 libutti et al 2018 it was envisaged that enhanced concentrations of available nutrients might be correlated with improved plant growth in ww50 as compared to ww75 and ww100 where nutrient availability diminished under soil alkalinization soil health and its nutrient status is a major factor in determining plant growth and yield high soil ph significantly influenced mineral availability nutrient acquisition and impaired root growth which ultimately negatively impacted plant development sirisuntornlak et al 2020 the higher levels of heavy metals in wastewater can contribute to soil micronutrients pool but their surplus levels in soil may cause abiotic stress moreover an increase in soil ph may lead to higher adsorption of nutrient ions onto clay soil colloids keren et al 1985 kumar et al 2017 4 2 impact of different irrigation waters on physio biochemical attributes of pea plant significant differences in pisum sativum photosynthetic pigments were recorded under different fertigation regimes table 3 chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were significantly increased in plants fertigated with btw and decreased in descending order for ww100 ww75 and ww50 as compared to cw lower chlorophyll and carotenoid levels might originate from disrupted transpiration rate due to impaired stomatal closure and preeminent levels of degrading enzyme chlorophyllase due to the presence of heavy metals in wastewater javed et al 2017 increase in photosynthetic pigments owing to biological treated wastewater might be associated with optimum supply of mineral nutrients as btw maintain the rhizospheric ph in optimum range for nutrient acquisition furthermore an increase in photosynthetic attributes was assessed after fertigation with ww50 which might be associated with maintained nutrient levels and reduced ros production by plants due to moderate level of wastewater induced toxicity in pea plants it was in agreement that biomass of v radiata plant increased when fertigated with diluted wastewater but plant growth was abridged when irrigated with untreated wastewater baskaran et al 2009 our results also corroborated the findings of helaly et al 2018 who described an increment in photosynthetic pigments of mango plants under treated wastewater fertigation the p sativum plants fertigated with untreated ww100 and ww75 revealed higher levels of lipid peroxidation in terms of mda and h2o2 in comparison to btw and cw table 3 higher concentrations of mda and h2o2 probably resulted from oxidative stress mediated by increased uptake of toxic elements from wastewater which negatively affected the plant growth and yield yasmeen et al 2014 javed et al 2017 it was envisaged that increased level of lipid peroxidation and h2o2 might have induced impaired cellular membrane activities due to interference and uptake of heavy metals with mineral nutrients in soil fertigated with wastewater hashem et al 2013 plants fertigated with btw and cw maintained lower levels of mda and h2o2 as compared to other wastewater treatments table 3 which is likely to be linked with optimal ph range and improved mineral uptake ali and ashraf 2011 severe levels of toxic conditions trigger production of ros and increased ion leakage in plants however those treated with ww50 exhibited lower levels of ros which obliterated p sativum plants form oxidative damage libutti et al 2018 the antioxidative machinery safeguards plants under oxidative stress by regulating ros production a substantial decline in the activities of sod and pod was observed when plants were fertigated with untreated wastewater table 3 decrease in sod and pod activities indicates that plants encountered increased lipid peroxidation h2o2 and their derivative ros which are resulting from inhibition of biosynthesis of enzymes due to toxicities coming from waste water irrigation xu et al 2010 in the current study plants fertigated with ww50 showed moderate levels while btw and cw treated ones exhibited maximum levels of sod and pod activities a significant increase in activities of sod and pod in ww50 treated plants validates the previous finding of daud et al 2016 who reported that enhanced levels of antioxidant activities prevailed in plants maintained under treated wastewater application 4 3 effect of wastewater irrigations on root and shoot mineral uptake of pea plant accumulation and uptake of nutrient ions was used as screening criteria for plant growth augmentation by using p sativum as a model plant after different wastewater applications in the current study concentrations of k mg ca fe and zn in roots and shoots of p sativum showed substantial increase after btw ww50 and cw treatments in comparison to other wastewater treatments fig 1 the enhanced uptake of these nutrients by p sativum plants was prominent and can be related to optimal supply of these nutrients under btw and cw application yasmeen et al 2014 increased influx of mineral nutrients as a result of treated wastewater application might be attributed to higher mineral nutrient contents which resulted in increased plant growth khalid et al 2017 furthermore outcomes of the current study indicated that ww50 application significantly up regulated the k and fe influx into roots and shoots in comparison to cw which corroborates with the results of anwar et al 2016 who reported the improvement of nutrient contents of mentha arvensis l and trigonella foenum l after fertigation with wastewater our finding also corroborates the findings that brassica napus plants showed elevated levels of nutrients when irrigated with 50 diluted industrial wastewater hajihashemi et al 2019 4 4 effect of different irrigation waters on yield attributes of pea plant results revealed that number of pods per plant pod weight number of seeds and seed weight increased when pea plants were fertigated with btw which corroborates the previous findings of yasmeen et al 2014 in the present study increase in plant growth and yield might be linked with higher light absorption optimal nutrient status as well as enhanced photosynthetic activity of p sativum plants hassena et al 2018 stimulatingly the yield attributes in ww50 fertigated plants maintained a prominent level in comparison to cw ww75 and ww100 treated plants table 4 therefore it was perceived that ww50 application increased the availability of mineral ions k ca mg in the rhizosphere which positively affected the nutrient uptake through plants roots rusan et al 2016 have reported identical that 50 diluted wastewater from olive mill enhanced maize growth by maintaining nutrient balance our findings also corroborate with the study of hajihashemi et al 2019 who reported that 50 diluted industrial wastewater acted as fertilizer where brassica napus plant performance was markedly increased due to augmented nutrient level photosynthetic activity and morpho anatomical traits in leguminous plants soil ph may affect nitrogen fixation capacity where nodule size and activity of nitrogenase enzyme as well as cross talk between rhizobia and host plant is disrupted under very low ph regimes ferreira et al 2016 ferreira et al 2016 suggested that nitrogen fixation increased at slightly acidic ph 6 7 which in turn likely to increase the plant n contents and growth as observed in present study under btw and ww50 application the decrease in number of pods per plant pod weight number of seeds and seed weight in ww100 is likely due to competition for nutrient uptake as heavy metal bioavailability to plants exceeded in untreated wastewater hashem et al 2013 in the current study decrease in plant growth and yield might be associated with nutrient deficiency and presence of different toxic elements which are peculiar to plant growth abegunrin et al 2016 our findings are in agreement with khan et al 2010 who reported that sorghum bicolor yield attributes were reduced when treated with municipal wastewater untreated wastewater usually have higher accumulation of toxic metals which imposes modulations in essential nutrient uptake and can be a possible reason for reduced growth and plant yield yasmeen et al 2014 we concluded that pea plants fertigated with ww75 and ww100 having high alkaline ph ranges revealed reduced growth and yield performance in comparison to cw and ww50 table 3 table 4 in alkaline calcareous soil nodule formation and their functionality as well as nitrogen uptake by legumes is limited by reduced availability of nutrients necessary for the establishment of proper nitrogen fixation system khan et al 2014 accumulation of nitrogen by plants i e ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 increases at neutral ph ranges across root interface neina 2019 therefore it was anticipated that n uptake and fixation by pea plant increased due to slightly acidic soil ph regimes after btw and ww50 application which confer growth and yield enhancement effects fan et al 2018 5 conclusion application of treated wastewater attained global attention as an economical and environmental friendly water management practice to cope with increased demand of fresh water resources for crop irrigation the present study aimed at elucidating the relative efficacy of five various water types canal water cw biologically treated wastewater btw 50 75 and 100 wastewater ww50 ww75 and ww100 on the basis of their physico chemical properties and explored their potential by applying to pisum sativum l as a test plant the water analysis of btw cw and ww50 indicated that these waters lie under the permissible ranges of irrigational waters set by neqs and who it was concluded that irrigation with btw increased the growth of p sativum together with biochemical parameters and yield attributes by maintaining a balance in uptake of nutrients and toxic elements from the rhizosphere furthermore cw and ww50 treatment also conferred growth enhancement but the effect was lower than btw fertigation while unbalanced nutrient accumulation contributed to poor growth and yield in plants fertigated with ww75 and ww100 therefore it is inferred that ww50 can be applied for pea plant fertigation when cw and or btw is unavailable because of its cost effectiveness it will also help in reduction of wastewater pollution originating from heavy metals contaminated wastewater irrigation however further studies should explore the use of ww50 in crop irrigation particularly its synergistic effects on plant growth and yield credit authorship contributions statement muhammad tariq javed muhammad sohail akram and kashif tanwir planning of study

10193,crop residue retention has been established as an effective conservation tillage practice for decreasing nitrogen n runoff losses and increasing crop production however the impacts on n runoff losses from annual rice wheat rotation are not well understood which has prevented identification of optimal straw retention practice herein n dynamics and losses in the runoff crop yields and soil properties were assessed for two years in a rice wheat system after implementing straw return for five consecutive years the field experiment included six treatments n1 wn1 rn1 recommended n application with no straw wheat straw and rice straw return respectively and sn0 sn1 and sn2 both wheat and rice straw return with zero recommended and custom n addition respectively the results showed that nh4 n and no3 n were the major forms of n loads discharged during the rice and wheat season respectively the total n loss tn p 0 001 and mean annual crop yield rice and wheat p 0 01 significantly increased as the n fertilizer rate increased with respect to crop residue retention modes the cumulative tn loss and mean annual crop yield trends were n1 rn1 wn1 sn1 p 0 05 and sn1 rn1 wn1 n1 p 0 05 respectively during a one year rice wheat rotation cycle the treatments with simultaneous incorporation of crop residue and n fertilizer reduced n runoff loss by 2 7 20 9 p 0 05 and increased crop yield by 8 7 16 9 p 0 05 of which the sn1 treatment was found to be the most effective the straw induced reducing effect occurred only during the base and tiller fertilization stages of the rice growing period which was primarily regulated by soil inorganic nitrogen sin soil organic carbon soc and ph during the rice tiller stage our findings indicate that straw return decreases n runoff loss by mediating factors in soil and standing water in order to reduce n runoff loss without jeopardizing crop yield the practice of double seasons straw retention with recommended n

paddy soil 1 introduction each year 67 8 million tonnes of synthetic nitrogen n is applied to agricultural systems worldwide liu et al 2010 while supplemental n is critical for increasing the

buckley and carney 2013 yang et al 2013a hence exploration of alternative practices that both increase crop production and reduce n runoff loss is pivotal for maintaining the required food supply at a minimal environmental cost a comprehensive statistical analysis of worldwide n loss prevention and control measures from 1957 to the present demonstrated that controlling n emission sources is the most effective n loss prevention measure zhang et al 2016 changing the fertilizer type and optimizing the amount were shown to effectively decrease n runoff loss from their sources in addition

huygens et al 2007 2008 previous studies have confirmed that partially substituting crop straw for synthetic n fertilizers can increase crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency nue while simultaneously decreasing n runoff loss wang et al 2012 2015b zhang et al 2019 however substantial n flow estimation or prediction errors are prone to occur with insufficient monitoring frequency moreover large n loss rate differences were observed under straw return from different studies even with the same amount of n fertilizer application xia et al 2016 wang et al 2018 clearly the characteristics and effectiveness of different straw retention practices on n loss are not well understood and therefore the optimal straw return practice i e the practice that reduces most of the n runoff losses while simultaneously ensuring a relative high yield has not been determined herein we subjected a rice wheat rotation system to a 5 year straw incorporation program then examined the efficiency of crop retention modes with different n fertilizer levels on mitigating n loss risks over a two year period our objectives were to 1 quantify the n runoff losses and crop yields under different straw retention practices during rice wheat seasons and 2 investigate the characteristics of n dynamics in standing water during the rice season as well as the features affected by soil factors under n and straw application 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiment was conducted in jiangsu province at changshu agro ecological experimental station 31 32 93 n 120 41 88 e a member station of the chinese ecosystem research network cern at the chinese academy of sciences the site is located in the yangtze delta region a typical annual rice wheat rotation growing area in china and is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 23 7 ºc and 10 years mean annual precipitation 2008 2017 of 1049 6 mm the mean daily temperature and precipitation during the 2018 rice wheat growing seasons are shown in fig s1 the site soil is classified as anthrosol which is a gleyed paddy soil derived from lacustrine sediments the following major soil properties were determined from top layer samples at a depth of 0 15 cm ph 7 19 soil water 1 2 5 organic matter content 40 24 g kg 1 total n 2 35 g kg 1 available p 29 9 mg kg 1 and available k 156 2 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental design and agronomic management the field experiment began in june 2012 by transplanting the rice seedlings six treatments table s1 all of which included an equivalent input of pk fertilizer were selected for investigating n runoff losses for two consecutive years 2017 2019 and consisted of 1 n1 no straw return n fertilizer 440 kg ha 1 year 1 2 sn0 double straw return rice and wheat in the rice and wheat growing seasons of the one year rotation respectively n fertilizer 0 3 sn1 double straw return n fertilizer 440 kg ha 1 year 1 4 sn2 double straw return n fertilizer 550 kg ha 1 year 1 5 wn1 wheat straw return only during the rice season n fertilizer 440 kg ha 1 year 1 and 6 rn1 rice straw return only during the wheat season n fertilizer 440 kg ha 1 year 1 the treatments were designed to reflect different combined n fertilizer applications and crop residues i e different straw return modes n1 wn1 rn1 and sn1 and straw return with different n input rates sn0 sn1 and sn2 the six treatments were arranged as a randomized complete block design with three 43 7 m2 replicate plots per treatment the plots had their own respective water inlet and outlet and were separated by 20 cm wide soil ridges which were covered with a plastic film to reduce water and fertilizer flow and lateral infiltration the crop rotation system was a yearly rice wheat double cropping system winter wheat and summer rice nanjing 46 oryza sativa l and yangmai 16 triticum aestivum l were used for summer rice and winter wheat respectively rice is usually transplanted on june 18th 20th and harvested on october 28th november 5th in each year while wheat is sown around november 10th and harvested around may 25th during the rice season flooding conditions were maintained after the rice plant sprouted leaves and the standing water layer was kept at a 3 5 cm depth lower than the drainage pipe outlet except during the late tillering stage and approximately two weeks before harvest during the wheat season no irrigation was applied since the precipitation usually provides enough water for normal wheat growth as shown in table s1 the synthetic n fertilizer in the form of urea was split into 40 basal fertilizer 20 tiller fertilizer and 40 panicle fertilizer and applied during both the summer rice and winter wheat season phosphorus in the form of calcium superphosphate was applied as basal fertilizer in both seasons potassium in the form of potassium chloride was split into 50 basal fertilizer and 50 panicle fertilizer and applied in both seasons the same amount of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied in all the treatments after harvesting the rice and wheat straw were chopped into pieces with 5 10 cm in length and fully rotary incorporated into corresponding plots before the next crop transplantation eighteen cubic concrete tanks 1 5 m 1 2 m 1 2 m were built beside the field to collect runoff from each plot which was delivered through a piping system there were two pipe water level holes in each field plot to accommodate the distinct water regimes during the rice and wheat season fig s2 the upper one was positioned 7 cm above the ground surface to collect runoff during the rice season and the lower one was located 12 cm under ground for collecting inter flow and surface runoff from middle field drain ditch during the wheat season generally during the rice season the paddy field s average irrigation depth is 4 cm the standard for heavy rain is 2 5 5 0 cm d based on the runoff generated by heavy rain so during rainfall the threshold for possible runoff is 3 cm therefore a depth of 7 cm is a reasonable overflow height during the rice season moreover the drainage ditch depth in the wheat season is 10 12 cm so the drainage outlet depth was set as 12 cm 2 3 water and soil sampling consistent with local practice rice was irrigated intermittently using water from the nearby river while wheat depended mainly on rain during the 2017 and 2018 rice seasons at the beginning ten days after each fertilization for every two days standing water in the field was collected about 100 ml from randomly chosen locations in each plot the sampling frequency was then changed to once a week once every two weeks and finally once a month note that this measurement was only made during the rice season as standing water was not permitted during the wheat season from the 2018 rice to 2019 wheat season the water depth in each collection tank was recorded after each runoff producing rainfall event then the runoff in each tank was carefully mixed and sampled using a 100 ml sterile polyethylene bottle to prepare for the next runoff collection the remaining water was discharged and the tank was cleaned soil samples at a depth of 0 15 cm were collected before rice transplanting and straw return implementation as well as during the rice tillering stage i e on may 20 2018 and july 10 2018 respectively six cores 5 cm in diameter were randomly sampled in each plot individually mixed and then gently passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove large roots and gravel a portion of each soil sample was stored at 4 ºc to air dry for subsequent chemical analysis crop yields were measured for each treatment by harvesting three 2 m2 areas from each plot after the rice and wheat had ripened 2 4 chemical analysis all the collected water samples were immediately delivered to the laboratory stored in a 4 ºc refrigerator and analyzed within 24 h two thirds of every sample was filtered through 0 45 µm membranes and assayed for nitrate n no3 n and ammonium n nh4 n concentration the unfiltered part was retained for tn concentration analysis tn and no3 n were determined using alkaline potassium persulfate oxidation ultraviolet spectrometry and dual wavelength ultra violet spectrometry 220 nm and 275 nm respectively committee of analytical method of water and wastewater 2002 nh4 n was determined using the indophenol blue method rayment and higginson 1992 soil ph and electrical conductivity ec were ascertained with a soil to water ratio of 1 2 5 and 1 5 respectively soil moisture was obtained by oven drying a portion of the sample at 105 c for 12 h soil inorganic nitrogen sin including nh4 no3 and no2 was extracted with 2 m kcl then measured using a continuous flow analyzer aaa3 bran and luebbe norderstedt germany soil organic matter som was analyzed using the k2cr2o7 oxidation method bao 2000 while soil total nitrogen sn was determined using the semi micro kjeldahl digestion method lu 2000 soil available phosphorous ap was extracted using sodium bicarbonate and then measured using the molybdenum blue method and soil available potassium ak was measured using a flame photometer 2 5 statistical calculation and analysis the volume v of runoff and loss flux q of various forms of water were calculated as follows 1 v i l d i s 1000 2 q i kg ha 1 i 1 n c i v i 43

effect size was fitted by origin 2017 version and the straw retention modes categorical variables effect size was examined in openmee by building a random effect model with restricted maximum likelihood estimation reml the n1 treatment effective value was used as the intercept and other straw retention modes were compared with the modified benchmark the straw return treatments response was significant if the 95 confidence interval ci did not overlap with zero luo et al 2006 structural equation modelling sem was also conducted to evaluate the direct and indirect relationships of soil physicochemical factors with n runoff loss and the observed variables standard total effects were calculated schermelleh engel et al 2003 delgado baquerizo et al 2016 3 results 3 1 n runoff losses and crop yields during rice wheat production runoff showed seasonal variation over a year of rice wheat rotation table s2 during the rice season the total rainfall and particularly the runoff for all the treatments were higher than those during the following wheat season as such the rice season exhibited much higher runoff coefficients relative to that of the wheat season moreover the runoff n losses also differed in various ways between the seasons as shown in fig 1 the rice seasonal cumulative tn loss ranged from 0 90 to 5 89 kg n ha 1 a value range somewhat lower than the wheat season s 1 73 6 63 kg n ha 1 however particularly significant is the fact that the reactive n forms in the runoff losses during the two seasons were nearly mirror opposites fig 2 there was 76 2 87 0 tn discharging in the form of nh4 n during the rice season except sn0 45 0 and 62 3 70 9 discharging in the form of no3 n during the wheat season changes of tn no3 n and nh4 n in each of the distinct treatments showed a similar trend between the two seasons figs 1 and 2 n discharged through runoff was distinctly affected by different straw retention modes and n fertilizer rates tn loads lost to runoff were significantly correlated with the n fertilizer input rate p 0 001 and the highest r 2 value 0 93 was obtained when the fitting curve was displayed in the quadratic parabola model figs 1 and 3a when considering the crop residue retention modes we found that the annual cumulative tn loss was ranked as follows n1 rn1 wn1 sn1 p 0 05 figs 1 and 3b the effect sizes showed that overall straw retention significantly decreased n runoff loads by 11 8 p 0 05 compared with the n1 treatment the reducing effect of sn1 and wn1 was 23 5 p 0 01 and 10 7 p 0 05 respectively yet rn1 showed no significant difference fig 3b these results indicate that straw retention can effectively decrease the external synthetic n source induced tn runoff loss furthermore in a double cropping system a single season s straw retention was less effective than that of a double season in reducing tn discharging load five years of straw return and n application substantially increased the crop yield table 1 the sn0 treatment showed the lowest significant yields during both the rice and wheat seasons the highest crop yields were obtained from the sn2 treatment which depicted a mean annual output nearly double that of the sn0 treatment p 0 05 a positive relationship was observed between the annual n input rate and crop yield fig 3a the rice and wheat productions varied among distinct straw return modes table 1 with a mean annual crop yield trend as follows sn1 rn1 wn1 n1 p 0 05 these results imply that when both environmental and economic variables are considered sn1 is the optimal straw retention practice 3 2 n dynamics in standing water during rice season n concentration dynamics in the paddy standing water were closely observed throughout the whole rice growing season in order to determine the specific processes facilitated by residue return practices consistent with runoff loss results during the rice season the form of nh4 n comprised the largest proportion 81 8 of the tn concentration and also displayed a similar variation tendency with tn fig 4 in general average concentrations of no3 n nh4 n and tn peaked just short of two days after each urea application although the effect was more obvious for the latter two indicators moreover although the n fertilizer was applied with a 4 2 4 ratio for the first second and third fertilization the n concentration except no3 n which was so low and undetectable was obviously at its lowest value during the first base fertilization stage across all treatments fig 4 variance analysis of n concentrations in the standing water was further conducted among the different fertilization stages table 2 results showed that the average tn content was ranked sn2 n1 rn1 sn1 wn1 sn0 throughout the whole rice growth period p 0 05 this trend is almost identical to the n dynamics during the base and tiller fertilizer stages but is not as applicable to the panicle stage for instance when straw return was applied with an equivalent input of n fertilizer the tn content of the straw return treatments sn1 wn1 and rn1 was lower than that of the n1 treatment p 0 05 during the base and tiller fertilizer stages however that trend was reversed during the panicle stage these results demonstrate that after incorporating straw a decrease in n loss occurred during the early base and tiller stages which exceed the increasing effect observed during the panicle stage 3 3 response of n runoff losses to soil factors under straw retention soil samples from the tillering stage were selected to further identify differences in soil characteristics and their direct and indirect influences on n runoff loss risks among distinct treatments table 3 however prior to rice transplanting the soc was found to be significantly higher for straw return treatments as compared with the n1 treatment other factors e g ap ak ph and ec showed relatively less differentiation table s3 moreover the soc sn ap ak and ec increased while ph decreased in parallel with the progression of rice development after straw retention and fertilization when soil properties more importantly differed markedly among treatments tables 3 and s3 for instance during the tillering stage the sin soc sn and ec content were enriched in response to an increasing rate of n fertilizer under straw incorporation whereas ap ak and ph reduced when compared with the n1 treatment other modes of straw return wn1 rn1 and particularly sn1 increased the soc and soil nutrients including sin sn ap and ak sem analysis fig 5 table 4 further indicated the direct and indirect effects of key soil factors on n runoff loss 79 4 of which was explained by the final model generally sin r d 0 47 note r represents the standardized direct d and indirect i regression weight coefficients exhibited the maximum positive coefficient directly impacting the n runoff loss and also contributed to increasing the n loss by mediating soil ph r i 0 66 however that positive effect was surpassed by the joint negative effects of soc and ph soc directly r d 0 54 and indirectly r i 0 12 influenced the n runoff losses by mediating soil ph r 0 30 while only a direct negative effect was found for ph r d 0 28 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of n runoff losses results from this study have shown that the critical period for n loss occurs after each fertilizer application however it s important to note that the amount of n transported through runoff or leaching is largely dependent on the fertilization regime bah et al 2020 and climatic conditions pandey et al 2018 for instance regular irrigation saturated the soil during the rice season which restricted lateral percolation by comparison during the wheat season soil properties did not favor runoff formation and thus exhibited a lower runoff coefficient although the observed n runoff load showed little difference between two seasons more importantly the detected n concentration maintained a relatively high level for approximately five days after each fertilization fig 4 a period that is referred to as the risky stage by environmental scientists tian et al 2007 zhao et al 2012 when this high concentration coincides with a heavy rainfall event the runoff inevitably carries a large amount of n which has been observed in paddy soils kim et al 2006 zhang et al 2018 in the current study runoff occurred only once during the risky stage throughout the two season s rotation rice and wheat the incident took place two days after tiller fertilization on july 6th 2018 and corresponds to the much higher runoff and the sudden large increase observed in table s2 and fig 1 therefore precautions should be taken to prevent torrential rain from impacting the area shortly after fertilization different forms of n loss were recognized as complex processes associated with plant and soil factors in this study more than half of the tn was lost from the paddy field in the form of nh4 while the form of no3 n was dominant during the wheat season these results are consistent with the reported studies tian et al 2007 yang et al 2013b cao et al 2017 krupa et al 2011 the changes between the different n forms in standing water elucidated the runoff characteristics during the rice season to begin with the aid of urease urea was immediately transformed into nh4 n whereas the anoxic paddy field remained in a reduction state which made it difficult for nitrification to occur yang et al 2013b the small quantity of generated no3 n was needed for rice growth and microbial activities zhang et al 2019 which led to even lower levels of no3 n in both the floodwater and surface runoff with respect to the wheat season although a high concentration of nh4 n was formed at the very beginning after each fertilization yang et al 2015b its movement was limited due to its strong affinity for negatively charged soil particles via cation exchange absorption zhao et al 2012 contrary to what was observed during the rice season suitable moisture and good aeration resulted in more nitrification and less denitrification during wheat production cao et al 2014 tan et al 2015 a large amount of no3 n accumulated in the soil profile and was subjected to transport and loss due to its high solubility in water wang et al 2015b 4 2 responses of n runoff loss risks crop yield and soil factors to straw retention when the location was taken into account considerable differences in n runoff losses were attributed to soil properties and climatic conditions pandey et al 2018 however application of appropriate organic matter supplement was successful in reducing n runoff losses and increasing crop yield linquist et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 shi and schulin 2018 in this study a significant positive relationship was observed between n application and crop yield which is consistent with numerous previous studies zhao et al 2015 xia et al 2016 however n runoff loss increased in a quadratic parabolic pattern as the quantity of n fertilizer increased under straw return therefore minimizing n application to the smallest practical concentration is critical for reducing environmental costs without sacrificing grain yield chen et al 2014a moreover during the rice season under a n fertilization rate of 300 kg ha 1 tn runoff loss was 5 89 kg n ha 1 significantly lower than xia s xia et al 2016 and wang s wang et al 2018 2014 measurements of 27 2 kg n ha 1 and 13 83 kg n ha 1 respectively in the lower reaches of the yangtze river similar n loss results were also observed from n leaching across different areas with the same n application treatments which was attributed to the soil n transformation characteristics wang et al 2015b for instance a significant positive relationship between gross nitrification rate and cumulative no3 n loss via runoff has been reported wang et al 2015a this result demonstrated that soil n losses were most likely driven by enhanced autotrophic nitrification following n fertilizer application this premise was also strongly supported by our findings that the sin which serves as a substrate in the nitrification process was enhanced following an incremental increase in n input and was positively correlated with n runoff loss although physical and chemical gradients in agricultural soils are known to be dependent on crop growth and development over time krause et al 2010 their differentiation was found to be significant after straw return and fertilization in the present study we observed increasing trends for all the assessed soil chemical factors soc sn sin ap and ak both for straw return treatments compared with n1 treatment and after fertilization and straw return compared with preceding the rice season which is consistent with the findings of most previous studies smith et al 2007 powlson et al 2008 this pattern was anticipated given the periodic supply of exogenous fertilizer and crop residue in conjunction with the amplified microbial activity that is associated with high accumulation and consumption of critical nutrients malhi et al 2011 more importantly extra attention should be paid to the returning crop residues which was a critical factor in reducing n runoff losses both in the current and many other past studies cao et al 2017 feng et al 2018 li et al 2017 wang et al 2015a xia et al 2016 xu et al 2000 zhao et al 2018c on one hand residue return can increase the water infiltration rate while enhancing soil quality blanco canqui et al 2006 in response the increased n retention ability diminishes solute percolation and transportation blanco canqui et al 2007 thereby declining n loss through hydrological pathways on the other hand crop residues have also been reported to regulate the amount of plant available n by influencing the soil biochemical process n transformation dynamics thus they affect plant production and prevent n loss from the soils wang et al 2015b zhao et al 2018a 2018b for example we discovered that residues reduced n lost from standing water during the base and tiller fertilization stages in addition the soc and ph as affected by straw return also generated a negative influence on n runoff loss researchers found that during the early stage after incorporating organic matter the residues high c n ratio promoted immobilization of inorganic n which temporarily surpassed the inorganic n released from their decomposition trinsoutrot et al 2000 nicolardot et al 2001 the increasing soc content enhanced the cation exchange capacity that prevents n loss particularly in the form of nh4 and improved the capacity to retain the active no3 due to deprotonated carboxyl groups blanco canqui and lal 2009 furthermore 15n tracing studies reveal that microbial activity was promoted by straw application which stimulated the gross nh4 immobilization process wang et al 2015b moreover dnra a no3 consumption pathway that converts no3 to more stable n pools was responsible for the soil retaining no3 and reducing its loss following organic fertilizer application overall the net mineralization rate decreased zhao et al 2018a and thus led to mitigation of n loss risks further direct evidence between n loss and specific n transformation process need to be established it is worth noting that tn runoff loss decreased due to single and double seasons of straw incorporation in one year of rice wheat rotation although the latter practice produced the most significant results specifically the wn1 treatment was more effective in reducing n loss than rn1 despite the fact that the latter was subjected to a significantly higher annual rate of straw return as mentioned previously crucial evidence consists of the fact that more microbial n was observed mooshammer et al 2014 reichel et al 2018 and higher gross nh4 n and no3 n immobilization rates cheng et al 2012 zhao et al 2018a were closely associated with the residues higher c n ratio like wheat straw in this study however the high c n ratio incorporated straw may have led to larger gross n mineralization rates due to the relationship between soil microbial biomass and the priming effects blagodatskaya and kuzyakov 2008 the stimulatory effects of straw retention on ammonium anaerobic oxidation anammox activity also had the potential to cause n losses zhu et al 2011 yang et al 2015a li et al 2016 2018 thus further study is needed to understand the unique behavior of straw return practices on n transformation rates and microbial community structure associated with soil n cycling 5 conclusions the results of this two year field experiment show that five consecutive years of straw retention significantly reduces runoff n losses and increases crop yield even though they both increased as a function of increasing synthetic n input rate the n runoff loss characteristics largely differed between the rice and wheat seasons crop residues were effective in reducing n runoff lost from the standing water during the early rice growth stage basal and tiller fertilization and soil sin soc and ph during the rice tillering stage were responsible for this effect the recommended straw return practice is double seasons of straw incorporation with 240 and 200 kg n ha 1 fertilizer for rice and wheat respectively in a year cycle of rice wheat rotation more research is required to directly examine the relationship of straw retention with n transformation rates and associated microbial communities across n cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10193,crop residue retention has been established as an effective conservation tillage practice for decreasing nitrogen n runoff losses and increasing crop production however the impacts on n runoff

significantly increased as the n fertilizer rate increased with respect to crop residue retention modes the cumulative tn loss and mean annual crop yield trends were n1 rn1 wn1 sn1 p 0 05 and sn1 rn1 wn1 n1 p 0 05 respectively during a one year rice wheat rotation cycle the treatments with simultaneous incorporation of crop residue and n fertilizer reduced n runoff loss by 2 7 20 9 p 0 05 and increased crop yield by 8 7 16 9 p 0 05 of which the sn1 treatment was found to be the most effective the straw induced reducing effect occurred only during the base and tiller fertilization stages of the rice growing period which was primarily regulated by soil inorganic nitrogen sin soil organic carbon soc and ph during the rice tiller stage our findings indicate that straw return decreases n runoff loss by mediating factors in soil and standing water in order to reduce n runoff loss without jeopardizing crop yield the practice of double seasons straw retention with recommended n

paddy soil 1 introduction each year 67 8 million tonnes of synthetic nitrogen n is applied to agricultural systems worldwide liu et al 2010 while supplemental n is critical for increasing the

buckley and carney 2013 yang et al 2013a hence exploration of alternative practices that both increase crop production and reduce n runoff loss is pivotal for maintaining the required food supply at a minimal environmental cost a comprehensive statistical analysis of worldwide n loss prevention and control measures from 1957 to the present demonstrated that controlling n emission sources is the most effective n loss prevention measure zhang et al 2016 changing the fertilizer type and optimizing the amount were shown to effectively decrease n runoff loss from their sources in addition substituting organic matter for mineral fertilizers reduces active n losses by regulating crop n utilization and soil n transformations banerjee et al 2002 xue et al 2014 thus this method can facilitate better synchronization between the n supply and the crop s n demand edmeades 2003 chen et al 2014b thereby reducing n losses gu et al 2016 crop residue retention is a unique organic tillage

huygens et al 2007 2008 previous studies have confirmed that partially substituting crop straw for synthetic n fertilizers can increase crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency nue while simultaneously decreasing n runoff loss wang et al 2012 2015b zhang et al 2019 however substantial n flow estimation or prediction errors are prone to occur with insufficient monitoring frequency moreover large n loss rate differences were observed under straw return from different studies even with the same amount of n fertilizer application xia et al 2016 wang et al 2018 clearly the characteristics and effectiveness of different straw retention practices on n loss are not well understood and therefore the optimal straw return practice i e the practice that reduces most of the n runoff losses while simultaneously ensuring a relative high yield has not been determined herein we subjected a rice wheat rotation system to a 5 year straw incorporation program then examined the efficiency of crop retention modes with different n fertilizer levels on mitigating n loss risks over a two year period our objectives were to 1 quantify the n runoff losses and crop yields under different straw retention practices during rice wheat seasons and 2 investigate the characteristics of n dynamics in standing water during the rice season as well as the features affected by soil factors under n and straw application 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiment was conducted in jiangsu province at changshu agro ecological experimental station 31 32 93 n 120 41 88 e a member station of the chinese ecosystem research network cern at the chinese academy of sciences the site is located in the yangtze delta region a typical annual rice wheat rotation growing area in china and is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 23 7 ºc and 10 years mean annual precipitation 2008 2017 of 1049 6 mm the mean daily temperature and precipitation during the 2018 rice wheat growing seasons are shown in fig s1 the site soil is classified as anthrosol which is a gleyed paddy soil derived from lacustrine sediments the following major soil properties were determined from top layer samples at a depth of 0 15 cm ph 7 19 soil water 1 2 5 organic matter content 40 24 g kg 1 total n 2 35 g kg 1 available p 29 9 mg kg 1 and available k

input of pk fertilizer were selected for investigating n runoff losses for two consecutive years 2017 2019 and consisted of 1 n1 no straw return n fertilizer 440 kg ha 1 year 1 2 sn0 double straw return rice and wheat in the rice and wheat growing seasons of the one year rotation respectively n fertilizer 0 3 sn1 double straw return n fertilizer 440 kg ha 1 year 1 4 sn2 double straw return n fertilizer 550 kg ha 1 year 1 5 wn1 wheat straw return only during the rice season n fertilizer 440 kg ha 1 year 1 and 6 rn1 rice straw return only during the wheat season n fertilizer 440 kg ha 1 year 1 the treatments were designed to reflect different combined n fertilizer applications and crop residues i e different straw return modes n1 wn1 rn1 and sn1 and straw return with different n input rates sn0 sn1 and sn2 the six treatments were arranged as a randomized complete block design with three 43 7 m2 replicate plots per treatment the plots had their own respective water inlet and outlet and were separated by 20 cm wide soil ridges which were covered with a plastic film to reduce water and fertilizer flow and lateral infiltration the crop rotation system was a yearly rice wheat double cropping system winter wheat and summer rice nanjing 46 oryza sativa l and yangmai 16 triticum aestivum l were used for summer rice and winter wheat respectively rice is usually transplanted on june 18th 20th and harvested on october 28th november 5th in each year while wheat is sown around november 10th and harvested around may 25th during the rice season flooding conditions were maintained after the rice plant sprouted leaves and the standing water layer was kept at a 3 5 cm depth lower than the drainage pipe outlet except during the late tillering stage and approximately two weeks before harvest during the wheat season no irrigation was applied since the precipitation usually provides enough water for normal wheat growth as shown in table s1 the synthetic n fertilizer in the form of urea was split into 40 basal fertilizer 20 tiller fertilizer and 40 panicle fertilizer and applied during both the summer rice and winter wheat season phosphorus in the form of calcium superphosphate was applied as basal fertilizer in both seasons potassium in the form of potassium chloride was split into 50 basal fertilizer and 50 panicle fertilizer and applied in both seasons the same amount of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied in all the treatments after harvesting the rice and wheat straw were chopped into pieces with 5 10 cm in length and fully rotary incorporated into corresponding plots before the next crop transplantation eighteen cubic concrete tanks 1 5 m 1 2 m 1 2 m were built beside the field to collect runoff from each plot which was delivered through a piping system there were two pipe water level holes in each field plot to accommodate the distinct water regimes during the rice and wheat season fig s2 the upper one was positioned 7 cm above the ground surface to collect runoff during the rice season and the lower one was located 12 cm under ground for collecting inter flow and surface runoff from middle field drain ditch during the wheat season generally during the rice season the paddy field s average irrigation depth is 4 cm the standard for heavy rain is 2 5 5 0 cm d based on the runoff generated by heavy rain so during rainfall the threshold for possible runoff is 3 cm therefore a depth of 7 cm is a reasonable overflow height during the rice season moreover the drainage ditch depth in the wheat season is 10 12 cm so the drainage outlet depth was set as 12 cm 2 3 water and soil sampling consistent with local practice rice was irrigated intermittently using water from the nearby river while wheat depended mainly on rain during the 2017 and 2018 rice seasons at the beginning ten days after each fertilization for every two days standing water in the field was collected about 100 ml from randomly chosen locations in each plot the sampling frequency was then changed to once a week once every two weeks and finally once a month note that this measurement was only made during the rice season as standing water was not permitted during the wheat season from the 2018 rice to 2019 wheat season the water depth in each collection tank was recorded after each runoff producing rainfall event then the runoff in each tank was carefully mixed and sampled using a 100 ml sterile polyethylene bottle to prepare for the next runoff collection the remaining water was discharged and the tank was cleaned soil samples at a depth of 0 15 cm were collected before rice transplanting and straw return implementation as well as during the rice tillering stage i e on may 20 2018 and july 10 2018 respectively six cores 5 cm in diameter were randomly sampled in each plot individually mixed and then gently passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove large roots and gravel a portion of each soil sample was stored at 4 ºc to air dry for subsequent chemical analysis crop yields were measured for each treatment by harvesting three 2 m2 areas from each plot after the rice and wheat had ripened 2 4 chemical analysis all the collected water samples were immediately delivered to the laboratory stored in a 4 ºc refrigerator and analyzed within 24 h two thirds of every sample was filtered through 0 45 µm membranes and assayed for nitrate n no3 n and ammonium n nh4 n concentration the unfiltered part was retained for tn concentration analysis tn and no3 n were determined using alkaline potassium persulfate oxidation ultraviolet spectrometry and dual wavelength ultra violet spectrometry 220 nm and 275 nm respectively committee of analytical method of water and wastewater 2002 nh4 n was determined using the indophenol blue method rayment and higginson 1992 soil ph and electrical conductivity ec were ascertained with a soil to water ratio of 1 2 5 and 1 5 respectively soil moisture was obtained by oven drying a portion of the sample at 105 c for 12 h soil inorganic nitrogen sin including nh4 no3 and no2 was extracted with 2 m kcl then measured using a continuous flow analyzer aaa3 bran and luebbe norderstedt germany soil organic matter som was analyzed using the k2cr2o7 oxidation method bao 2000 while soil total nitrogen sn was determined using the semi micro kjeldahl digestion method lu 2000 soil available phosphorous ap was extracted using sodium bicarbonate and then measured using the molybdenum blue method and soil available potassium ak was measured using a flame photometer 2 5 statistical calculation and analysis the volume v of runoff and loss flux q of various forms of water were calculated as follows 1 v i l d i s 1000 2 q i kg ha 1 i 1 n c i v i 43

likelihood estimation reml the n1 treatment effective value was used as the intercept and other straw retention modes were compared with the modified benchmark the straw return treatments response was significant if the 95 confidence interval ci did not overlap with zero luo et al 2006 structural equation modelling sem was also conducted to evaluate the direct and indirect relationships of soil physicochemical factors with n runoff loss and the observed variables standard total effects were calculated schermelleh engel et al 2003 delgado baquerizo et al 2016 3 results 3 1 n runoff losses and crop yields during rice wheat production runoff showed seasonal variation over a year of rice wheat rotation table s2 during the rice season the total rainfall and particularly the runoff for all the treatments were higher than those during the following wheat season as such the rice season exhibited much higher runoff coefficients relative to that of the wheat season moreover the runoff n losses also differed in various ways between the seasons as shown in fig 1 the rice seasonal cumulative tn loss ranged from 0 90 to 5 89 kg n ha 1 a value range somewhat lower than the wheat season s 1 73 6 63 kg n ha 1 however particularly significant is the fact that the reactive n forms in the runoff losses during the two seasons were nearly mirror opposites fig 2 there was 76 2 87 0 tn discharging in the form of nh4 n during the rice season except sn0 45 0 and 62 3 70 9 discharging in the form of no3 n during the wheat season changes of tn no3 n and nh4 n in each of the distinct treatments showed a similar trend between the two seasons figs 1 and 2 n discharged through runoff was distinctly affected by different straw retention modes and n fertilizer rates tn loads lost to runoff were significantly correlated with the n fertilizer input rate p 0 001 and the highest r 2 value 0 93 was obtained when the fitting curve was displayed in the quadratic parabola model figs 1 and 3a when considering the crop residue retention modes we found that the annual cumulative tn loss was ranked as follows n1 rn1 wn1 sn1 p 0 05 figs 1 and 3b the effect sizes showed that overall straw retention significantly decreased n runoff loads by 11 8 p 0 05 compared with the n1 treatment the reducing effect of sn1 and wn1 was 23 5 p 0 01 and 10 7 p 0 05 respectively yet rn1 showed no significant difference fig 3b these results indicate that straw retention can effectively decrease the external synthetic n source induced tn runoff loss furthermore in a double cropping system a single season s straw retention was less effective than that of a double season in reducing tn discharging load five years of straw return and n application substantially increased the crop yield table 1 the sn0 treatment showed the lowest significant yields during both the rice and wheat seasons the highest crop yields were obtained from the sn2 treatment which depicted a mean annual output nearly double that of the sn0 treatment p 0 05 a positive relationship was observed between the annual n input rate and crop yield fig 3a the rice and wheat productions varied among distinct straw return modes table 1 with a mean annual crop yield trend as follows sn1 rn1 wn1 n1 p 0 05 these results imply that when both environmental and economic variables are considered sn1 is the optimal straw retention practice 3 2 n dynamics in standing water during rice season n concentration dynamics in the paddy standing water were closely observed throughout the whole rice growing season in order to determine the specific processes facilitated by residue return practices consistent with runoff loss results during the rice season the form of nh4 n comprised the largest proportion 81 8 of the tn concentration and also displayed a similar variation tendency with tn fig 4 in general average concentrations of no3 n nh4 n and tn peaked just short of two days after each urea application although the effect was more obvious for the latter two indicators moreover although the n fertilizer was applied with a 4 2 4 ratio for the first second and third fertilization the n concentration except no3 n which was so low and undetectable was obviously at its lowest value during the first base fertilization stage across all treatments fig 4 variance analysis of n concentrations in the standing water was further conducted among the different fertilization stages table 2 results showed that the average tn content was ranked sn2 n1 rn1 sn1 wn1 sn0 throughout the whole rice growth period p 0 05 this trend is almost identical to the n dynamics during the base and tiller fertilizer stages but is not as applicable to the panicle stage for instance when straw return was applied with an equivalent input of n fertilizer the tn content of the straw return treatments sn1 wn1 and rn1 was lower than that of the n1 treatment p 0 05 during the base and tiller fertilizer stages however that trend was reversed during the panicle stage these results demonstrate that after incorporating straw a decrease in n loss occurred during the early base and tiller stages which exceed the increasing effect observed during the panicle stage 3 3 response of n runoff losses to soil factors under straw retention soil samples from the tillering stage were selected to further identify differences in soil characteristics and their direct and indirect influences on n runoff loss risks among distinct treatments table 3 however prior to rice transplanting the soc was found to be significantly higher for straw return treatments as compared with the n1 treatment other factors e g ap ak ph and ec showed relatively less differentiation table s3 moreover the soc sn ap ak and ec increased while ph decreased in parallel with the progression of rice development after straw retention and fertilization when soil properties more importantly differed markedly among treatments tables 3 and s3 for instance during the tillering stage the sin soc sn and ec content were enriched in response to an increasing rate of n fertilizer under straw incorporation whereas ap ak and ph reduced when compared with the n1 treatment other modes of straw return wn1 rn1 and particularly sn1 increased the soc and soil nutrients including sin sn ap and ak sem analysis fig 5 table 4 further indicated the direct and indirect effects of key soil factors on n runoff loss 79 4 of which was explained by the final model generally sin r d 0 47 note r represents the standardized direct d and indirect i regression weight coefficients exhibited the maximum positive coefficient directly impacting the n runoff loss and also contributed to increasing the n loss by mediating soil ph r i 0 66 however that positive effect was surpassed by the joint negative effects of soc and ph soc directly r d 0 54 and indirectly r i 0 12 influenced the n runoff losses by mediating soil ph r 0 30 while only a direct negative effect was found for ph r d 0 28 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of n runoff losses results from this study have shown that the critical period for n loss occurs after each fertilizer application however it s important to note that the amount of n transported through runoff or leaching is largely dependent on the fertilization regime bah et al 2020 and climatic conditions pandey et al 2018 for instance regular irrigation saturated the soil during the rice season which restricted lateral percolation by comparison during the wheat season soil properties did not favor runoff formation and thus exhibited a lower runoff coefficient although the observed n runoff load showed little difference between two seasons more importantly the detected n concentration maintained a relatively high level for approximately five days after each fertilization fig 4 a period that is referred to as the risky stage by environmental scientists tian et al 2007 zhao et al 2012 when this high concentration coincides with a heavy rainfall event the runoff inevitably carries a large amount of n which has been observed in paddy soils kim et al 2006 zhang et al 2018 in the current study runoff occurred only once during the risky stage throughout the two season s rotation rice and wheat the incident took place two days after tiller fertilization on july 6th 2018 and corresponds to the much higher runoff and the sudden large increase observed in table s2 and fig 1 therefore precautions should be taken to prevent torrential rain from impacting the area shortly after fertilization different forms of n loss were recognized as complex processes associated with plant and soil factors in this study more than half of the tn was lost from the paddy field in the form of nh4 while the form of no3 n was dominant during the wheat season these results are consistent with the reported studies tian et al 2007 yang et al 2013b cao et al 2017 krupa et al 2011 the changes between the different n forms in standing water elucidated the runoff characteristics during the rice season to begin with the aid of urease urea was immediately transformed into nh4 n whereas the anoxic paddy field remained in a reduction state which made it difficult for nitrification to occur yang et al 2013b the small quantity of generated no3 n was needed for rice growth and microbial activities zhang et al 2019 which led to even lower levels of no3 n in both the floodwater and surface runoff with respect to the wheat season although a high concentration of nh4 n was formed at the very beginning after each fertilization yang et al 2015b its movement was limited due to its strong affinity for negatively charged soil particles via cation exchange absorption zhao et al 2012 contrary to what was observed during the rice season suitable moisture and good aeration resulted in more nitrification and less denitrification during wheat production cao et al 2014 tan et al 2015 a large amount of no3 n accumulated in the soil profile and was subjected to transport and loss due to its high solubility in water wang et al 2015b 4 2 responses of n runoff loss risks crop yield and soil factors to straw retention when the location was taken into account considerable differences in n runoff losses were attributed to soil properties and climatic conditions pandey et al 2018 however application of appropriate organic matter supplement was successful in reducing n runoff losses and increasing crop yield linquist et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 shi and schulin 2018 in this study a significant positive relationship was observed between n application and crop yield which is consistent with numerous previous studies zhao et al 2015 xia et al 2016 however n runoff loss increased in a quadratic parabolic pattern as the quantity of n fertilizer increased under straw return therefore minimizing n application to the smallest practical concentration is critical for reducing environmental costs without sacrificing grain yield chen et al 2014a moreover during the rice season under a n fertilization rate of 300 kg ha 1 tn runoff loss was 5 89 kg n ha 1 significantly lower than xia s xia et al 2016 and wang s wang et al 2018 2014 measurements of 27 2 kg n ha 1 and 13 83 kg n ha 1 respectively in the lower reaches of the yangtze river similar n loss results were also observed from n leaching across different areas with the same n application treatments which was attributed to the soil n transformation characteristics wang et al 2015b for instance a significant positive relationship between gross nitrification rate and cumulative no3 n loss via runoff has been reported wang et al 2015a this result demonstrated that soil n losses were most likely driven by enhanced autotrophic nitrification following n fertilizer application this premise was also strongly supported by our findings that the sin which serves as a substrate in the nitrification process was enhanced following an incremental increase in n input and was positively correlated with n runoff loss although physical and chemical gradients in agricultural soils are known to be dependent on crop growth and development over time krause et al 2010 their differentiation was found to be significant after straw return and fertilization in the present study we observed increasing trends for all the assessed soil chemical factors soc sn sin ap and ak both for straw return treatments compared with n1 treatment and after fertilization and straw return compared with preceding the rice season which is consistent with the findings of most previous studies smith et al 2007 powlson et al 2008 this pattern was anticipated given the periodic supply of exogenous fertilizer and crop residue in conjunction with the amplified microbial activity that is associated with high accumulation and consumption of critical nutrients malhi et al 2011 more importantly extra attention should be paid to the returning crop residues which was a critical factor in reducing n runoff losses both in the current and many other past studies cao et al 2017 feng et al 2018 li et al 2017 wang et al 2015a xia et al 2016 xu et al 2000 zhao et al 2018c on one hand residue return can increase the water infiltration rate while enhancing soil quality blanco canqui et al 2006 in response the increased n retention ability diminishes solute percolation and transportation blanco canqui et al 2007 thereby declining n loss through hydrological pathways on the other hand crop residues have also been reported to regulate the amount of plant available n by influencing the soil biochemical process n transformation dynamics thus they affect plant production and prevent n loss from the soils wang et al 2015b zhao et al 2018a 2018b for example we discovered that residues reduced n lost from standing water during the base and tiller fertilization stages in addition the soc and ph as affected by straw return also generated a negative influence on n runoff loss researchers found that during the early stage after incorporating organic matter the residues high c n ratio promoted immobilization of inorganic n which temporarily surpassed the inorganic n released from their decomposition trinsoutrot et al 2000 nicolardot et al 2001 the increasing soc content enhanced the cation exchange capacity that prevents n loss particularly in the form of nh4 and improved the capacity to retain the active no3 due to deprotonated carboxyl groups blanco canqui and lal 2009 furthermore 15n tracing studies reveal that microbial activity was promoted by straw application which stimulated the gross nh4 immobilization process wang et al 2015b moreover dnra a no3 consumption pathway that converts no3 to more stable n pools was responsible for the soil retaining no3 and reducing its loss following organic fertilizer application overall the net mineralization rate decreased zhao et al 2018a and thus led to mitigation of n loss risks further direct evidence between n loss and specific n transformation process need to be established it is worth noting that tn runoff loss decreased due to single and double seasons of straw incorporation in one year of rice wheat rotation although the latter practice produced the most significant results specifically the wn1 treatment was more effective in reducing n loss than rn1 despite the fact that the latter was subjected to a significantly higher annual rate of straw return as mentioned previously crucial evidence consists of the fact that more microbial n was observed mooshammer et al 2014 reichel et al 2018 and higher gross nh4 n and no3 n immobilization rates cheng et al 2012 zhao et al 2018a were closely associated with the residues higher c n ratio like wheat straw in this study however the high c n ratio incorporated straw may have led to larger gross n mineralization rates due to the relationship between soil microbial biomass and the priming effects blagodatskaya and kuzyakov 2008 the stimulatory effects of straw retention on ammonium anaerobic oxidation anammox activity also had the potential to cause n losses zhu et al 2011 yang et al 2015a li et al 2016 2018 thus further study is needed to understand the unique behavior of straw return practices on n transformation rates and microbial community structure associated with soil n cycling 5 conclusions the results of this two year field experiment show that five consecutive years of straw retention significantly reduces runoff n losses and increases crop yield even though they both increased as a function of increasing synthetic n input rate the n runoff loss characteristics largely differed between the rice and wheat seasons crop residues were effective in reducing n runoff lost from the standing water during the early rice growth stage basal and tiller fertilization and soil sin soc and ph during the rice tillering stage were responsible for this effect the recommended straw return practice is double seasons of straw incorporation with 240 and 200 kg n ha 1 fertilizer for rice and wheat respectively in a year cycle of rice wheat rotation more research is required to directly examine the relationship of straw retention with n transformation rates and associated microbial communities across n cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10194,treated wastewater tww reuse for crop irrigation has been developing in recent decades in areas hampered by severe water shortages however in humid conditions the agronomic impacts of supplementary irrigation are less and poorly documented on the island of réunion we measured sugarcane yield and quality on a nitisol over 2 years by providing 2600 mm of tww or irrigation water control as a supplement to the 3500 mm rainfall meanwhile with the same tww irrigation water iw and rainfall inputs we monitored leachates and soil under controlled conditions without plants sugarcane yield brix degree fiber and sucrose contents were similar between the tww and control plots each year the leachate ph and electrical conductivity at 60 cm depth showed marked differences between the tww and control modalities similarly after a constant increase in chloride sulfate potassium and sodium contents or breakthrough curves for calcium and magnesium the concentrations of these elements under the tww modality were stable from 12 pore volumes pv except for calcium which was stable from 16 pv at the end of the experiment the hydraulic conductivity and organic carbon contents did not show any significant change while the ph of soils that had received tww and of the control soil was higher overall than the ph of the initial soil the dynamics of the major elements in leachates at 65 cm depth were consistent with the input concentrations and the variations in exchangeable base contents in the soil at the end of the experiment however potassium and mineral nitrogen had accumulated in the soil profile while there were low concentrations in the leachate the tww quality and quantities provided uptake by plants competition for adsorption or leaching and the pedoclimatic context could therefore i explain the absence of negative agronomic impact and ii highlight the benefits of irrigation with tww in humid environments to supplement water requirements and fertilize intensive crops keywords réunion reuse complementary irrigation 1 introduction irrigation and organic fertilizer spreading are millennial agricultural practices contrary to wastewater reuse the global urban population has been increasing and densifying for more than a hundred years to the extent that it is now crucial to organize wastewater collection and treatment in sewage treatment plants before its release mainly into the aquatic environment irrigation with treated wastewater tww has long been limited due to the poor treatment efficiency to reduce the omnipresent microbiological risks toze 2006 pedrero et al 2010 further aggravated by the tww salinity and the presence of contaminants such as metallic and organic trace elements el moussaoui et al 2019 in developing countries irrigation with untreated or barely treated wastewater is sometimes a necessity to meet crop water and nutrient needs despite various risks of contamination qadir et al 2010 hodomihou et al 2016 however irrigation with tww has been developing in recent decades with the improvement of physicochemical biological and chemical treatment processes with clearcut benefits it is a complementary source of water that reduces pressure on other resources especially groundwater it is produced continuously throughout the year it contains nutrients essential for crops in turn generating economic benefits for farmers by reducing the need for fertilizers such as organic waste wassenaar et al 2014 irrigation with tww has a positive overall environmental impact yet it is currently mainly being developed in arid or semiarid regions where water deficits are commonplace elgallal et al 2016 the positive and negative environmental impacts of irrigation with tww depend on multiple factors with the main ones being the tww quality the type of soil and crop the climatic conditions and the tww agronomic management modalities irrigation with tww is mainly likely to modify the soil salinity levels mohammad and mazahreh

characteristics that irrigation with tww could modify iuss working group 2015 the sustainability of tww irrigation could thus be assessed by combined monitoring of variations in soil properties and leachates gloaguen et al 2007 tarchouna et al 2010 yet soil solution sampling techniques are still imperfect especially in the root zone irrigation with tww is increasingly being implemented in humid environments when annual rainfall is insufficient or very unequally distributed particularly with regard to water demanding non food crops that are not very susceptible to salinity irrigation with tww does not have an impact on crop yields in the short term compared to normal iw and equivalent fertilization disciglio et al 2015 gonçalves et al 2017 libutti et al 2018 elfanssi et al 2018 chaganti et al 2020 yields have been found to increase sometimes significantly when tww irrigation provided additional nutrients and water compared to the control sebastian et al 2009 leal et al 2010 minhas et al 2015 elfanssi et al 2018 whereas yields decrease when there are physical or chemical constraints libutti et al 2018 but these issues can be partially overcome via tww input management toze 2006 qadir et al 2010 elgallal et al 2016 in humid environments high rainfall or the possibility of irrigating crops with good quality water can curb some constraints especially salinity toze 2006 qadir et al 2010 even in the long term andrews et al 2016 in highly arid conditions irrigation may provide up to 90 of the water needs of sugarcane saccharum spp which makes it impossible to use tww sustainably yet optimal sugarcane yields cannot be achieved without supplementary irrigation in humid tropical environments where rainfall ranges from 2000 to 3000 mm irrigation with tww can therefore provide supplementary water as well as some or even all of the nutrients required during the growing season sugarcane irrigation with tww has not been found to decrease yields leal et al 2009 change the industrial characteristics braddock and downs 2001 gonçalves et al 2017 or impact germination and plant physiology sebastian et al 2009 nitrogen and phosphate leaching has been found to be low blum et al 2013 with little change in soil quality however in these studies the nutrient amounts applied and the volumes of irrigation or rainfall water were not equivalent this limits the generalization of these results studies on irrigation with tww have thus mainly been focused on the different environmental risks yield increases and production quality in arid and subarid environments the sustainability and pluriannual agronomic impacts of complementary irrigation of sugarcane with tww as a replacement for normal irrigation and fertilization on nitisols have yet to be investigated this study was aimed at assessing whether i water and nutrient inputs via tww could sustainably replace mineral fertilization associated with conventional irrigation without modifying sugarcane yield or quality ii irrigation with tww modifies the soil physical and chemical properties and iii the soil solution reaches equilibrium with tww we therefore planted a sugarcane crop in an experimental plot and monitored it for 2 years meanwhile we reproduced the same tww iw and rainwater inputs in soil columns in order to monitor the dynamics of water and solute fluxes over time independently of the crop intake 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site in réunion and the treated wastewater réunion is a french island located 800 km east of madagascar in the southern indian ocean region the main peak

plantation eight blocks of 7 5 m i e five rows of sugarcane by 6 m in length were set up in the center of the plot each block was spaced at 5 m distance from the others in the width direction and 3 m distance in the length direction four blocks were irrigated with tww and four control c blocks were irrigated with iw the blocks of each modality were distributed alternately so as not to be side by side drip irrigation was used and each irrigation line was separate and connected to its own 5 m3 tank equipped with a solenoid valve with volumetric measurement two annual sugarcane crops were grown consecutively 2010 2012 with the r579 variety for the two cumulative years the tww irrigation modality received 2600 mm of tww and 3500 mm of rainwater 1900 mm during the first year and 1600 mm during the second year while the control modality received 2600 mm of iw and 3500 mm of rainwater supporting information feder 2020 under reunion island conditions in order to achieve a yield of 80 t ha the

feder 2020 the tww modality received each year and per hectare the following fertilization 165 kg n 30 kg p and 315 kg k without any complementary fertilization each year at the beginning of the cycle the control modality received mineral fertilization equivalent to that provided by the tww modality 2 3 soil column experiment the device consisted of 8 pvc columns 100 cm high 60 cm of which were in the soil and 20 cm diameter the soil was reconstituted at the bulk density bd measured in the field bd 1 30 and in successive 10 cm layers corresponding to the layers sampled in situ the outlet was protected with a geotextile at the base the total volume in each column was 18 84 dm3 the pore volume ratio pvr was calculated for the column by the equation pvr 1 bd pd dimensionless with bd kg dm 3 corresponding to the bulk density measured in situ and pd kg dm 3 corresponding to the particle density pd 2 7 kg dm 3 for this soil applied to the total volume the calculated pore volume pv was then 9 77 dm3 and corresponded also to 311 mm for the column five columns received 2600 mm of tww and 3500 mm of rainwater three control columns c received 2600 mm of iw and 3500 mm of rainwater the total accumulated amounts of irrigation water tww or ir or rainwater were therefore equivalent in the soil columns and in the field during the experiments in order to ensure that the distribution of these different inputs was similar in the two experiments and in order to get closer to the field experiment conditions each input of ½ pv of tww or iw was alternated with an input of ½ pv of rainwater an additional ½ pv rainwater supply was conducted every 2 pv 2 4 soil water and plant analysis the initial soil analyses were performed on samples collected in situ from the 0 10 20 30 and 45 60 cm

comparison of means when the normality was not confirmed the factors were tested using non parametric methods such as the kruskal wallis test 3 results 3 1 effect of wastewater irrigation on sugarcane yield and quality sugarcane yields were similar between the tww and the control plots in the first and second years the average yield in the four tww plots was 85 mg ha 1 with peak yields of 80 and 97 mg ha 1 during the first year of sugarcane cultivation fig 1 the average yield in the four control plots was 88 mg ha 1 with peak yields of 80 and 94 mg ha 1 the average yield in the four tww plots was 109 mg ha 1 with peak yields of 98 and 117 mg ha 1 during the second year of sugarcane cultivation the average yield in the four control plots was 114 mg ha 1 with peak yields of 108 and 120 mg ha 1 the yield dispersion of the four replicates was always higher for the tww plots compared to the control plots but the yield differences were not significant for each year the first year of sugarcane cultivation showed lower average yields than the second year in both years nutrient inputs from tww or mineral fertilization irrigation rainfall and crop duration were similar but yields in the tww and control plots increased by 23 and 26 mg ha 1 respectively between the first and second year the main sugarcane industrial characteristics were similar between the tww and the control plots in the first and second years brix degrees measured postharvest in sugarcane juice were statistically identical when comparing sugarcane from the tww and control plots for the first and second year table 3 nevertheless brix degrees measured at harvest in the second year were significantly lower than in the first year for sugarcane from the tww and control plots sugarcane fiber contents were statistically similar when comparing sugarcane from the tww and control plots in the first and second years however fiber contents were statistically higher in the first year than in the second year for sugarcane from each of the tww and control plots sugarcane sucrose concentrations were statistically similar when comparing sugarcane from the tww and control plots and between the first and second year the brix degree corresponding to the total sugar was always higher than the sugarcane sucrose concentration for each year and for each modality the brix degree was 23 higher than the sucrose concentration for the tww and control plots in the first year but the brix degree was 21 higher than the sucrose concentration for the tww modality and 28 higher than the sucrose concentration for the control modality in the second year 3 2 solute transfers in soil at first we checked whether the experimental setup could closely reproduce flows that occur in the field by measuring the hydraulic conductivity on the column surfaces for each irrigation these measures ranged from 8 5 10 7 m s 1 to 1 4 10 6 m s 1 during the experiment for all the columns and were in line with the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured in situ with a permeameter ring at saturation 2 3 10 6 m s 1 the column hydraulic properties were similar and close to those of in situ soil the soil columns could thus accurately replicate the hydrodynamic behavior of in situ soil from 4 pore volumes pv the electrical conductivity of the leachate at the column outlet was constant and always lower than the average electrical conductivity of the input water fig 2 the average electrical conductivity of the tww input to the tww columns was 1 733 ms cm 1 at the tww column outlets the leachate electrical conductivity increased linearly from 2 pv and to 4 pv then from 4 pv the leachate electrical conductivity levelled off at 0 898 ms cm 1 range 4 20 pv the electrical conductivity of the iw supplied to the control columns was on average 0 130 ms cm 1 at the control column outlets the leachate electrical conductivity was always constant and averaged 0 07 ms cm 1 throughout the experiment from 3 pv upwards the electrical conductivity of leachates from the tww and control columns was always significantly different from 3 pv upwards the leachate ph at the tww column outlets was always significantly lower than that of the control columns fig 2 the ph of the tww supplied to the tww columns averaged 7 28 during the experiment table 2 at the tww column outlets the leachate ph decreased and then starting at 3 pv levelled off between 6 and 6 3 the ph of the iw supplied to the control columns averaged 7 65 during the experiment table 2 at the control column outlets the leachate ph was always constant between 6 4 and 6 7 from 3 pv to the end of the experiment the ph of the tww and control columns was always significantly different by about 0 5 units from 12 pv upwards the leachate chloride and sulfate concentrations at the tww column outlets were similar to the input concentrations in contrast to the nitrate and phosphate concentrations all concentrations of chemicals in solution were related to their measured tww concentration fig 3 a ratio of 1 thus means that the concentration at the outlet was similar to the average supplied tww concentration the breakthrough curve for chlorides in the leachate at the tww outlet showed an almost linear increase between 2 and 6 pv then reaching a maximum ratio of 1 4 between 6 and 8 pv then the ratio was between 0 75 and 0 9 from 12 pv to 20 pv in addition the breakthrough curve plotted for the leachate chloride concentrations at the control column outlet showed very little variation with a ratio of 0 09 3 pv and then the ratio was always below 0 03 from 5 pv upwards the breakthrough curve for leachate sulfates at the tww column outlets showed a quasi linear increase between 4 and 10 pv up to a maximum ratio of 0 87 then this ratio was between 0 87 and 0 74 up to 20 pv in addition throughout the experiment leachate sulfate concentrations at the control column outlet were constant and the ratio ranged from 0 08 to 0 1 on the other hand leachate nitrate concentrations at the column outlet were always low for the tww and control columns with a ratio of less than 0 2 and without significant differences phosphate concentrations always had a ratio of less than 0 02 with no significant differences between the tww and control columns the maxima of the leachate calcium and magnesium concentrations at the tww column outlets showed ratios close to 9 and 3 respectively on the breakthrough curve before becoming identical to the input concentrations the leachate calcium concentration at the tww outlet showed an almost linear increase from 2 to 5 pv on the breakthrough curve and then reached a maximum ratio of 8 95 at 8 pv the ratio then gradually decreased and from 17 pv onwards while ranging from 0 8 to 1 furthermore throughout the experiment the leachate calcium concentrations at the control column outlet were constant and the ratio ranged from 0 45 to 0 88 the leachate magnesium concentration at the outlet of the tww columns showed a quasi linear increase between 2 and 6 pv on the breakthrough curve then reaching a maximum ratio of 2 86 at 6 pv the ratio then gradually decreased and was between 0 69 and 0 9 from 13 pv onwards furthermore throughout the experiment the magnesium concentrations at the control column outlet were constant and the ratio was between 0 18 and 0 35 sodium and potassium leachate concentrations at the outlet of the tww columns showed the same dynamics but with different maximum ratios for the leachate sodium concentrations at the tww outlet initially the ratio increased slowly and linearly between 2 and 7 pv and reached a ratio of 0 15 then in a second step the ratio increased linearly from 8 pv to 14 pv and peaked at 0 86 at 12 pv then the ratio was between 0 66 and 0 8 from 13 pv to 20 pv in addition throughout the experiment the sodium concentrations in the leachate at the control column outlet were constant and the ratio ranged from 0 04 to 0 06 otherwise leachate potassium concentrations at the outlet of the tww columns reached a maximum ratio of 0 22 0 27 from 11 pv until the end of the experiment between 11 and 20 pv this ratio did not show an increasing trend moreover throughout the experiment potassium concentrations at the control column outlets were constant and the ratio was between 0 03 and 0 05 3 3 exchangeable cations extractable nitrogen organic carbon and ph in the soil at the end of the experiment exchangeable calcium and sodium concentrations varied substantially when comparing the initial and final soils of the tww and control columns exchangeable calcium decreased from 2 4 to 0 9 cmol c kg 1 in the surface horizon 0 20 cm depth between the initial and final soils of the tww and control columns respectively fig 4 on the other hand it increased from 0 8 to 1 3 cmol c kg 1 in the deep horizon 40 60 cm depth between the initial and final soils of the tww and control columns respectively exchangeable magnesium increased by 1 1 cmol c kg 1 in the surface horizon 0 10 cm depth when comparing the initial and final soils of the tww columns however there was no change in the control columns at this depth in the deep horizons 35 60 cm depth the exchangeable magnesium increased by 0 9 and 1 6 cmol c kg 1 between the initial and final soils of the tww and control columns respectively exchangeable potassium increased from 0 2 to 0 65 cmol c kg 1 in the surface horizon 0 20 cm depth between the initial and final soils in the tww columns while it remained unchanged in the control columns similarly it increased by about 0 2 cmol c kg 1 in the lower horizon 25 60 cm depth of the tww columns exchangeable sodium increased from 1 7 to 2 2 cmol c kg 1 throughout the entire column depth 0 60 cm when comparing the initial and final soils of the tww columns in contrast there was no change in exchangeable sodium concentration between the initial and final soils in the control columns throughout the full column depth 0 60 cm the mineral nitrogen corresponding to the sum of ammonium and nitrate extractable at 1 m kcl increased from 60 mg kg 1 to nearly 80 mg kg 1 in the surface horizon 0 20 cm depth between the initial and final soils in the tww columns a similar increase was observed in the surface layer 0 10 cm depth between the initial and final soils of the control columns the mineral nitrogen concentration was not modified between the initial and final soils in the control columns between 10 and 60 cm column depth in contrast the mineral nitrogen concentration increased significantly between the initial and final soil in the tww columns from 36 to 135 mg kg 1 20 30 cm 88 mg kg 1 30 40 cm and 59 mg kg 1 40 60 cm respectively the total cec followed the same dynamics as the exchangeable calcium concentration for the surface horizon 0 30 cm depth cec decreased by 1 2 cmol c kg 1 between the initial and final soils in the tww and control columns respectively on the other hand for the deep horizon 40 60 cm depth the total cec increased from 1 2 to 2 5 cmol c kg 1 between the initial and final soils of the control and tww columns respectively the base saturation rate increased from 5 to 20 throughout the entire column depth 0 60 cm when comparing the initial and final soils of the tww and control columns the increase was always more marked for the final soil of the tww columns except for the 50 60 cm depth horizon average organic carbon concentrations did not show significant changes they decreased by 0 25 g 100 g 1 in the surface horizon from 0 to 20 cm depth between the initial and final soils of the tww and control columns but not significantly however organic carbon concentrations in soils from the tww and control columns were similar to the initial soil concentrations for the 20 60 cm depth horizons in addition for all depths organic carbon concentrations between the final soil in the tww and control columns were highly reproducible the phw and phkcl of the soils in the tww and control columns were generally higher than the ph of the initial soil at the end of the experiment for all depths the phw of the tww and control column soils was higher than the phw of the original soil by 0 1 0 9 ph units respectively the differences in phw were most marked for the 0 10 cm layer and gradually decreased for the other depths from 0 1 to 0 4 ph units at the end of the experiment the phw of the soils in the tww and control columns was similar for the 20 60 cm depth horizons and was 0 2 ph units higher than in the initial soil 4 discussion 4 1 impact of treated wastewater on sugarcane yield and quality sugarcane yields were similar between the tww and control plots in the first and second year of this study the nutrients supplied by tww therefore generated the same yield as obtained with equivalent mineral fertilization in two consecutive years with equal rainfall and total water supply in the tww or iw plots conversely gonçalves et al 2017 do not observe an increase in sugarcane yield despite the additional nutrient supply by irrigation with tww compared to the control modality however their study was only carried out during one sugarcane crop cycle which hinders observation of any beneficial effects of the nutrient supply over several cycles however with normal iw sugarcane usually responds well to organic fertilization during the current crop cycle yields increase when nitrogen is supplied in mineral form or if it mineralizes quickly sebastian et al 2009 umesh et al 2013 yet leal et al 2010 observed an increase in sugarcane yield which they attribute to the increase in the amount of water supplied with tww with equal fertilization as their control modality was not irrigated but the aim of their study was not to evaluate the effects of short term tww irrigation on yield but rather on nitrogen uptake by sugarcane nitrogen and carbon accumulation in soil and nitrate leaching in addition sugarcane yields in the first year of cultivation were always lower in subsequent years due to the need for new root systems to develop leal et al 2010 gonçalves et al 2017 similarly braddock and downs 2001 found a 45 increase in yield when irrigating with tww but their findings were compared to a non irrigated modality these apparent contradictory results for sugarcane are not strictly comparable since the conditions were not identical especially with regard to fertilization and irrigation management moreover the differences could be attributed to indirect effects of irrigation with tww on yields especially when the tww is too saline or when the soils are sodic nelson and ham 2000 these depreciation effects are not always observed or measured or are hard to quantify finally in our study there were two minor differences between the tww and control modalities despite the identical nutrient intakes in both years first sugarcane mineral fertilization was applied during the first month of the crop for the control modality whereas fertilizers were applied during the plant cycle for 12 months under the tww modality this practice is poorly documented probably because the effects are minor a main reason is the similarity with the conventional organic fertilization piouceau et al 2020 with solid sewage sludge manure litter etc or liquid products methanation digestates slurries etc secondly as already observed during fertilization with pig slurry feder et al 2015 piouceau et al 2020 a fraction of the nitrogen provided by tww is organic thus not assimilable by sugarcane in this chemical form these forms of nitrogen must therefore be mineralized into bioavailable chemical forms finally since fertilization and irrigation conditions including rainfall were similar during the two years of our study we can attribute the increase in yields between the two years to climatological differences higher average temperatures and longer and more intense sunshine as well as to a better installation of the sugarcane root system in our study the rainfall level was 1900 mm during the first year and 1600 mm during the second year while tww or iw provided 1300 mm during the first and second year complementary irrigation with tww or iw thus represented 40 and 45 of the total water input rainfall and irrigation in the first and second years respectively this percentage of complementary irrigation is much lower in more arid situations with two to tenfold lower rainfall gloaguen et al 2010 ayoub et al 2016 paudel et al 2018 demonstrated the benefits of alternating tww inputs with better quality water to limit negative impacts on the soil and improve yields in lemon orchards moreover the hydrodynamic and geochemical properties of nitisols reduced the negative impact of tww due to the high clay content 56 in the surface horizon unlike many other tropical sugarcane soils such as oxisols sebastian et al 2009 gloaguen et al 2010 which have a sandy texture for other types of crops with identical mineral fertilization conditions the impact of irrigation with tww on crop yields compared to normal iw has not been observed in the short term irrigation with tww has been reported to significantly increase eucalyptus tereticornis sm biomass production after 10 years minhas et al 2015 similarly the fresh weight of alfalfa increased significantly when supplementary fertilization was provided via untreated wastewater whereas it did not increase with tww elfanssi et al 2018 in contrast after 2 years irrigation with tww did not significantly increase yields of sorghum chaganti et al 2020 nor of wheat gram palak methi and berseem singh et al 2012 similarly irrigation with tww did not significantly increase tomato yields disciglio et al 2015 libutti et al 2018 while it even significantly decreased broccoli yields in two cycles libutti et al 2018 irrigation of olive trees with tww did not significantly increase the quantity of olives per tree on a silty clay soil in northern jordan with average annual rainfall of about 275 mm ayoub et al 2016 nor on a sandy clay loam soil in greece with average annual rainfall of about 750 mm bourazanis et al 2016 in contrast on sandy soil in central eastern tunisia with annual rainfall of about 140 200 mm bedbabis et al 2010 measured higher quantities of olives per tree following irrigation with tww rather than iw without supplementary fertilization chloride concentrations in tww are high 454 mg l 1 but similar to those measured in other studies for example chaganti et al 2020 measured chloride concentrations in tww of 221 mg l 1 el moussaoui et al 2019 measured 504 mg l 1 for raw wastewater and between 241 and 316 mg l 1 for tww and paudel et al 2018 measured concentrations over several years of 280 343 mg l 1 in all these studies no toxic effects directly related to these high chloride concentrations were observed on crops the main industrial characteristics of sugarcane were similar when we compared sugarcane from the tww and control plots for the first and second year however the brix degree and fiber content were higher in the second year than in the first year contrary to the sucrose concentration as with yields some industrial characteristics of sugarcane may differ between the first year of cultivation and subsequent years due to new root system development even under similar irrigation fertilization and climatic conditions leal et al 2010 gonçalves et al 2017 compared the industrial characteristics of sugarcane without irrigation and with two types of irrigation with tww during a second ratoon they did not observe any significant differences in brix degree yet the fiber content was lower and the sucrose concentration higher for the non irrigated modality braddock and downs 2001 noted a 12 increase in sucrose concentration when irrigating sugarcane crops with tww compared to a non irrigated modality with normal iw the industrial characteristics of sugarcane were found to not change under different mineral fertilization conditions unlike yields bokhtiar and sakurai 2005 oliveira et al 2018 except when additional organic fertilization was applied bokhtiar and sakurai 2005 umesh et al 2013 ghube et al 2017 irrigation and fertilization do not increase the sugar content of crops but they increase yields and therefore the amount of sugar per hectare sucrose concentrations are measured for other crops in particular sugarbeet or sweet sorghum sugarbeet and sweet sorghum yields were reported to decrease with the iw quality i e higher electrical conductivity while the brix degree and sucrose concentrations almodares and sharif 2007 and all water soluble carbohydrate concentrations chaganti et al 2020 remained unchanged on the other hand alfalfa medicago sativa l accumulated twice as much sugar when irrigated with raw wastewater than with tww or well water elfanssi et al 2018 4 2 changes in soil organic carbon content and soil ph after irrigation with tww soil organic carbon contents vary and depend mainly on the doses applied and the soil climate conditions in our study at the end of the experiment for the surface layer 0 20 cm depth we measured a non significant decrease of 0 25 g 100 g 1 in organic carbon content comparatively to the initial soil of tww and control modalities moreover at the end of the experiment the tww and control soils had similar organic carbon contents at all depths in experiments lasting less than 4 years many authors have not measured significant changes in organic carbon content when comparing irrigation with tww and a control modality for sugarcane leal et al 2010 vegetable abegunrin et al 2016 libutti et al 2018 and olive ayoub et al 2016 crops however polglase et al 1995 gloaguen et al 2007 and tarchouna et al 2010 measured decreases in organic carbon content after irrigation with tww in forest plantations under semiarid climatic conditions annual crop fields under humid tropical climatic conditions and in a peach orchard under mediterranean climatic conditions respectively yet other studies have shown increases in soil organic carbon contents after irrigation with tww in annual and market gardening crop plots singh et al 2012 lal et al 2015 olive orchards bedbabis et al 2014 and fodder crop fields elfanssi et al 2018 el moussaoui et al 2019 the inconsistency in long term wastewater irrigation impacts on soil organic matter has been reported in other studies indeed after 10 years minhas et al 2015 measured increases in organic carbon contents in surface layers receiving tww compared to normal iw in a eucalyptus plantation whereas after 27 and 48 years andrews et al 2016 did not note any changes when comparing an irrigated modality with tww and a non irrigated modality in annual crop fields grasslands and forests under wet climatic conditions 1000 mm annual precipitation these a priori contradictory results could be explained by i the nature of organic matter in tww and its mineralization rate in soils ii the activity of microorganisms that increase with tww inputs of labile carbon and nitrogen and under favorable soil moisture conditions iii the contrasting climatic conditions and iv the soils properties indeed nitisols from reunion island have high corg concentrations that tww inputs cannot modify in the short term irrigation with tww increases or decreases the soil and leachate ph depending on the dominant processes that consume or release protons the duration of irrigation with tww and its chemical composition some studies have revealed minor decreases in soil ph or no significant increase after irrigation with tww mohammad and mazahreh 2003 rusan et al 2007 duan et al 2010 singh et al 2012 ayoub et al 2016 el moussaoui et al 2019 elfanssi et al 2018 the short monitoring time the sandy texture of the soils and the contribution of tww with very high dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen contents have frequently been noted the main processes identified in these studies that decrease soil ph are oxidation of organic compounds and ammonium nitrification on the contrary most studies have shown an increase in soil ph under multiple climate soil and crop conditions tarchouna et al 2010 andrews et al 2016 abegunrin et al 2016 libutti et al 2018 the main reasons identified are i the increase in base cations mainly calcium and magnesium and thus in the alkaline reserve of the soil ii processes that consume protons or produce hydroxyl ions such as denitrification decarboxylation and deamination organic anions and amino acids nitrogen mineralization 4 3 effect on electrical conductivity cec and exchangeable elements the tww used in our study was of good quality for irrigation and the risk of soil salinization and sodisation was low the electrical conductivity of the leachate at the outlet of columns irrigated with tww was constant after 4 pv and consistent with the values of the tww and rainwater supplied at the column inlets the risk of salinization or alkalinization was low with this tww since the sar was less than 1 mmol l 1 and the average electrical conductivity was less than 1 75 ms cm 1 these values were five to tenfold lower than many tww pedrero et al 2010 qadir et al 2010 ayoub et al 2016 libutti et al 2018 paudel et al 2018 chaganti et al 2020 at the outlet of the columns receiving tww the sodium concentrations were very similar to those at the column inlets leal et al 2009 also measured sodium concentrations in soil solution at different depths that were similar to the tww concentrations applied and on average fivefold lower on their control plots after a single crop cycle sebastian et al 2009 and gonçalves et al 2017 reported better sugarcane yields with irrigation with tww and a sar of 6 9 and 5 mmol l 1 respectively leal et al 2009 observed identical yields with irrigation with tww and a sar of 10 3 mmol l 1 nelson and ham 2000 measured decreases in sugarcane yields irrigated for several years with groundwater and a sar of 1 1 mmol l 1 and electrical conductivity of 0 28 ms cm 1 however these yield decreases were correlated with the previously existing soil salinity and particularly with the esp and not directly with the iw a 1 increase in esp led to a 2 1 mg ha 1 decrease in sugarcane yield nelson and ham 2000 because soil salinity upset the osmotic balance and the movement of water through plants in our study the mean esp in the soil profile 21 1 after tww input was significantly higher than that of the control 4 1 and initial 3 3 soils leal et al 2009 measured similar esp of 18 93 and 5 93 respectively for their tww and control modality at the end of an experiment on an oxisol in sandy soils tarchouna et al 2010 also measured a significant increase in esp up to 42 but with very high temporal variability related to rainfall and during two dry years where the cumulative rainfall was 600 mm paudel et al 2018 also measured a 2 8 5 9 increase in esp in irrigated soil after tww input ayoub et al 2016 measured a significant increase in esp in the surface horizon of soils receiving tww 7 6 and in the subsurface horizon 8 85 compared to non irrigated soils 2 1 surface and 2 7 subsurface and soils irrigated with groundwater 3 7 surface and 4 2 subsurface between the first and second year of their study libutti et al 2018 measured an increase in exchangeable sodium after the first year of tomato cultivation but not in subsequent years and with different crops elfanssi et al 2018 measured a significant increase in exchangeable sodium after irrigation with untreated raw water 1 23 cmol c kg 1 or tww 0 32 cmol c kg 1 compared to good quality water 0 1 cmol c kg 1 the increase in esp and sodium concentrations in soil solution thus depend on the sar of the supplied tww or iw the evaporation precipitation balance and the adsorption desorption processes many tropical soils have a low organic matter content and sandy texture diallo et al 2019 so they have low cec and are highly sensitive to increases in soil salinization and sodification we did not observe any negative effects of tww inputs on the sodium content in the soil or soil solution or on the hydraulic conductivity during our experiment this could be explained by the tww quality and the alternation of tww inputs and rainfalls in addition the bivalent cations calcium and magnesium initially represent nearly 80 of the total cec of the nitisols in the study this helps to reduce the potential negative impacts of monovalent cation inputs including sodium paudel et al 2018 also observed positive short term effects a few months to 2 years of alternating irrigation with tww and with good quality water and these authors highlighted the benefits of this irrigation management strategy the variations in mineral nitrogen nitrate ammonium in solution observed at the column outlets and in the soil at the end of the experiment were consistent with the input concentrations tropical soils frequently have an anion exchange capacity that reduces the transfer of nitrates and accumulates them in the soil feder et al 2020 the nitisols present in this study contained positively charged mineral phases and poorly crystallized phases extractable with oxalate hence between 15 and 50 cm depth mineral nitrogen extracted with molar kcl accumulated significantly in the tww columns nitrate and ammonium solution concentrations at the outlet were negligible at 1 m depth blum et al 2013 measured nmin concentrations in solution of 9 3 mg l 1 after tww nmin 21 mg l 1 and 6 7 mg l 1 without irrigation in an oxisol cropped with sugarcane after applying liquid manure on a nitisol feder et al 2015 measured fivefold lower nitrate concentrations at the maximum of the breakthrough curve at 85 cm depth than input concentrations similarly duan et al 2010 measured a significant decrease in nitrate concentrations in soil solution between the beginning and end of their experiment 3 and 0 5 mg kg 1 soil respectively averaged over the soil profile after a few irrigations with 1000 mm tww nmin 12 mg l 1 over a 1 year period this confirmed that nitrate and ammonium ions systematically decrease in soil solution because they are taken up by the crop or are adsorbed libutti et al 2018 measured a punctual increase in soil mineral nitrogen in the first year of a tomato crop cycle after tww irrigation but no significant differences in subsequent years and different crops lal et al 2015 measured a significant increase in soil mineral nitrogen after 8 years of tww irrigation nmin 12 8 mg l 1 on different crops following tww irrigation in our study mineral nitrogen was thus essentially stored in the soil and remained available to the crop for at least 2 years at a depth within reach of the roots the dynamics of the other major elements at the column outlets were consistent with the concentrations supplied at the column inlets and with the variations in exchangeable base contents in the soil at the end of the experiment concentrations of calcium magnesium chlorides and sulfates at the tww column outlets reached constant values with a ratio of close to 0 8 only potassium did not reach the same concentrations as at the column inlets and continued to accumulate in soils after 20 pv this accumulation resulted in an increase in exchangeable potassium throughout the soil profile in the tww columns however libutti et al 2018 did not measure differences in exchangeable potassium but rather an increase in exchangeable calcium and magnesium for the second crop in the second year of their study elfanssi et al 2018 measured a significant increase in exchangeable calcium magnesium and potassium after irrigation with untreated raw water 16 33 2 4 and 8 5 cmol c kg 1 respectively or tww 14 7 2 2 and 8 1 cmol c kg 1 respectively compared to good quality water 14 1 2 11 and 7 cmol c kg 1 respectively ayoub et al 2016 measured a significant increase in exchangeable calcium magnesium and potassium in the surface and subsurface horizons of soils irrigated with tww compared to non irrigated soils and soils irrigated with groundwater between the first and second year of their study abegunrin et al 2016 observed disparate results depending on the depth crop and type of tww provided however the control treatment always showed the lowest calcium magnesium and exchangeable potassium levels in the surface horizon compared to tww in contrast tarchouna et al 2010 measured higher calcium and magnesium concentrations in a modality irrigated with tww and lower potassium concentrations these authors explained that high calcium and magnesium levels promote potassium uptake by the plant as well as its desorption and leaching thus in addition to the concentrations of these elements in tww their removal by the plant and their competition for adsorption or leaching could explain the differences observed between studies 4 4 potential risks to aquifers the impact of tww irrigation on groundwater is essentially analyzed by taking into account the chemical elements taken up by the sugar cane the elements adsorbed on the soil mineral exchange surfaces leachated with the soil solution or lost by volatilization plant uptake was not studied in this study however it is well known oliveira et al 2018 and fertilization is calculated a priori to achieve a specific yield for a given soil and plant type ghube et al 2017 thus the plant takes up the major chemical elements provided by fertilization n p and k as well as those already present and available in the soil piouceau et al 2020 the calculation of fertilization is a crucial step since fertilizers represent a major cost for the farmer wassenaar et al 2014 however any chemical elements that are not taken up by the plant are likely to either accumulate in the soil or contaminate groundwater qadir et al 2010 in our study the flux of chemical elements at the outlet of the soil columns therefore corresponds to the extreme situation when the plant does not intercept any chemical elements absence of plant root system still too undeveloped flux between crop rows etc the chemical analyses of the major elements of the leachates at the soil column outlet and the final measurements of the exchangeable bases present dynamics consistent with the quality of the tww the impact of tww or high salt irrigation water on groundwater is one of the major potential risks toze 2006 indeed to avoid salinisation or sodisation it is necessary to provide more water than the crop needs to leach the soluble salts and avoid their accumulation in the soil elgallal et al 2016 however depending on the hydrogeological context this practice induces two major negative impacts to be avoided which are an increase in the level of the water table and a progressive increase in its salt concentrations tww have a major advantage since they are supplied continuously during the crop cycle the nutrients supplied are therefore fractionated and the potential losses are reduced similarly nitrogen losses through volatilization are insignificant with tww compared to applications of organic matter or mineral fertilizer bokhtiar and sakurai 2005 the risk of groundwater contamination after heavy rainfall events is thus also reduced 5 conclusion irrigation with tww is also relevant in humid environmental settings to supplement water and fertilize intensive crops the percentage of tww used in the water balance is lower than in arid environmental conditions which could explain the absence of negative effects on sugarcane crop yields industrial characteristics and soil properties we combined two experiments in a sugarcane field and in the laboratory under the same hydrological conditions but without the sugarcane crop the first experiment clearly highlighted the impact of tww irrigation on sugarcane while the second provided a more general view of the impact on the soil indeed the apparent contradictions between the studies in terms of changes in ph organic carbon content and exchangeable base contents could be explained by the variability in element concentrations in the tww their uptake by crops their competition for adsorption or leaching and the hydric conditions short term impacts of irrigation with tww were for example an increase in ph values compared with the initial value which results in increased availability of trace elements and heavy metals and thus reducing the risk of heavy metal uptake by plants however a soil ph above 8 reduces the bioavailability of micronutrients to crops and subsequently impacts their

10194,treated wastewater tww reuse for crop irrigation has been developing in recent decades in areas hampered by severe water shortages however in humid conditions the agronomic impacts of supplementary irrigation are less and poorly documented on the island of réunion we measured sugarcane yield and quality on a nitisol over 2 years by providing 2600 mm of tww or irrigation water control as a supplement to the 3500 mm rainfall meanwhile with the same tww irrigation water iw and rainfall inputs we monitored leachates and soil under controlled conditions without plants sugarcane yield brix degree fiber and sucrose contents were similar between the tww and control plots each year the leachate ph and electrical conductivity at 60 cm depth showed marked differences between the tww and control modalities similarly after a constant increase in chloride sulfate potassium and sodium contents or breakthrough curves for calcium and magnesium the concentrations of these elements under the tww modality were stable from 12 pore volumes pv except for calcium which was stable from 16 pv at the end of the experiment the hydraulic conductivity and organic carbon contents did not show any significant change while the ph of soils that had received tww and of the control soil was higher overall than the ph of the initial soil the dynamics of the major elements in leachates at 65 cm depth were consistent with the input concentrations and the variations in exchangeable base contents in the soil at the end of the experiment however potassium and mineral nitrogen had accumulated in the soil profile while there were low concentrations in the leachate the tww quality and quantities provided uptake by plants competition for adsorption or leaching and the pedoclimatic context could therefore i explain the absence of negative agronomic impact and ii highlight the benefits of irrigation with tww in humid environments to supplement water requirements and fertilize intensive crops keywords réunion reuse complementary irrigation 1 introduction irrigation and organic fertilizer spreading are millennial agricultural practices contrary to wastewater reuse the global urban population has been increasing and densifying for more than a hundred years to the extent that it is now crucial to organize wastewater collection and treatment in sewage treatment plants before its release mainly into the aquatic environment irrigation with treated wastewater tww has long been limited due to the poor treatment efficiency to reduce the omnipresent microbiological risks toze 2006 pedrero et al 2010 further aggravated by the tww salinity and the presence of contaminants such as metallic and organic trace elements el moussaoui et al 2019 in developing countries irrigation with untreated or barely treated wastewater is sometimes a necessity to meet crop water and nutrient needs despite various risks of contamination qadir et al 2010 hodomihou et al 2016 however irrigation with tww has been developing in recent decades with the improvement of physicochemical biological and chemical treatment processes with clearcut benefits it is a complementary source of water that reduces pressure on other resources especially groundwater it is produced continuously throughout the year it contains nutrients essential for crops in turn generating economic benefits for farmers by reducing the need for fertilizers such as organic waste wassenaar et al 2014 irrigation with tww has a positive overall environmental impact yet it is currently mainly being developed in arid or semiarid regions where water deficits are commonplace elgallal et al 2016 the positive and negative environmental impacts of irrigation with tww depend on multiple factors with the main ones being the tww quality the type of soil and crop the climatic conditions and the tww agronomic management modalities irrigation with tww is mainly likely to modify the soil salinity levels mohammad and mazahreh 2003 gloaguen et al 2007 ayoub et al 2016 libutti et al 2018 ph gloaguen et al 2007 abegunrin et al 2016 ayoub et al 2016 carbon content minhas et al 2015 abegunrin et al 2016 el moussaoui et al 2019

rusan et al 2007 singh et al 2012 el moussaoui et al 2019 however irrigation with tww affects soils differently long term changes in soil properties also depend on the intrinsic soil characteristics texture mineralogy initial chemical composition etc tropical soils are particularly vulnerable because they have certain physical sandy texture etc and chemical cec and low carbon content etc characteristics that irrigation with tww could modify iuss working group 2015 the sustainability of tww irrigation could thus be assessed by combined monitoring of variations in soil properties and leachates gloaguen et al 2007 tarchouna et al 2010 yet soil solution sampling techniques are still imperfect especially in the root zone irrigation with tww is increasingly being implemented in humid environments when annual rainfall is insufficient or very unequally distributed particularly with regard to water demanding non food crops that are not very susceptible to salinity irrigation with tww does not have an impact on crop yields in the short term compared to normal iw and equivalent fertilization disciglio et al 2015 gonçalves et al 2017 libutti et al 2018 elfanssi et al 2018 chaganti et al 2020 yields have been found to increase sometimes significantly when tww irrigation provided additional nutrients and water compared to the control sebastian et al 2009 leal et al 2010 minhas et al 2015 elfanssi et al 2018 whereas yields decrease when there are physical or chemical constraints libutti et al 2018 but these issues can be partially overcome via tww input management toze 2006 qadir et al 2010 elgallal et al 2016 in humid environments high rainfall or the possibility of irrigating crops with good quality water can curb some constraints especially salinity toze 2006 qadir et al 2010 even in the long term andrews et al 2016 in highly arid conditions irrigation may provide up to 90 of the water needs of sugarcane saccharum spp which makes it impossible to use tww sustainably yet optimal sugarcane yields cannot be achieved without supplementary irrigation in humid tropical environments where rainfall ranges from 2000 to 3000 mm irrigation with tww can therefore provide supplementary water as well as some or even all of the nutrients required during the growing season sugarcane irrigation with tww has not been found to decrease yields leal et al 2009 change the industrial characteristics braddock and downs 2001 gonçalves et al 2017 or impact germination and plant physiology sebastian et al 2009 nitrogen and phosphate leaching has been found to be low blum et al 2013 with little change in soil quality however in these studies the nutrient amounts applied and the volumes of irrigation or rainfall water were not equivalent this limits the generalization of these results studies on irrigation with tww have thus mainly been focused on the different environmental risks yield increases and production quality in arid and subarid environments the sustainability and pluriannual agronomic impacts of complementary irrigation of sugarcane with tww as a replacement for normal irrigation and fertilization on nitisols have yet to be investigated this study was aimed at assessing whether i water and nutrient inputs via tww could sustainably replace mineral fertilization associated with conventional irrigation without modifying sugarcane yield or quality ii irrigation with tww modifies the soil physical and chemical properties and iii the soil solution reaches equilibrium with tww we therefore planted a sugarcane crop in an experimental plot and monitored it for 2 years meanwhile we reproduced the same tww iw and rainwater inputs in soil columns in order to monitor the dynamics of water and solute fluxes over time independently of the crop intake 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site in réunion and the treated wastewater réunion is a french island located 800 km east of madagascar in the southern indian ocean region the main peak

plantation eight blocks of 7 5 m i e five rows of sugarcane by 6 m in length were set up in the center of the plot each block was spaced at 5 m distance from the others in the width direction and 3 m distance in the length direction four blocks were irrigated with tww and four control c blocks were irrigated with iw the blocks of each modality were distributed alternately so as not to be side by side drip irrigation was used and each irrigation line was separate and connected to its own 5 m3 tank equipped with a solenoid valve with volumetric measurement two annual sugarcane crops were grown consecutively 2010 2012 with the r579 variety for the two cumulative years the tww irrigation modality received 2600 mm of tww and 3500 mm of rainwater 1900 mm during the first year and 1600 mm during

feder 2020 the tww modality received each year and per hectare the following fertilization 165 kg n 30 kg p and 315 kg k without any complementary fertilization each year at the beginning of the cycle the control modality received mineral fertilization equivalent to that provided by the tww modality 2 3 soil column experiment the device consisted of 8 pvc columns 100 cm high 60 cm of which were in the soil and 20 cm diameter the soil was reconstituted at the bulk density bd measured in the field bd 1 30 and in successive 10 cm layers corresponding to the layers sampled in situ the outlet was protected with a geotextile at the base the total volume in each column was 18 84 dm3 the pore volume ratio pvr was calculated for the column by the equation pvr 1 bd pd dimensionless with bd kg dm 3 corresponding to the bulk density measured in situ and pd kg dm 3 corresponding to the particle density pd 2 7 kg dm 3 for this soil applied to the total volume the calculated pore volume pv was then 9 77 dm3 and corresponded also to 311 mm for the column five columns received 2600 mm of tww and 3500 mm of rainwater three control columns c received 2600 mm of iw and 3500 mm of rainwater the total accumulated amounts of irrigation water tww or ir or rainwater were therefore equivalent in the soil columns and in the field during the experiments in order to ensure that the distribution of these different inputs was similar in the two experiments and in order to get closer to the field experiment conditions each input of ½ pv of tww or iw was alternated with an input of ½ pv of rainwater an additional ½ pv rainwater supply was conducted every 2 pv 2 4 soil water and plant analysis the initial soil analyses were performed on samples collected in situ from the 0 10 20 30 and 45 60 cm

comparison of means when the normality was not confirmed the factors were tested using non parametric methods such as the kruskal wallis test 3 results 3 1 effect of wastewater irrigation on sugarcane yield and quality sugarcane yields were similar between the tww and the control plots in the first and second years the average yield in the four tww plots was 85 mg ha 1 with peak yields of 80 and 97 mg ha 1 during the first year of sugarcane cultivation fig 1 the average yield in the four control plots was 88 mg ha 1 with peak yields of 80 and 94 mg ha 1 the average yield in the four tww plots was 109 mg ha 1 with peak yields of 98 and 117 mg ha 1 during the second year of sugarcane cultivation the average yield in the four control plots was 114 mg ha 1 with peak yields of 108 and 120 mg ha 1 the yield dispersion of the four replicates was always higher for the tww plots compared to the control plots but the yield differences were not significant for each year the first year of sugarcane cultivation showed lower average yields than the second year in both years nutrient inputs from tww or mineral fertilization irrigation rainfall and crop duration were similar but yields in the tww and control plots increased by 23 and 26 mg ha 1 respectively between the first and second year the main sugarcane industrial characteristics were similar between the tww and the control plots in the first and second years brix degrees measured postharvest in sugarcane juice were statistically identical when comparing sugarcane from the tww and control plots for the first and second year table 3 nevertheless brix degrees measured at harvest in the second year were significantly lower than in the first year for sugarcane from the tww and control plots sugarcane fiber contents were statistically similar when comparing sugarcane from the tww and control plots in the first and second years however fiber contents were statistically higher in the first year than in the second year for sugarcane from each of the tww and control plots sugarcane sucrose concentrations were statistically similar when comparing sugarcane from the tww and control plots and between the first and second year the brix degree corresponding to the total sugar was always higher than the sugarcane sucrose concentration for each year and for each modality the brix degree was 23 higher than the sucrose concentration for the tww and control plots in the first year but the brix degree was 21 higher than the sucrose concentration for the tww modality and 28 higher than the sucrose concentration for the control modality in the second year 3 2 solute transfers in soil at first we checked whether the experimental setup could closely reproduce flows that occur in the field by measuring the hydraulic conductivity on the column surfaces for each irrigation these measures ranged from 8 5 10 7 m s 1 to 1 4 10 6 m s 1 during the experiment for all the columns and were in line with the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured in situ with a permeameter ring at saturation 2 3 10 6 m s 1 the column hydraulic properties were similar and close to those of in situ soil the soil columns could thus accurately replicate the hydrodynamic behavior of in situ soil from 4 pore volumes pv the electrical conductivity of the leachate at the column outlet was constant and always lower than the average electrical conductivity of the input water fig 2 the average electrical conductivity of the tww input to the tww columns was 1 733 ms cm 1 at the tww column outlets the leachate electrical conductivity increased linearly from 2 pv and to 4 pv then from 4 pv the leachate electrical conductivity levelled off at 0 898 ms cm 1 range 4 20 pv the electrical conductivity of the iw supplied to the control columns was on average 0 130 ms cm 1 at the control column outlets the leachate electrical conductivity was always constant and averaged 0 07 ms cm 1 throughout the experiment from 3 pv upwards the electrical conductivity of leachates from the tww and control columns was always significantly different from 3 pv upwards the leachate ph at the tww column outlets was always significantly lower than that of the control columns fig 2 the ph of the tww supplied to the tww columns averaged 7 28 during the experiment table 2 at the tww column outlets the leachate ph decreased and then starting at 3 pv levelled off between 6 and 6 3 the ph of the iw supplied to the control columns averaged 7 65 during the experiment table 2 at the control column outlets the leachate ph was always constant between 6 4 and 6 7 from 3 pv to the end of the experiment the ph of the tww and control columns was always significantly different by about 0 5 units from 12 pv upwards the leachate chloride and sulfate concentrations at the tww column outlets were similar to the input concentrations in contrast to the nitrate and phosphate concentrations all concentrations of chemicals in solution were related to their measured tww concentration fig 3 a ratio of 1 thus means that the concentration at the outlet was similar to the average supplied tww concentration the breakthrough curve for chlorides in the leachate at the tww outlet showed an almost linear increase between 2 and 6 pv then reaching a maximum ratio of 1 4 between 6 and 8 pv then the ratio was between 0 75 and 0 9 from 12 pv to 20 pv in addition the breakthrough curve plotted for the leachate chloride concentrations at the control column outlet showed very little variation with a ratio of 0 09 3 pv and then the ratio was always below 0 03 from 5 pv upwards the breakthrough curve for leachate sulfates at the tww column outlets showed a quasi linear increase between 4 and 10 pv up to a maximum ratio of 0 87 then this ratio was between 0 87 and 0 74 up to 20 pv in addition throughout the experiment leachate sulfate concentrations at the control column outlet were constant and the ratio ranged from 0 08 to 0 1 on the other hand leachate nitrate concentrations at the column outlet were always low for the tww and control columns with a ratio of less than 0 2 and without significant differences phosphate concentrations always had a ratio of less than 0 02 with no significant differences between the tww and control columns the maxima of the leachate calcium and magnesium concentrations at the tww column outlets showed ratios close to 9 and 3 respectively on the breakthrough curve before becoming identical to the input concentrations the leachate calcium concentration at the tww outlet showed an almost linear increase from 2 to 5 pv on the breakthrough curve and then reached a maximum ratio of 8 95 at 8 pv the ratio then gradually decreased and from 17 pv onwards while ranging from 0 8 to 1 furthermore throughout the experiment the leachate calcium concentrations at the control column outlet were constant and the ratio ranged from 0 45 to 0 88 the leachate magnesium concentration at the outlet of the tww columns showed a quasi linear increase between 2 and 6 pv on the breakthrough curve then reaching a maximum ratio of 2 86 at 6 pv the ratio then gradually decreased and was between 0 69 and 0 9 from 13 pv onwards furthermore throughout the experiment the magnesium concentrations at the control column outlet were constant and the ratio was between 0 18 and 0 35 sodium and potassium leachate concentrations at the outlet of the tww columns showed the same dynamics but with different maximum ratios for the leachate sodium concentrations at the tww outlet initially the ratio increased slowly and linearly between 2 and 7 pv and reached a ratio of 0 15 then in a second step the ratio increased linearly from 8 pv to 14 pv and peaked at 0 86 at 12 pv then the ratio was between 0 66 and 0 8 from 13 pv to 20 pv in addition throughout the experiment the sodium concentrations in the leachate at the control column outlet were constant and the ratio ranged from 0 04 to 0 06 otherwise leachate potassium concentrations at the outlet of the tww columns reached a maximum ratio of 0 22 0 27 from 11 pv until the end of the experiment between 11 and 20 pv this ratio did not show an increasing trend moreover throughout the experiment potassium concentrations at the control column outlets were constant and the ratio was between 0 03 and 0 05 3 3 exchangeable cations extractable nitrogen organic carbon and ph in the soil at the end of the experiment exchangeable calcium and sodium concentrations varied substantially when comparing the initial and final soils of the tww and control columns exchangeable calcium decreased from 2 4 to 0 9 cmol c kg 1 in the surface horizon 0 20 cm depth between the initial and final soils of the tww and control columns respectively fig 4 on the other hand it increased from 0 8 to 1 3 cmol c kg 1 in the deep horizon 40 60 cm depth between the initial and final soils of the tww and control columns respectively exchangeable magnesium increased by 1 1 cmol c kg 1 in the surface horizon 0 10 cm depth when comparing the initial and final soils of the tww columns however there was no change in the control columns at this depth in the deep horizons 35 60 cm depth the exchangeable magnesium increased by 0 9 and 1 6 cmol c kg 1 between the initial and final soils of the tww and control columns respectively exchangeable potassium increased from 0 2 to 0 65 cmol c kg 1 in the surface horizon 0 20 cm depth between the initial and final soils in the tww columns while it remained unchanged in the control columns similarly it increased by about 0 2 cmol c kg 1 in the lower horizon 25 60 cm depth of the tww columns exchangeable sodium increased from 1 7 to 2 2 cmol c kg 1 throughout the entire column depth 0 60 cm when comparing the initial and final soils of the tww columns in contrast there was no change in exchangeable sodium concentration between the initial and final soils in the control columns throughout the full column depth 0 60 cm the mineral nitrogen corresponding to the sum of ammonium and nitrate extractable at 1 m kcl increased from 60 mg kg 1 to nearly 80 mg kg 1 in the surface horizon 0 20 cm depth between the initial and final soils in the tww columns a similar increase was observed in the surface layer 0 10 cm depth between the initial and final soils of the control columns the mineral nitrogen concentration was not modified between the initial and final soils in the control columns between 10 and 60 cm column depth in contrast the mineral nitrogen concentration increased significantly between the initial and final soil in the tww columns from 36 to 135 mg kg 1 20 30 cm 88 mg kg 1 30 40 cm and 59 mg kg 1 40 60 cm respectively the total cec followed the same dynamics as the exchangeable calcium concentration for the surface horizon 0 30 cm depth cec decreased by 1 2 cmol c kg 1 between the initial and final soils in the tww and control columns respectively on the other hand for the deep horizon 40 60 cm depth the total cec increased from 1 2 to 2 5 cmol c kg 1 between the initial and final soils of the control and tww columns respectively the base saturation rate increased from 5 to 20 throughout the entire column depth 0 60 cm when comparing the initial and final soils of the tww and control columns the increase was always more marked for the final soil of the tww columns except for the 50 60 cm depth horizon average organic carbon concentrations did not show significant changes they decreased by 0 25 g 100 g 1 in the surface horizon from 0 to 20 cm depth between the initial and final soils of the tww and control columns but not significantly however organic carbon concentrations in soils from the tww and control columns were similar to the initial soil concentrations for the 20 60 cm depth horizons in addition for all depths organic carbon concentrations between the final soil in the tww and control columns were highly reproducible the phw and phkcl of the soils in the tww and control columns were generally higher than the ph of the initial soil at the end of the experiment for all depths the phw of the tww and control column soils was higher than the phw of the original soil by 0 1 0 9 ph units respectively the differences in phw were most marked for the 0 10 cm layer and gradually decreased for the other depths from 0 1 to 0 4 ph units at the end of the experiment the phw of the soils in the tww and control columns was similar for the 20 60 cm depth horizons and was 0 2 ph units higher than in the initial soil 4 discussion 4 1 impact of treated wastewater on sugarcane yield and quality sugarcane yields were similar between the tww and control plots in the first and second year of this study the nutrients supplied by tww therefore generated the same yield as obtained with equivalent mineral fertilization in two consecutive years with equal rainfall and total water supply in the tww or iw plots conversely gonçalves et al 2017 do not observe an increase in sugarcane yield despite the additional nutrient supply by irrigation with tww compared to the control modality however their study was only carried out during one sugarcane crop cycle which hinders observation of any beneficial effects of the nutrient supply over several cycles however with normal iw sugarcane usually responds well to organic fertilization during the current crop cycle yields increase when nitrogen is supplied in mineral form or if it mineralizes quickly sebastian et al 2009 umesh et al 2013 yet leal et al 2010 observed an increase in sugarcane yield which they attribute to the increase in the amount of water supplied with tww with equal fertilization as their control modality was not irrigated but the aim of their study was not to evaluate the effects of short term tww irrigation on yield but rather on nitrogen uptake by sugarcane nitrogen and carbon accumulation in soil and nitrate leaching in addition sugarcane yields in the first year of cultivation were always lower in subsequent years due to the need for new root systems to develop leal et al 2010 gonçalves et al 2017 similarly braddock and downs 2001 found a 45 increase in yield when irrigating with tww but their findings were compared to a non irrigated modality these apparent contradictory results for sugarcane are not strictly comparable since the conditions were not identical especially with regard to fertilization and irrigation management moreover the differences could be attributed to indirect effects of irrigation with tww on yields especially when the tww is too saline or when the soils are sodic nelson and ham 2000 these depreciation effects are not always observed or measured or are hard to quantify finally in our study there were two minor differences between the tww and control modalities despite the identical nutrient intakes in both years first sugarcane mineral fertilization was applied during the first month of the crop for the control modality whereas fertilizers were applied during the plant cycle for 12 months under the tww modality this practice is poorly documented probably because the effects are minor a main reason is the similarity with the conventional organic fertilization piouceau et al 2020 with solid sewage sludge manure litter etc or liquid products methanation digestates slurries etc secondly as already observed during fertilization with pig slurry feder et al 2015 piouceau et al 2020 a fraction of the nitrogen provided by tww is organic thus not assimilable by sugarcane in this chemical form these forms of nitrogen must therefore be mineralized into bioavailable chemical forms finally since fertilization and irrigation conditions including rainfall were similar during the two years of our study we can attribute the increase in yields between the two years to climatological differences higher average temperatures and longer and more intense sunshine as well as to a better installation of the sugarcane root system in our study the rainfall level was 1900 mm during the first year and 1600 mm during the second year while tww or iw provided 1300 mm during the first and second year complementary irrigation with tww or iw thus represented 40 and 45 of the total water input rainfall and irrigation in the first and second years respectively this percentage of complementary irrigation is much lower in more arid situations with two to tenfold lower rainfall gloaguen et al 2010 ayoub et al 2016 paudel et al 2018 demonstrated the benefits of alternating tww inputs with better quality water to limit negative impacts on the soil and improve yields in lemon orchards moreover the hydrodynamic and geochemical properties of nitisols reduced the negative impact of tww due to the high clay content 56 in the surface horizon unlike many other tropical sugarcane soils such as oxisols sebastian et al 2009 gloaguen et al 2010 which have a sandy texture for other types of crops with identical mineral fertilization conditions the impact of irrigation with tww on crop yields compared to normal iw has not been observed in the short term irrigation with tww has been reported to significantly increase eucalyptus tereticornis sm biomass production after 10 years minhas et al 2015 similarly the fresh weight of alfalfa increased significantly when supplementary fertilization was provided via untreated wastewater whereas it did not increase with tww elfanssi et al 2018 in contrast after 2 years irrigation with tww did not significantly increase yields of sorghum chaganti et al 2020 nor of wheat gram palak methi and berseem singh et al 2012 similarly irrigation with tww did not significantly increase tomato yields disciglio et al 2015 libutti et al 2018 while it even significantly decreased broccoli yields in two cycles libutti et al 2018 irrigation of olive trees with tww did not significantly increase the quantity of olives per tree on a silty clay soil in northern jordan with average annual rainfall of about 275 mm ayoub et al 2016 nor on a sandy clay loam soil in greece with average annual rainfall of about 750 mm bourazanis et al 2016 in contrast on sandy soil in central eastern tunisia with annual rainfall of about 140 200 mm bedbabis et al 2010 measured higher quantities of olives per tree following irrigation with tww rather than iw without supplementary fertilization chloride concentrations in tww are high 454 mg l 1 but similar to those measured in other studies for example chaganti et al 2020 measured chloride concentrations in tww of 221 mg l 1 el moussaoui et al 2019 measured 504 mg l 1 for raw wastewater and between 241 and 316 mg l 1 for tww and paudel et al 2018 measured concentrations over several years of 280 343 mg l 1 in all these studies no toxic effects directly related to these high chloride concentrations were observed on crops the main industrial characteristics of sugarcane were similar when we compared sugarcane from the tww and control plots for the first and second year however the brix degree and fiber content were higher in the second year than in the first year contrary to the sucrose concentration as with yields some industrial characteristics of sugarcane may differ between the first year of cultivation and subsequent years due to new root system development even under similar irrigation fertilization and climatic conditions leal et al 2010 gonçalves et al 2017 compared the industrial characteristics of sugarcane without irrigation and with two types of irrigation with tww during a second ratoon they did not observe any significant differences in brix degree yet the fiber content was lower and the sucrose concentration higher for the non irrigated modality braddock and downs 2001 noted a 12 increase in sucrose concentration when irrigating sugarcane crops with tww compared to a non irrigated modality with normal iw the industrial characteristics of sugarcane were found to not change under different mineral fertilization conditions unlike yields bokhtiar and sakurai 2005 oliveira et al 2018 except when additional organic fertilization was applied bokhtiar and sakurai 2005 umesh et al 2013 ghube et al 2017 irrigation and fertilization do not increase the sugar content of crops but they increase yields and therefore the amount of sugar per hectare sucrose concentrations are measured for other crops in particular sugarbeet or sweet sorghum sugarbeet and sweet sorghum yields were reported to decrease with the iw quality i e higher electrical conductivity while the brix degree and sucrose concentrations almodares and sharif 2007 and all water soluble carbohydrate concentrations chaganti et al 2020 remained unchanged on the other hand alfalfa medicago sativa l accumulated twice as much sugar when irrigated with raw wastewater than with tww or well water elfanssi et al 2018 4 2 changes in soil organic carbon content and soil ph after irrigation with tww soil organic carbon contents vary and depend mainly on the doses applied and the soil climate conditions in our study at the end of the experiment for the surface layer 0 20 cm depth we measured a non significant decrease of 0 25 g 100 g 1 in organic carbon content comparatively to the initial soil of tww and control modalities moreover at the end of the experiment the tww and control soils had similar organic carbon contents at all depths in experiments lasting less than 4 years many authors have not measured significant changes in organic carbon content when comparing irrigation with tww and a control modality for sugarcane leal et al 2010 vegetable abegunrin et al 2016 libutti et al 2018 and olive ayoub et al 2016 crops however polglase et al 1995 gloaguen et al 2007 and tarchouna et al 2010 measured decreases in organic carbon content after irrigation with tww in forest plantations under semiarid climatic conditions annual crop fields under humid tropical climatic conditions and in a peach orchard under mediterranean climatic conditions respectively yet other studies have shown increases in soil organic carbon contents after irrigation with tww in annual and market gardening crop plots singh et al 2012 lal et al 2015 olive orchards bedbabis et al 2014 and fodder crop fields elfanssi et al 2018 el moussaoui et al 2019 the inconsistency in long term wastewater irrigation impacts on soil organic matter has been reported in other studies indeed after 10 years minhas et al 2015 measured increases in organic carbon contents in surface layers receiving tww compared to normal iw in a eucalyptus plantation whereas after 27 and 48 years andrews et al 2016 did not note any changes when comparing an irrigated modality with tww and a non irrigated modality in annual crop fields grasslands and forests under wet climatic conditions 1000 mm annual precipitation these a priori contradictory results could be explained by i the nature of organic matter in tww and its mineralization rate in soils ii the activity of microorganisms that increase with tww inputs of labile carbon and nitrogen and under favorable soil moisture conditions iii the contrasting climatic conditions and iv the soils properties indeed nitisols from reunion island have high corg concentrations that tww inputs cannot modify in the short term irrigation with tww increases or decreases the soil and leachate ph depending on the dominant processes that consume or release protons the duration of irrigation with tww and its chemical composition some studies have revealed minor decreases in soil ph or no significant increase after irrigation with tww mohammad and mazahreh 2003 rusan et al 2007 duan et al 2010 singh et al 2012 ayoub et al 2016 el moussaoui et al 2019 elfanssi et al 2018 the short monitoring time the sandy texture of the soils and the contribution of tww with very high dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen contents have frequently been noted the main processes identified in these studies that decrease soil ph are oxidation of organic compounds and ammonium nitrification on the contrary most studies have shown an increase in soil ph under multiple climate soil and crop conditions tarchouna et al 2010 andrews et al 2016 abegunrin et al 2016 libutti et al 2018 the main reasons identified are i the increase in base cations mainly calcium and magnesium and thus in the alkaline reserve of the soil ii processes that consume protons or produce hydroxyl ions such as denitrification decarboxylation and deamination organic anions and amino acids nitrogen mineralization 4 3 effect on electrical conductivity cec and exchangeable elements the tww used in our study was of good quality for irrigation and the risk of soil salinization and sodisation was low the electrical conductivity of the leachate at the outlet of columns irrigated with tww was constant after 4 pv and consistent with the values of the tww and rainwater supplied at the column inlets the risk of salinization or alkalinization was low with this tww since the sar was less than 1 mmol l 1 and the average electrical conductivity was less than 1 75 ms cm 1 these values were five to tenfold lower than many tww pedrero et al 2010 qadir et al 2010 ayoub et al 2016 libutti et al 2018 paudel et al 2018 chaganti et al 2020 at the outlet of the columns receiving tww the sodium concentrations were very similar to those at the column inlets leal et al 2009 also measured sodium concentrations in soil solution at different depths that were similar to the tww concentrations applied and on average fivefold lower on their control plots after a single crop cycle sebastian et al 2009 and gonçalves et al 2017 reported better sugarcane yields with irrigation with tww and a sar of 6 9 and 5 mmol l 1 respectively leal et al 2009 observed identical yields with irrigation with tww and a sar of 10 3 mmol l 1 nelson and ham 2000 measured decreases in sugarcane yields irrigated for several years with groundwater and a sar of 1 1 mmol l 1 and electrical conductivity of 0 28 ms cm 1 however these yield decreases were correlated with the previously existing soil salinity and particularly with the esp and not directly with the iw a 1 increase in esp led to a 2 1 mg ha 1 decrease in sugarcane yield nelson and ham 2000 because soil salinity upset the osmotic balance and the movement of water through plants in our study the mean esp in the soil profile 21 1 after tww input was significantly higher than that of the control 4 1 and initial 3 3 soils leal et al 2009 measured similar esp of 18 93 and 5 93 respectively for their tww and control modality at the end of an experiment on an oxisol in sandy soils tarchouna et al 2010 also measured a significant increase in esp up to 42 but with very high temporal variability related to rainfall and during two dry years where the cumulative rainfall was 600 mm paudel et al 2018 also measured a 2 8 5 9 increase in esp in irrigated soil after tww input ayoub et al 2016 measured a significant increase in esp in the surface horizon of soils receiving tww 7 6 and in the subsurface horizon 8 85 compared to non irrigated soils 2 1 surface and 2 7 subsurface and soils irrigated with groundwater 3 7 surface and 4 2 subsurface between the first and second year of their study libutti et al 2018 measured an increase in exchangeable sodium after the first year of tomato cultivation but not in subsequent years and with different crops elfanssi et al 2018 measured a significant increase in exchangeable sodium after irrigation with untreated raw water 1 23 cmol c kg 1 or tww 0 32 cmol c kg 1 compared to good quality water 0 1 cmol c kg 1 the increase in esp and sodium concentrations in soil solution thus depend on the sar of the supplied tww or iw the evaporation precipitation balance and the adsorption desorption processes many tropical soils have a low organic matter content and sandy texture diallo et al 2019 so they have low cec and are highly sensitive to increases in soil salinization and sodification we did not observe any negative effects of tww inputs on the sodium content in the soil or soil solution or on the hydraulic conductivity during our experiment this could be explained by the tww quality and the alternation of tww inputs and rainfalls in addition the bivalent cations calcium and magnesium initially represent nearly 80 of the total cec of the nitisols in the study this helps to reduce the potential negative impacts of monovalent cation inputs including sodium paudel et al 2018 also observed positive short term effects a few months to 2 years of alternating irrigation with tww and with good quality water and these authors highlighted the benefits of this irrigation management strategy the variations in mineral nitrogen nitrate ammonium in solution observed at the column outlets and in the soil at the end of the experiment were consistent with the input concentrations tropical soils frequently have an anion exchange capacity that reduces the transfer of nitrates and accumulates them in the soil feder et al 2020 the nitisols present in this study contained positively charged mineral phases and poorly crystallized phases extractable with oxalate hence between 15 and 50 cm depth mineral nitrogen extracted with molar kcl accumulated significantly in the tww columns nitrate and ammonium solution concentrations at the outlet were negligible at 1 m depth blum et al 2013 measured nmin concentrations in solution of 9 3 mg l 1 after tww nmin 21 mg l 1 and 6 7 mg l 1 without irrigation in an oxisol cropped with sugarcane after applying liquid manure on a nitisol feder et al 2015 measured fivefold lower nitrate concentrations at the maximum of the breakthrough curve at 85 cm depth than input concentrations similarly duan et al 2010 measured a significant decrease in nitrate concentrations in soil solution between the beginning and end of their experiment 3 and 0 5 mg kg 1 soil respectively averaged over the soil profile after a few irrigations with 1000 mm tww nmin 12 mg l 1 over a 1 year period this confirmed that nitrate and ammonium ions systematically decrease in soil solution because they are taken up by the crop or are adsorbed libutti et al 2018 measured a punctual increase in soil mineral nitrogen in the first year of a tomato crop cycle after tww irrigation but no significant differences in subsequent years and different crops lal et al 2015 measured a significant increase in soil mineral nitrogen after 8 years of tww irrigation nmin 12 8 mg l 1 on different crops following tww irrigation in our study mineral nitrogen was thus essentially stored in the soil and remained available to the crop for at least 2 years at a depth within reach of the roots the dynamics of the other major elements at the column outlets were consistent with the concentrations supplied at the column inlets and with the variations in exchangeable base contents in the soil at the end of the experiment concentrations of calcium magnesium chlorides and sulfates at the tww column outlets reached constant values with a ratio of close to 0 8 only potassium did not reach the same concentrations as at the column inlets and continued to accumulate in soils after 20 pv this accumulation resulted in an increase in exchangeable potassium throughout the soil profile in the tww columns however libutti et al 2018 did not measure differences in exchangeable potassium but rather an increase in exchangeable calcium and magnesium for the second crop in the second year of their study elfanssi et al 2018 measured a significant increase in exchangeable calcium magnesium and potassium after irrigation with untreated raw water 16 33 2 4 and 8 5 cmol c kg 1 respectively or tww 14 7 2 2 and 8 1 cmol c kg 1 respectively compared to good quality water 14 1 2 11 and 7 cmol c kg 1 respectively ayoub et al 2016 measured a significant increase in exchangeable calcium magnesium and potassium in the surface and subsurface horizons of soils irrigated with tww compared to non irrigated soils and soils irrigated with groundwater between the first and second year of their study abegunrin et al 2016 observed disparate results depending on the depth crop and type of tww provided however the control treatment always showed the lowest calcium magnesium and exchangeable potassium levels in the surface horizon compared to tww in contrast tarchouna et al 2010 measured higher calcium and magnesium concentrations in a modality irrigated with tww and lower potassium concentrations these authors explained that high calcium and magnesium levels promote potassium uptake by the plant as well as its desorption and leaching thus in addition to the concentrations of these elements in tww their removal by the plant and their competition for adsorption or leaching could explain the differences observed between studies 4 4 potential risks to aquifers the impact of tww irrigation on groundwater is essentially analyzed by taking into account the chemical elements taken up by the sugar cane the elements adsorbed on the soil mineral exchange surfaces leachated with the soil solution or lost by volatilization plant uptake was not studied in this study however it is well known oliveira et al 2018 and fertilization is calculated a priori to achieve a specific yield for a given soil and plant type ghube et al 2017 thus the plant takes up the major chemical elements provided by fertilization n p and k as well as those already present and available in the soil piouceau et al 2020 the calculation of fertilization is a crucial step since fertilizers represent a major cost for the farmer wassenaar et al 2014 however any chemical elements that are not taken up by the plant are likely to either accumulate in the soil or contaminate groundwater qadir et al 2010 in our study the flux of chemical elements at the outlet of the soil columns therefore corresponds to the extreme situation when the plant does not intercept any chemical elements absence of plant root system still too undeveloped flux between crop rows etc the chemical analyses of the major elements of the leachates at the soil column outlet and the final measurements of the exchangeable bases present dynamics consistent with the quality of the tww the impact of tww or high salt irrigation water on groundwater is one of the major potential risks toze 2006 indeed to avoid salinisation or sodisation it is necessary to provide more water than the crop needs to leach the soluble salts and avoid their accumulation in the soil elgallal et al 2016 however depending on the hydrogeological context this practice induces two major negative impacts to be avoided which are an increase in the level of the water table and a progressive increase in its salt concentrations tww have a major advantage since they are supplied continuously during the crop cycle the nutrients supplied are therefore fractionated and the potential losses are reduced similarly nitrogen losses through volatilization are insignificant with tww compared to applications of organic matter or mineral fertilizer bokhtiar and sakurai 2005 the risk of groundwater contamination after heavy rainfall events is thus also reduced 5 conclusion irrigation with tww is also relevant in humid environmental settings to supplement water and fertilize intensive crops the percentage of tww used in the water balance is lower than in arid environmental conditions which could explain the absence of negative effects on sugarcane crop yields industrial characteristics and soil properties we combined two experiments in a sugarcane field and in the laboratory under the same hydrological conditions but without the sugarcane crop the first experiment clearly highlighted the impact of tww irrigation on sugarcane while the second provided a more general view of the impact on the soil indeed the apparent contradictions between the studies in terms of changes in ph organic carbon content and exchangeable base contents could be explained by the variability in element concentrations in the tww their uptake by crops their competition for adsorption or leaching and the hydric conditions short term impacts of irrigation with tww were for example an increase in ph values compared with the initial value which results in increased availability of trace elements and heavy metals and thus reducing the risk of heavy metal uptake by plants however a soil ph above 8 reduces the bioavailability of micronutrients to crops and subsequently impacts their
