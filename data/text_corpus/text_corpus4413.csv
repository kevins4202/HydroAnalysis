22065,tidal stream turbines spend most of time in a shear flow environment which leads to non uniformity effect in stream vertical profile to better understanding of such effect on tidal stream turbine performance the hydrodynamic performance and comparison between a bare turbine and a diffuser augmented turbine under shear flow condition were numerically investigated to closer to the real working environment of tidal stream turbine three major factors influence on hydrodynamic performance including flow shear rates yaw angle and arrangement rule in array were discussed in detail it is found that the different shear rate of flow will result in power and axis thrust slightly amplitude comparing with the uniform flow and a diffuser turbine will further amplify this effect comparing with a bare turbine the greater the yaw angle is the more power and axis thrust is reduced additionally there are advantageous interaction and disadvantage interaction in the wake effect on the energy extraction performance in the turbine array the output power for each case is relatively concentrated at lower tip speed ratio tsr and divergent at higher tsr furthermore each turbine in array operating at near 2d flow distance and relative deviation angle of 45 reaches its maximum c p keywords tidal stream turbine computational fluid dynamic shear flow yaw angle turbine array 1 introduction nowadays general concerns of global warming along with the disadvantages caused by fossil fuels leading to an increased focus on the environmentally friendly renewable energy application for years ellabban et al 2014 some of renewable energy such as on shore wind or solar are used widely heide et al 2010 on the other hand tidal energy is a type of clean energy sources that is still to be exploited anywhere near its full potential in the future researchers and institutions spend time and money on this type of energy in recent years blunden et al 2007 tidal stream turbines are currently being developed as the energy converted devices a variety kind of turbine has been proposed but the most widely deployed systems are horizontal axis turbines with a two or three bladed rotor olczak et al 2016 and their optimal use is one of the most important things besides it should be noted the horizontal axis diffuser augmented turbine technology offers opportunities for the development of conventional hydropower from currents running at low velocities mainly because diffuser technologies enhance turbine performance silva et al 2018 although research on tidal stream turbines deal with several areas of interest the most investigated topic is definitely the power performance issue brunetti et al 2019 over the next decades it seems possible that thousands of turbines will be placed all over the world turbines in tidal current are facing additional challenges due to harsher conditions in such environment large tidal turbine system presents its own physical challenges which make it difficult and costly to develop manufacture and maintain leroux et al 2019 besides turbines are subjected to various unsteady and random environments such as shear flow yaw misalignment and wake interaction which could affect the turbine performance yahagi et al 2019 in particular turbines spend most of their life time in non uniform shear tidal current the effect of shear flow condition will be highlighted for tidal stream turbines and the flow domain will become complicated due to shear turbulence möller et al 2016 therefore for tidal stream renewable energy given the cost of designing and testing radically new devices estimation of the power performance finding the optimal configuration is crucial for the design of tidal stream turbines thus making the technology competitive in the renewable energy application many published works studied a large number of oceanographic parameters on tidal turbine power diagram as well as shear flow effects on turbines using experimental and or numerical tools for the experimental way forbush et al 2015 2016 tested a turbine developed by the ocean renewable power company orpc and proposed a method for constructing a non dimensional performance curve in shear flow myers and bahaj 2010 2012 tested a 2 row array full scale marine current energy converter undergoing sea trials in shear flow demonstrated commercial viability of the technology and proposed an appropriate and clear classification that could aid developers in understanding how arrays operate bahaj et al 2007 carried out an experimental and theoretical investigation of the shear flow field around a marine current turbine the numerical model results shown good agreement with the measured experimental data and further work will be conducted to refine the model mulu et al 2015 carried out a detailed comparison of flow field simulation in the u9 kaplan turbine draft tube with experimental velocity and pressure measurements showing the prediction of the flow in the runner cone region however remains delicate and no turbulence model could accurately predict the complex phenomena observed experimentally xia and takagi 2016 used the nearly linear shear flow near miyake island to test a marine current turbine showing the importance of predicting structural loads accurately in shear flow and the analyzed results presented provide reference for the future work draycott et al 2019 used a 1 15 scale tidal turbine model to realize the influence of waves and shear current on tidal turbine the results demonstrated that wave action induces large variations in turbine power and thrust compared to current only conditions gaurier et al 2013 tested a 3 blade horizontal axis tidal turbine under the influence of both current and wave interaction showing the wave current interactions can cause large additional loading amplitudes compared to currents alone with the development of computational fluid dynamics and computer technology recent numerical methods have gradually become a more popular research method on shear flow issue especial for the complex problem ahmed et al 2017 used computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations on a full scale tidal stream turbine focused on the fluctuations in thrust power and blade bending moment from onset mean velocity shear badshah et al 2018 used a cfd and fluid structure interaction fsi tool to analyze the performance evaluation and structural load characterization on a tidal current turbine under uniform and shear flow gillibrand et al 2016 studied the potential effects of energy extraction of tidal turbines on the ambient near bed velocity field and bed shear stress in a coastal channel with strong currents laß et al 2019 presented a bi directional coupling of a bond graph method solver and an unsteady vortex lattice method solver to analyze a tidal turbine in shear flow and in shear flow plus water waves and in order to save computing resources some researcher used a cfd combined bem calculation model to analyze such issue collier et al 2013 and turnock et al 2011 used reynolds averaged navier stokes rans coupling blade element momentum theory rans bemt method to predict the unsteady loads on a tidal turbine in shear flow o rourke et al 2015 analyzed a hydrodynamic performance of a tidal current turbine in shear and yaw misalignment based on a mathematical model of the bemt from the above research results it can be seen that the researches on turbines in shear flow are still in the stage of theoretical exploration and concept model test these research results mainly focused on three aspects 1 fluctuating loads on turbine 2 wake and vortex structure 3 hydrodynamic performance characterization despite this there are still some key technical problems in the development of tidal stream turbines for example the differences in shear flow between a bare turbine system and a diffuser augmented turbine system the hydrodynamic performance under different shear flow and yaw misalignment conditions the interaction between each turbine in array and how this interaction affects the hydrodynamic behavior and energy extracting performance of the turbine array system in this study we present a performance comparison and discuss between a bare turbine and a diffuser augmented turbine as well as turbine arrays in shear flow this paper is organized as follows the numerical method computational model set up and the application background are introduced in section 2 the single turbine performance under different shear rates and yaw angles is introduced in section 3 1 and 3 2 respectively the turbine arrays performance and their interaction are introduced in section 3 3 finally it is concluded in section 4 2 computational setup and application background 2 1 governing equations the incompressible navier stokes equation can be written as 1 u i x i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j f i where u i represents time averaged velocity p is time average pressure ρ is fluid density f i is body force ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress when a rotor with radius r is rotating with angular velocity ω and inlet velocity v it generates thrust and torque the hydrodynamic performance characteristics of the rotor can be defined as the non dimensional coefficients such as the tip speed ratio tsr the power coefficient c p and the thrust coefficient c t which can be computed respectively as follows 3 t s r ω r v 4 c p p 0 5 ρ a v 3 5 c t t 0 5 ρ a v 2 where p represents the output power of rotor t represents rotor axis thrust a represents area of a reference surface for a bare turbine case a is the swept area πr 2 2 2 computational setup in this paper two cases were analyzed including a bare turbine and a diffuser augmented turbine the three dimensional view of the bare and diffuser augmented turbine is shown in fig 1 the diameter d of rotor is 2 m the bare turbine and the diffuser augmented turbine share the same rotor the axis length of the diffuser is 0 5d the relative axis assembly position between rotor and diffuser is 0 15d which reflects the maximum thickness of the diffuser cross annular section the tip clearance between the rotor and diffuser is 0 01d the computations were performed using ansys fluent software fluent 2015 according to the geometry of the turbine and the actual flow conditions the computational domain is cylinder the diameter of the domain is 10d the distance between the center plane of the turbine and the inlet is 5d and the distance between the center planet and the outlet is 10d the mrf model frank 2015 was used to simulate the rotating effects and the computational domain was divided into rotatory zone and stationary zone the rotatory zone is a small cylinder enveloping the rotor boundary conditions were set as velocity inlet an free outflow and a free slip wall condition for the domain walls the rotor was configured inside a rotatory zone as a no slip wall the diffuser surface was also set as a no slip wall the rotatory domain kept the same diameter for the bare turbine and the diffuser augmented turbine the computational domain is shown in fig 2 based on v about 1 54 m s see in see in eq 6 and a reference length is equal to the rotor radius 1 m the reynolds number is about 1 5 106 and assuming a reference length equal to the length of chord line at blade tip element section 0 115 m a reference velocity is the absolute velocity at blade tip it is 9 37 m s at tsr 6 0 the maximum reynolds number is about 1 1 106 at blade tip section when tsr is 6 0 the turbulent model k ω sst menter 1994 was used and employed in the boundary layer to satisfy the requirements of the k ω sst model the grid was more dense and the surface was configured to have prism layers including 6 inflation layers and a y 1 for the rotor s surfaces and y 10 for the diffuser s surfaces a mesh independence assessment of each turbine at 2 m s is shown in table 1 and table 2 which is carried out by analyzing c p and c t of the rotor finally 4 million elements for the rotor and total 8 million to 9 million for the diffuser and rotor were set up the mesh details are shown in fig 3 the experiments and cfd results for the bare turbine and the diffuser augmented turbine are shown in fig 4 the cfd results are in good agreement with the model experimental tests song et al 2019 which verifying the reliability of the numerical method 2 3 geographical application background in this paper the tidal current power generation test field near the zhaitang island in china east sea is taken as the research background jiang et al 2018 shown in fig 5 the max parameters in zhaitang island are wave height 0 6 m wave length 24 8 m as can be seen in fig 5 b the current velocity decrease with increasing of water depth when depth is more than 30 m the effect of bottom friction on velocity attenuation is obvious according to batten et al 2008 a large gradient of tidal current will have a great impact on turbine power performance besides the wave force also has an impact on turbine performance the deeper the water depth the smaller the effect is and the wave force can be neglected when the water depth reaches a half of wave length dean 1984 when depth is beyond 12 m the effects of surface wave can be ignored in summary the hub of turbine is installed at 13 m depth and it is noted that a linear variation in depth is near 13 m depth the coefficient of the linear equation is determined based on fig 5 b shown in eq 6 results listed in this paper all numerical simulations are implemented at shear flow condition by eq 6 6 v 1 54 0 002 h ms 1 3 results 3 1 effect of shear rate the relationship between the c p and c t against tsr in uniform flow and in shear flow with different shear rates for the bare turbine and the diffuser augmented turbine is shown in fig 6 it is observed that the difference between the uniform flow case and the shear flow case is not apparent especially for the bare turbine the results show that c p and c t in the shear flow is slightly bigger than that in the uniform flow since the shear rate is not strong it can be concluded that the effect of shear flow on c p and c t is small if the shear rate is not big although the shear rate in our study is 0 002 a higher shear rate was reported in the tidal current kiyomatsu et al 2014 a larger rate 50shear 0 1 was also carried out by the cfd it is observed that c p and c t have a percentage enhancement in the 50shear case for both turbines even though such effect is not too obvious and this trend is more obvious for the diffuser augmented turbine since the magnitude of the blade force is proportional to the square of the inflow speed and the shear rate flow changes linearly according to the variation of inflow speed and when an axis turbine is applied in tidal stream the shear flow will affect the turbine performance when the flow is through the blade originating from a faster region of the upper stream flow the fact that the bypass flow on the other side with slower stream velocity must accelerate by a larger fraction so that to achieve the same background pressure gradient as that realized by the faster flow bypassing on the upper side of the blade the extra incoming flow is bringing to the upper blade while the incoming flow on lower blade is negative the stronger trailing vortex at the upper blade decelerates the fluid quicker than that on the lower blade therefore the summation of blade forces of rotor in the shear flow is theoretically larger in the axis direction compared to the uniform flow condition additionally a higher shear rate flow condition will result in c p and c t amplitude table 3 shows the comparison results of c p and c t between uniform flow and shear flow for different tsrs although the difference is slightly in whole it seems that the c p and c t are more larger at higher tsr and for the diffuser augmented turbine it further amplify this effect comparing to the bare turbine fig 7 shows the axis torque and thrust of each blade under different shear rates at tsr 4 0 it is observed that a higher shear rate flow condition will result in increasing of thrust and torque acting on blade1 and blade 3 and reduction on blade 2 for both bare and diffuser augmented turbine when one blade reaches top position blade1 the blade can make the most of the flow shear to produce the hydrodynamic forces instead as one blade reaches the bottom position the shear effect is weakest it is clear that shear flow have some effects of thrust and torque acting on the blade because the position of each blade is different at time although the effect is not obvious for example the torque of 50shear flow acting on blade 1 is only bigger than 7 of shear flow for bare turbine and that is only 6 for diffuser turbine the turbulent kinetic energy tke distribution for the bare and diffuser turbines at tsr 4 0 at 1d and 4d position of downstream of rotation plane are presented in fig 8 it is observed a high tke levels is formed for both turbines a similar trend was reported in earlier studies bartl et al 2016 eriksen et al 2017 leroux et al 2019 the strongest tke levels are observed for locations behind the tips of the rotor blades at 1d which is clearly to identify at 4d this area seems to be smaller but the levels are still distinct the sharp levels decrease in magnitude and dissolved to their surroundings and the tip vortices decayed into turbulent motions furthermore the 50shear cases result in higher tke level compare with the shear cases and the difference of tke level behind each blade is obviously enlarged comparing with the shear flow besides it seem the shear rate have more obvious effect on the diffuser augmented turbine comparing to the bare turbine 3 2 effect of yaw angle the relationship between the c p and c t against tsr in different shear yaw flow for the bare turbine and the diffuser augmented turbine is shown in fig 9 it can be observed that yaw angle have a great influence on the performance of both turbines the greater the yaw angle is the more power and axis thrust is reduced besides the yaw angle also affects the variation of the c p and c t curve of both turbines the maximum tsr point was shifted to lower tsr position with increasing yaw angle the changing yaw angle of the turbine have changed the local relative attack angle distribution around the blade section and therefore changed the energy harvesting performance of the system it is also seen that the diffuser augmented turbine has a better energy harvesting performance comparing with the bare turbine for the yaw angle of 15 the c pmax reduces about 8 comparing to that of the non yawed for bare turbine and that is 6 for diffuser augmented turbine for the yaw angle of 30 the c pmax reduces about 27 comparing to that of the non yawed for bare turbine and it is 23 for the diffuser augmented turbine for the yaw angle of 45 the c pmax reduces about 52 comparing to that of the non yawed for bare turbine and it is 50 for the diffuser augmented turbine when at lower yaw angle flow condition the diffuser reduce base pressure behind the rotor and lead to a lower cavity pressure due to enhanced diffusion potential and a greater rotor plane velocity therefore the diffuser augmented turbine is able to perform better in yawed flow than the bare turbine cresswell et al 2015 however it should be noted that an over big yaw angle may result in stall and separation which is not conducive to the system works stably and reliably e g ohya et al 2008 igra 1981 especially for the diffuser augmented turbine the separation and stall occurred closer to the edge of the diffuse shown in fig 11 with increasing yaw angles the beneficial effect of the diffuser decreases and a greater diffusion of the diffuser forward section lead to a negative pressure gradient and a velocity reduction and the energy harvesting performance will not remain fig 10 shows the axis torque and thrust of each blades under different yaw angles at tsr 4 0 it is observed that the greater the yaw angle is the more torque and thrust is reduced moreover the difference provided by each blade is very large comparing to the result of no yawed angle in fig 7 especially to bare turbine which indicated the hydrodynamic non balance force was enlarged in yaw flow the velocity distribution on yawed flow conditions on longitudinal plane at tsr 4 0 is shown in fig 11 it can be observed that yaw flow condition leads to an asymmetrical flow structure and induce velocity and momentum in spanwise for both turbines thus the downstream flow behavior and structure become more unstable and extremely complex the velocity distribution in transverse plane at different downstream locations at tsr 4 0 is shown in fig 12 it is worth mentioning that adding low shear basically will not change the flow structure comparing to uniform when it is yawed bartl et al 2018 in non yawed flow condition this three bladed shape flow structure is observed for bare turbine case and a ring flow structure is observed for diffuser augmented turbine case for yaw flow condition the flow structure is laterally deflected and deformed accordingly resulting in a highly complex flow field in the downstream an amount of streamwise momentum is lost in the axis direction and a cross stream momentum in spanwise is induced the wake flow is deflected sideways by this lateral force component effect and it is clearly to see the lower velocity zone was shifted from 1d to 3d this area is observed to be smaller and start recovering to normal zone for higher downstream distances besides the lower velocity zone was also separated in the center of the deflected wake with downstream distance increased for the bare turbine case as turbine cannot be avoided to operate in yaw flow in actual ocean environment the complex flow structure and unstable flow behavior often occur such as the wake interaction among the hub blade and diffuser besides turbine could be significantly affected from the unbalance hydrodynamic loads acting on each blade these effects will become more serious as yaw angle increased lee et al 2019 especially for the diffuser augmented turbine as the diffuser can further enhance loads and corresponding negative effects on the system moreover there would be excessive and unexpected loads added to the shaft and gearbox grujicic et al 2013 yaw flow condition is a crucial factor when operating a turbine and the hydrodynamic behavior and fatigue lifecycle of each component should always be accounted for when considering designing a tidal current turbine system 3 3 effect of array configurations to illustrate the effects associated with turbine array this section presented in plane four turbines array system in side direction under shear flow including the bare turbine case and diffuser augmented turbine case the schematic of the turbine array is shown in fig 13 in this section the boundary condition and mesh setup remained unchanged to sect 2 2 to maximize the output power and produce power greater than four times that of a corresponding single turbine the relative deviation angle θ and the relative axial distance between hub center in flow direction l were used to study the effects of arrangement on hydrodynamic performance the hydrodynamic interaction among the four turbines determines the whole output power of the array system which is governed by the configuration of the system therefore in addition to the location configuration parameters of system tsr and rotating direction also should be considered according to chawdhary et al 2017 and olczak et al 2016 the angular velocity of array turbines in side direction and with same rotating direction varied slightly in time due to unsteadiness in the approach flow and without the precise and constant angular velocity control during the experimental test in this section assuming that the four turbines have the same angular velocity and rotating direction counter clockwise versus tsr under the same operating conditions for the convenience of differentiating the array cases with different l and θ in a follow up analysis the notation xd x is applied for instance 2d 45 stands for the axial distance is 2d and the relative deviation angle is 45 the average c p and c t of the bare turbines array and the single turbine versus tsr in seven array arrangement rules are shown in fig 14 it can be observed that the different arrangement rules have a little effect on c p and c t of the array system and the performance curves show a similarity between each array and the single turbine except for 1d 30 case the difference in c p at tsr 4 0 in each case comparing to the single turbine is less than 3 except for 1d 30 case the difference of c p in each turbine of array with a single bare turbine versus tsr is shown in fig 15 since the output performance variations of array is the main goal on the current discussion the hydrodynamic interaction among each turbine in array comes from streamwise wake and spanwise disturbance it can be observed that each turbine in array shows different performance versus tsr for different arrangement rules for the turbine spacing presented here the results show that the arrangement rules of 2d 45 and 2d 30 have a better performance table 4 shows the average c p value and corresponding standard deviation sd of c p for the different bare turbine array arrangement rules at tsr 3 5 4 5 from the presented data it can be seen that some turbines in array do not reach the single turbine level 2d 45 and 2d 30 have a better c p value and both have a very close performance however as for 2d 45 case the standard deviation of c p is smaller which illustrate the 2d 45 have a relatively stable operation characteristics thus the 2d 45 bare turbine array has the optimum performance when the downstream turbine had an overlapping wake flow from the upstream turbine such as 1d 45 case 2d 30 case and 1d 30 case such positions lead to large differences in hydrodynamic performance when the overlapping part within a certain range as can be seen in fig 15 b d the results show the enhancement in c p for downstream turbine t3 t4 and the enhancement of c p for downstream turbines for 1d 45 array is much more obvious than that for 2d 30 however when the overlapping part reaches a bigger range shown in fig 15 a all downstream turbines t2 t3 t4 have a significant drop off in c p versus tsr these trends are similar and agreement with apsley et al 2018 and myers et al 2011 which suggests that the overlapping wake part size has a great impact on the downstream turbine performance due to the relatively channel blockage effect and lower wake spreading effect in the flow leading to an increase in the bypass velocity on either side of the array particularly for the outermost downstream turbine of the array so that the downstream turbines can effectively capture energy from the bypass flow of the upstream turbines thus the downstream turbines can experience more thrust and torque than the upstream turbine as can be also seen from fig 15 the difference in c p for each case is relatively concentrated at lower tsr and divergent at higher tsr which indicates the effect of angular velocity on turbine performance in array cannot be ignored the bigger the tsr is the stronger the influence of interaction from wake and disturbance of the array system is the average c p and c t of the seven different diffuser augmented turbines array and a single turbine versus tsr are shown in fig 16 contrary to the bare turbines array the different arrangement rules have a significant effect on c p and c t of the array system the results indicate that the c p and c t of the turbines array is larger than the single turbine at low tsr range 3 0 3 75 except for 1d 30 case and 1d 45 case which is an indication of the positive effect of the diffuser augmented turbines array in addition to the relative channel blockage effect there is also presumably the flow field around each turbine at this flow condition has characteristics closer to those of a flow having higher free stream turbulence devinant et al 2002 comparing to the bare turbines array fig 17 also shows the difference of c p in each diffuser augmented turbine of array with a single diffuser augmented turbine versus tsr following the same comparison it can be observed that the output power of each turbine in all diffuser augmented turbines array is increased at lower tsr and the c p divergence is stronger than the bare turbines array similarly as can be seen from fig 17 the difference in c p for each case is relatively concentrated at lower tsr and divergent at higher tsr likewise the results show that the arrangement rules of 2d 45 and 1d 60 have a better performance table 5 shows the average c p value and corresponding standard deviation of c p for the different diffuser augmented turbine array arrangement rules at tsr 3 5 4 5 from the presented data it can be seen that some turbines in array do not reach the single turbine level 2d 45 and 1d 60 have a better c p value and both have a very close performance similarly the standard deviation of c p in 2d 45 is smaller which illustrate the 2d 45 have a relatively stable operation characteristics the 2d 45 diffuser augmented turbines array has the optimum performance therefore for the flow conditions and the axis tidal stream turbines described in the study it may be concluded that the array operating at near 2d flow distance and relative deviation angle of 45 reaches its maximum c p comparing with the bare turbines array in fig 15 the overlapping wake flow effect in 1d 45 case and 2d 30 case of diffuser augmented turbines array seems to be quite different as mentioned above the interaction among the each turbine in array mainly comes from streamwise wake and spanwise disturbance due to the diffuser rectifying flow effect in diffuser augmented turbine the interaction in streamwise becomes stronger and that in spanwise becomes weaker the downstream turbines experience a lower onset velocity and ineffectively gain energy in the bypass flow of the upstream turbines especially at higher tsr as can be seen in fig 17 b and d the results show enhancement in c p for each turbine at tsr 3 0 in 1d 45 case and enhancement in c p near at tsr 3 0 3 5 in 2d 30 case no significant enhancement of the downstream turbines in the two cases was observed comparing to the upstream turbine at tsr 3 5 5 0 moreover as for the 1d 30 case there was also a significant drop off in c p versus tsr shown in fig 17 a thus for the turbines array presented here it may be concluded that the overlapping wake effect is not conducive to overall power performance improvement for both bare turbine arrays and diffuser augmented turbine arrays although some turbines at tsrs may be enhanced the above results show that there are advantageous interaction and disadvantage interaction in the wake effect on the energy extraction performance in the axis turbine array on the premise of guaranteeing normal maintenance the output power in array can be enhanced effectively when at appropriate arrangement rules of course the optimum distance of spacing between turbines also depends on several parameters such as the turbines physical parameters and tsr the velocity distribution on longitudinal plane for turbine array at tsr 4 0 is shown in fig 18 the typical interaction of flow including the center line downstream wake recovery together with persistent flow from the upstream turbines the ambient wake separates the adjacent wake and the individual downstream wake can be clearly identified due to the lateral staggering and close proximity of each turbine the flow field shows a combined flow wake between the adjacent turbines for the 1d 45 arrays a belt of slower flowing is observed at the array center line downstream of t4 in fig 18 a comparing to that of each turbine in fig 18 c likewise there is also a belt of slower flowing observed at the array center line downstream of t1 and t4 in fig 18 b comparing to that of each turbine in fig 18 d the lower velocity behind the turbine means more kinetic energy absorbed by turbine these further explain the reason of the t4 in 1d 45 bare turbine array has the highest power output level comparing to other turbines in fig 18 a or c for the same reason t1 and t4 in 1d 45 diffuser augmented turbine array have higher power output level comparing to other turbines the velocity distribution in transverse plane for turbine array located at 2d downstream at tsr 4 0 is shown in fig 19 the velocity profiles of 2d 45 and 3d 45 array look very similar to each other and the velocity distribution is nearly central symmetric however there is obvious mixed flowing wake between the adjacent turbines observed in 1d 45 array and the zone of lower velocity moves to lateral especially the diffuser causes extra blockage by increasing the wake area and the ambient flow between the initial wake and the downstream turbines which leads to smaller spanwise wake extent at region of far away center line area according to the above results fig 20 illustrates a multi row arrangement rule of 12 turbines based on the single optimal array 2d 45 respectively in front second and third rows corresponding streamwise spacing is 4d the spanwise spacing is 3d and the corresponding vertical spacing is 2d the average c p for each row of the multi row bare turbine array and multi row diffuser augmented turbine array versus tsr are shown in fig 21 it can be observed that each row have a close c p value to the corresponding single 2d 45 array row and all have exceeded the single turbine level for both multi row arrays the comments of the multi row array are similar to the single row array in the front row relatively channel blockage effect increasing the bypass velocity on the either side of the array the downstream rows turbine arrays can effectively capture energy from the bypass flow of the front row thus the second row and third row have a little higher c p value 4 conclusions in the present study the hydrodynamic performance and comparison between a bare turbine system and a diffuser augmented turbine system under shear flow condition considered the effects of shear rates yaw flow conditions and array configurations were numerically investigated the following conclusions are drawn for an axis turbine applied in tidal stream the effect of shear flow on turbine performance is small if the shear rate is not big especially for the bare turbine a higher shear rate flow condition will result in power and axis thrust amplitude and a diffuser will further amplify of this effect comparing to a bare turbine a larger shear rate flow condition will have more sever fluctuations of the device loading than a uniform flow condition it is important to focus on turbine fatigue design in ocean areas with higher shear rate yaw angle has a great influence on turbine performance the greater the yaw angle is the more power and axis thrust is reduced besides yaw angle also affects the variation of the c p and c t curve the tsr corresponding to the maximum power coefficient was shifted to lower value with the increase of yaw angle the diffuser augmented turbine has a better energy harvesting performance comparing with the bare turbine yaw flow condition is a crucial factor when operating a turbine and the hydrodynamic behavior and fatigue lifecycle of each component will be overall different for both bare turbine and diffuser augmented turbine the different arrangement rules have a little effect on the bare turbine array average performance however each turbine in array has very different performance versus tsr for each arrangement rules contrary to the bare turbines array the different arrangement rules have a significant effect on average performance of diffuser augmented turbine array the output power is larger than the single turbine of almost all arrays at lower tsr and the c p divergence is stronger than that of the bare turbine array for the flow conditions and the axis tidal stream turbines described in the study the array operating at near 2d flow distance and relative deviation angle of 45 reaches its maximum c p for the turbine array presented here the overlapping wake flow effect on performance of the bare turbine array is different with the diffuser augmented turbine array and it is not conducive to overall power performance improvement although some turbines at tsrs may be enhanced the hydrodynamic interaction in array came from streamwise wake and spanwise disturbance there are advantageous interaction and disadvantage interaction in the wake effect on the energy extraction performance in the axis turbine array the output power for each case is relatively concentrated at lower tsr and divergent at higher tsr the bigger the tsr is the stronger the influence of interaction from wake and disturbance of the array system is on the premise of guaranteeing normal maintenance the output power in array can be enhanced effectively when at appropriate arrangement rules of course the output performance from tidal stream turbines at prescribed position in these arrays in present study also can be used to those for the multi row arrays however it should be noted that turbulence and velocity shear is much more complex and the onset flow direction may change over the tidal cycle in a real tidal flow from this point the turbine interactions presented are probably exaggerated or narrowed therefore the experimental tests of a full scale array system at different turbulence intensities and free stream velocities will be carried out in future work which will focus on better understanding the interactions and offering a clearer design instructions of turbine arrays credit author statement song ke data curation writing original draft preparation visualization investigation wen quan wang

22065,tidal stream turbines spend most of time in a shear flow environment which leads to non uniformity effect in stream vertical profile to better understanding of such effect on tidal stream turbine performance the hydrodynamic performance and comparison between a bare turbine and a diffuser augmented turbine under shear flow condition were numerically investigated to closer to the real working environment of tidal stream turbine three major factors influence on hydrodynamic performance including flow shear rates yaw angle and arrangement rule in array were discussed in detail it is found that the different shear rate of flow will result in power and axis thrust slightly amplitude comparing with the uniform flow and a diffuser turbine will further amplify this effect comparing with a bare turbine the greater the yaw angle is the more power and axis thrust is reduced additionally there are advantageous interaction and disadvantage interaction in the wake effect on the energy extraction performance in the turbine array the output power for each case is relatively concentrated at lower tip speed ratio tsr and divergent at higher tsr furthermore each turbine in array

introduction nowadays general concerns of global warming along with the disadvantages caused by fossil fuels leading to an increased focus on the environmentally friendly renewable energy application for years ellabban et al 2014 some of renewable energy such as on shore wind or solar are used widely heide et al 2010 on the other hand tidal energy is a type of clean energy sources that is still to be exploited anywhere near its full potential in the future researchers and institutions spend time and money on this type of energy in recent years blunden et al 2007 tidal stream turbines are currently being developed as the energy converted devices a variety kind of turbine has been proposed but the most widely deployed systems are horizontal axis turbines with a two or three bladed rotor olczak et al 2016 and their optimal use is one of the most important things besides it should be noted the horizontal axis diffuser augmented turbine technology offers opportunities for the development of conventional hydropower from currents running at low velocities mainly because diffuser technologies enhance turbine performance silva et al 2018 although research on tidal stream turbines deal with several areas of interest the most investigated topic is definitely the power performance issue brunetti et al 2019 over the next decades it seems possible that thousands of turbines will be placed all over the world turbines in tidal current are facing additional challenges due to harsher conditions in such environment large tidal turbine system presents its own physical challenges which make it difficult and costly to develop manufacture and maintain leroux et al 2019 besides turbines are subjected to various unsteady and random environments such as shear flow yaw misalignment and wake interaction which could affect the turbine performance yahagi et al 2019 in particular turbines spend most of their life time in non uniform shear tidal current the effect of shear flow condition will be highlighted for tidal stream turbines and the flow domain will become complicated due to shear turbulence möller et al 2016 therefore for tidal stream renewable energy given the cost of designing and testing radically new devices estimation of the power performance finding the optimal configuration is crucial for the design of tidal stream turbines thus making the technology competitive in the renewable energy application many published works studied a large number of oceanographic parameters on tidal turbine power diagram as well as shear flow effects on turbines using experimental and or numerical tools for the experimental way forbush et al 2015 2016 tested a turbine developed by the ocean renewable power company orpc and proposed a method for constructing a non dimensional performance curve in shear flow myers and bahaj 2010 2012 tested a 2 row array full scale marine current energy converter undergoing sea trials in shear flow demonstrated commercial viability of the technology and proposed an appropriate and clear classification that could aid developers in understanding how arrays operate bahaj et al 2007 carried out an experimental and theoretical investigation of the shear flow field around a marine current turbine the numerical model results shown good agreement with the measured experimental data and further work will be conducted to refine the model mulu et al 2015 carried out a detailed comparison of flow field simulation in the u9 kaplan turbine draft tube with experimental velocity and pressure measurements showing the prediction of the flow in the runner cone region however remains delicate and no turbulence model could accurately predict the complex phenomena observed experimentally xia and takagi 2016 used the nearly linear shear flow near miyake island to test a marine current turbine showing the importance of predicting structural loads accurately in shear flow and the analyzed results presented provide reference for the future work draycott et al 2019 used a 1 15 scale tidal turbine model to realize the influence of waves and shear current on tidal turbine the results demonstrated that wave action induces large variations in turbine power and thrust compared to current only conditions gaurier et al 2013 tested a 3 blade horizontal axis tidal turbine under the influence of both current and wave interaction showing the wave current interactions can cause large additional loading amplitudes compared to currents alone with the development of computational fluid dynamics and computer technology recent numerical methods have gradually become a more popular research method on shear flow issue especial for the complex problem ahmed et al 2017 used computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations on a full scale tidal stream turbine focused on the fluctuations in thrust power and blade bending moment from onset mean velocity shear badshah et al 2018 used a cfd and fluid structure interaction fsi tool to analyze the performance evaluation and structural load characterization on a tidal current turbine under uniform and shear flow gillibrand et al 2016 studied the potential effects of energy extraction of tidal turbines on the ambient near bed velocity field and bed shear stress in a coastal channel with strong currents laß et al 2019 presented a bi directional coupling of a bond graph method solver and an unsteady vortex lattice method solver to analyze a tidal turbine in shear flow and in shear flow plus water waves and in order to save computing resources some researcher used a cfd combined bem calculation model to analyze such issue collier et al 2013 and turnock et al 2011 used reynolds averaged navier stokes rans coupling blade element momentum theory rans bemt method to predict the unsteady loads on a tidal turbine in shear flow o rourke et al 2015 analyzed a hydrodynamic performance of a tidal current turbine in shear and yaw misalignment based on a mathematical model of the bemt from the above research results it can be seen that the researches on turbines in shear flow are still in the stage of theoretical exploration and concept model test these research results mainly focused on three aspects 1 fluctuating loads on turbine 2 wake and vortex structure 3 hydrodynamic performance characterization despite this there are still some key technical problems in the development of tidal stream turbines for example the differences in shear flow between a bare turbine system and a diffuser augmented turbine system the hydrodynamic performance under different shear flow and yaw misalignment conditions the interaction between each turbine in array and how this interaction affects the hydrodynamic behavior and energy extracting performance of the turbine array system in this study we present a performance comparison and discuss between a bare turbine and a diffuser augmented turbine as well as turbine arrays in shear flow this paper is organized as follows the numerical method computational model set up and the application background are introduced in section 2 the single turbine performance under different shear rates and yaw angles is introduced in section 3 1 and 3 2 respectively the turbine arrays performance and their interaction are introduced in section 3 3 finally it is concluded in section 4 2 computational setup and application background 2 1 governing equations the incompressible navier stokes equation can be written as 1 u i x i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j f i where u i represents time averaged velocity p is time average pressure ρ is fluid density f i is body force ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress when a rotor with radius r is rotating with angular velocity ω and inlet velocity v it generates thrust and torque the hydrodynamic performance characteristics of the rotor can be defined as the non dimensional coefficients such as the tip speed ratio tsr the power coefficient c p and the thrust coefficient c t which can be computed respectively as follows 3 t s r ω r v 4 c p p 0 5 ρ a v 3 5 c t t 0 5 ρ a v 2 where p represents the output power of rotor t represents rotor axis thrust a represents area of a reference surface for a bare turbine case a is the swept area πr 2 2 2 computational setup in this paper two cases were analyzed including a bare turbine and a diffuser augmented turbine the three dimensional view of the bare and diffuser augmented turbine is shown in fig 1 the diameter d of rotor is 2 m the bare turbine and the diffuser augmented turbine share the same rotor the axis length of the diffuser is 0 5d the relative axis assembly position between rotor and diffuser is 0 15d which reflects the maximum thickness of the diffuser cross annular section the tip clearance between the rotor and diffuser is 0 01d the computations were performed using ansys fluent software fluent 2015 according to the geometry of the turbine and the actual flow conditions the computational domain is cylinder the diameter of the domain is 10d the distance between the center plane of the turbine and the inlet is 5d and the distance between the center planet and the outlet is 10d the mrf model frank 2015 was used to simulate the rotating effects and the computational domain was divided into rotatory zone and stationary zone the rotatory zone is a small cylinder enveloping the rotor boundary conditions were set as velocity inlet an free outflow and a free slip wall condition for the domain walls the rotor was configured inside a rotatory zone as a no slip wall the diffuser surface was also set as a no slip wall the rotatory domain kept the same diameter for the bare turbine and the diffuser augmented turbine the computational domain is shown in fig 2 based on v about 1 54 m s see in see in eq 6 and a reference length is equal to the rotor radius 1 m the reynolds number is about 1 5 106 and assuming a reference length equal to the length of chord line at blade tip element section 0 115 m a reference velocity is the absolute velocity at blade tip it is 9 37 m s at tsr 6 0 the maximum reynolds number is about 1 1 106 at blade tip section when tsr is 6 0 the turbulent model k ω sst menter 1994 was used and employed in the boundary layer to satisfy the requirements of the k ω sst model the grid was more dense and the surface was configured to have prism layers including 6 inflation layers and a y 1 for the rotor s surfaces and y 10 for the diffuser s surfaces a mesh independence assessment of each turbine at 2 m s is shown in table 1 and table 2 which is carried out by analyzing c p and c t of the rotor finally 4 million elements for the rotor and total 8 million to 9 million for the diffuser and rotor were set up the mesh details are shown in fig 3 the experiments and cfd results for the bare turbine and the diffuser augmented turbine are shown in fig 4 the cfd results are in good agreement with the model experimental tests song et al 2019 which verifying the reliability of the numerical method 2 3 geographical application background in this paper the tidal current power generation test field near the zhaitang island in china east sea is taken as the research background jiang et al 2018 shown in fig 5 the max parameters in zhaitang island are wave height 0 6 m wave length 24 8 m as can be seen in fig 5 b the current velocity decrease with increasing of water depth when depth is more than 30 m the effect of bottom friction on velocity attenuation is obvious according to batten et al 2008 a large gradient of tidal current will have a great impact on turbine power performance besides the wave force also has an impact on turbine performance the deeper the water depth the smaller the effect is and the wave force can be neglected when the water depth reaches a half of wave length dean 1984 when depth is beyond 12 m the effects of surface wave can be ignored in summary the hub of turbine is installed at 13 m depth and it is noted that a linear variation in depth is near 13 m depth the coefficient of the linear equation is determined based on fig 5 b shown in eq 6 results listed in this paper all numerical simulations are implemented at shear flow condition by eq 6 6 v 1 54 0 002 h ms 1 3 results 3 1 effect of shear rate the relationship between the c p and c t against tsr in uniform flow and in shear flow with different shear rates for the bare turbine and the diffuser augmented turbine is shown in fig 6 it is observed that the difference between the uniform flow case and the shear flow case is not apparent especially for the bare turbine the results show that c p and c t in the shear flow is slightly bigger than that in the uniform flow since the shear rate is not strong it can be concluded that the effect of shear flow on c p and c t is small if the shear rate is not big although the shear rate in our study is 0 002 a higher shear rate was reported in the tidal current kiyomatsu et al 2014 a larger rate 50shear 0 1 was also carried out by the cfd it is observed that c p and c t have a percentage enhancement in the 50shear case for both turbines even though such effect is not too obvious and this trend is more obvious for the diffuser augmented turbine since the magnitude of the blade force is proportional to the square of the inflow speed and the shear rate flow changes linearly according to the variation of inflow speed and when an axis turbine is applied in tidal stream the shear flow will affect the turbine performance when the flow is through the blade originating from a faster region of the upper stream flow the fact that the bypass flow on the other side with slower stream velocity must accelerate by a larger fraction so that to achieve the same background pressure gradient as that realized by the faster flow bypassing on the upper side of the blade the extra incoming flow is bringing to the upper blade while the incoming flow on lower blade is negative the stronger trailing vortex at the upper blade decelerates the fluid quicker than that on the lower blade therefore the summation of blade forces of rotor in the shear flow is theoretically larger in the axis direction compared to the uniform flow condition additionally a higher shear rate flow condition will result in c p and c t amplitude table 3 shows the comparison results of c p and c t between uniform flow and shear flow for different tsrs although the difference is slightly in whole it seems that the c p and c t are more larger at higher tsr and for the diffuser augmented turbine it further amplify this effect comparing to the bare turbine fig 7 shows the axis torque and thrust of each blade under different shear rates at tsr 4 0 it is observed that a higher shear rate flow condition will result in increasing of thrust and torque acting on blade1 and blade 3 and reduction on blade 2 for both bare and diffuser augmented turbine when one blade reaches top position blade1 the blade can make the most of the flow shear to produce the hydrodynamic forces instead as one blade reaches the bottom position the shear effect is weakest it is clear that shear flow have some effects of thrust and torque acting on the blade because the position of each blade is different at time although the effect is not obvious for example the torque of 50shear flow acting on blade 1 is only bigger than 7 of shear flow for bare turbine and that is only 6 for diffuser turbine the turbulent kinetic energy tke distribution for the bare and diffuser turbines at tsr 4 0 at 1d and 4d position of downstream of rotation plane are presented in fig 8 it is observed a high tke levels is formed for both turbines a similar trend was reported in earlier studies bartl et al 2016 eriksen et al 2017 leroux et al 2019 the strongest tke levels are observed for locations behind the tips of the rotor blades at 1d which is clearly to identify at 4d this area seems to be smaller but the levels are still distinct the sharp levels decrease in magnitude and dissolved to their surroundings and the tip vortices decayed into turbulent motions furthermore the 50shear cases result in higher tke level compare with the shear cases and the difference of tke level behind each blade is obviously enlarged comparing with the shear flow besides it seem the shear rate have more obvious effect on the diffuser augmented turbine comparing to the bare turbine 3 2 effect of yaw angle the relationship between the c p and c t against tsr in different shear yaw flow for the bare turbine and the diffuser augmented turbine is shown in fig 9 it can be observed that yaw angle have a great influence on the performance of both turbines the greater the yaw angle is the more power and axis thrust is reduced besides the yaw angle also affects the variation of the c p and c t curve of both turbines the maximum tsr point was shifted to lower tsr position with increasing yaw angle the changing yaw angle of the turbine have changed the local relative attack angle distribution around the blade section and therefore changed the energy harvesting performance of the system it is also seen that the diffuser augmented turbine has a better energy harvesting performance comparing with the bare turbine for the yaw angle of 15 the c pmax reduces about 8 comparing to that of the non yawed for bare turbine and that is 6 for diffuser augmented turbine for the yaw angle of 30 the c pmax reduces about 27 comparing to that of the non yawed for bare turbine and it is 23 for the diffuser augmented turbine for the yaw angle of 45 the c pmax reduces about 52 comparing to that of the non yawed for bare turbine and it is 50 for the diffuser augmented turbine when at lower yaw angle flow condition the diffuser reduce base pressure behind the rotor and lead to a lower cavity pressure due to enhanced diffusion potential and a greater rotor plane velocity therefore the diffuser augmented turbine is able to perform better in yawed flow than the bare turbine cresswell et al 2015 however it should be noted that an over big yaw angle may result in stall and separation which is not conducive to the system works stably and reliably e g ohya et al 2008 igra 1981 especially for the diffuser augmented turbine the separation and stall occurred closer to the edge of the diffuse shown in fig 11 with increasing yaw angles the beneficial effect of the diffuser decreases and a greater diffusion of the diffuser forward section lead to a negative pressure gradient and a velocity reduction and the energy harvesting performance will not remain fig 10 shows the axis torque and thrust of each blades under different yaw angles at tsr 4 0 it is observed that the greater the yaw angle is the more torque and thrust is reduced moreover the difference provided by each blade is very large comparing to the result of no yawed angle in fig 7 especially to bare turbine which indicated the hydrodynamic non balance force was enlarged in yaw flow the velocity distribution on yawed flow conditions on longitudinal plane at tsr 4 0 is shown in fig 11 it can be observed that yaw flow condition leads to an asymmetrical flow structure and induce velocity and momentum in spanwise for both turbines thus the downstream flow behavior and structure become more unstable and extremely complex the velocity distribution in transverse plane at different downstream locations at tsr 4 0 is shown in fig 12 it is worth mentioning that adding low shear basically will not change the flow structure comparing to uniform when it is yawed bartl et al 2018 in non yawed flow condition this three bladed shape flow structure is observed for bare turbine case and a ring flow structure is observed for diffuser augmented turbine case for yaw flow condition the flow structure is laterally deflected and deformed accordingly resulting in a highly complex flow field in the downstream an amount of streamwise momentum is lost in the axis direction and a cross stream momentum in spanwise is induced the wake flow is deflected sideways by this lateral force component effect and it is clearly to see the lower velocity zone was shifted from 1d to 3d this area is observed to be smaller and start recovering to normal zone for higher downstream distances besides the lower velocity zone was also separated in the center of the deflected wake with downstream distance increased for the bare turbine case as turbine cannot be avoided to operate in yaw flow in actual ocean environment the complex flow structure and unstable flow behavior often occur such as the wake interaction among the hub blade and diffuser besides turbine could be significantly affected from the unbalance hydrodynamic loads acting on each blade these effects will become more serious as yaw angle increased lee et al 2019 especially for the diffuser augmented turbine as the diffuser can further enhance loads and corresponding negative effects on the system moreover there would be excessive and unexpected loads added to the shaft and gearbox grujicic et al 2013 yaw flow condition is a crucial factor when operating a turbine and the hydrodynamic behavior and fatigue lifecycle of each component should always be accounted for when considering designing a tidal current turbine system 3 3 effect of array configurations to illustrate the effects associated with turbine array this section presented in plane four turbines array system in side direction under shear flow including the bare turbine case and diffuser augmented turbine case the schematic of the turbine array is shown in fig 13 in this section the boundary condition and mesh setup remained unchanged to sect 2 2 to maximize the output power and produce power greater than four times that of a corresponding single turbine the relative deviation angle θ and the relative axial distance between hub center in flow direction l were used to study the effects of arrangement on hydrodynamic performance the hydrodynamic interaction among the four turbines determines the whole output power of the array system which is governed by the configuration of the system therefore in addition to the location configuration parameters of system tsr and rotating direction also should be considered according to chawdhary et al 2017 and olczak et al 2016 the angular velocity of array turbines in side direction and with same rotating direction varied slightly in time due to unsteadiness in the approach flow and without the precise and constant angular velocity control during the experimental test in this section assuming that the four turbines have the same angular velocity and rotating direction counter clockwise versus tsr under the same operating conditions for the convenience of differentiating the array cases with different l and θ in a follow up analysis the notation xd x is applied for instance 2d 45 stands for the axial distance is 2d and the relative deviation angle is 45 the average c p and c t of the bare turbines array and the single turbine versus tsr in seven array arrangement rules are shown in fig 14 it can be observed that the different arrangement rules have a little effect on c p and c t of the array system and the performance curves show a similarity between each array and the single turbine except for 1d 30 case the difference in c p at tsr 4 0 in each case comparing to the single turbine is less than 3 except for 1d 30 case the difference of c p in each turbine of array with a single bare turbine versus tsr is shown in fig 15 since the output performance variations of array is the main goal on the current discussion the hydrodynamic interaction among each turbine in array comes from streamwise wake and spanwise disturbance it can be observed that each turbine in array shows different performance versus tsr for different arrangement rules for the turbine spacing presented here the results show that the arrangement rules of 2d 45 and 2d 30 have a better performance table 4 shows the average c p value and corresponding standard deviation sd of c p for the different bare turbine array arrangement rules at tsr 3 5 4 5 from the presented data it can be seen that some turbines in array do not reach the single turbine level 2d 45 and 2d 30 have a better c p value and both have a very close performance however as for 2d 45 case the standard deviation of c p is smaller which illustrate the 2d 45 have a relatively stable operation characteristics thus the 2d 45 bare turbine array has the optimum performance when the downstream turbine had an overlapping wake flow from the upstream turbine such as 1d 45 case 2d 30 case and 1d 30 case such positions lead to large differences in hydrodynamic performance when the overlapping part within a certain range as can be seen in fig 15 b d the results show the enhancement in c p for downstream turbine t3 t4 and the enhancement of c p for downstream turbines for 1d 45 array is much more obvious than that for 2d 30 however when the overlapping part reaches a bigger range shown in fig 15 a all downstream turbines t2 t3 t4 have a significant drop off in c p versus tsr these trends are similar and agreement with apsley et al 2018 and myers et al 2011 which suggests that the overlapping wake part size has a great impact on the downstream turbine performance due to the relatively channel blockage effect and lower wake spreading effect in the flow leading to an increase in the bypass velocity on either side of the array particularly for the outermost downstream turbine of the array so that the downstream turbines can effectively capture energy from the bypass flow of the upstream turbines thus the downstream turbines can experience more thrust and torque than the upstream turbine as can be also seen from fig 15 the difference in c p for each case is relatively concentrated at lower tsr and divergent at higher tsr which indicates the effect of angular velocity on turbine performance in array cannot be ignored the bigger the tsr is the stronger the influence of interaction from wake and disturbance of the array system is the average c p and c t of the seven different diffuser augmented turbines array and a single turbine versus tsr are shown in fig 16 contrary to the bare turbines array the different arrangement rules have a significant effect on c p and c t of the array system the results indicate that the c p and c t of the turbines array is larger than the single turbine at low tsr range 3 0 3 75 except for 1d 30 case and 1d 45 case which is an indication of the positive effect of the diffuser augmented turbines array in addition to the relative channel blockage effect there is also presumably the flow field around each turbine at this flow condition has characteristics closer to those of a flow having higher free stream turbulence devinant et al 2002 comparing to the bare turbines array fig 17 also shows the difference of c p in each diffuser augmented turbine of array with a single diffuser augmented turbine versus tsr following the same comparison it can be observed that the output power of each turbine in all diffuser augmented turbines array is increased at lower tsr and the c p divergence is stronger than the bare turbines array similarly as can be seen from fig 17 the difference in c p for each case is relatively concentrated at lower tsr and divergent at higher tsr likewise the results show that the arrangement rules of 2d 45 and 1d 60 have a better performance table 5 shows the average c p value and corresponding standard deviation of c p for the different diffuser augmented turbine array arrangement rules at tsr 3 5 4 5 from the presented data it can be seen that some turbines in array do not reach the single turbine level 2d 45 and 1d 60 have a better c p value and both have a very close performance similarly the standard deviation of c p in 2d 45 is smaller which illustrate the 2d 45 have a relatively stable operation characteristics the 2d 45 diffuser augmented turbines array has the optimum performance therefore for the flow conditions and the axis tidal stream turbines described in the study it may be concluded that the array operating at near 2d flow distance and relative deviation angle of 45 reaches its maximum c p comparing with the bare turbines array in fig 15 the overlapping wake flow effect in 1d 45 case and 2d 30 case of diffuser augmented turbines array seems to be quite different as mentioned above the interaction among the each turbine in array mainly comes from streamwise wake and spanwise disturbance due to the diffuser rectifying flow effect in diffuser augmented turbine the interaction in streamwise becomes stronger and that in spanwise becomes weaker the downstream turbines experience a lower onset velocity and ineffectively gain energy in the bypass flow of the upstream turbines especially at higher tsr as can be seen in fig 17 b and d the results show enhancement in c p for each turbine at tsr 3 0 in 1d 45 case and enhancement in c p near at tsr 3 0 3 5 in 2d 30 case no significant enhancement of the downstream turbines in the two cases was observed comparing to the upstream turbine at tsr 3 5 5 0 moreover as for the 1d 30 case there was also a significant drop off in c p versus tsr shown in fig 17 a thus for the turbines array presented here it may be concluded that the overlapping wake effect is not conducive to overall power performance improvement for both bare turbine arrays and diffuser augmented turbine arrays although some turbines at tsrs may be enhanced the above results show that there are advantageous interaction and disadvantage interaction in the wake effect on the energy extraction performance in the axis turbine array on the premise of guaranteeing normal maintenance the output power in array can be enhanced effectively when at appropriate arrangement rules of course the optimum distance of spacing between turbines also depends on several parameters such as the turbines physical parameters and tsr the velocity distribution on longitudinal plane for turbine array at tsr 4 0 is shown in fig 18 the typical interaction of flow including the center line downstream wake recovery together with persistent flow from the upstream turbines the ambient wake separates the adjacent wake and the individual downstream wake can be clearly identified due to the lateral staggering and close proximity of each turbine the flow field shows a combined flow wake between the adjacent turbines for the 1d 45 arrays a belt of slower flowing is observed at the array center line downstream of t4 in fig 18 a comparing to that of each turbine in fig 18 c likewise there is also a belt of slower flowing observed at the array center line downstream of t1 and t4 in fig 18 b comparing to that of each turbine in fig 18 d the lower velocity behind the turbine means more kinetic energy absorbed by turbine these further explain the reason of the t4 in 1d 45 bare turbine array has the highest power output level comparing to other turbines in fig 18 a or c for the same reason t1 and t4 in 1d 45 diffuser augmented turbine array have higher power output level comparing to other turbines the velocity distribution in transverse plane for turbine array located at 2d downstream at tsr 4 0 is shown in fig 19 the velocity profiles of 2d 45 and 3d 45 array look very similar to each other and the velocity distribution is nearly central symmetric however there is obvious mixed flowing wake between the adjacent turbines observed in 1d 45 array and the zone of lower velocity moves to lateral especially the diffuser causes extra blockage by increasing the wake area and the ambient flow between the initial wake and the downstream turbines which leads to smaller spanwise wake extent at region of far away center line area according to the above results fig 20 illustrates a multi row arrangement rule of 12 turbines based on the single optimal array 2d 45 respectively in front second and third rows corresponding streamwise spacing is 4d the spanwise spacing is 3d and the corresponding vertical spacing is 2d the average c p for each row of the multi row bare turbine array and multi row diffuser augmented turbine array versus tsr are shown in fig 21 it can be observed that each row have a close c p value to the corresponding single 2d 45 array row and all have exceeded the single turbine level for both multi row arrays the comments of the multi row array are similar to the single row array in the front row relatively channel blockage effect increasing the bypass velocity on the either side of the array the downstream rows turbine arrays can effectively capture energy from the bypass flow of the front row thus the second row and third row have a little higher c p value 4 conclusions in the present study the hydrodynamic performance and comparison between a bare turbine system and a diffuser augmented turbine system under shear flow condition considered the effects of shear rates yaw flow conditions and array configurations were numerically investigated the following conclusions are drawn for an axis turbine applied in tidal stream the effect of shear flow on turbine performance is small if the shear rate is not big especially for the bare turbine a higher shear rate flow condition will result in power and axis thrust amplitude and a diffuser will further amplify of this effect comparing to a bare turbine a larger shear rate flow condition will have more sever fluctuations of the device loading than a uniform flow condition it is important to focus on turbine fatigue design in ocean areas with higher shear rate yaw angle has a great influence on turbine performance the greater the yaw angle is the more power and axis thrust is reduced besides yaw angle also affects the variation of the c p and c t curve the tsr corresponding to the maximum power coefficient was shifted to lower value with the increase of yaw angle the diffuser augmented turbine has a better energy harvesting performance comparing with the bare turbine yaw flow condition is a crucial factor when operating a turbine and the hydrodynamic behavior and fatigue lifecycle of each component will be overall different for both bare turbine and diffuser augmented turbine the different arrangement rules have a little effect on the bare turbine array average performance however each turbine in array has very different performance versus tsr for each arrangement rules contrary to the bare turbines array the different arrangement rules have a significant effect on average performance of diffuser augmented turbine array the output power is larger than the single turbine of almost all arrays at lower tsr and the c p divergence is stronger than that of the bare turbine array for the flow conditions and the axis tidal stream turbines described in the study the array operating at near 2d flow distance and relative deviation angle of 45 reaches its maximum c p for the turbine array presented here the overlapping wake flow effect on performance of the bare turbine array is different with the diffuser augmented turbine array and it is not conducive to overall power performance improvement although some turbines at tsrs may be enhanced the hydrodynamic interaction in array came from streamwise wake and spanwise disturbance there are advantageous interaction and disadvantage interaction in the wake effect on the energy extraction performance in the axis turbine array the output power for each case is relatively concentrated at lower tsr and divergent at higher tsr the bigger the tsr is the stronger the influence of interaction from wake and disturbance of the array system is on the premise of guaranteeing normal maintenance the output power in array can be enhanced effectively when at appropriate arrangement rules of course the output performance from tidal stream turbines at prescribed position in these arrays in present study also can be used to those for the multi row arrays however it should be noted that turbulence and velocity shear is much more complex and the onset flow direction may change over the tidal cycle in a real tidal flow from this point the turbine interactions presented are probably exaggerated or narrowed therefore the experimental tests of a full scale array system at different turbulence intensities and free stream velocities will be carried out in future work which will focus on better understanding the interactions and offering a clearer design instructions of turbine arrays credit author statement song ke data curation writing original draft preparation visualization investigation wen quan wang

22066,with the increasing distance and time of voyage component maintenance of shipborne antenna plays a crucial role in ship communication for navigation safety however most maintenance strategy

expedition however the extreme working condition on the ocean such as salt fog sea wave and humid environment may cause key transmission parts of shipborne antennas fatigue and damage after a long term operation without appropriate maintenance strategy the operational performance of key transmission parts will fall fast resulting in communication interruption and even serious accident therefore a reasonable maintenance model and relevant strategy optimization method for shipborne antennas are desired chen et al 2015 garbatov et al 2018 erkoyuncu et al 2017 even now the maintenance strategy can be inducted as two main categories corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance the maintenance strategies aiming at different equipment and system are usually developed inspired by these maintenance policies corrective maintenance strategy is the most basic maintenance activity which means maintaining the component after it fails j pkenné and agharbi consider the production control problem in a manufacturing system with corrective maintenance and a policy is proposed by considering the thresholds of involved products and switching inventory levels kenné and gharbi 2004 john et al discusses the trading cost and availability of corrective maintenance strategy at the equipment type level wang et al 2014 wang introduces a new complete corrective maintenance scheme for engineering equipment and the policy is applied for a boring machine tool ho and quinino 2012 linda proposes an online process control and imperfect corrective maintenance model considering the economical factor ruschel et al 2017 vathoopan et al proposed a new modular corrective maintenance methodology by using the digital twin of an automation module vathoopan et al 2018 yepez et al proposed a knowledge based system to generate an assisted corrective maintenance strategy for non expert operators yepez et al 2019 however it will be too late to maintain after the component failure occurs therefore a novel maintenance method which can prevent faults and improve system availability is expected preventive maintenance policy can be also divided into two different categories time based preventive maintenance tbm and condition based preventive maintenance cbm keizer et al 2017a zhang et al 2019 time based maintenance is one of the most classical preventive maintenance strategies and widely applied in various fields since it is easy to understand and implement zou et al 2019 cullum et al 2018 it has been widely used to solve replacement problem and based on traditional replacement policy may require unrealistic assumptions and repair replacement problem based on imperfect maintenance concept such as jung et al 2008 jiang 2009 moustafa et al 2004 jack et al 2009 and aven and castro 2008 on the other hand condition based maintenance also known as predictive maintenance considers degradation degree and reliability of components as the preventive maintenance criterion and has been the most popular maintenance strategy keizer et al 2017b sakib and wuest 2018 typically qiu et al proposes a maintenance model for a competing risk system with multiple failure modes and the optimal policies maximizing steady state availability and minimizing long run average cost are obtained respectively qiu et al 2017a cipollini et al proposes a unsupervised learning method based on data analysis with minimal feedback for naval propulsion systems which can be used to identify maintenance necessities directly cipollini et al 2018 qiu et al develops a novel maintenance model incorporating two dependent failure processes and in the model a multi level maintenance strategy is proposed to deal with competing failures qiu et al 2018 tan et al applies a one class svm based approach for condition based maintenance of a naval propulsion plant with limited labeled data where the concept of imbalanced decay and deep decay are proposed to guide condition based maintenance tan et al 2019 and recently nguyen et al consider joint optimization of imperfect inspection and replacement decisions in condition based maintenance a dynamic condition based maintenance and inspection policy adapted to observation information is proposed and formulated based on partially observable markov decision processes in the paper nguyen et al 2019 in spite of advantages and wide application tbm and cbm are applicable for single component maintenance but transmission system of shipborne antenna contains several key parts such as motor gearbox and planetary reducer therefore om a group maintenance strategy is more reasonable for shipborne antenna maintenance and has been researched in various fields zhang proposes an opportunistic maintenance strategy for wind turbines considering stochastic weather conditions and spare parts management ba et al 2017 truong proposes an opportunistic maintenance model considering non homogenous opportunity arrivals yang et al 2018 yang proposes a novel condition based maintenance strategy considering production wait time and applies it to crystallizer casting machine maintenance salari and makis 2017 salari and makis apply opportunistic maintenance to the electric power distribution systems including two units and calculate the cost of maintenance berkowitz et al 2005 however most om researches focus on optimizing the maintenance policy to reduce the cost but seldom care about the influence of system performance which is unreasonable in shipborne antenna operating to ensure the operational reliability of shipborne antenna performance guided maintenance pgm is applied in shipborne antenna transmission system maintenance under a pgm strategy system performance is the critical factor of maintenance activity so the operator is dedicated to improving system performance to obtain a higher system operating revenue devries 2005 kim et al 2007 shohet and nobili 2016 d angelo et al 2018 mirzahosseinian and piplani 2011 it is used in the defense industry initially and widely introduced into modern industry subsequently xiang et al develop a cbm model under the novel performance based contracting approach and determine the optimal policies under a performance based contract xiang et al 2017 mirzahosseinian studies repairable parts inventory system operating under performance based policy mo et al 2018 mo proposes a control performance based maintenance model to ensure reliable control of energy systems qiu et al 2017b xiang develops a cbm model which allows incomplete maintenance under the novel performance based contracting approach he et al 2014 the pgm strategy is more reasonable in shipborne antenna transmission system maintenance since we attach more importance to system operating efficiency and stability however the model of pgm should be modified to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness before using in practical condition aiming at improving the operating revenue of shipborne antenna with high system performance a modified performance guided maintenance model is proposed in this paper first relevant assumptions about shipborne antenna operating and maintenance are suggested and subsequently a novel maintenance model based on performance guided strategy is built second three criterions are structured to assess the model s performance finally the cyclic coordinate search method to search the optimal maintenance decision is applied the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the assumptions and modified performance guided maintenance model section 3 introduces the maintenance criterions and the corresponding solution an illustrative case is shown to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model in section 4 finally the result of applications and conclusion are drawn in section 5 2 maintenance model based on performance guided strategy generally a shipborne antenna transmission system includes three subsystems which control cross moving pitching moving and rotating moving respectively each subsystem consists of motor planetary retarder transmission gear box bearing etc failures on any of those components will cause downtime of the shipborne antenna thoroughly li et al 2018 brown and burke 2000 therefore a transmission system can be regarded as a typical multi component series system and then several reasonable assumptions can be structured on this basis 2 1 assumptions before model building to simplify the model under the rational conditions we suggest several assumptions about components degradation and practical working condition of shipborne antenna 1 two different stages exist in shipborne antenna operating period voyage stage and berthing stage in voyage stage the shipborne antenna work normally while in berthing stage the shipborne antenna will close down and there is no degeneration in this stage 2 system restart up is implemented before each voyage stage which means an extra restart up cost 3 failure distribution of the component in voyage stage follows weibull distribution with the scale parameter α and shape parameter β that is the probability density function of component i can be gained as eq 1 showing 1 f i t β i α i t α i β i 1 e t α i β i t 0 4 only economic dependence between components will be considered in the model structural dependence and stochastic dependence have none influence in the maintenance which means failures of different component are completely unrelated 5 all maintenance activities are perfect maintenance which can bring the component to the good as new state 6 the corrective maintenance time preventive maintenance time and opportunistic maintenance time of component follow exponential distribution with parameters λ c λ p λ o respectively however the time and cost of corrective maintenance is far higher than other maintenance 7 other maintenance factors such as spare parts repairmen and so on are enough so that they can t influence the maintenance strategy 2 2 modified maintenance model 2 2 1 performance guided contract because of the particularity of shipborne antenna transmission system performance guided strategy is more appropriate to optimize the maintenance polices for practical condition however it is necessary to clarify the definition of performance guided strategy before modeling the system performance can be expressed in terms of various key indexes including mean time between failures mean time to repair availability and so on we choose system availability to express the system performance because higher system stability and longer operating time are desired in voyage according to the definition of availability the component availability can be given in eq 2 2 a i t s e n o i e t o i e n p i e t p i e n c i e t c i t s where e n o i e n p i e n c i represent the number of opportunistic maintenance preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance respectively we will introduce how to calculate those numbers in the next section e t o i e t p i e t c i represent the single time of opportunistic maintenance preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance respectively which can be gained from practical cases furthermore as a series system the availability of shipborne antenna transmission system can be written as eq 3 3 a a i 1 n a i t s e n o i e t o i e n p i e t p i e n c i e t c i t s after gaining the system availability we need an intuitive criterion to optimize the maintenance activity under performance guided strategy the linear revenue function is widely applied to judge the maintenance decision which can be expressed as eq 4 4 r a a b a a min where α denoted the fixed revenue of system operating and b a a min is the performance based incentive of system furthermore the criterion can also be designed as an exponential function d ariano et al 2019 nowicki et al 2008 comparing with the linear criterion the exponential function can show the influence of system performance more clearly therefore in this paper the stage revenue criterion is given by eq 5 5 r a i exp ε γ a a min where ε and γ are incentive parameters of the function in this situation ε means the basic and stable capability of shipborne antenna while γ is influenced by the maintenance effect what should be noticed is that r a i is not necessarily the economic profit in shipborne antenna maintenance and it can be receiving efficiency effective working area and so on for transmission system of shipborne antenna then the operating period revenue criterion can be given by eq 6 6 r a r a i 1 n exp ε γ a a min it is easy to obtain that more revenue will be received from system when the system availability improves but the efficiency of system will decrease once the system availability is less than the minimum availability therefore the model can be expressed as an optimization problem of efficiency cost ratio which can be given as eq 7 7 max z w s r a c r a 1 m c w i s i e r i t n c s s t 0 w i s i t where m represents the number of berthing during the whole period c w i s i represents the expected maintenance cost of component i during a renewal cycle which can be written as eq 8 8 c w i s i c s c p i p i p c s c c i p i c c o i p i o e r i represents the expected duration of a renewable process simultaneously 2 2 2 maintenance policy solution in this section we focus on the solution of three different maintenance policies corrective maintenance preventive maintenance opportunistic maintenance they are used in different condition and cover all maintenance needs in practice corrective maintenance is applicable for broken components and it is usually unplanned and costly because of the sudden faults as for preventive maintenance it can be planned before manufacturing and operating to maintain the reliability of systems and avoid possible corrective maintenance more preventive maintenance means higher reliability of the system and less possibility of corrective maintenance but it will hold more running time and spend more resources conversely therefore opportunistic maintenance is proposed to balance times and cost of preventive maintenance opportunistic maintenance can be regarded as a cooperative preventive maintenance during other components preventive maintenance or corrective maintenance it can reduce such as the disassembling time and assembly time in multi component maintenance saving correlative cost as well the three maintenance rates of component i can be calculated respectively by multiplying the probability of related maintenance and its total maintenance rate which can be obtained by the operating time after gaining three maintenance rates of all components the number and total duration of maintenance can be calculated subsequently 2 2 2 1 corrective maintenance corrective maintenance is the most basis maintenance measure in system health management which means post maintenance activity after component failure then the maintenance probability in a voyage period can be calculated since a component fails following different probabilities in two cumulative intervals 0 w i and w i s i the corrective maintenance probability of the corresponding component can be expressed as the sum of two parts in the interval 0 w i the corrective maintenance is implemented when a sudden failure occurs on the component so the maintenance probability of component i in this stage can be written as eq 9 9 p 1 i c 0 w i f i t d t on the other hand if the corrective maintenance is carried out in the interval w i s i there will be a sudden failure on the component but no other opportunistic maintenance possibility therefore the corrective maintenance probability in this interval can be given as eq 10 10 p 2 i c w i s i f i t 1 s i t g i t d t d t where s i t g i t d t is the probability of opportunistic maintenance finally the complete corrective maintenance probability can be given as eq 11 11 p i c p 1 i c p 2 i c 0 w i f i t d t w i s i f i t 1 s i t g i t d t d t since the corrective maintenance probability is gained the number of corrective maintenance can be calculated clearly which is shown as eq 12 12 e n c i t s p i c λ i furthermore the cost of corrective maintenance is also considered once a sudden failure occurs the system will shut down and corrective maintenance will be implemented therefore the cost of corrective maintenance should consist of two parts restarting cost c s and corrective maintenance cost c c i 2 2 2 2 preventive maintenance preventive maintenance is a kind of beforehand maintenance measure which is implemented when the working life of component reach the pre set preventive maintenance threshold therefore the c of preventive maintenance can be written as eq 13 13 p i p 1 0 t f i t d t 1 s i t g i t d t subsequently the number of preventive maintenance can be calculated as eq 14 14 e n p i t s p i p λ i the cost of corrective maintenance is also considered once preventive maintenance is implemented the system will shut down and be restarted after maintenance the cost of preventive maintenance consists of restarting cost c s and preventive maintenance cost c p i consequently 2 2 2 3 opportunistic maintenance opportunistic maintenance is a kind of totally different maintenance measure since its implementation is not only depended on aimed component s working condition but also other components maintenance activities there exist three stochastic opportunistic maintenance policies mainly and they are distinguished by the difference of maintenance occasion the first one is opportunistic maintenance based on corrective which means the opportunistic maintenance is only implemented when other components fail and a corrective maintenance is desired the second opportunistic maintenance policy is so called opportunistic maintenance based on preventive and under such a policy opportunistic maintenance is only implemented with other components preventive maintenance rightly the last policy opportunistic maintenance based on corrective and preventive means the maintenance opportunity can be created by both corrective and preventive maintenance of other components it s a more policy in the practical shipborne antenna working condition therefore the last opportunistic maintenance policy is chosen in this paper the opportunistic maintenance policy aims at reducing the number of system shutdown and sharing the cost of restarting by optimizing the opportunistic maintenance threshold under the chosen opportunistic maintenance policy opportunistic maintenance is only implemented when other components in the system are repaired and its life reaches opportunistic maintenance threshold therefore the parameter of opportunistic maintenance of component i can be denoted as the sum of corrective and preventive maintenance rate of other components and given as eq 15 15 λ o i i j λ c j λ p j as the opportunistic maintenance time of component follows exponential distribution the probability density function of maintenance interval can be gained as eq 16 16 g i w i t λ o i exp λ o i t w i it is obvious that opportunistic maintenance can be only implemented during w i s i thus the probability of opportunistic maintenance of component is written as eq 17 17 p i o w i s i 1 0 t f i t d t g i w i t d t where 1 0 t f i t d t is the survival function of the aimed component furthermore the number of opportunistic maintenance can be calculated as eq 18 18 e n o i t s p i o λ i considering the restarting cost is shared with other maintenance measure the total opportunistic maintenance cost of the component is c o i 2 2 2 4 renewable cycle the expected duration of a renewable cycle consists of two parts the expected operating time and expected maintenance time the operating time can be calculated as eq 19 19 e n o i 0 w i t f i t d t w i s i t f i t 1 s i t g i t d t d t w i s i t 1 0 t f i t d t 1 s i t g i t d t d t s i 1 0 t f i t d t 1 s i t g i t d t while the maintenance time is given as eq 20 20 e m i p i o t o i p i p t p i p i c t c i therefore the expected duration of a renewable cycle can be written as eq 21 21 e r i e o i e m i 3 model performance criterions and solution process 3 1 model performance criterions after the model is structured some effective and forceful is desired to compare the proposed model with the traditional model therefore three criterions minimum maintenance cost system operational availability and system operational revenue are chosen to compare the different models performance 3 1 1 minimum maintenance cost even though we pay more attention to system preference and reliability of shipborne antenna maintenance cost is still an important part of maintenance strategy the minimum maintenance cost can be calculated as eq 22 22 min l w s m c s i m 1 l i w s m c s j n c w j s j e r j t s i where m is the number of berthing and n is the number of component it should be noticed that the minimum maintenance cost doesn t represent a highest efficiency cost ratio which means a strategy with the minimum maintenance cost is necessarily the optimal strategy 3 1 2 system operational availability system availability is one of the most concerned indices of shipborne antenna maintenance to improve the operational availability we have to increase the mean operating time during two maintenance activities and reduce the mean maintenance time therefore we try to reduce the shutdown time of system by optimizing the threshold of the opportunistic maintenance and preventive maintenance in this paper according to the previous chapter the component operational availability can be gained as eq 23 a i t s e n o i e t o i e n p i e t p i e n c i e t c i t s 23 1 t p i p i p λ i t c i p i c λ i t o i p i o λ i then the system operational availability can be given as eq 24 24 a a i i n 1 t p i p i p λ i t c i p i c λ i t o i p i o λ i 3 1 3 system operational revenue to emphasize the importance of system performance in maintenance activity an operational revenue function is structured as eq 25 25 r a exp ε γ a a min a a min 0 a a min it means that any maintenance strategy must keep the system operational availability firstly once the system availability is lower than the threshold the system will lost its original functions which is closer to practical condition of shipborne antenna transmission system 3 2 solution process as the model is structured as a constrained multi variable optimization problem and the relevant model evaluation criterions are defined the appropriate model solving method should be applied to gain the optimal maintenance strategy under the certain condition there exist several feasible algorithms for this kind of optimization problem such as pareto optimal solution genetic algorithm heuristic method and policy iteration method paulo et al 2016 feng et al 2017 feinberg and huang 2013 luo et al 2014 since the aim of the model solution is to search the optimal vectors w s which changes with different parameter situations the coordinate search algorithm is applied in this paper the detailed steps will be introduced in following content first the schedule of voyage is confirmed simultaneously the parameters of weibull distribution α i β i for all components the maintenance correlative parameters c r c p i c o i c c i and the parameters of stage revenue criterion ε γ are pre set respectively second the opportunistic maintenance parameters are calculated after the maintenance correlative parameters are initialized the maintenance rates of all components λ i can be gained and the probability of three maintenance activities p i o p i p p i c can be calculated subsequently then the opportunistic maintenance parameters can be calculated according to the previous deduction third the values of opportunistic maintenance threshold w and preventive maintenance threshold s are pre set and the boundaries of w and s are set as well then the optimal values of w and s are searched in the boundary by dichotomy method and the objective functions is calculated according to the searched values the boundaries of w and s are also updated finally the third step is implemented iteratively until the loop meets the terminating criteria and the optimal thresholds are determined after getting the optimal decision thresholds the model performance criterions including the maximum profit the system operational availability and the system operational revenue are calculated based on the previous formulas 4 illustrative case 4 1 optimal maintenance strategy to prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and compare the strategy with traditional maintenance strategy an illustrative case is applied in our paper generally a shipborne antenna transmission system consists of three subsystems which control crossing moving pitching moving and rotating moving respectively failures on anyone of those subsystems will cause downtime of the shipborne antenna completely furthermore a direction control system usually consists of four key components motor planetary retarder transmission gear box and bearing and the experiential knowledge indicate that the maintenance cost and maintenance time of these components are far higher than others therefore we discuss a single subsystem consisting of four key components in this case according to the known parameters and the mentioned formula in chapter 2 and 3 the optimal decision variables can be obtained through the policy iteration method and the model performance criterions can be calculated subsequently the optimal decision under the traditional cost guided policy is also discussed in the case comparing with the proposed policy first the operation parameters and maintenance parameters such as the total operation period the number of berthing maintenance cost of different maintenance activities maintenance time of different maintenance activities are pre set in this case the ship duty period t 360 d and the whole period is divided into two parts which last 160 days and 200 days respectively it is also obvious that the ship ashore once during the duty period as for maintenance parameters and components degeneration parameters they can be obtained from historical maintenance information and historical monitoring data and they are per set in table 1 in this case then we set the minimum availability of the system a min 0 85 and choose the parameters ε and γ of the proposed period revenue criterion in order to analyze the sensitivity of our maintenance policy several combination of ε and γ are applied and the corresponding optimal strategies are obtained the optimal strategy under traditional cost guided policy is also calculated comparing with the proposed policy simultaneously the result of optimal maintenance parameters is shown in table 2 as can be observed the maintenance strategies under different maintenance policies are gained it is obvious the threshold of preventive maintenance in the proposed performance guided model is higher than that in the traditional cost guided model while the threshold of the opportunistic maintenance is lower because more opportunistic maintenance is required under performance guided policy to keep a higher availability of the system the number of the preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance is reduced relatively furthermore we can notice that the threshold of the preventive maintenance is higher as the incentive parameters increase which means excessive preventive maintenance will bring negative effects on system availability 4 2 model performance criterion comparison first the maintenance cost under different strategies is compared and the result is shown in table 3 it is dramatic that the maintenance cost under performance guided policy is slightly higher than the maintenance cost under the traditional policy however it is reasonable that more maintenance activities are required to keep high system availability under performance guided policy while the aim of the traditional policy is to search the maintenance strategy with a minimum maintenance cost trend comparison is shown in fig 1 and red points are the maintenance cost under cost based policy green points are the maintenance cost under the proposed policy with a variable γ and γ increases progressively form 10 to 20 meanwhile blue points are the maintenance cost under the proposed policy with a variable ε and ε increases progressively form 15 to 17 it is noticed that the maintenance cost increases with an ascending parameter γ of the period revenue criterion the system operational availability is compared subsequently and the result is given in table 4 the superiority of the proposed model is preliminarily shown as the system operational availability in the proposed model is higher than one in the traditional model which is important for shipborne antenna transmission system maintenance fig 2 shows the trend of system operational availability of different policies in the figure red points are the system operational availability under cost based policy green points are the system operational availability under the proposed policy with a changing γ and γ increases progressively form 10 to 20 by 1 meanwhile blue points are the system operational availability under the proposed policy with a changing ε and ε increases progressively form 15 to 17 by 0 2 the system operational availability under the proposed policy is about 2 higher than it under the traditional policy even if the time of opportunistic maintenance is almost neglected in our model it is also noticed that the system operational availability increases with an ascending parameter γ of the period revenue criterion in fig 2 therefore increasing the value of parameter γ is an effective method to improving the system operational availability in practical condition as one of the most important factor of maintenance evaluation system operational revenue is also compared in the paper to show the superiority of performance guided maintenance policy it can be noticed in table 5 that the system operational revenue under the performance guided maintenance policy is much higher than one under cost based policy with same parameters the advantage of the proposed model is from 13 5 to 33 0 with different parameters therefore the result means better communication performance and safety performance of ship under the performance guided maintenance policy finally the efficiency cost ratio under different maintenance policies and different revenue parameters are compared respectively in table 6 fig 3 and fig 4 on the one hand we can observe that the efficiency cost ratio is growing with increasing revenue parameters ε and γ which means the maintainability and structure of shipborne antenna transmission system influences the maintenance efficiency itself on the other hand it can be noticed that the efficiency cost ratio under the proposed policy is far higher than one under the cost guided policy therefore it is proved that the proposed model is more efficient than the traditional one for the shipborne antenna transmission system maintenance 5 discussion and conclusion it is necessary for the transmission system of shipborne antenna to build an effective and reasonable maintenance model in this paper we proposed a novel performance guided maintenance policy and the corresponding optimization method in order to associate maintenance activities and system performance an efficiency cost ratio criterion is applied in this paper first the relevant assumption is proposed and the performance guided maintenance model is structured second the relative maintenance parameters are calculated and three criterions are introduced and applied to judge the performance of the model at last an illustrative case is used to prove the rationality of the model and the comparison with the traditional cost guided model proves the superiority of the model the attractions of the paper are enumerated as follows 1 a reasonable performance guided maintenance policy is applied for maintenance decision of shipborne antenna transmission system 2 an efficiency cost ratio criterion based on system availability is proposed to guide maintenance activities 3 the optimal maintenance strategy of the proposed model and traditional cost model is compared in the case which shows the rationality and advantage of performance guided maintenance policy however there still exist several segments to be perfected in the proposed model such as the component degeneration during the berthing stage and the parameter estimation of the system performance revenue function in the future we will pay attention to building a two stage component degeneration model of shipborne antenna transmission system and estimating related parameters in practical condition credit author statement zipeng li conceptualization

22066,with the increasing distance and time of voyage component maintenance of shipborne antenna plays a crucial role in ship communication for navigation safety however most maintenance strategy studies which only focus on reducing maintenance cost or improving operating revenue are not applicable for transmission system of shipborne antenna therefore a multiple component maintenance policy for shipborne antenna is proposed to maximize the operating revenue under the requirement of the antenna s availability in this paper first the maintenance model based on performance guided policy is built and the relevant maintenance parameters are derived under the special working condition of shipborne antenna second three criterions including maintenance cost system availability and system

expedition however the extreme working condition on the ocean such as salt fog sea wave and humid environment may cause key transmission parts of shipborne antennas fatigue and damage after a long term operation without appropriate maintenance strategy the operational performance of key transmission parts will fall fast resulting in communication interruption and even serious accident therefore a reasonable maintenance model and relevant strategy optimization method for shipborne antennas are desired chen et al 2015 garbatov et al 2018 erkoyuncu et al 2017 even now the maintenance strategy can be inducted as two main categories corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance the maintenance strategies aiming at different equipment and system are usually developed inspired by these maintenance policies corrective maintenance strategy is the most basic maintenance activity which means maintaining the component after it fails j pkenné and agharbi consider the production control problem in a manufacturing system with corrective maintenance and a policy is proposed by considering the thresholds of involved products and switching inventory levels kenné and gharbi 2004 john et

proposed a knowledge based system to generate an assisted corrective maintenance strategy for non expert operators yepez et al 2019 however it will be too late to maintain after the component failure occurs therefore a novel maintenance method which can prevent faults and improve system availability is expected preventive maintenance policy can be also divided into two different categories time based preventive maintenance tbm and condition based preventive maintenance cbm keizer et al 2017a zhang et al 2019 time based maintenance is one of the most classical preventive maintenance strategies and widely applied in various fields since it is easy to understand and implement zou et al 2019 cullum et al 2018 it has been widely used to solve replacement problem and based on traditional replacement policy may require unrealistic assumptions and repair replacement problem based on imperfect maintenance concept such as jung et al 2008 jiang 2009 moustafa et al 2004 jack et

researches focus on optimizing the maintenance policy to reduce the cost but seldom care about the influence of system performance which is unreasonable in shipborne antenna operating to ensure the operational reliability of shipborne antenna performance guided maintenance pgm is applied in shipborne antenna transmission system maintenance under a pgm strategy system performance is the critical

incomplete maintenance under the novel performance based contracting approach he et al 2014 the pgm strategy is more reasonable in shipborne antenna transmission system maintenance since we attach more importance to system operating efficiency and stability however the model of pgm should be modified to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness before using in practical condition aiming at improving the operating revenue of shipborne antenna with high system performance a modified performance guided maintenance model is proposed in this paper first relevant assumptions about shipborne antenna operating and maintenance are suggested and subsequently a novel maintenance model based on performance guided strategy is built second three criterions are structured to assess the model s performance finally the cyclic coordinate search method to search the optimal maintenance decision is applied the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the assumptions and modified performance guided maintenance model section 3 introduces the maintenance criterions and the corresponding solution an illustrative case is shown to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model in section 4 finally the result of applications and conclusion are drawn in section 5 2 maintenance model based on performance guided strategy generally a shipborne antenna transmission system includes three subsystems which control cross moving pitching moving and rotating moving respectively each subsystem consists of motor planetary retarder transmission gear box bearing etc failures on any of those components will cause downtime of the shipborne antenna thoroughly li et al 2018 brown and burke 2000 therefore a transmission system can be regarded as a typical multi component series system and then several reasonable assumptions can be structured on this basis 2 1 assumptions before model building to simplify the model under the rational conditions we suggest several assumptions about components degradation and practical working condition of shipborne antenna 1 two different stages exist in shipborne antenna operating period voyage stage and berthing stage in voyage stage the shipborne antenna work normally while in berthing stage the shipborne antenna will close down and there is no degeneration in this stage 2 system restart up is implemented before each voyage stage which means an extra restart up cost 3 failure distribution of the component in voyage stage follows weibull distribution with the scale parameter α and shape parameter β that is the probability density function of component i can be gained as eq 1 showing 1 f i t β i α i t α i β i 1 e t α i β i t 0 4 only economic dependence between components will be considered in the model structural dependence and stochastic dependence have none influence in the maintenance which means failures of different component are completely unrelated 5 all maintenance activities are perfect maintenance which can bring the component to the good as new state 6 the corrective maintenance time preventive maintenance time and opportunistic maintenance time of component follow exponential distribution with parameters λ c λ p λ o respectively however the time and cost of corrective maintenance is far higher than other maintenance 7 other maintenance factors such as spare parts repairmen and so on are enough so that they can t influence the maintenance strategy 2 2 modified maintenance model 2 2 1 performance guided contract because of the particularity of shipborne antenna transmission system performance guided strategy is more appropriate to optimize the maintenance polices for practical condition however it is necessary to clarify the definition of performance guided strategy before modeling the system performance can be expressed in terms of various key indexes including mean time between failures mean time to repair availability and so on we choose system availability to express the system performance because higher system stability and longer operating time are desired in voyage according to the definition of availability the component availability can be given in eq 2 2 a i t s e n o i e t o i e n p i e t p i e n c i e t c i t s where e n o i e n p i e n c i represent the number of opportunistic maintenance preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance respectively we will introduce how to calculate those numbers in the next section e t o i e t p i e t c i represent the single time of opportunistic maintenance preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance respectively which can be gained from practical cases furthermore as a series system the availability of shipborne antenna transmission system can be written as eq 3 3 a a i 1 n a i t s e n o i e t o i e n p i e t p i e n c i e t c i t s after gaining the system availability we need an intuitive criterion to optimize the maintenance activity under performance guided strategy the linear revenue function is widely applied to judge the maintenance decision which can be expressed as eq 4 4 r a a b a a min where α denoted the fixed revenue of system operating and b a a min is the performance based incentive of system furthermore the criterion can also be designed as an exponential function d ariano et al 2019 nowicki et al 2008 comparing with the linear criterion the exponential function can show the influence of system performance more clearly therefore in this paper the stage revenue criterion is given by eq 5 5 r a i exp ε γ a a min where ε and γ are incentive parameters of the function in this situation ε means the basic and stable capability of shipborne antenna while γ is influenced by the maintenance effect what should be noticed is that r a i is not necessarily the economic profit in shipborne antenna maintenance and it can be receiving efficiency effective working area and so on for transmission system of shipborne antenna then the operating period revenue criterion can be given by eq 6 6 r a r a i 1 n exp ε γ a a min it is easy to obtain that more revenue will be received from system when the system availability improves but the efficiency of system will decrease once the system availability is less than the minimum availability therefore the model can be expressed as an optimization problem of efficiency cost ratio which can be given as eq 7 7 max z w s r a c r a 1 m c w i s i e r i t n c s s t 0 w i s i t where m represents the number of berthing during the whole period c w i s i represents the expected maintenance cost of component i during a renewal cycle which can be written as eq 8 8 c w i s i c s c p i p i p c s c c i p i c c o i p i o e r i represents the expected duration of a renewable process simultaneously 2 2 2 maintenance policy solution in this section we focus on the solution of three different maintenance policies corrective maintenance preventive maintenance opportunistic maintenance they are used in different condition and cover all maintenance needs in practice corrective maintenance is applicable for broken components and it is usually unplanned and costly because of the sudden faults as for preventive maintenance it can be planned before manufacturing and operating to maintain the reliability of systems and avoid possible corrective maintenance more preventive maintenance means higher reliability of the system and less possibility of corrective maintenance but it will hold more running time and spend more resources conversely therefore opportunistic maintenance is proposed to balance times and cost of preventive maintenance opportunistic maintenance can be regarded as a cooperative preventive maintenance during other components preventive maintenance or corrective maintenance it can reduce such as the disassembling time and assembly time in multi component maintenance saving correlative cost as well the three maintenance rates of component i can be calculated respectively by multiplying the probability of related maintenance and its total maintenance rate which can be obtained by the operating time after gaining three maintenance rates of all components the number and total duration of maintenance can be calculated subsequently 2 2 2 1 corrective maintenance corrective maintenance is the most basis maintenance measure in system health management which means post maintenance activity after component failure then the maintenance probability in a voyage period can be calculated since a component fails following different probabilities in two cumulative intervals 0 w i and w i s i the corrective maintenance probability of the corresponding component can be expressed as the sum of two parts in the interval 0 w i the corrective maintenance is implemented when a sudden failure occurs on the component so the maintenance probability of component i in this stage can be written as eq 9 9 p 1 i c 0 w i f i t d t on the other hand if the corrective maintenance is carried out in the interval w i s i there will be a sudden failure on the component but no other opportunistic maintenance possibility therefore the corrective maintenance probability in this interval can be given as eq 10 10 p 2 i c w i s i f i t 1 s i t g i t d t d t where s i t g i t d t is the probability of opportunistic maintenance finally the complete corrective maintenance probability can be given as eq 11 11 p i c p 1 i c p 2 i c 0 w i f i t d t w i s i f i t 1 s i t g i t d t d t since the corrective maintenance probability is gained the number of corrective maintenance can be calculated clearly which is shown as eq 12 12 e n c i t s p i c λ i furthermore the cost of corrective maintenance is also considered once a sudden failure occurs the system will shut down and corrective maintenance will be implemented therefore the cost of corrective maintenance should consist of two parts restarting cost c s and corrective maintenance cost c c i 2 2 2 2 preventive maintenance preventive maintenance is a kind of beforehand maintenance measure which is implemented when the working life of component reach the pre set preventive maintenance threshold therefore the c of preventive maintenance can be written as eq 13 13 p i p 1 0 t f i t d t 1 s i t g i t d t subsequently the number of preventive maintenance can be calculated as eq 14 14 e n p i t s p i p λ i the cost of corrective maintenance is also considered once preventive maintenance is implemented the system will shut down and be restarted after maintenance the cost of preventive maintenance consists of restarting cost c s and preventive maintenance cost c p i consequently 2 2 2 3 opportunistic maintenance opportunistic maintenance is a kind of totally different maintenance measure since its implementation is not only depended on aimed component s working condition but also other components maintenance activities there exist three stochastic opportunistic maintenance policies mainly and they are distinguished by the difference of maintenance occasion the first one is opportunistic maintenance based on corrective which means the opportunistic maintenance is only implemented when other components fail and a corrective maintenance is desired the second opportunistic maintenance policy is so called opportunistic maintenance based on preventive and under such a policy opportunistic maintenance is only implemented with other components preventive maintenance rightly the last policy opportunistic maintenance based on corrective and preventive means the maintenance opportunity can be created by both corrective and preventive maintenance of other components it s a more policy in the practical shipborne antenna working condition therefore the last opportunistic maintenance policy is chosen in this paper the opportunistic maintenance policy aims at reducing the number of system shutdown and sharing the cost of restarting by optimizing the opportunistic maintenance threshold under the chosen opportunistic maintenance policy opportunistic maintenance is only implemented when other components in the system are repaired and its life reaches opportunistic maintenance threshold therefore the parameter of opportunistic maintenance of component i can be denoted as the sum of corrective and preventive maintenance rate of other components and given as eq 15 15 λ o i i j λ c j λ p j as the opportunistic maintenance time of component follows exponential distribution the probability density function of maintenance interval can be gained as eq 16 16 g i w i t λ o i exp λ o i t w i it is obvious that opportunistic maintenance can be only implemented during w i s i thus the probability of opportunistic maintenance of component is written as eq 17 17 p i o w i s i 1 0 t f i t d t g i w i t d t where 1 0 t f i t d t is the survival function of the aimed component furthermore the number of opportunistic maintenance can be calculated as eq 18 18 e n o i t s p i o λ i considering the restarting cost is shared with other maintenance measure the total opportunistic maintenance cost of the component is c o i 2 2 2 4 renewable cycle the expected duration of a renewable cycle consists of two parts the expected operating time and expected maintenance time the operating time can be calculated as eq 19 19 e n o i 0 w i t f i t d t w i s i t f i t 1 s i t g i t d t d t w i s i t 1 0 t f i t d t 1 s i t g i t d t d t s i 1 0 t f i t d t 1 s i t g i t d t while the maintenance time is given as eq 20 20 e m i p i o t o i p i p t p i p i c t c i therefore the expected duration of a renewable cycle can be written as eq 21 21 e r i e o i e m i 3 model performance criterions and solution process 3 1 model performance criterions after the model is structured some effective and forceful is desired to compare the proposed model with the traditional model therefore three criterions minimum maintenance cost system operational availability and system operational revenue are chosen to compare the different models performance 3 1 1 minimum maintenance cost even though we pay more attention to system preference and reliability of shipborne antenna maintenance cost is still an important part of maintenance strategy the minimum maintenance cost can be calculated as eq 22 22 min l w s m c s i m 1 l i w s m c s j n c w j s j e r j t s i where m is the number of berthing and n is the number of component it should be noticed that the minimum maintenance cost doesn t represent a highest efficiency cost ratio which means a strategy with the minimum maintenance cost is necessarily the optimal strategy 3 1 2 system operational availability system availability is one of the most concerned indices of shipborne antenna maintenance to improve the operational availability we have to increase the mean operating time during two maintenance activities and reduce the mean maintenance time therefore we try to reduce the shutdown time of system by optimizing the threshold of the opportunistic maintenance and preventive maintenance in this paper according to the previous chapter the component operational availability can be gained as eq 23 a i t s e n o i e t o i e n p i e t p i e n c i e t c i t s 23 1 t p i p i p λ i t c i p i c λ i t o i p i o λ i then the system operational availability can be given as eq 24 24 a a i i n 1 t p i p i p λ i t c i p i c λ i t o i p i o λ i 3 1 3 system operational revenue to emphasize the importance of system performance in maintenance activity an operational revenue function is structured as eq 25 25 r a exp ε γ a a min a a min 0 a a min it means that any maintenance strategy must keep the system operational availability firstly once the system availability is lower than the threshold the system will lost its original functions which is closer to practical condition of shipborne antenna transmission system 3 2 solution process as the model is structured as a constrained multi variable optimization problem and the relevant model evaluation criterions are defined the appropriate model solving method should be applied to gain the optimal maintenance strategy under the certain condition there exist several feasible algorithms for this kind of optimization problem such as pareto optimal solution genetic algorithm heuristic method and policy iteration method paulo et al 2016 feng et al 2017 feinberg and huang 2013 luo et al 2014 since the aim of the model solution is to search the optimal vectors w s which changes with different parameter situations the coordinate search algorithm is applied in this paper the detailed steps will be introduced in following content first the schedule of voyage is confirmed simultaneously the parameters of weibull distribution α i β i for all components the maintenance correlative parameters c r c p i c o i c c i and the parameters of stage revenue criterion ε γ are pre set respectively second the opportunistic maintenance parameters are calculated after the maintenance correlative parameters are initialized the maintenance rates of all components λ i can be gained and the probability of three maintenance activities p i o p i p p i c can be calculated subsequently then the opportunistic maintenance parameters can be calculated according to the previous deduction third the values of opportunistic maintenance threshold w and preventive maintenance threshold s are pre set and the boundaries of w and s are set as well then the optimal values of w and s are searched in the boundary by dichotomy method and the objective functions is calculated according to the searched values the boundaries of w and s are also updated finally the third step is implemented iteratively until the loop meets the terminating criteria and the optimal thresholds are determined after getting the optimal decision thresholds the model performance criterions including the maximum profit the system operational availability and the system operational revenue are calculated based on the previous formulas 4 illustrative case 4 1 optimal maintenance strategy to prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and compare the strategy with traditional maintenance strategy an illustrative case is applied in our paper generally a shipborne antenna transmission system consists of three subsystems which control crossing moving pitching moving and rotating moving respectively failures on anyone of those subsystems will cause downtime of the shipborne antenna completely furthermore a direction control system usually consists of four key components motor planetary retarder transmission gear box and bearing and the experiential knowledge indicate that the maintenance cost and maintenance time of these components are far higher than others therefore we discuss a single subsystem consisting of four key components in this case according to the known parameters and the mentioned formula in chapter 2 and 3 the optimal decision variables can be obtained through the policy iteration method and the model performance criterions can be calculated subsequently the optimal decision under the traditional cost guided policy is also discussed in the case comparing with the proposed policy first the operation parameters and maintenance parameters such as the total operation period the number of berthing maintenance cost of different maintenance activities maintenance time of different maintenance activities are pre set in this case the ship duty period t 360 d and the whole period is divided into two parts which last 160 days and 200 days respectively it is also obvious that the ship ashore once during the duty period as for maintenance parameters and components degeneration parameters they can be obtained from historical maintenance information and historical monitoring data and they are per set in table 1 in this case then we set the minimum availability of the system a min 0 85 and choose the parameters ε and γ of the proposed period revenue criterion in order to analyze the sensitivity of our maintenance policy several combination of ε and γ are applied and the corresponding optimal strategies are obtained the optimal strategy under traditional cost guided policy is also calculated comparing with the proposed policy simultaneously the result of optimal maintenance parameters is shown in table 2 as can be observed the maintenance strategies under different maintenance policies are gained it is obvious the threshold of preventive maintenance in the proposed performance guided model is higher than that in the traditional cost guided model while the threshold of the opportunistic maintenance is lower because more opportunistic maintenance is required under performance guided policy to keep a higher availability of the system the number of the preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance is reduced relatively furthermore we can notice that the threshold of the preventive maintenance is higher as the incentive parameters increase which means excessive preventive maintenance will bring negative effects on system availability 4 2 model performance criterion comparison first the maintenance cost under different strategies is compared and the result is shown in table 3 it is dramatic that the maintenance cost under performance guided policy is slightly higher than the maintenance cost under the traditional policy however it is reasonable that more maintenance activities are required to keep high system availability under performance guided policy while the aim of the traditional policy is to search the maintenance strategy with a minimum maintenance cost trend comparison is shown in fig 1 and red points are the maintenance cost under cost based policy green points are the maintenance cost under the proposed policy with a variable γ and γ increases progressively form 10 to 20 meanwhile blue points are the maintenance cost under the proposed policy with a variable ε and ε increases progressively form 15 to 17 it is noticed that the maintenance cost increases with an ascending parameter γ of the period revenue criterion the system operational availability is compared subsequently and the result is given in table 4 the superiority of the proposed model is preliminarily shown as the system operational availability in the proposed model is higher than one in the traditional model which is important for shipborne antenna transmission system maintenance fig 2 shows the trend of system operational availability of different policies in the figure red points are the system operational availability under cost based policy green points are the system operational availability under the proposed policy with a changing γ and γ increases progressively form 10 to 20 by 1 meanwhile blue points are the system operational availability under the proposed policy with a changing ε and ε increases progressively form 15 to 17 by 0 2 the system operational availability under the proposed policy is about 2 higher than it under the traditional policy even if the time of opportunistic maintenance is almost neglected in our model it is also noticed that the system operational availability increases with an ascending parameter γ of the period revenue criterion in fig 2 therefore increasing the value of parameter γ is an effective method to improving the system operational availability in practical condition as one of the most important factor of maintenance evaluation system operational revenue is also compared in the paper to show the superiority of performance guided maintenance policy it can be noticed in table 5 that the system operational revenue under the performance guided maintenance policy is much higher than one under cost based policy with same parameters the advantage of the proposed model is from 13 5 to 33 0 with different parameters therefore the result means better communication performance and safety performance of ship under the performance guided maintenance policy finally the efficiency cost ratio under different maintenance policies and different revenue parameters are compared respectively in table 6 fig 3 and fig 4 on the one hand we can observe that the efficiency cost ratio is growing with increasing revenue parameters ε and γ which means the maintainability and structure of shipborne antenna transmission system influences the maintenance efficiency itself on the other hand it can be noticed that the efficiency cost ratio under the proposed policy is far higher than one under the cost guided policy therefore it is proved that the proposed model is more efficient than the traditional one for the shipborne antenna transmission system maintenance 5 discussion and conclusion it is necessary for the transmission system of shipborne antenna to build an effective and reasonable maintenance model in this paper we proposed a novel performance guided maintenance policy and the corresponding optimization method in order to associate maintenance activities and system performance an efficiency cost ratio criterion is applied in this paper first the relevant assumption is proposed and the performance guided maintenance model is structured second the relative maintenance parameters are calculated and three criterions are introduced and applied to judge the performance of the model at last an illustrative case is used to prove the rationality of the model and the comparison with the traditional cost guided model proves the superiority of the model the attractions of the paper are enumerated as follows 1 a reasonable performance guided maintenance policy is applied for maintenance decision of shipborne antenna transmission system 2 an efficiency cost ratio criterion based on system availability is proposed to guide maintenance activities 3 the optimal maintenance strategy of the proposed model and traditional cost model is compared in the case which shows the rationality and advantage of performance guided maintenance policy however there still exist several segments to be perfected in the proposed model such as the component degeneration during the berthing stage and the parameter estimation of the system performance revenue function in the future we will pay attention to building a two stage component degeneration model of shipborne antenna transmission system and estimating related parameters in practical condition credit author statement zipeng li conceptualization

22067,unbonded flexible risers are widely applied to deep water oil and gas production field and their complex cross section mechanical properties have always been a challenging issue in ocean engineering over the recent years the traditional steel tensile armour layers of unbonded flexible risers are replaced by composite materials owing to their advantages of lightweight and high strength in this paper a theoretical deduction based on energy method and a numerical method in consideration of detailed geometric properties are proposed to analyze the behaviour of the unbonded flexible riser with composite armour layers both the theoretical and numerical methods take full consideration of the material orientation of composite and for the numerical model two local coordinate systems are established to define the material properties of composite armour layers based on a 2 5 inches unbonded flexible riser model with eight layers some cases from theoretical and numerical methods are presented for validation then the effect of the fiber volume fraction of composite on the axial tensile stiffness as well as the weight of the unbonded flexible riser is discussed furthermore characteristics analysis of axial stiffness is carried out and the effect of the boundary condition is discussed as well keywords unbonded flexible riser energy method axial tensile stiffness composite armour layer detailed geometric characteristics 1 introduction unbonded flexible risers have been widely employed to transport oil and gas resources from underwater wellheads to the offshore rigs in ocean engineering several works have been carried out on the mechanical properties of unbonded flexible risers due to its complicated construction with offshore oil and gas development stepping into ultra deep waters some new materials have been applied to the unbonded flexible risers manufacture and composite material is one of them composite materials can reduce the weight of riser provide better mechanical properties enhance corrosion resistant properties and reduce installation costs some institutes like nkt flexibles and technip have already utilized cross wrapped composite armour layers to replace the helical armour layers in unbonded flexible riser to enhance the strength of the riser and lighten the pipe weight rytter 2004 do and lambert 2012 lambert et al 2012 kalman et al 2012 and the composite materials have a wide application prospect in the unbonded flexible risers manufacture an unbonded flexible riser typically consists of carcass layer pressure armour layer tensile armour layers inner and outer sheaths anti friction tapes see fig 1 nkt flexibles presents an unbonded flexible pipe design with carbon fibre reinforced armour layer which is shown in fig 2 a rytter 2004 technip lambert et al 2012 also proposes a riser model with carbon fiber composite armour layers as shown in fig 2 b the special structural form of unbonded flexible riser contribute to complicated mechanical behaviour and the replacing of original steel tensile armour layers by composite armour layer would arise the modeling difficulty considering the complexity and importance of the behaviour of an unbonded flexible riser under axisymmetric loads numerous studies have been conducted in this field over the last decades experimental works on unbonded flexible riser are still few since experiments are normally expensive and time consuming zhang et al 2015 the types of the experimental work can be divided into three categories dip deepwater immersion performance tests tests in hyperbaric chambers and mechanical test secher et al 2011 witz 1996 provided an experiment in 1996 in which present detailed geometric and material properties detailed loading conditions and test results witz conducted the experiment by using a 2 5 inches unbonded flexible riser with eight layers and studied the behaviour of the riser under cyclic axial force cyclic twisting moment and cyclic bending moment and noticeable nonlinear characteristics under twisting moment and hysteresis effect under bending moment were observed since then some analytical and numerical works have been done based on witz s experiment ramos et al 2000 sousa et al 2003 rizzo 2010 there are also some other experimental works about the mechanical behavior of unbonded flexible riser for instance sævik et al 2011 presented an 8 inches flexible test riser and studied the stresses in flexible riser under internal pressure and tension sousa et al 2012 studied the behaviour of an unbonded flexible riser under axial compression and analyzed the bird caging phenomenon of tensile armour layer different from the experimental method numerous analytical and numerical works have been carried out for the analytical works most theoretical formulations are based on a series of restrictive assumptions kebadze 2000 wang and chen 2011 ren et al 2014 concerning the local structural analysis of an unbonded flexible riser under axisymmetric loads several researchers have made their contribution to this field e g fé ret 1987 bahtui 2008 sævik 2005 2011 ren et al 2014 ren et al 2014 summarized the previous analytical works and defined the unknowns of the theoretical model as radius variation thickness variation axial displacement and torsional angle ramos et al 2014 2015 gave an extended 4 4 linear operator and a reduced 2 2 linear operator to analyze the behaviour of unbonded flexible pipe under axisymmetric loads the proposed method was applied in a five layer flexible riser and the analytical results showed good agreement with experimental results also there were some works done using numerical method considering the geometric complexity of unbonded flexible riser model and convergence of the numerical method some simplifications are needed in the numerical modeling of unbonded flexible riser like simulating irregular geometric structures carcass layer zeta layer and tensile armour layer as equivalent beam spring or shell elements sousa et al 2012 wang and chen 2011 bahtui 2008 vaz and rizzo 2011 with the continuous development of computer science the more detailed numerical model is becoming popular ren et al 2014 2016 established a finite element fe model of solid elements by abaqus software in full consideration of the geometric characteristics of unbonded flexible pipe and studied the behaviour of riser under tension and torsion yoo et al 2017 analyzed the ultimate strength of flexible pipes by utilizing an 8 layer detailed numerical model and an equivalent 5 layer model by ansys software considering its complex constitutive and geometric relationship composite materials are usually assumed as orthotropic material in analytical method and the elastic constants can be obtained by an equivalent stress model bai et al 2014 previous works related to the composite material in the ocean engineering mainly concentrated on reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtp which has a different geometric form from unbonded flexible riser there are still limited studies on the mechanical behaviour of composite armour layer this paper aims to provide theoretical and numerical models to predict the mechanical behaviour of unbonded flexible riser with composite armour layers under axial tension this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the elastic constants are present based on equivalent stress assumption and the balance equation of the composite armour layer is deduced by an energy method then the integral theoretical model in consideration of geometric relationship between adjacent layers in unbonded flexible riser is established together with the balance equations of other layers in section 3 the numerical model which takes the detailed geometric characteristics of unbonded flexible riser into account is developed using the abaqus software and a comparative study is performed based on a 2 5 inches unbonded flexible riser model in section 4 the behaviour of unbonded flexible riser with composite armour layers is conducted and several characteristics related to the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser are discussed in addition the effect of the boundary condition is also studied in this section in section 5 some conclusions are drawn 2 theoretical formulations of composite armour layers 2 1 working hypotheses though the end effect of unbonded flexible riser is not considered in the analytical model for practical purposes the magnitude of l 0 initial unstressed length of the riser segment is typically assumed to be o l 0 d 0 10 roberto and kawano 2015 where d 0 stands for the outer diameter of the riser the theoretical model in this paper is based on the following assumptions 1 the axisymmetric loads and bending moment acting on the riser can be decoupled 2 the displacements and strains of layers are small and all materials are homogeneous and have elastic behaviour 3 each of the layers at all cross sections show the same axial displacement and torsional angle per unit of riser length with two ends fixed thickness variations and radial displacements of each layer are assumed uniformly along the length of the riser under the axisymmetric loads 4 the contact pressure between adjacent layers is evenly distributed along the length of the riser 5 the initial manufacturing defects of the riser are ignored 6 for the helical armour layers spacing between tendons is equal and the stress acts respectively in the tangent and normal directions to the central axis of the tendon 7 for the irregular helical layers carcass and zeta layer only the axial deformation is considered 2 2 elastic constants of composite material composite material consists of matrix and fiber assuming each constituent material is distributed uniformly the macro mechanical behaviour of the composite material can be regarded as the combined performance of the constituent materials

analytical model of composite armour layer and unbonded flexible riser helical layer or tensile armour layer contains a number of twisted tendons with rectangle cross section neglecting the influence

r i r m 2 π p o r o r m l π p i r i t π p o r o t l together with the balance equations of the other layers the force strain relationship can be established for the integral of unbonded flexible riser the known parameters include loads material parameters boundary conditions and the unknowns include inner and outer radius of each layer contact pressure between layers elongation and twist see table 1 apart from the balance equations geometric relationship between adjacent layers also should be considered to solve all the unknown strains based on the geometric continuous condition the geometric relationship is given by 28 r m j δ r j t j δ t j 2 r m j 1 δ r j 1 t j 1 δ t j 1 2 j 1 n 1 where j stands for the layer number and n is the total number of layers since there is sometimes gap between adjacent layers sometimes the contact pressure is defined by null when the j layer and the j 1 layer are separated from each other based on the above formulations the analytical solution equations of unbonded flexible riser under axisymmetric loads can be obtained and the flowchart of theoretical solution procedure is presented in fig 5 3 numerical simulation model witz s 8 layers 2 5 inches unbonded flexible riser model is taken as the research object with the geometric and material properties present in table 2 witz 1996 in addition to the introduction of the numerical model this section would also provide verification compared with witz s test 3 1 methodology as shown in fig 6 the finite element model of the unbonded flexible riser is established within the framework of abaqus software to weaken the end effect the length of the numerical model should be of sufficient length typically more than twice the pitch of the tensile armour layers bahtui 2008 which is 1 m in this paper in order to simulate the interlayer s contact and friction all eight layers of the numerical model are established separately and meshed into 8 node linear brick elements with incompatible modes c3d8i element in the abaqus software from fig 6 the full fe model contains 881 680 nodes 409 703 elements more than 2 million degrees of freedom and the grids are small enough in terms of computational precision two reference points rp1 and rp2 are created at the center of each layer s cross section and the cross sectional end points of all layers are bounded rigidly onto the reference point all the loads and boundary conditions are applied to rp1 and rp2 the complicated geometric characteristics are also taken into account in the numerical model and the profile as well as the cross sectional properties of the carcass layer is present in fig 7 and table 3 respectively meanwhile the geometric characteristics of the tensile armour layer are also very complicated and it is hard to define the mechanical properties of the composite material directly thus two local cylindrical coordinate systems with laying angle which is agreed with the laying angle of the tensile armour layer are established within the numerical model and the corresponding material orientation can be defined in order to avoid the non convergent phenomenon the explicit solution method is applied to capture the interaction between separate layers considering that the inertial effect of the numerical simulation must be taken into account in the explicit solution method the ratio of kinetic energy allke to internal energy allie must be kept under 5 to ensure the accuracy of the simulation results ren et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 thus the inertial effect is reduced by using the smooth step loading method and increasing the simulation time and the applied load can be calculated by 29 f f 0 f 1 f 0 ξ 3 10 15 ξ 6 ξ 2 t 0 t t 1 f 1 t t 1 where ξ t t 0 t 1 t 0 meanwhile as the numerical model contains multiple components the general contact algorithm is used to simulate the contact between and inside layers to avoid penetration the normal behaviour due to contact is set to the hard contact and the tangential behaviour due to contact is calculated by coulomb friction model the shear stress τ is given by 30 τ μ p where the friction coefficient μ between layers is assumed to be 0 1 sævik and berge 1995 ren et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 p is the contact pressure between adjacent layers however due to the large amount of the elements and nonlinear contact between and inside layers the total computing time would also be unacceptable thus the target time increment is scaled up to reduce the calculation time with no significant impact on the calculation results in this paper a minimum time increment of 5 10 7 s compared with acquiescent 8 4 10 8 s can improve the computational efficiency and ensure the stability of explicit analysis 3 2 model verification for verification reason witz s 1996 experiment is discussed in this section also based on the analytical method in section 2 the corresponding analytical model is also established for comparison the boundary condition of the loading cases is consistent with witz s model and the corresponding settings of loading conditions are shown in table 4 fig 8 illustrates the axial tension elongation curves of unbonded flexible riser by different methods from fig 8 the experimental axial tension elongation curve has some nonlinear phenomenon which is contributed by bedding in of the component layers witz 1996 and the corresponding axial tensile stiffness calculated by the theoretical and numerical methods in this paper as well as the test result and the average theoretical result obtained by scholars are present in table 5 from fig 8 the trend of the theoretical results is consistent with the numerical and experimental results but the axial tensile stiffness of theoretical method is greater than that of the numerical and experimental methods based on witz s model some institutes and scholars also had given their theoretical predictions which ranged from 89 mn to 165 mn witz 1996 and the average of the prediction results is close to the theoretical results in this paper see table 5 compared with the experimental and numerical methods the analytical method overestimates the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser indicating the difference of the theoretical method where some assumptions have been made on one hand as mentioned in section 2 1 the analytical method cannot include in the effect of the complex contact due to relative displacement as well as the radial and circumferential deformation of irregular heliacal layers carcass and zeta layer and also has made assumption that the contact pressure radial deformation and thickness variation are evenly distributed along the length of the riser for the other hand it is assumed in the analytical model that different layers present the same axial displacement and twist per unit of length however this hypothesis is only valid at the two end sections in the experimental and fe models where all layers are coupled together all the difference makes the discrepancies between the three methods according to table 5 the numerical result due to its ability to model the complex geometric and contact behavior within unbonded flexible riser is closer to the test results compared to the analytical result and there is still a relative deviation of 8 07 between the numerical and the experimental results since there always exists initial pre stress in the actual riser due to the manufacturing process 4 results and discussions the axial tensile stiffness is a primary mechanical property of unbonded flexible riser based on the proposed theoretical and numerical methods the objective of this section is to analyze the effect of composite material on the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser with composite armour layers firstly the theoretical and numerical model is verified with two cases and the effect of boundary condition with top end rotation fixed is also discussed then in consideration of the material properties of carbon fiber composite armour layers the axial tensile stiffness and weight objective of unbonded flexible riser are conducted finally some characteristics related to the axial stiffness are analyzed 4 1 case study carbon fiber is currently one of the most widely used materials and mature in design and manufacture in the industrial community for its advantages of low density excellent mechanical properties simple process and low cost rytter 2004 lambert et al 2012 kalman et al 2012 epoxy resin is the main matrix material for carbon fiber composite and undertakes the function of bonding the fibers transferring the stress between fibers etc two typical carbon fiber composites are studied in this section for verification and the relevant material properties are shown in table 6 deng and liu 2005 from table 6 the composite materials show an obvious orthotropic mechanical behaviour the loading cases of the unbonded flexible riser with carbon fiber composite armour layers are shown in table 7 the boundary condition with top end rotation fixed is also considered thus with four more loading cases the corresponding results are present in fig 9 and table 8 from fig 9 and table 8 the theoretical results regarding the axial tensile stiffness are greater than the numerical results and the relative deviation is about 20 in addition the relative deviation is mainly caused by the assumptions of the theoretical model the numerical model cannot comply with the assumptions that the interlayer contact pressure the radial deformation and the thickness variation are evenly distributed along the length of the riser in the case of the boundary condition with top end rotation fixed there is no more than 1 difference between the two considered boundary conditions which is contributed by the helical structures and the boundary condition can be neglected in the case of unbonded flexible riser with composite armour layers in the following cases the boundary with top end rotation fixed would not be considered 4 2 effect of composite material the carbon fibers can be divided into three types according to the mechanical properties normal carbon fiber high strength carbon fiber and high modulus carbon fiber all the three types of carbon fiber have not only excellent mechanical properties but also low density compared with the steel which has already been widely applied in aeronautics and astronautics and the material properties of the carbon fibers are show in table 9 together with the matrix material s epoxy resin properties from table 9 the high strength carbon fiber has a young s modulus of about 2 6 times that of the steel but only about a quarter of the weight in consideration of the change of the mechanical properties of composite material the issue of targeting the axial tensile stiffness and weight of unbonded flexible riser would be discussed through several carbon fiber ratios with intervals of 10 as the young s modulus of the normal carbon fiber and the high strength carbon fiber is about the same only high strength and high modulus carbon fiber are studied in this section fig 10 presents the change of the elastic constants with the change of the fiber volume fraction fvf according to section 2 2 e 1 and μ 12 is the combined performance along the axial direction thus performing linearly with the increase of the fvf while the young s modulus in the radial direction is related to the volume ratio and perform nonlinearly with the increase of the fvf and has a greatly increase when the fvf is over 80 within the theoretical model the matrix mainly dominates the young s modulus in the radial direction when the fvf is small for comparisons the numerical results through several carbon fiber ratios with intervals of 20 are also present fig 11 shows the trend of axial tensile stiffness with the increasing of fvf from fig 11 the axial tensile stiffness has a non linear increase the non linearity is more obvious at the high modulus of carbon fiber the numerical results are consistent with the trend of the analytical results the relative deviation is about 20 and has an insignificant decrease with the increasing of axial tensile stiffness as the helical axial tensile direction is the main bearing direction and the axial tensile stiffness increases with the increasing of the young s modulus in the helical axial direction of composite armour layer assuming that the radial and circumference young s modulus of composite armour layer has limited effect on the axial tensile stiffness a case control study on the stiffness is carried out based on loading case b1 and b2 in the control case the composite armour layer is set to isotropic material and the young s modulus equals the axial young s modulus the corresponding results are present in table 10 and approximate results can be obtained by the control case compared with the original cases the relative deviation by theoretical and numerical method is no more than 0 47 and the simplified numerical model not only simplifies the modeling process but also saves about 20 calculating time to satisfy the original axial stiffness of unbonded flexible riser the fvfs of different composite materials are calculated as for the normal and high strength carbon fiber the fvfs have to exceed 90 92 73 for normal carbon fiber 91 07 for high strength carbon fiber and based on existing manufacturing technology it is difficult to manufacture such composite materials for the high modulus carbon fiber less than 40 of fvf 37 46 for high modulus carbon fiber can achieve the tensile stiffness of original model thus the high modulus carbon fiber is a better choice by means of mechanical properties in the field of manufacture of composite armour layer meanwhile the numerical method is also applied for checking the different models and the corresponding results are present in table 11 the results of two different materials are in good agreement with the original model while in the case when the equivalent tensile stiffness is acquired with high modulus carbon fiber e 1 of the composite material is a little greater than the young s modulus of steel it is also noted that the direction of the fiber in composite cannot be strictly distributed about the axial direction and the practical fvf actually should be greater than the result obtained by theoretical method the density of the composite material is also related to the two constituent materials 31 ρ ρ f v f ρ m v m thus the change of the density is also linear between 1 54 1 75 kg m3 which is significantly less than the density of steel per unit of length the weight can reduce by 11 35 11 74 kg m3 compared with the original model benefiting the dynamic behaviour of unbonded flexible riser 4 3 characteristics analysis of axial stiffness there are several characteristics that can affect the axial stiffness when the geometric and mechanical characteristics of tendons are fixed characteristics of laying angle of composite armour layer and the thickness of outer sheath are discussed in this section the material properties are set as the high modulus carbon fiber model which can maintain the original tensile stiffness owing to the geometric restriction of tendons the change on laying angle should be small ren et al 2014 thus the loading cases are set in consideration of the laying angle with range of 35 5 and 1 interval besides the tendon volume for per unit of length which is related to the weight of unbonded flexible riser is also discussed as present in fig 12 the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser is sensitive to the laying angle of composite armour layer and decreases almost linear with the increase of laying angle while the trend of the volume is on the contrary suggesting that the model with smaller layering angle would also reduce the integral weight of unbonded flexible riser the outer sheath can isolate the inside of pipe and the outer environment and also support the axial force with 0 5 mm spacing the axial tensile stiffness with different thickness of outer sheath is present in fig 13 the axial tensile stiffness is proportional to the thickness of outer sheath and the axial stiffness of unbonded flexible riser has a considerably low sensitivity for the thickness of outer sheath where the axial stiffness is increased by no more than 2 when the thickness of outer sheath is increased by 19 times 5 conclusions in this study the mechanical behaviour of unbonded flexible riser with composite armour layers under axial tension is investigated firstly this paper proposes a theoretical model to predict the behaviour of composite armour layer subjected to axisymmetric loads by energy method then a numerical method in full consideration of detailed geometric characteristics large geometric deformation complex contact and friction is adopted by the abaqus software based on witz s experiment in 1996 the proposed methods are verified afterwards the axial tensile stiffness and weight of unbonded flexible riser related to the properties of composite materials are discussed additionally characteristics analysis related to the axial stiffness is conducted besides the effect of the boundary conditions is also discussed in this paper the results show that the proposed theoretical method can be a fast calculation method for forecasting the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser and can provide some reference for the numerical model and the numerical method can simulate the riser under axial tension more realistically the methods in this paper could provide reference for further study like behaviour of unbonded flexible riser under combined axisymmetric loads and provide parameters for dynamic analysis some conclusions are drawn in the end of this paper 1 the replacement of original tensile armour layers by composite armour layers can maintain the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser when the fiber volume fraction of composite reaches 37 46 at least and the high modulus carbon fiber has a better mechanical performance than the other two carbon fibers in terms of axial stiffness 2 composite armour layers can also reduce the weight of tensile armour layers by about 80 compared to steel tensile armour layers greatly reducing the weight of unbonded flexible riser 3 for the analysis of tensile stiffness simplification of the complicated composite models as isotropic material can also obtain an approximate result and the simplified model can improve the modeling efficiency and also the computational efficiency by about 20 4 the decreasing of laying angle of composite armour layers can benefit the axial tensile stiffness to a great extent and reduce the weight per unit length as well the thickness of the outer sheath has limited effect on the axial tensile stiffness 5 the effect of the boundary condition with the top end rotation fixed can be neglected in the condition when the unbonded flexible riser under axial tension author contribution statement liu qingsheng methodology software xue hongxiang

22067,unbonded flexible risers are widely applied to deep water oil and gas production field and their complex cross section mechanical properties have always been a challenging issue in ocean engineering over the recent years the traditional steel tensile armour layers of unbonded flexible risers are replaced by composite materials owing to their advantages of lightweight and high strength

characteristics analysis of axial stiffness is carried out and the effect of the boundary condition is discussed as well keywords unbonded flexible riser energy method axial tensile stiffness composite armour layer detailed geometric characteristics 1 introduction unbonded flexible risers have been widely employed to transport oil and gas resources from underwater wellheads to the offshore rigs in ocean engineering several works have been carried out on the mechanical properties of unbonded flexible risers due to its complicated construction with offshore oil and gas development stepping into ultra deep waters some new materials have been applied to the unbonded flexible risers manufacture and composite material is one of them composite materials can reduce the weight of riser provide better mechanical properties enhance corrosion resistant properties and reduce installation costs some institutes like nkt flexibles and technip have already utilized cross wrapped composite armour layers to replace the helical armour layers in unbonded flexible riser to enhance the strength of the riser and lighten the pipe weight rytter 2004 do and lambert 2012 lambert et al 2012 kalman et al 2012 and the composite materials have a wide application prospect in the unbonded flexible risers manufacture an unbonded flexible riser typically consists of carcass layer pressure armour layer tensile armour layers inner and outer sheaths anti friction tapes see fig 1 nkt flexibles presents an unbonded flexible pipe design with carbon fibre reinforced armour layer which is shown in fig 2 a rytter 2004 technip lambert et al 2012 also proposes a riser model with carbon fiber composite armour layers as shown in fig 2 b the special structural form of unbonded flexible riser contribute to complicated mechanical behaviour and the replacing of original steel tensile armour layers by composite armour layer would arise the modeling difficulty considering the complexity and importance of the behaviour of an unbonded flexible riser under axisymmetric loads numerous studies have been conducted in this field over the last decades experimental works on unbonded flexible riser are still few since experiments are normally expensive and time consuming zhang et al 2015 the types of the experimental work can be divided into three categories dip deepwater immersion performance tests tests in hyperbaric chambers and mechanical test secher et al 2011 witz 1996 provided an experiment in 1996 in which present detailed geometric and material properties detailed loading conditions and test results witz conducted the experiment by using a 2 5 inches unbonded flexible riser with eight layers and studied the behaviour of the riser under cyclic axial force cyclic twisting moment and cyclic bending moment and noticeable nonlinear characteristics under twisting moment and hysteresis effect under bending moment were observed since then some analytical and numerical works have been done based on witz s experiment ramos et al 2000 sousa et al 2003 rizzo 2010 there are also some other experimental works about the mechanical behavior of unbonded flexible riser for instance sævik et al 2011 presented an 8 inches flexible test riser and studied the stresses in flexible riser under internal pressure and tension sousa et al 2012 studied the behaviour of an unbonded flexible riser under axial compression and analyzed the bird caging phenomenon of tensile armour layer different from the experimental method numerous analytical and numerical works have been carried out for the analytical works most theoretical formulations are based on a series of restrictive assumptions kebadze 2000 wang and chen 2011 ren et al 2014 concerning the local structural analysis of an unbonded flexible riser under axisymmetric loads several researchers have made their contribution to this field e g fé ret 1987 bahtui 2008 sævik 2005 2011 ren et al 2014 ren et al 2014 summarized the previous analytical works and defined the unknowns of the theoretical model as radius variation thickness variation axial displacement and torsional angle ramos et al 2014 2015 gave an extended 4 4 linear operator and a reduced 2 2 linear operator to analyze the behaviour of unbonded flexible pipe under axisymmetric loads the proposed method was applied in a five layer flexible riser and the analytical results showed good agreement with experimental results also there were some works done using numerical method considering the geometric complexity of unbonded flexible riser model and convergence of the numerical method some simplifications are needed in the numerical modeling of unbonded flexible riser like simulating irregular geometric structures carcass layer zeta layer and tensile armour layer as equivalent beam spring or shell elements sousa et al 2012 wang and chen 2011 bahtui 2008 vaz and rizzo 2011 with the continuous development of computer science the more detailed numerical model is becoming popular ren et al 2014 2016 established a finite element fe model of solid elements by abaqus software in full consideration of the geometric characteristics of unbonded flexible pipe and studied the behaviour of riser under tension and torsion yoo et al 2017 analyzed the ultimate strength of flexible pipes by utilizing an 8 layer detailed numerical model and an equivalent 5 layer model by ansys software considering its complex constitutive and geometric relationship composite materials are usually assumed as orthotropic material in analytical method and the elastic constants can be obtained by an equivalent stress model bai et al 2014 previous works related to the composite material in the ocean engineering mainly concentrated on reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtp which has a different geometric form from unbonded flexible riser there are still limited studies on the mechanical behaviour of composite armour layer this paper aims to provide theoretical and numerical models to predict the mechanical behaviour of unbonded flexible riser with composite armour layers under axial tension this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the elastic constants are present based on equivalent stress assumption and the balance equation of the composite armour layer is deduced by an energy method then the integral theoretical model in consideration of geometric relationship between adjacent layers in unbonded flexible riser is established together with the balance equations of other layers in section 3 the numerical model which takes the detailed geometric characteristics of unbonded flexible riser into account is developed using the abaqus software and a comparative study is performed based on a 2 5 inches unbonded flexible riser model in section 4 the behaviour of unbonded flexible riser with composite armour layers is conducted and several characteristics related to the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser are discussed in addition the effect of the boundary condition is also studied in this section in section 5 some conclusions are drawn 2 theoretical formulations of composite armour layers 2 1 working hypotheses though the end effect of unbonded flexible riser is not considered in the analytical model for practical purposes the magnitude of l 0 initial unstressed length of the riser segment is typically assumed to be o l 0 d 0 10 roberto and kawano 2015 where d 0 stands for the outer diameter of the riser the theoretical model in this paper is based on the following assumptions 1 the axisymmetric loads and bending moment acting on the riser can be decoupled 2 the displacements and strains of layers are small and all materials are homogeneous and have elastic behaviour 3 each of the layers at all cross sections show the same axial displacement and torsional angle per unit of riser length with two ends fixed thickness variations and radial displacements of each layer are assumed uniformly along the length of the riser under the axisymmetric loads 4 the contact pressure between adjacent layers is evenly distributed along the length of the riser 5 the initial manufacturing defects of the riser are ignored 6 for the helical armour layers spacing between tendons is equal and the stress acts respectively in the tangent and normal directions to the central axis of the tendon 7 for the irregular helical layers carcass and zeta layer only the axial deformation is considered 2 2 elastic constants of composite material composite material consists of matrix

r i r m 2 π p o r o r m l π p i r i t π p o r o t l together with the balance equations of the other layers the force strain relationship can be established for the integral of unbonded flexible riser the known parameters include loads material parameters boundary conditions and the unknowns include inner and outer radius of each layer contact pressure between layers elongation and twist see table 1 apart from the balance equations geometric relationship between adjacent layers also should be considered to solve all the unknown strains based on the geometric continuous condition the geometric relationship is given by 28 r m j δ r j t j δ t j 2 r m j 1 δ r j 1 t j 1 δ t j 1 2 j 1 n 1 where j stands for the layer number and n is the total number of layers since there is sometimes gap between adjacent layers sometimes the contact pressure is defined by null when the j layer and the j 1 layer are separated from each other based on the above formulations the analytical solution equations of unbonded flexible riser under axisymmetric loads can be obtained and the flowchart of theoretical solution procedure is presented in fig 5 3 numerical simulation model witz s 8 layers 2 5 inches unbonded flexible riser model is taken as the research object with the geometric and material properties present in table 2 witz 1996 in addition to the introduction of the numerical model this section would also provide verification compared with witz s test 3 1 methodology as shown in fig 6 the finite element model of the unbonded flexible riser is established within the framework of abaqus software to weaken the end effect the length of the numerical model should be of sufficient length typically more than twice the pitch of the tensile armour layers bahtui 2008 which is 1 m in this paper in order to simulate the interlayer s contact and friction all eight layers of the numerical model are established separately and meshed into 8 node linear brick elements with incompatible modes c3d8i element in the abaqus software from fig 6 the full fe model contains 881 680 nodes 409 703 elements more than 2 million degrees of freedom and the grids are small enough in terms of computational precision two reference points rp1 and rp2 are created at the center of each layer s cross section and the cross sectional end points of all layers are bounded rigidly onto the reference point all the loads and boundary conditions are applied to rp1 and rp2 the complicated geometric characteristics are also taken into account in the numerical model and the profile as well as the cross sectional properties of the carcass layer is present in fig 7 and table 3 respectively meanwhile the geometric characteristics of the tensile armour layer are also very complicated and it is hard to define the mechanical properties of the composite material directly thus two local cylindrical coordinate systems with laying angle which is agreed with the laying angle of the tensile armour layer are established within the numerical model and the corresponding material orientation can be defined in order to avoid the non convergent phenomenon the explicit solution method is applied to capture the interaction between separate layers considering that the inertial effect of the numerical simulation must be taken into account in the explicit solution method the ratio of kinetic energy allke to internal energy allie must be kept under 5 to ensure the accuracy of the simulation results ren et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 thus the inertial effect is reduced by using the smooth step loading method and increasing the simulation time and the applied load can be calculated by 29 f f 0 f 1 f 0 ξ 3 10 15 ξ 6 ξ 2 t 0 t t 1 f 1 t t 1 where ξ t t 0 t 1 t 0 meanwhile as the numerical model contains multiple components the general contact algorithm is used to simulate the contact between and inside layers to avoid penetration the normal behaviour due to contact is set to the hard contact and the tangential behaviour due to contact is calculated by coulomb friction model the shear stress τ is given by 30 τ μ p where the friction coefficient μ between layers is assumed to be 0 1 sævik and berge 1995 ren et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 p is the contact pressure between adjacent layers however due to the large amount of the elements and nonlinear contact between and inside layers the total computing time would also be unacceptable thus the target time increment is scaled up to reduce the calculation time with no significant impact on the calculation results in this paper a minimum time increment of 5 10 7 s compared with acquiescent 8 4 10 8 s can improve the computational efficiency and ensure the stability of explicit analysis 3 2 model verification for verification reason witz s 1996 experiment is discussed in this section also based on the analytical method in section 2 the corresponding analytical model is also established for comparison the boundary condition of the loading cases is consistent with witz s model and the corresponding settings of loading conditions are shown in table 4 fig 8 illustrates the axial tension elongation curves of unbonded flexible riser by different methods from fig 8 the experimental axial tension elongation curve has some nonlinear phenomenon which is contributed by bedding in of the component layers witz 1996 and the corresponding axial tensile stiffness calculated by the theoretical and numerical methods in this paper as well as the test result and the average theoretical result obtained by scholars are present in table 5 from fig 8 the trend of the theoretical results is consistent with the numerical and experimental results but the axial tensile stiffness of theoretical method is greater than that of the numerical and experimental methods based on witz s model some institutes and scholars also had given their theoretical predictions which ranged from 89 mn to 165 mn witz 1996 and the average of the prediction results is close to the theoretical results in this paper see table 5 compared with the experimental and numerical methods the analytical method overestimates the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser indicating the difference of the theoretical method where some assumptions have been made on one hand as mentioned in section 2 1 the analytical method cannot include in the effect of the complex contact due to relative displacement as well as the radial and circumferential deformation of irregular heliacal layers carcass and zeta layer and also has made assumption that the contact pressure radial deformation and thickness variation are evenly distributed along the length of the riser for the other hand it is assumed in the analytical model that different layers present the same axial displacement and twist per unit of length however this hypothesis is only valid at the two end sections in the experimental and fe models where all layers are coupled together all the difference makes the discrepancies between the three methods according to table 5 the numerical result due to its ability to model the complex geometric and contact behavior within unbonded flexible riser is closer to the test results compared to the analytical result and there is still a relative deviation of 8 07 between the numerical and the experimental results since there always exists initial pre stress in the actual riser due to the manufacturing process 4 results and discussions the axial tensile stiffness is a primary mechanical property of unbonded flexible riser based on the proposed theoretical and numerical methods the objective of this section is to analyze the effect of composite material on the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser with composite armour layers firstly the theoretical and numerical model is verified with two cases and the effect of boundary condition with top end rotation fixed is also discussed then in consideration of the material properties of carbon fiber composite armour layers the axial tensile stiffness and weight objective of unbonded flexible riser are conducted finally some characteristics related to the axial stiffness are analyzed 4 1 case study carbon fiber is currently one of the most widely used materials and mature in design and manufacture in the industrial community for its advantages of low density excellent mechanical properties simple process and low cost rytter 2004 lambert et al 2012 kalman et al 2012 epoxy resin is the main matrix material for carbon fiber composite and undertakes the function of bonding the fibers transferring the stress between fibers etc two typical carbon fiber composites are studied in this section for verification and the relevant material properties are shown in table 6 deng and liu 2005 from table 6 the composite materials show an obvious orthotropic mechanical behaviour the loading cases of the unbonded flexible riser with carbon fiber composite armour layers are shown in table 7 the boundary condition with top end rotation fixed is also considered thus with four more loading cases the corresponding results are present in fig 9 and table 8 from fig 9 and table 8 the theoretical results regarding the axial tensile stiffness are greater than the numerical results and the relative deviation is about 20 in addition the relative deviation is mainly caused by the assumptions of the theoretical model the numerical model cannot comply with the assumptions that the interlayer contact pressure the radial deformation and the thickness variation are evenly distributed along the length of the riser in the case of the boundary condition with top end rotation fixed there is no more than 1 difference between the two considered boundary conditions which is contributed by the helical structures and the boundary condition can be neglected in the case of unbonded flexible riser with composite armour layers in the following cases the boundary with top end rotation fixed would not be considered 4 2 effect of composite material the carbon fibers can be divided into three types according to the mechanical properties normal carbon fiber high strength carbon fiber and high modulus carbon fiber all the three types of carbon fiber have not only excellent mechanical properties but also low density compared with the steel which has already been widely applied in aeronautics and astronautics and the material properties of the carbon fibers are show in table 9 together with the matrix material s epoxy resin properties from table 9 the high strength carbon fiber has a young s modulus of about 2 6 times that of the steel but only about a quarter of the weight in consideration of the change of the mechanical properties of composite material the issue of targeting the axial tensile stiffness and weight of unbonded flexible riser would be discussed through several carbon fiber ratios with intervals of 10 as the young s modulus of the normal carbon fiber and the high strength carbon fiber is about the same only high strength and high modulus carbon fiber are studied in this section fig 10 presents the change of the elastic constants with the change of the fiber volume fraction fvf according to section 2 2 e 1 and μ 12 is the combined performance along the axial direction thus performing linearly with the increase of the fvf while the young s modulus in the radial direction is related to the volume ratio and perform nonlinearly with the increase of the fvf and has a greatly increase when the fvf is over 80 within the theoretical model the matrix mainly dominates the young s modulus in the radial direction when the fvf is small for comparisons the numerical results through several carbon fiber ratios with intervals of 20 are also present fig 11 shows the trend of axial tensile stiffness with the increasing of fvf from fig 11 the axial tensile stiffness has a non linear increase the non linearity is more obvious at the high modulus of carbon fiber the numerical results are consistent with the trend of the analytical results the relative deviation is about 20 and has an insignificant decrease with the increasing of axial tensile stiffness as the helical axial tensile direction is the main bearing direction and the axial tensile stiffness increases with the increasing of the young s modulus in the helical axial direction of composite armour layer assuming that the radial and circumference young s modulus of composite armour layer has limited effect on the axial tensile stiffness a case control study on the stiffness is carried out based on loading case b1 and b2 in the control case the composite armour layer is set to isotropic material and the young s modulus equals the axial young s modulus the corresponding results are present in table 10 and approximate results can be obtained by the control case compared with the original cases the relative deviation by theoretical and numerical method is no more than 0 47 and the simplified numerical model not only simplifies the modeling process but also saves about 20 calculating time to satisfy the original axial stiffness of unbonded flexible riser the fvfs of different composite materials are calculated as for the normal and high strength carbon fiber the fvfs have to exceed 90 92 73 for normal carbon fiber 91 07 for high strength carbon fiber and based on existing manufacturing technology it is difficult to manufacture such composite materials for the high modulus carbon fiber less than 40 of fvf 37 46 for high modulus carbon fiber can achieve the tensile stiffness of original model thus the high modulus carbon fiber is a better choice by means of mechanical properties in the field of manufacture of composite armour layer meanwhile the numerical method is also applied for checking the different models and the corresponding results are present in table 11 the results of two different materials are in good agreement with the original model while in the case when the equivalent tensile stiffness is acquired with high modulus carbon fiber e 1 of the composite material is a little greater than the young s modulus of steel it is also noted that the direction of the fiber in composite cannot be strictly distributed about the axial direction and the practical fvf actually should be greater than the result obtained by theoretical method the density of the composite material is also related to the two constituent materials 31 ρ ρ f v f ρ m v m thus the change of the density is also linear between 1 54 1 75 kg m3 which is significantly less than the density of steel per unit of length the weight can reduce by 11 35 11 74 kg m3 compared with the original model benefiting the dynamic behaviour of unbonded flexible riser 4 3 characteristics analysis of axial stiffness there are several characteristics that can affect the axial stiffness when the geometric and mechanical characteristics of tendons are fixed characteristics of laying angle of composite armour layer and the thickness of outer sheath are discussed in this section the material properties are set as the high modulus carbon fiber model which can maintain the original tensile stiffness owing to the geometric restriction of tendons the change on laying angle should be small ren et al 2014 thus the loading cases are set in consideration of the laying angle with range of 35 5 and 1 interval besides the tendon volume for per unit of length which is related to the weight of unbonded flexible riser is also discussed as present in fig 12 the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser is sensitive to the laying angle of composite armour layer and decreases almost linear with the increase of laying angle while the trend of the volume is on the contrary suggesting that the model with smaller layering angle would also reduce the integral weight of unbonded flexible riser the outer sheath can isolate the inside of pipe and the outer environment and also support the axial force with 0 5 mm spacing the axial tensile stiffness with different thickness of outer sheath is present in fig 13 the axial tensile stiffness is proportional to the thickness of outer sheath and the axial stiffness of unbonded flexible riser has a considerably low sensitivity for the thickness of outer sheath where the axial stiffness is increased by no more than 2 when the thickness of outer sheath is increased by 19 times 5 conclusions in this study the mechanical behaviour of unbonded flexible riser with composite armour layers under axial tension is investigated firstly this paper proposes a theoretical model to predict the behaviour of composite armour layer subjected to axisymmetric loads by energy method then a numerical method in full consideration of detailed geometric characteristics large geometric deformation complex contact and friction is adopted by the abaqus software based on witz s experiment in 1996 the proposed methods are verified afterwards the axial tensile stiffness and weight of unbonded flexible riser related to the properties of composite materials are discussed additionally characteristics analysis related to the axial stiffness is conducted besides the effect of the boundary conditions is also discussed in this paper the results show that the proposed theoretical method can be a fast calculation method for forecasting the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser and can provide some reference for the numerical model and the numerical method can simulate the riser under axial tension more realistically the methods in this paper could provide reference for further study like behaviour of unbonded flexible riser under combined axisymmetric loads and provide parameters for dynamic analysis some conclusions are drawn in the end of this paper 1 the replacement of original tensile armour layers by composite armour layers can maintain the axial tensile stiffness of unbonded flexible riser when the fiber volume fraction of composite reaches 37 46 at least and the high modulus carbon fiber has a better mechanical performance than the other two carbon fibers in terms of axial stiffness 2 composite armour layers can also reduce the weight of tensile armour layers by about 80 compared to steel tensile armour layers greatly reducing the weight of unbonded flexible riser 3 for the analysis of tensile stiffness simplification of the complicated composite models as isotropic material can also obtain an approximate result and the simplified model can improve the modeling efficiency and also the computational efficiency by about 20 4 the decreasing of laying angle of composite armour layers can benefit the axial tensile stiffness to a great extent and reduce the weight per unit length as well the thickness of the outer sheath has limited effect on the axial tensile stiffness 5 the effect of the boundary condition with the top end rotation fixed can be neglected in the condition when the unbonded flexible riser under axial tension author contribution statement liu qingsheng methodology software xue hongxiang

22068,with the aim of the developing offshore wind turbines in the deep sea and with the demand for larger capacity turbines a brace structure was designed to provide guidance for an offshore wind turbine jacket foundation the influence of the brace structure on the bearing capacity and load transfer mode from the top to bottom of the jacket structure was studied using numerical simulation the results show that among various topological structures the x type topological mode has great advantages for the bearing capacity the number of layers can be decreased to reduce the cost of offshore wind power when the section moment of inertia of the brace is greater the load on the top of the leg is smaller and the proportion of the horizontal load on the bottom of the compressive leg is higher the properties of the brace only affect the bearing capacity of the structure in a small range keywords jacket bearing capacity load transfer brace topological section properties 1 introduction with an increase in worldwide attention to offshore wind power offshore wind turbines have made great progress in recent years wind and council 2019 to achieve efficient utilization of offshore wind energy there are two major challenges with respect to offshore wind turbines in the current era oh et al 2018 one challenge is the deep water development of offshore wind turbines currently most of the offshore wind farms that have been developed are concentrated in areas of the sea area where the water depth is 30 m or less and there are an abundance of deep water wind farms that have not been developed yet the second challenge is increasing the capacity of a single turbine under certain conditions when a turbine is bigger it occupies less units and uses less sea area and the infrastructure cost is easier to control the crown estate 2012 therefore developing offshore wind energy has several advantages the design and installation of the foundation of traditional offshore wind turbines include the monopile multi pile cap foundation gravity foundation and composite suction bucket foundation which are relatively mature techniques ding et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 2017 jia et al 2018 he et al 2017 wang et al 2019 however these approaches have certain limitations for sea areas where the depth is more than 30 m the materials and construction cost of offshore structures are relatively high and the stability of these foundations is insufficient for relative deep water areas 30 m 50 m thus their applicability for deep water areas is not strong however large scale use of the jacket structure in offshore oil and gas platforms has been fully verified for application in deep water tjelta 1994 in recent years offshore wind farms using the multi bucket jacket foundation as a support structure have been successively built around the world geotechnics 2017 proving the applicability of this type of foundation in intermediate water depth and for large capacity turbines shown in fig 1 the jacket structure is a spatial steel frame formed by welding legs and braces through joints which makes its stiffness greater however different from an offshore platform structure that covers a large area the jacket structure for offshore turbines is much simpler and is mainly based on longitudinal topology more importantly the load that an offshore turbines jacket structure bears is mainly due to the large bending moment and horizontal load transmitted by the top of the turbine at present countries that have abundant marine resources have carried out relevant research on the jacket foundation for offshore wind power in the early stage petrini geotechnics 2017 and hao and liu 2017 used numerical simulation and compared the stress distribution of monopile tripod and jacket foundations under a static load dynamic load and ship impact load they found that the jacket foundation as a basic substructure was more uniform than the other two forms of stress distribution and had the best overall performance for the dynamic characteristics of jacket structures with various topological forms shi et al 2011 2013a 2013b 2015 studied the natural frequency of the system and the shear force and bending moment differences of the components they found that the overall stiffness of the z type is smaller than that of the x type also the internal force of the structure under a dynamic load is smaller and this can reduce structural fatigue and enhance the life of offshore turbines in terms of optimizing the structural design gentils et al 2017 used finite element analysis and a genetic algorithm to optimize the overall quality of an owt offshore wind turbine supporting structure to improve the design efficiency of the supporting structure of offshore wind turbines meanwhile a size optimization method that considered fatigue and the limit state was verified by oest et al 2016 who used cplex in ibm ilog popko et al 2012 used coupling simulation and verified the modeling code of the owt jacket support structure and explained the importance of local dynamics in structural design when designing the jacket structure it should not only have enough safety performance but also be convenient for manufacturing and construction and reduce the cost as much as possible häfele et al 2018 the commonly used design specifications in engineering only specify the design size limits of joints and bars to meet certain design requirements but do not give more instructions on how to adjust american petroleum institute 2014 det norske veritas 2005 2014 2016 2019 the research regarding the jacket structure in offshore wind turbines field has mainly been focused on the static and dynamic response and overall quality optimization but research on the optimization of the specific topological structure and transmission mode is still lacking therefore this article adopts the numerical simulation method to study the form of the jacket structure brace topology layering and the brace section attribute for variables and discusses the various factors in terms of the influence of the horizontal vertical and flexural bearing capacity of the jacket structure within the scope of the standard this article also explains the load distribution in the jacket and analyzes the impact of various factors on the structure of the load transfer this research provides guidance for the design of offshore wind turbines 2 load condition and calculation model the jacket structure for an offshore turbine located at a depth of approximately 50 m in the north sea of the netherlands is the research object of this paper the turbine used with the jacket design is an nrel general 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 vorpahl et al 2011 for environmental conditions and tower parameters see upwind 2010 a diagram of the jacket model is shown in the fig 2 the main calculations in this paper were carried out using the finite element software abaqus which is widely used in structural engineering was used for the load calculations and results assessment all parts of the jacket structure are steel tubes and the properties and dimensions of the steel pipes are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively dnv 2014 simple elastic plastic constitutions in abaqus were used for analysis and the stress strain curve of steel was shown in fig 3 the research of this paper is focused on the brace topology and the relationship between the bearing capacity of the jacket and the load transfer between the brace and leg thus the influence of bottom transverse bracing and the interaction between the foundation structure and soil were ignored also the stiffness of the bottom of the structure was considered to be infinite thus the freedom in all 6 directions of the bottom of the structure was restricted in abaqus long et al 2011 long and moe 2012 meanwhile the b32 beam element was adopted in abaqus with a mesh size of 0 2 m 3 effects of topological forms of braces on bearing capacity and transfer load 3 1 finite element model x type z type and k type are commonly used topological structures for jackets in offshore wind turbines the z type can be divided into z1 type z2 type and z3 type on the basis of its spatial arrangement and the k type topological structure can be divided into k1 type and k2 type on the basis of the opening direction in this section jackets with these six jacket topological forms shown in fig 4 of brace are established the bearing performance analysis and force transfer analysis of the six jacket structures in the service state were carried out except for the brace layout all of the other parameters of the six kinds of jacket are the same including the height of each layer material properties and section properties of the leg and brace 3 2 horizontal vertical and flexural capacity analysis the displacement control method was adopted to apply horizontal displacement vertical displacement and an angular angle to the jacket structure from the geometric center on the top of the jacket structure the moment when the jacket structure shows plastic deformation is taken as the instability position load displacement curves of the jacket structures under various topological conditions are shown in figs 5 7 the topology of the brace has a significant effect on the horizontal and flexural bearing capacity of the jacket for structures under a horizontal load the x type z type and k2 type reach their ultimate bearing capacity when the top displacement is about 0 3 m in contrast the k1 form has greater flexibility and the ultimate bearing capacity is at a displacement of 0 4 m the horizontal bearing capacity of the x type jacket structure was the largest followed by that of the k type structure and that of the z type structure was the lowest the horizontal bearing capacity of the z type structure was only 0 7 times that of the x type in the three types of z type structures the values of the horizontal bearing capacity are basically the same and the z3 type reaches its ultimate strength earlier than z1 and z2 with greater relative stiffness for the vertical bearing capacity the bearing capacity is almost identical for each structure and the stiffness is almost identical for each structure in terms of the bending resistance of the jacket structures the k1 type and x type are the best the k2 type and the three z type structures have lower flexural capacity among these the k2 type has the lowest flexural stiffness and the flexural stiffness and capacity of the three z type structures are relatively consistent table 3 lists the mass of each topological jacket structure it can be seen that z type has the lowest steel consumption x type is slightly larger than z and k type is the largest the structural displacements of the jacket during instability are shown in figs 8 9 under a horizontal load the displacement of the structure increases gradually from the bottom to the top the displacement of the structure under the action of the bending moment is different from that under the action of the horizontal load the displacement does not change uniformly with the height it is mainly focused on the top especially the two layer brace on the top for the large deformation component the x type diagonal brace rotates in the direction of the bending moment with the bottom joint as the center and this bar is mainly affected by the bending moment and axial force the rotation center of the z type diagonal brace on the top floor is located at the bottom joint the rotation center of the next layer is located at the lower middle of the bar and the rotation center of the z type transverse brace is located in the middle of the bar bearing a large shear force when the bottom joint is the center of rotation k1 displacement increases evenly along the height because of the influence of the transverse support joint at the top the k2 diagonal support deforms greatly at the joint the displacement of the k1 type transverse brace increases from both ends to the middle and thus this transverse brace plays an important role in bending resistance the displacement direction of the k2 type transverse brace on both sides of the midpoint is different and thus it plays a role in shear resistance the four leg jacket structure is symmetrical about both axes so the influence of loading direction on the bearing capacity of the structure can be searched within 0 45 as shown in fig 10 the horizontal bearing capacity of the x type jacket structure searched every 15 in the range of 45 is shown in fig 11 the horizontal bearing capacity of the structure decreases gradually as the direction of the load shifts from the symmetry axis to the diagonal of square in the elastic stage the direction of load has no effect on the horizontal stiffness of the structure therefore the lower limit of horizontal bearing capacity of the structure is 45 and the bearing capacity is 75 of 0 the flexural capacity of x type jacket structure under different direction bending moment is shown in fig 12 as the load deviates from the axis of symmetry the flexural capacity decreases before reaching the bearing capacity of the structure the flexural stiffness of the structure is the same in all directions in terms of resistance to bending moment the performance was also the weakest in the 45 direction only about 75 of the 0 direction 3 3 horizontal vertical and bending moment transfer analysis the purpose of this section is to clarify the way that the upper load passes down gradually through the jacket extracting the bending moment horizontal internal force and vertical internal force of each section of the legs of various jacket structures under the ultimate limit state the internal force extraction method of the section is shown in fig 13 the load of a leg section is considered to be dimensionless 1 h h h v v v m m m where h v and m are the horizontal load vertical load and bending moment load of the extracted chord section respectively h v and m are the external loads on the top of the structure under the ultimate limit state h v and m are the ratio of the load assigned to the legs to the external load the horizontal load distribution of each section of the legs with respect to height is shown as fig 14 the horizontal load that is borne by the legs gradually increases from top to bottom and the load variation between the lower three layers is relatively uniform because of the large deformation at the top the horizontal load that is borne by the brace in the topological structure of the top layer is slightly larger for the different topological forms of braces the k2 chord bar bears the smallest horizontal load followed by the x type the three z types bear basically the same load which is slightly larger than x type the k1 type bears the largest horizontal load and the horizontal component force coefficient of the top legs is within the range of 0 43 0 58 and that of the bottom is between 0 68 and 0 75 as seen in fig 15 the vertical load borne by the legs increases gradually from the top to the bottom and the diagonal section is the dead weight of the leg the abrupt change is the value transmitted from the brace to the leg through the joint and this consists of the dead weight of the brace and the external load the jacket structure of an offshore wind turbine is mainly characterized by the huge bending moment load generated by the upper horizontal load in the six topological forms the section bending moment that is borne by the legs gradually increases from the top to bottom and the bottom is about 3 2 times the bending moment load that is borne by the top shown in fig 16 between the leg joints of each layer the bending moment in the leg is basically consistent with the height and it is related to the size and inclination of the structure at the joint the leg is subjected to the bending moment load that is transmitted by the brace and the bending moment diagram of the section suddenly changes the bending moment of the foundation structure is mainly composed of two parts 1 the bending moment from the bottom of the tower and 2 the part that is caused by the horizontal load therefore under the top concentrated load simulation method that was adopted in this paper the bending moment between the legs increases linearly however if the nonlinear wave load on the foundation of the in situ state is considered then the distribution of the bending moment between the chords is more complicated however the overall trend will not change much for the six topological forms of braces under the same loading condition the k2 type leg bears the lowest bending moment load followed by the z type and x type and k1 type leg bears the largest bending moment load combined with the displacement diagram and the flexural capacity curve the k2 type brace is the one that is most affected by the bending moment whereas its flexural capacity is relatively the lowest it can be inferred that the flexural performance of the structure is related to the strength of the top brace and that the size of the top brace can be appropriately engineered to increase the horizontal load and bending moment transfer of the legs under load in different directions are shown in fig 17 the direction of the load does not affect the transfer of the legs fig 18 shows the stress distribution of jacket structure under extreme load obviously in the jacket structure of the six arrangement forms the stress of the leg is higher and the stress of the brace is an order of magnitude lower than that of the chord this is determined by the tension compressive system of the jacket structure while the main function of the brace is to transfer load and resist deformation the illustration of the force loaded on the jacket is shown in fig 19 according to the equation of the force balance 2 f f w a f c u f t f c v g v t v c m m f w a m f c u f h m t m c 2 2 r b v c v t here f v and m are the horizontal load vertical load and bending moment load on the top of the structure under the ultimate limit state g is the weight of the structure f w a and f c u are the wave load and current load respectively h is the height of the jacket f t v t and m t are the reaction of tension leg and f c v c and m c are the reaction of compressive leg the inclination angle of each leg in the oc4 reference jacket is φ arctan h r b r t and the horizontal and vertical components of the internal forces of each member are shown in formula 3 3 f v i σ x a sin φ τ y z a cos φ f h i σ x a cos φ τ y z a sin φ in the case of infinite stiffness at the bottom of the structure the reverse bending moment at the bottom of the jacket can be ignored also it is assumed that the force exerted by the four jacket legs is uniform under the action of the load in the absence of structural deformation and joint stress concentration according to the balanced equation under the action of the bending moment and the vertical load the axial force of tension and compression bar in leg can be calculated by equation 4 4 m f n t 2 2 r i sin φ f n c 2 2 r i sin φ v g f n t sin φ f n c sin φ where f n t is the axial force in the tension leg f n c is the axial force in the compressive leg r i is the radius of the circumferential circle at each height of the jacket the stress in the leg is as follows 5 σ n t f n t a σ n c f n c a fig 20 shows the abaqus abq sacs and the above theoretically calculated tc leg stress under a vertical load and bending moment load when the braces are ignored the jacket leg stress curve gradually increases from the bottom to the top and according to the numerical simulation results the layers between the joints of the leg stress are a constant value getting bigger from the structure bottom up the results for the layers located in the middle of the stress value and the theoretical calculation results are basically identical and therefore the theoretical calculation and sacs results agree relatively well with abaqus obviously the horizontal load is not evenly distributed between the leg and brace it is mainly carried by the leg at distances closer to the bottom this more significant as seen in fig 10 meanwhile there are differences in the distribution of the horizontal load among the legs on both sides of the tension and compression as seen in fig 21 the horizontal load on the legs on the compression side accounts for 0 6 0 7 times the total horizontal load on the legs which is evenly distributed with respect to height also it is only slightly affected by the topological forms of the bracing bars the transmission modes of the six topological forms are shown in fig 22 at the joint the load that is perpendicular to the direction of the leg is balanced by the brace and the leg at the joint is mainly subjected to a downward load along the leg transmitted by the brace on both sides in the plane parallel to the horizontal load one of the two steel pipes that forms the x type brace structure is a tension bar and the other of the steel pipes is a compressive bar in the plane parallel to the bending moment the x type brace is staggered by one layer of tension and one layer of compression in comparing the three z types it is found that the tension and compression of the inclined braces are related to the direction of the horizontal load also the force transfer modes of z1 and z2 are relatively regular whereas the stress concentration is more likely to occur at the z3 joint similarly at the joint that is in the same plane as the k type brace the diagonal brace enters an equilibrium state wherein one rod is under tension and one is under compression the load on both sides of the vertical leg is balanced by the diagonal brace and the transverse brace on both sides the leg is mainly subject to the load along its axis 4 effects of the layering mode of braces on the bearing capacity and transfer load 4 1 finite element model in this section the stratification mode of the jacket structure is considered to be a variable and the model is shown in fig 23 the jacket structure is stratified within a range of 60 m in height 4x 15 is a 4 layer structure that is arranged uniformly and 3x 20 is a 3 layer structure that is arranged uniformly 3x 25 is a three layer structure that has a spacing of 25 m at the bottom 20 m in the middle and 15 m at the top 3x 30 is a three layer structure that has a spacing of 30 m at the bottom 20 m in the middle and 10 m at the top all of the other parameters of the four jacket structures are the same 4 2 horizontal vertical and flexural capacity analysis the displacement control method was adopted to apply horizontal displacement vertical displacement and angle displacement to the jacket structure from the geometric center on the top of the jacket the moment when the jacket structure shows plastic deformation is considered to be its instability position load displacement curves of the jacket structures under various layering modes are shown in figs 24 26 according to fig 25 when the horizontal stiffness of a uniform 4 layer jacket is slightly greater than that of a 3 layer jacket there is little difference in the vertical bearing capacity for the bending moment the bending bearing capacity of the jacket that is divided into 4 layers is slightly less than that of that jacket that is divided into 3 layers uniformly for the 3 layer brace when the depth of the brace on the top floor is greater the flexural capacity is higher the above factors all have a small effect and are not the main factors that affect the bearing capacity therefore the cost of offshore wind power can be reduced by adjusting the layering mode of braces the structural displacements of the jackets with each layered mode are shown in figs 27 and 28 for the moments when the structures become unstable under the action of a horizontal load the displacement of each structure is basically the same and the displacement increases gradually with height under the action of the bending moment the displacement of the brace on the top two floors is larger and mainly on the first floor similarly when the depth of the top layer is greater the displacement is smaller 4 3 horizontal vertical and bending moment transfer analysis the distribution of the horizontal load with respect to the height of each section of the leg in the various layered modes is shown in fig 29 the horizontal load that is borne by the leg gradually increases from top to bottom and the added value of the load between the lower three layers is relatively uniform because of the large deformation at the top the horizontal load that is borne by the brace in the topological structure of the top layer is slightly larger for the topological forms of the braces the k2 type bears the smallest horizontal load followed by the x type the three z types bear basically the same horizontal load which is slightly larger than that borne by the x type the type that bears the largest horizontal load is the k1 type the coefficient of the horizontal component of the force for the top leg is within the range of 0 43 0 58 and that of the bottom leg is between 0 68 and 0 75 the influences of the different brace layouts on the vertical load transfer mode of the jacket structure are shown in fig 30 at the top floor of the structure the vertical load transfer of the leg of the jacket that has four layers is significantly different from that of the jacket that has three layers also the vertical load value of the leg of the 4 layer structure at the joint increases whereas the vertical load value of the 3 layer structure decreases at the joint when the distance between layers is smaller the change in the value is smaller however in the second layer the loads on the legs of the four structures tend to have the same value in the case of 3 layer brace at the bottom of the structure when the span between layers is smaller the vertical load on the bottom leg is greater with the depths of 20 m 25 m and 30 m the values of the vertical load on the bottom leg are 1 48 1 45 and 1 39 respectively the depth of the bottom of the span of the 4 layer structure is 15 m and the vertical load value of the bottom chord is 1 53 as seen in fig 31 the bending moment of the leg of the jacket of the 4 layer structure is larger than that of the jacket of the 3 layer structure at all heights also at distances closer to the bottom the difference is greater the bending moment of the leg of the jacket of the 4 layer structure is 3 1 times that of the load on the top and the bending moment of the jacket of the 3 layer structure is about 2 7 times that of the load on the top three kinds of 3 layer jacket structures with different depths show good linearity when the jacket has more layers the spacing is more uniform the discrete distribution of the horizontal load at the top of the structure in the tension and compression legs is smaller shown in fig 32 however the four structures at the bottom all tend to have values in the range of 0 63 0 65 similarly for the case of the 3 layer structure the values of the interlayer span difference are 0 m 5 m and 10 m and the values of the load ratio at the top are 0 69 0 73 and 0 81 respectively 5 effects of brace section properties of braces on bearing capacity and transfer load 5 1 finite element model in this section the section property of jacket brace is regarded as a variable shown in fig 33 and the bearing capacity and transmission mode of the structure are analyzed 5 2 horizontal vertical and flexural capacity analysis 5 2 1 effects of brace diameter on bearing capacity for the horizontal bearing capacity when the diameter of brace is lower than a certain value the structural stiffness and bearing capacity are directly related to the strength of brace when the diameter of the brace exceeds that certain value further increases in the diameter of the brace will only increase the stiffness of the structure but have hardly any effect on the limit of the horizontal bearing capacity shown in fig 34 at this time the failure of the leg is the cause of structural instability therefore increasing the diameter of the braces is effective for improving the bending resistance of the jacket structure 5 2 2 effects of brace thickness on bearing capacity similar to the situation discussed in the part 5 2 1 when the wall thickness is too thin the ultimate horizontal bearing capacity of the structure is reduced furthermore when it reaches a certain value only the stiffness of the structure is affected but the impact on the bearing capacity limit is very small when the wall thickness of the strut is greater the bending stiffness and bending bearing capacity of the structure are greater shown in fig 35 also the sensitivity of the bearing capacity with respect to the thickness of the wall is lower than that with respect to the brace diameter 5 2 3 effects of the ratio of section moment of inertia on bearing capacity changes in both the brace diameter and wall thickness can be regarded as changes in the section moment of inertia and can further be regarded as changes in the ratio of the section moment of inertia from the brace to the leg therefore the structural bearing capacity under various ratios is extracted as seen in fig 36 when the ratio of the section moment of inertia is greater than or equal to 0 07 the brace is no longer the main cause of horizontal failure in the control structure with an increase in the section moment of inertia of the brace the horizontal stiffness of the structure is indeed strengthened the effect is obvious when the ratio is low but the effect is very small when the ratio reaches 0 5 again the vertical bearing capacity remains basically unchanged for the jacket structure mentioned in this section the section moment of inertia changes from 0 007 to 1 and the flexural capacity of the structure increases from 1400 mn m to 1630 mn m for comparison the flexural capacity of the original structure is 1520 mn m 5 3 horizontal vertical and bending moment transfer analysis 5 3 1 effects of brace diameter on force transfer the effects of the brace diameter on the load distribution of the structure leg section with respect to height is shown in fig 37 when the diameter of the brace is larger the horizontal load that the brace bears on the top floor of the structure is greater the moment transfer is almost unaffected by the diameter of the strut and the bending moment of the strut increases slightly because of the increase in the diameter of the strut at the top for the vertical load in the leg when the diameter is smaller the addition value at the joint is smaller and this is mainly because of the influence of self weight especially at the top floor the distribution of the horizontal load in the tension and compression legs of the top floor is unaffected a change in the diameter for the structure of the following layers the horizontal load in the tension and compression legs increases with an increase in the diameter of the brace specifically the value at the top is 0 61 and the values at the bottom are 0 632 0 646 0 658 and 0 662 5 3 2 effects of brace thickness on force transfer obviously changes in the thickness of the brace wall affect the transfer of the load in the structure and this is similar to the changes discussed in the part 5 3 1 moment transfer is unaffected by wall thickness for the vertical load when the wall thickness is greater the mutation value at the joint is greater the horizontal load distribution in the tension and compression legs is similar to that above specifically the value at the top is 0 61 and the load values at the bottom are only 0 638 0 648 0 658 and 0 663 shown in fig 38 5 3 3 effects of the ratio of section moment of inertia on force transfer the effects of changes to the strut section property on the transmission force are uniformly expressed by the ratio of the moment of inertia of the brace and leg section as seen in fig 39 the proportion of horizontal load on the top layer of the leg is between 0 45 and 0 55 and that of the bottom layer is between 0 68 and 0 72 for the vertical load distribution in the chord the influence of the brace section on the top floor is between 0 8 and 1 0 when the brace section is close to the bottom the vertical load component in the legs increases gradually with values between 1 4 and 1 95 regardless of how the brace section changes the bending moment of the lower part of the leg barely changes and the bending moment of the top floor varies between 0 89 and 1 3 similarly with changes to the section properties of the brace the distribution of the horizontal load in the tension and compression legs of the top layer is not affected for the structure of the next layers the greater the when the moment of inertia of the brace section is greater the horizontal load in the compression leg is greater 6 conclusion this paper studies the bearing characteristics and force transfer modes of the 5 mw turbine jacket foundation which is located in an area of the dutch north sea that has a water depth of 46 m the bearing characteristics and force transfer modes were studied with different brace topological structures and cross section properties in this paper the load carrying properties of six kinds of jacket topologies are discussed and the load transfer modes and the stress characteristics of the six kinds of jackets are summarized under the limit load condition that occurs under the ultimate limit state to explore reasonable jacket topological structure the stratification modes of four types of jacket braces were analyzed and the influences of the depth of the jacket brace on its force transfer property are obtained also the effects of the brace on the structural load and force transfer were studied in detail by considering the cross section property of the braces as a variable the results are as follows 1 based on my research x brace jacket is better than others in the field of offshore wind turbines when z brace is selected the performance of the three z type topologies in bearing capacity and load transfer is similar if k brace is selected it is recommended to use k1 type which has a large flexural bearing capacity 2 for the x type jacket structure the cost savings can be achieved by reducing the number of layers and the impact on the bearing capacity is negligible within a certain range the bending strength of the jacket is mainly affected by two layers of the brace at the top 3 the horizontal load of the leg is obviously affected by the brace only on the top floor when the moment of inertia of the brace is higher the load shared is higher the top layer of the horizontal load in the tension and compression legs has nothing to do with the interfacial property of the brace in the middle and lower layers when the moment of inertia of the brace is greater the horizontal load in the compression leg is greater and the ratio is between 0 63 and 0 69 4 if the moment of inertia of the brace section is too small then there is an effect on the bearing capacity of the structure when the inertia ratio between the brace and the leg is greater than 0 07 the horizontal bearing capacity of the structure is mainly controlled by the strength of the leg increasing the section property of brace is beneficial for improving the flexural performance of the structure in a small range however it is not applicable in the case where the bearing capacity is far lower than the design value credit

22068,with the aim of the developing offshore wind turbines in the deep sea and with the demand for larger capacity turbines a brace structure was designed to provide guidance for an offshore wind turbine jacket foundation the influence of the brace structure on the bearing capacity and load transfer mode from the top to bottom of the jacket structure was studied using numerical simulation the results show that among various topological structures the x type topological mode has great advantages for the bearing capacity the number of layers can be decreased to reduce the cost of offshore wind power when the section moment of inertia of the brace is greater the load on the top of the leg is smaller and the proportion of the horizontal load on the bottom of the compressive leg is higher the properties of the brace only affect the bearing capacity of the structure in a small range keywords jacket bearing capacity load transfer brace topological section properties 1 introduction with an increase in worldwide attention to offshore wind power offshore wind turbines have made great progress in recent years wind and council 2019 to achieve efficient utilization of offshore wind energy there are two major challenges with respect to offshore wind turbines in the current era oh et al 2018 one challenge is the deep water development of offshore wind turbines currently most of the offshore wind farms that have been developed are concentrated in areas of the sea area where the water depth is 30 m or less and there are an abundance of deep water wind farms that have not been developed yet the second challenge is increasing the capacity of a single turbine under certain conditions when a turbine is bigger it occupies less units and uses less sea area and the infrastructure cost is easier to control the crown estate 2012 therefore developing offshore wind energy has several advantages the design and installation of the foundation of traditional offshore wind turbines include the monopile multi pile cap foundation gravity foundation and composite suction bucket foundation which are relatively mature techniques ding et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 2017 jia et al 2018 he et al 2017 wang et al 2019 however these approaches have certain limitations for sea areas where the depth is more than 30 m the materials and construction cost of offshore structures are relatively high and the stability of these foundations is insufficient for relative deep water areas 30 m 50 m thus their applicability for deep water areas is not strong however large scale use of the jacket structure in offshore oil and gas platforms has been fully verified for application in deep water tjelta 1994 in recent years offshore wind farms using the multi bucket jacket foundation as a support structure have been successively built around the world geotechnics 2017 proving the applicability of this type of foundation in intermediate water depth and for large capacity turbines shown in fig 1 the jacket structure is a spatial steel frame formed by welding legs and braces through joints which makes its stiffness greater however different from an offshore platform structure that covers a large area the jacket structure for offshore turbines is much simpler and is mainly based on longitudinal topology more importantly the load that an offshore turbines jacket structure bears is mainly due to the large bending moment and horizontal load transmitted by the top of the turbine at present countries that have abundant marine resources have carried out relevant research on the jacket foundation for offshore wind power in the early stage petrini geotechnics 2017 and hao and liu 2017 used numerical simulation and compared the stress distribution of monopile tripod and jacket foundations under a static load dynamic load and ship impact load they found that the jacket foundation as a basic substructure was more uniform than the other two forms of stress distribution and had the best overall performance for the dynamic characteristics of jacket structures with various topological forms shi et al 2011 2013a 2013b 2015 studied the natural frequency of the system and the shear force and bending moment differences of the components they found that the overall stiffness of the z type is smaller than that of the x type also the internal force of the structure under a dynamic load is smaller and this can reduce structural fatigue and enhance the life of offshore turbines in terms of optimizing the structural design gentils et al 2017 used finite element analysis and a genetic algorithm to optimize the overall quality of an owt offshore wind turbine supporting structure to improve the design efficiency of the supporting structure of offshore wind turbines meanwhile a size optimization method that considered fatigue and the limit state was verified by oest et al 2016 who used cplex in ibm ilog popko et al 2012 used coupling simulation and verified the modeling code of the owt jacket support structure and explained the importance of local dynamics in structural design when designing the jacket structure it should not only have enough safety performance but also be convenient for manufacturing and construction and reduce the cost as much as possible häfele et al 2018 the commonly used design specifications in engineering only specify the design size limits of joints and bars to meet certain design requirements but do not give more instructions on how to adjust american petroleum institute 2014 det norske veritas 2005 2014 2016 2019 the research regarding the jacket structure in offshore wind turbines field has mainly been focused on the static and dynamic response and overall quality optimization but research on the optimization of the specific topological structure and transmission mode is still lacking therefore this article adopts the numerical simulation method to study the form of the jacket structure brace topology layering and the brace section attribute for variables and discusses the various factors in terms of the influence of the horizontal vertical and flexural bearing capacity of the jacket structure within the scope of the standard this article also explains the load distribution in the jacket and analyzes the impact of various factors on the structure of the load transfer this research provides guidance for the design of offshore wind turbines 2 load condition and calculation model the jacket structure for an offshore turbine located at a depth of approximately 50 m in the north sea of the netherlands is the research object of this paper the turbine used with the jacket design is an nrel general 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 vorpahl et al 2011 for environmental conditions and tower parameters see upwind 2010 a diagram of the jacket model is shown in the fig 2 the main calculations in this paper were carried out using the finite element software abaqus which is widely used in structural engineering was used for the load calculations and results assessment all parts of the jacket structure are steel tubes and the properties and dimensions of the steel pipes are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively dnv 2014 simple elastic plastic constitutions in abaqus were used for analysis and the stress strain curve of steel was shown in fig 3 the research of this paper is focused on the brace topology and the relationship between the bearing capacity of the jacket and the load transfer between the brace and leg thus the influence of bottom transverse bracing and the interaction between the foundation structure and soil were ignored also the stiffness of the bottom of the structure was considered to be infinite thus the freedom in all 6 directions of the bottom of the structure was restricted in abaqus long et al 2011 long and moe 2012 meanwhile the b32 beam element was adopted in abaqus with a mesh size of 0 2 m 3 effects of topological forms of braces on bearing capacity and transfer load 3 1 finite element model x type z type and k type are commonly used topological structures for jackets in offshore wind turbines the z type can be divided into z1 type z2 type and z3 type on the basis of its spatial arrangement and the k type topological structure can be divided into k1 type and k2 type on the basis of the opening direction in this section jackets with these six jacket topological forms shown in fig 4 of brace are established the bearing performance analysis and force transfer analysis of the six jacket structures in the service state were carried out except for the brace layout all of the other parameters of the six kinds of jacket are the same including the height of each layer material properties and section properties of the leg and brace 3 2 horizontal vertical and flexural capacity analysis the displacement control method was adopted to apply horizontal displacement vertical displacement and an angular angle to the jacket structure from the geometric center on the top of the jacket structure the moment when the jacket structure shows plastic deformation is taken as the instability position load displacement curves of the jacket structures under various topological conditions are shown in figs 5 7 the topology of the brace has a significant effect on the horizontal and flexural bearing capacity of the jacket for structures under a horizontal load the x type z type and k2 type reach their ultimate bearing capacity when the top displacement is about 0 3 m in contrast the k1 form has greater flexibility and the ultimate bearing capacity is at a displacement of 0 4 m the horizontal bearing capacity of the x type jacket structure was the largest followed by that of the k type structure and that of the z type structure was the lowest the horizontal bearing capacity of the z type structure was only 0 7 times that of the x type in the three types of z type structures the values of the horizontal bearing capacity are basically the same and the z3 type reaches its ultimate strength earlier than z1 and z2 with greater relative stiffness for the vertical bearing capacity the bearing capacity is almost identical for each structure and the stiffness is almost identical for each structure in terms of the bending resistance of the jacket structures the k1 type and x type are the best the k2 type and the three z type structures have lower flexural capacity among these the k2 type has the lowest flexural stiffness and the flexural stiffness and capacity of the three z type structures are relatively consistent table 3 lists the mass of each topological jacket structure it can be seen that z type has the lowest steel consumption x type is slightly larger than z and k type is the largest the structural displacements of the jacket during instability are shown in figs 8 9 under a horizontal load the displacement of the structure increases gradually from the bottom to the top the displacement of the structure under the action of the bending moment is different from that under the action of the horizontal load the displacement does not change uniformly with the height it is mainly focused on the top especially the two layer brace on the top for the large deformation component the x type diagonal brace rotates in the direction of the bending moment with the bottom joint as the center and this bar is mainly affected by the bending moment and axial force the rotation center of the z type diagonal brace on the top floor is located at the bottom joint the rotation center of the next layer is located at the lower middle of the bar and the rotation center of the z type transverse brace is located in the middle of the bar bearing a large shear force when the bottom joint is the center of rotation k1 displacement increases evenly along the height because of the influence of the transverse support joint at the top the k2 diagonal support deforms greatly at the joint the displacement of the k1 type transverse brace increases from both ends to the middle and thus this transverse brace plays an important role in bending resistance the displacement direction of the k2 type transverse brace on both sides of the midpoint is different and thus it plays a role in shear resistance the four leg jacket structure is symmetrical about both axes so the influence of loading direction on the bearing capacity of the structure can be searched within 0 45 as shown in fig 10 the horizontal bearing capacity of the x type jacket structure searched every 15 in the range of 45 is shown in fig 11 the horizontal bearing capacity of the structure decreases gradually as the direction of the load shifts from the symmetry axis to the diagonal of square in the elastic stage the direction of load has no effect on the horizontal stiffness of the structure therefore the lower limit of horizontal bearing capacity of the structure is 45 and the bearing capacity is 75 of 0 the flexural capacity of x type jacket structure under different direction bending moment is shown in fig 12 as the load deviates from the axis of symmetry the flexural capacity decreases before reaching the bearing capacity of the structure the flexural stiffness of the structure is the same in all directions in terms of resistance to bending moment the performance was also the weakest in the 45 direction only about 75 of the 0 direction 3 3 horizontal vertical and bending moment transfer analysis the purpose of this section is to clarify the way that the upper load passes down gradually through the jacket extracting the bending moment horizontal internal force and vertical internal force of each section of the legs of various jacket structures under the ultimate limit state the internal force extraction method of the section is shown in fig 13 the load of a leg section is considered to be dimensionless 1 h h h v v v m m m where h v and m are the horizontal load vertical load and bending moment load of the extracted chord section respectively h v and m are the external loads on the top of the structure under the ultimate limit state h v and m are the ratio of the load assigned to the legs to the external load the horizontal load distribution of each section of the legs with respect to height is shown as fig 14 the horizontal load that is borne by the legs gradually increases from top to bottom and the load variation between the lower three layers is relatively uniform because of the large deformation at the top the horizontal load that is borne by the brace in the topological structure of the top layer is slightly larger for the different topological forms of braces the k2 chord bar bears the smallest horizontal load followed by the x type the three z types bear basically the same load which is slightly larger than x type the k1 type bears the largest horizontal load and the horizontal component force coefficient of the top legs is within the range of 0 43 0 58 and that of the bottom is between 0 68 and 0 75 as seen in fig 15 the vertical load borne by the legs increases gradually from the top to the bottom and the diagonal section is the dead weight of the leg the abrupt change is the value transmitted from the brace to the leg through the joint and this consists of the dead weight of the brace and the external load the jacket structure of an offshore wind turbine is mainly characterized by the huge bending moment load generated by the upper horizontal load in the six topological forms the section bending moment that is borne by the legs gradually increases from the top to bottom and the bottom is about 3 2 times the bending moment load that is borne by the top shown in fig 16 between the leg joints of each layer the bending moment in the leg is basically consistent with the height and it is related to the size and inclination of the structure at the joint the leg is subjected to the bending moment load that is transmitted by the brace and the bending moment diagram of the section suddenly changes the bending moment of the foundation structure is mainly composed of two parts 1 the bending moment from the bottom of the tower and 2 the part that is caused by the horizontal load therefore under the top concentrated load simulation method that was adopted in this paper the bending moment between the legs increases linearly however if the nonlinear wave load on the foundation of the in situ state is considered then the distribution of the bending moment between the chords is more complicated however the overall trend will not change much for the six topological forms of braces under the same loading condition the k2 type leg bears the lowest bending moment load followed by the z type and x type and k1 type leg bears the largest bending moment load combined with the displacement diagram and the flexural capacity curve the k2 type brace is the one that is most affected by the bending moment whereas its flexural capacity is relatively the lowest it can be inferred that the flexural performance of the structure is related to the strength of the top brace and that the size of the top brace can be appropriately engineered to increase the horizontal load and bending moment transfer of the legs under load in different directions are shown in fig 17 the direction of the load does not affect the transfer of the legs fig 18 shows the stress distribution of jacket structure under extreme load obviously in the jacket structure of the six arrangement forms the stress of the leg is higher and the stress of the brace is an order of magnitude lower than that of the chord this is determined by the tension compressive system of the jacket structure while the main function of the brace is to transfer load and resist deformation the illustration of the force loaded on the jacket is shown in fig 19 according to the equation of the force balance 2 f f w a f c u f t f c v g v t v c m m f w a m f c u f h m t m c 2 2 r b v c v t here f v and m are the horizontal load vertical load and bending moment load on the top of the structure under the ultimate limit state g is the weight of the structure f w a and f c u are the wave load and current load respectively h is the height of the jacket f t v t and m t are the reaction of tension leg and f c v c and m c are the reaction of compressive leg the inclination angle of each leg in the oc4 reference jacket is φ arctan h r b r t and the horizontal and vertical components of the internal forces of each member are shown in formula 3 3 f v i σ x a sin φ τ y z a cos φ f h i σ x a cos φ τ y z a sin φ in the case of infinite stiffness at the bottom of the structure the reverse bending moment at the bottom of the jacket can be ignored also it is assumed that the force exerted by the four jacket legs is uniform under the action of the load in the absence of structural deformation and joint stress concentration according to the balanced equation under the action of the bending moment and the vertical load the axial force of tension and compression bar in leg can be calculated by equation 4 4 m f n t 2 2 r i sin φ f n c 2 2 r i sin φ v g f n t sin φ f n c sin φ where f n t is the axial force in the tension leg f n c is the axial force in the compressive leg r i is the radius of the circumferential circle at each height of the jacket the stress in the leg is as follows 5 σ n t f n t a σ n c f n c a fig 20 shows the abaqus abq sacs and the above theoretically calculated tc leg stress under a vertical load and bending moment load when the braces are ignored the jacket leg stress curve gradually increases from the bottom to the top and according to the numerical simulation results the layers between the joints of the leg stress are a constant value getting bigger from the structure bottom up the results for the layers located in the middle of the stress value and the theoretical calculation results are basically identical and therefore the theoretical calculation and sacs results agree relatively well with abaqus obviously the horizontal load is not evenly distributed between the leg and brace it is mainly carried by the leg at distances closer to the bottom this more significant as seen in fig 10 meanwhile there are differences in the distribution of the horizontal load among the legs on both sides of the tension and compression as seen in fig 21 the horizontal load on the legs on the compression side accounts for 0 6 0 7 times the total horizontal load on the legs which is evenly distributed with respect to height also it is only slightly affected by the topological forms of the bracing bars the transmission modes of the six topological forms are shown in fig 22 at the joint the load that is perpendicular to the direction of the leg is balanced by the brace and the leg at the joint is mainly subjected to a downward load along the leg transmitted by the brace on both sides in the plane parallel to the horizontal load one of the two steel pipes that forms the x type brace structure is a tension bar and the other of the steel pipes is a compressive bar in the plane parallel to the bending moment the x type brace is staggered by one layer of tension and one layer of compression in comparing the three z types it is found that the tension and compression of the inclined braces are related to the direction of the horizontal load also the force transfer modes of z1 and z2 are relatively regular whereas the stress concentration is more likely to occur at the z3 joint similarly at the joint that is in the same plane as the k type brace the diagonal brace enters an equilibrium state wherein one rod is under tension and one is under compression the load on both sides of the vertical leg is balanced by the diagonal brace and the transverse brace on both sides the leg is mainly subject to the load along its axis 4 effects of the layering mode of braces on the bearing capacity and transfer load 4 1 finite element model in this section the stratification mode of the jacket structure is considered to be a variable and the model is shown in fig 23 the jacket structure is stratified within a range of 60 m in height 4x 15 is a 4 layer structure that is arranged uniformly and 3x 20 is a 3 layer structure that is arranged uniformly 3x 25 is a three layer structure that has a spacing of 25 m at the bottom 20 m in the middle and 15 m at the top 3x 30 is a three layer structure that has a spacing of 30 m at the bottom 20 m in the middle and 10 m at the top all of the other parameters of the four jacket structures are the same 4 2 horizontal vertical and flexural capacity analysis the displacement control method was adopted to apply horizontal displacement vertical displacement and angle displacement to the jacket structure from the geometric center on the top of the jacket the moment when the jacket structure shows plastic deformation is considered to be its instability position load displacement curves of the jacket structures under various layering modes are shown in figs 24 26 according to fig 25 when the horizontal stiffness of a uniform 4 layer jacket is slightly greater than that of a 3 layer jacket there is little difference in the vertical bearing capacity for the bending moment the bending bearing capacity of the jacket that is divided into 4 layers is slightly less than that of that jacket that is divided into 3 layers uniformly for the 3 layer brace when the depth of the brace on the top floor is greater the flexural capacity is higher the above factors all have a small effect and are not the main factors that affect the bearing capacity therefore the cost of offshore wind power can be reduced by adjusting the layering mode of braces the structural displacements of the jackets with each layered mode are shown in figs 27 and 28 for the moments when the structures become unstable under the action of a horizontal load the displacement of each structure is basically the same and the displacement increases gradually with height under the action of the bending moment the displacement of the brace on the top two floors is larger and mainly on the first floor similarly when the depth of the top layer is greater the displacement is smaller 4 3 horizontal vertical and bending moment transfer analysis the distribution of the horizontal load with respect to the height of each section of the leg in the various layered modes is shown in fig 29 the horizontal load that is borne by the leg gradually increases from top to bottom and the added value of the load between the lower three layers is relatively uniform because of the large deformation at the top the horizontal load that is borne by the brace in the topological structure of the top layer is slightly larger for the topological forms of the braces the k2 type bears the smallest horizontal load followed by the x type the three z types bear basically the same horizontal load which is slightly larger than that borne by the x type the type that bears the largest horizontal load is the k1 type the coefficient of the horizontal component of the force for the top leg is within the range of 0 43 0 58 and that of the bottom leg is between 0 68 and 0 75 the influences of the different brace layouts on the vertical load transfer mode of the jacket structure are shown in fig 30 at the top floor of the structure the vertical load transfer of the leg of the jacket that has four layers is significantly different from that of the jacket that has three layers also the vertical load value of the leg of the 4 layer structure at the joint increases whereas the vertical load value of the 3 layer structure decreases at the joint when the distance between layers is smaller the change in the value is smaller however in the second layer the loads on the legs of the four structures tend to have the same value in the case of 3 layer brace at the bottom of the structure when the span between layers is smaller the vertical load on the bottom leg is greater with the depths of 20 m 25 m and 30 m the values of the vertical load on the bottom leg are 1 48 1 45 and 1 39 respectively the depth of the bottom of the span of the 4 layer structure is 15 m and the vertical load value of the bottom chord is 1 53 as seen in fig 31 the bending moment of the leg of the jacket of the 4 layer structure is larger than that of the jacket of the 3 layer structure at all heights also at distances closer to the bottom the difference is greater the bending moment of the leg of the jacket of the 4 layer structure is 3 1 times that of the load on the top and the bending moment of the jacket of the 3 layer structure is about 2 7 times that of the load on the top three kinds of 3 layer jacket structures with different depths show good linearity when the jacket has more layers the spacing is more uniform the discrete distribution of the horizontal load at the top of the structure in the tension and compression legs is smaller shown in fig 32 however the four structures at the bottom all tend to have values in the range of 0 63 0 65 similarly for the case of the 3 layer structure the values of the interlayer span difference are 0 m 5 m and 10 m and the values of the load ratio at the top are 0 69 0 73 and 0 81 respectively 5 effects of brace section properties of braces on bearing capacity and transfer load 5 1 finite element model in this section the section property of jacket brace is regarded as a variable shown in fig 33 and the bearing capacity and transmission mode of the structure are analyzed 5 2 horizontal vertical and flexural capacity analysis 5 2 1 effects of brace diameter on bearing capacity for the horizontal bearing capacity when the diameter of brace is lower than a certain value the structural stiffness and bearing capacity are directly related to the strength of brace when the diameter of the brace exceeds that certain value further increases in the diameter of the brace will only increase the stiffness of the structure but have hardly any effect on the limit of the horizontal bearing capacity shown in fig 34 at this time the failure of the leg is the cause of structural instability therefore increasing the diameter of the braces is effective for improving the bending resistance of the jacket structure 5 2 2 effects of brace thickness on bearing capacity similar to the situation discussed in the part 5 2 1 when the wall thickness is too thin the ultimate horizontal bearing capacity of the structure is reduced furthermore when it reaches a certain value only the stiffness of the structure is affected but the impact on the bearing capacity limit is very small when the wall thickness of the strut is greater the bending stiffness and bending bearing capacity of the structure are greater shown in fig 35 also the sensitivity of the bearing capacity with respect to the thickness of the wall is lower than that with respect to the brace diameter 5 2 3 effects of the ratio of section moment of inertia on bearing capacity changes in both the brace diameter and wall thickness can be regarded as changes in the section moment of inertia and can further be regarded as changes in the ratio of the section moment of inertia from the brace to the leg therefore the structural bearing capacity under various ratios is extracted as seen in fig 36 when the ratio of the section moment of inertia is greater than or equal to 0 07 the brace is no longer the main cause of horizontal failure in the control structure with an increase in the section moment of inertia of the brace the horizontal stiffness of the structure is indeed strengthened the effect is obvious when the ratio is low but the effect is very small when the ratio reaches 0 5 again the vertical bearing capacity remains basically unchanged for the jacket structure mentioned in this section the section moment of inertia changes from 0 007 to 1 and the flexural capacity of the structure increases from 1400 mn m to 1630 mn m for comparison the flexural capacity of the original structure is 1520 mn m 5 3 horizontal vertical and bending moment transfer analysis 5 3 1 effects of brace diameter on force transfer the effects of the brace diameter on the load distribution of the structure leg section with respect to height is shown in fig 37 when the diameter of the brace is larger the horizontal load that the brace bears on the top floor of the structure is greater the moment transfer is almost unaffected by the diameter of the strut and the bending moment of the strut increases slightly because of the increase in the diameter of the strut at the top for the vertical load in the leg when the diameter is smaller the addition value at the joint is smaller and this is mainly because of the influence of self weight especially at the top floor the distribution of the horizontal load in the tension and compression legs of the top floor is unaffected a change in the diameter for the structure of the following layers the horizontal load in the tension and compression legs increases with an increase in the diameter of the brace specifically the value at the top is 0 61 and the values at the bottom are 0 632 0 646 0 658 and 0 662 5 3 2 effects of brace thickness on force transfer obviously changes in the thickness of the brace wall affect the transfer of the load in the structure and this is similar to the changes discussed in the part 5 3 1 moment transfer is unaffected by wall thickness for the vertical load when the wall thickness is greater the mutation value at the joint is greater the horizontal load distribution in the tension and compression legs is similar to that above specifically the value at the top is 0 61 and the load values at the bottom are only 0 638 0 648 0 658 and 0 663 shown in fig 38 5 3 3 effects of the ratio of section moment of inertia on force transfer the effects of changes to the strut section property on the transmission force are uniformly expressed by the ratio of the moment of inertia of the brace and leg section as seen in fig 39 the proportion of horizontal load on the top layer of the leg is between 0 45 and 0 55 and that of the bottom layer is between 0 68 and 0 72 for the vertical load distribution in the chord the influence of the brace section on the top floor is between 0 8 and 1 0 when the brace section is close to the bottom the vertical load component in the legs increases gradually with values between 1 4 and 1 95 regardless of how the brace section changes the bending moment of the lower part of the leg barely changes and the bending moment of the top floor varies between 0 89 and 1 3 similarly with changes to the section properties of the brace the distribution of the horizontal load in the tension and compression legs of the top layer is not affected for the structure of the next layers the greater the when the moment of inertia of the brace section is greater the horizontal load in the compression leg is greater 6 conclusion this paper studies the bearing characteristics and force transfer modes of the 5 mw turbine jacket foundation which is located in an area of the dutch north sea that has a water depth of 46 m the bearing characteristics and force transfer modes were studied with different brace topological structures and cross section properties in this paper the load carrying properties of six kinds of jacket topologies are discussed and the load transfer modes and the stress characteristics of the six kinds of jackets are summarized under the limit load condition that occurs under the ultimate limit state to explore reasonable jacket topological structure the stratification modes of four types of jacket braces were analyzed and the influences of the depth of the jacket brace on its force transfer property are obtained also the effects of the brace on the structural load and force transfer were studied in detail by considering the cross section property of the braces as a variable the results are as follows 1 based on my research x brace jacket is better than others in the field of offshore wind turbines when z brace is selected the performance of the three z type topologies in bearing capacity and load transfer is similar if k brace is selected it is recommended to use k1 type which has a large flexural bearing capacity 2 for the x type jacket structure the cost savings can be achieved by reducing the number of layers and the impact on the bearing capacity is negligible within a certain range the bending strength of the jacket is mainly affected by two layers of the brace at the top 3 the horizontal load of the leg is obviously affected by the brace only on the top floor when the moment of inertia of the brace is higher the load shared is higher the top layer of the horizontal load in the tension and compression legs has nothing to do with the interfacial property of the brace in the middle and lower layers when the moment of inertia of the brace is greater the horizontal load in the compression leg is greater and the ratio is between 0 63 and 0 69 4 if the moment of inertia of the brace section is too small then there is an effect on the bearing capacity of the structure when the inertia ratio between the brace and the leg is greater than 0 07 the horizontal bearing capacity of the structure is mainly controlled by the strength of the leg increasing the section property of brace is beneficial for improving the flexural performance of the structure in a small range however it is not applicable in the case where the bearing capacity is far lower than the design value credit

22069,pile group effect is crucial for correct estimation of the hydrodynamic force on a pile within a pile group foundation of sea crossing bridge during earthquakes unlike the case of single isolated pile a numerical calculation model considering fluid structure interaction under the combined loads of earthquakes waves and currents is established based on the second development on ansys software a detailed analysis of pile group effect in the earthquake induced oscillatory flow field is carried out by the presented method that is validated in advance pile group effect in the earthquake current combined flow field as well as in the earthquake wave combined flow field are further discussed pile group effect has almost disappeared when relative spacing s d 4 5 and all piles behave like a single isolated pile in terms of earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces yet in the coexistence field the range of s d influencing pile group effect has been expanded due to the presence of current and wave for a sea crossing bridge foundation pile group effect coefficient k is equal to 0 69 implying noticeable interference effects and results show the hydrodynamic force on corner pile is greater than that on centre pile strengthening section reinforcement pertinently so as to improve overall seismic performance keywords pile group effect fluid structure interaction numerical method earthquake wave current 1 introduction in order to utmostly shorten the traffic distance between major cities in coastal regions in recent years many countries have built many sea crossing bridges at coastal and offshore locations and are planning to build more sea crossing bridges most of these bridges are located in zones characterized by high seismic hazard levels which are not only subjected to common wave current loads but also are affected by earthquakes earthquake excitation can cause additional hydrodynamic pressure on the submerged part of bridge besides structural inertia force li 2013 yang 2017 therefore the working conditions of the sea crossing bridges are more complex than that of the conventional bridges unlike the case of wave forces morion et al 1950 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 guo et al 2015 huang et al 2018 and wave current forces li 1991 malenica et al 1995 cokgor 2002 song 2006 nie et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 as the most frequently used loads on ocean engineering structures less attention has been paid to earthquake induced hydrodynamic force that affects potentially structural safety the original morison equation morion et al 1950 was used only to calculate the wave force on pile standing in water later morison equation was developed to calculate the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure by penzien and kaul 1972 yang and li 2013 expanded morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure during earthquakes caused by inner water and outer water simultaneously for circular and rectangular hollow piers li et al 2019 investigated the coefficients in morison equation for earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure of cylinders huang and li 2011 proposed hydrodynamic pressure formula based on the radiation wave theory for newtonian incompressible fluid flow and analyzed the influence of hydrodynamic pressure on the seismic response of bridge piers the results indicated that the dynamic characteristics of pier changed and the seismic response is augmented because of the hydrodynamic pressure effect the aforementioned hydrodynamic pressure calculations during earthquakes usually assume that the fluid is originally in quiescence without consideration of wave or current motion actually earthquake wave and current may be simultaneously applied to bridges in the marine environment so far the understanding of the coupling mechanism of multi disaster loads is not clear enough li and huang 2012 established a method of dynamic response analysis for bridges in deep water under combined actions of earthquake and wave using the linear radiation wave theory and diffraction wave theory the results indicated dynamic responses of bridge in deep water under separate earthquake and wave actions are nonlinear and cannot be combined by superposition yuan and liu 2013 studied the load effect of bridge pier under combined wave and earthquake actions by the extended morison equation it is noticed that both linear radiation wave theory and diffraction wave theory are suitable for dealing with inviscid incompressible flows for the large scale pier or platform members this assumption is reasonable because of the insignificant viscous effect however for the small scale piles namely slender piles the viscous effect is important and cannot be ignored thereupon the prerequisites of these two theories are no longer valid although the semi empirical morison equation has high accuracy for the small scale component calculation it is not suitable for the closely spaced pile group used widely in sea crossing bridges due to no consideration of interference effects that affect the flow field around the oscillating piles currently it is still difficult to conduct large scale underwater shaking table test especially for the coexistence field e g earthquake current combined flow field earthquake wave combined flow field earthquake wave current combined flow field and so on therefore the seismic analysis method for pile group foundations of sea crossing bridges is poor which is a problem that needs to be solved urgently current literatures about pile group effect mainly focus on currents and waves lack of concern about the earthquake induced flow field obviously earthquake and wave are two different conditions li et al 2019 furthermore pile group effect in the coexistence field such as the earthquake current field the earthquake wave field as well as the earthquake wave current field is seldom discussed in the present paper a systematical study on pile group effect in the earthquake induced flow field the earthquake current field and earthquake wave field is carried out by the numerical method based on the second development on ansys procedure in addition a reasonable approximate formula for pile group effect is proposed 2 numerical method of pile water coupling vibration analysis 2 1 method of fluid structure interaction fsi analysis when a bridge is in the ocean and suffers from wave currents and earthquakes and the hydrodynamic force acted as an external force on bridge the governing equation of transient structural dynamics can be refined as 1 m x t c x t k x t m x g t f h t where m c and k represent the structural mass matrix damping matrix and stiffness matrix respectively x t ẋ t and ẍ t represent the structural relative displacement velocity and acceleration vectors respectively ẍ g t is the acceleration vectors of seismic ground motion f h t is the fluid force vectors exerted on the bridge structure including wave current force and earthquake induced hydrodynamic force the structural governing equation can be discretized using the finite element method fem meanwhile the general governing equations of fluid dynamics e g navier stokes equations are discretized using the finite volume method fvm in the numerical model the navier stokes equations are complemented with the volume of fluid vof method to model the gas liquid interface which can be written in the vector as 2 ρ d u d t ρ f p μ 3 div u μ 2 u in which u is the fluid velocity f is the body acceleration ρ is the fluid density p is the fluid pressure and μ is the dynamic viscosity represents hamilton operator namely differential operator and div denotes divergence operator characterized by fluid volume expansion rate in unit time obviously this term of div u is equal to zero for the incompressible fluid according to pressure and velocity boundary conditions the mutual real time feedback of the calculation results between fluid field and structure is implemented by the interface this coupling process can be described in detail as the structure in water will generate deformations because of fluid pressure meanwhile the fluid field will be affected by the motional structure with rigid body displacement and deformation and the distribution and magnitude of fluid pressure will be changed accordingly the final results are obtained by multiple iterations with an advanced numerical method which is conducted by ansys combined with cfx in ansys workbench platform where the simulation is performed between transient structural ansys and fluid flow cfx and both modules are not only developed independently but also connected through the system coupling module to make a two way fluid structure coupling computational framework the flow of the cfx ansys two way fsi analysis is introduced in fig 1 2 2 wave and current generation the vof method is used to track the free surface profile by introducing a fluid volume fraction a q a q denotes the ratio of the volume occupied by the q phase fluid to the total volume whose value is between 0 and 1 including 0 and 1 when a q 1 the q phase substance is full when a q 0 the q phase substance is empty and when 0 a q 1 it means that the multiphase flow interface for the two phase flow patterns of air and water in this paper there are the following relationships 3 a q t u a q x v a q y w a q z 0 q 1 2 4 q 1 2 a q 1 in which u v and w are the fluid velocity components in x y and z directions respectively the sketch of a cfx numerical flume model is depicted in fig 2 where the length of flume is usually greater than 3 times wavelength and the width is not less than 5 times pile diameter to reduce boundary interference wave generation adopts the boundary generating wave method by defining analytical expressions of the velocity and the wave surface which vary with time at the inlet boundary this method has strong operability and wide application range and is particularly convenient for simultaneous generation of wave and current for the case it only needs to superimpose current velocity components on the basis of wave velocity components at the inlet boundary fluids are forced to make periodic alternating movements in a specified form at the inlet and outlet boundary defined by opening velocity which can eliminate wave reflections from the outlet boundary and the relative static pressure is set as zero at the top boundary defined by opening pressure both side surfaces of the flume are defined as symmetric boundary conditions while the bottom of the flume is defined as no slip wall the pile water coupling surface is used to transfer the real time data between bridge pile and flow field the initial conditions of the transient calculation can be set up by compiling cel codes according to the preset wave velocity wave surface profile and corresponding hydrostatic pressure so as to save the iterative calculation time for forming a stable wave field in the calculation model for a water air two phase flow of compressible viscous fluids the water density is ρ f 1000 kg m3 the dynamic viscosity of water is μ f 0 8899 10 3 pa s the air density is ρ a 1 185 kg m3 the dynamic viscosity of air is μ a 1 831 10 5 pa s the reference pressure is 1atm 101325pa i e a standard atmospheric pressure and the surface tension coefficient is 0 0725n m taking a three dimensional regular linear wave as an example wave height h 3 m wave period t 6s water depth d 25 m the wave profile generated by the numerical method can be seen clearly as shown in fig 3 2 3 earthquake simulation at the bottom of flume a non slip horizontal wall boundary characterized by sand grain roughness with length dimension h s 8 mm is used to approximate a seabed where seabed movement caused by earthquake is regarded as rigid motion ignoring seabed water interaction and consequently the focus is rather put on bridge structure water interaction aimed at promoting analysis efficiency of the problems involved the bottom of pile fixed with seabed moves synchronously with the seabed and earthquake excitation is conducted by the user defined function in ansys cfx module if a seismic excitation input to the seabed tied up with the bottom of pile is the displacement time history of seismic wave the structural absolute displacement including rigid and elastic displacement will be obtained then the hydrodynamic force exerted on the structure consists of two parts namely the one generated by rigid motion and the other one generated by elastic vibration if a seismic acceleration time history is applied to the entire structure and the bottom of pile remains stationary the hydrodynamic force caused only by the structural elastic vibration can be obtained in the numerical model the fluid domain is discretized using the fvm on structured non uniform hexahedral grids meanwhile the finite element discretization for bridge structure is performed using 20 node hexahedron element solid 186 within cfx the standard two equation k epsilon model is chosen as turbulence calculation model the scalable wall function is used to model near wall region the solver s discrete format is set to high resolution and the second order backward euler scheme is used for time integration fig 4 shows the time history of hydrodynamic forces on a circular vertical pile length l 30 m diameter d 1 8 m and water depth d 25 m excited by the north south component of the 1940 el centro earthquake the peak value of total hydrodynamic force generated by both rigid motion and elastic vibration is 140 14 kn corresponding to a maximum absolute displacement of 14 0 cm and the peak value of hydrodynamic force generated by elastic vibration is 125 62 kn corresponding to a maximum elastic displacement of 12 5 cm it can be seen that the elastic vibration induced hydrodynamic force accounts for a large proportion in total hydrodynamic force noting that the aforementioned two peaks do not occur at the same time in other words the maximum value of the elastic vibration induced hydrodynamic force and the maximum value of the rigid motion induced hydrodynamic force do not occur at the same moment therefore the maximum value of total hydrodynamic force can t be simply added by the two ones 3 numerical model validation an earthquake motion can be decomposed into a series of harmonic motions with different amplitudes frequencies and phases and the superposition law can be used to add up hydrodynamic force of each harmonic motion to form the total hydrodynamic force under the earthquake yang et al 2017 harmonic motion was chosen as excitations exerted on a cylinder the physical experimental data of a single cylinder vibrating in still water by yang et al 2018 are used to confirm the correctness of modeling method and the related parameters the numerical model has the same dimensions and suffers the same external excitation as the physical experimental model the comparison of the time histories of hydrodynamic forces between the physical experimental model and the numerical model is shown in fig 5 it can be observed that the amplitudes of the hydrodynamic forces change from 0 to a constant value as the amplitudes of the harmonic waves change from 0 to 0 025 m gradually during the first several cycles and the two curves coincide well indicating the solution of the present numerical model is trustable table 1 lists results of the water flow forces given by the present numerical method and the experimental test by deng and zhang 2007 for currents past pile groups of two piles in tandem arrangement the comparison between experimental and simulated results shows numerical simulation has good agreement to physical experiment where the relative error is less than 9 morison formula penzien and kaul 1972 characterized by simple expression and clear physical meaning has preferable accuracy and reliability for small scale components such as piles and is chosen as the validation tool fig 6 shows the response time history of a pile with circular cross section l 30 m and d 1 8 m subjected to the combined loads of wave current and earthquake at different relative water depth d l for case h 3 m t 6s current velocity u c 2 m s obtained by the present method two way fsi analysis and the morison method wave and current are in the positive x direction the north south east west and vertical components of el centro wave selected for seismic excitation are in the direction of x z and y respectively and the coordinate directions are shown in fig 2 the drag coefficient c d and inertial coefficient c m affected by current in morison equation are taken as 1 21 and 1 38 respectively specified in the code of hydrology for harbour and waterway published by china communications press 2015 here the maximum structural displacement absolute displacement occurs at the top of pile and the maximum equivalent stress von mises occurs at the bottom of pile it can be observed from fig 6 that the response curves obtained by the two methods agree well with each other especially when d l is relatively small table 2 lists the peak values of responses and their relative errors represented by r 0 where r 0 is defined as 5 r 0 response peak value by the present method response peak value by morison method response peak value by morison method 100 given that r 0 values are small and acceptable it can be concluded that the numerical simulation method in this paper is of high accuracy and reliability as an alternative for deep water pile seismic analysis it can be seen that the value of r 0 changes with d l from negative to positive noting that morison equation s hydrodynamic coefficients i e c d and c m are taken as constants without changing with water depth which imply that the calculation results given by the morison method are conservative when d l is small and unsafe when d l is large 4 analysis of hydrodynamic forces on pile groups during earthquakes the circular cross section piles with rectangular arrangement as depicted in fig 7 are widely used as the foundation of sea crossing bridge therefore the following analysis mainly focuses on this form for a given pipe group arrangement pile group effect is quantitatively reflected by two indexes of k and k i which are defined respectively as let 6a f t f group t f single t m n t 0 t max 6b f i t f i t f single t t 0 t max if at some point t0 t 0 0 t max f t o and f i t o always meet the requirements of the following formula respectively 7a f t 0 1 f t 1 7b f i t 0 1 f i t 1 then k f t o and k i f i t o in eqs 6a and 6b f group t f single t and f i t are the hydrodynamic force on a pile group a single isolated pile and any a pile within a pile group during earthquake respectively subscript i 1 to total number of piles in a group m and n denote column and row number of piles in a group respectively t represents time and t max is the end time of the earthquake in fact the vibration paces of all piles among a pile group during earthquakes are almost consistent and consequently the peak values of earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces occur at the same time due to no significant seismic wave passage effect as the result of short distance between piles and the assumption of seabed as a rigid body motion which are also confirmed by the simulated results like that in other words the time of attaining maximum response for each pile is consistent and there is no obvious phase difference hence k and k i can be simplified and rewritten in the other form 8a k f group t max f single t max m n 8b k i f i t max f single t max where f group t max f single t max and f i t max represent the peak values of earthquake induced hydrodynamic force on a pile group a single isolated pile and any a pile within a pile group respectively meanings of other symbols are same as aforementioned as we all known the north south and vertical components of el centro wave have significant difference in frequency spectrum as shown in fig 8 and the former strength is stronger than that of the latter so these two waves and the amplitude modulated north south wave whose amplitude is equal to the vertical component are designed as three comparative testing seismic waves numbered as e 1 e 2 and e 3 respectively to investigate the influence of earthquakes with different strength and frequencies on pile group effect in the flow field 4 1 interference characteristics of two piles in side by side and tandem arrangements 4 1 1 side by side arrangement from eq 8a the pile group effect k for two piles in side by side arrangement where the seismic wave direction is orthogonal to the centre connexion line of the piles located next to each other in a more concrete form can be expressed as 9 k h k f group t max f single t max 2 1 1 2 f group t max f single t max by symmetry k h is equal to k i i 1 2 the relationships between pile group effect k h and relative spacing s d namely the ratio of centre to centre spacing of piles to diameter are demonstrated in figs 9 and 10 as seen k h deceases gradually from 1 to 1 with increasing s d and it is stated that pile group interaction i e lateral interference enhances as the distance between two piles decreases k h values are greater than 1 for s d 4 5 and its maximum value can reach 1 27 for e 1 d l 1 and s d 1 5 which represents the smallest calculated relative spacing implying the resulting hydrodynamic force on each one of two piles in side by side arrangement increases up to 27 in comparison with that on single isolated pile and ignoring the pile group effect will lead to unsafe results for this configuration it can be predicted that the k h value will further increase by decreasing s d until it reaches its minimum possible value s d 1 for s d 4 5 k h is equal to 1 indicating that there is no interaction between piles and each pile behaves like a single isolated pile it can be also observed from fig 9 that the lateral interference increases with the increase of earthquake strength while decreases with the increase of relative frequency f e f s where f e f s is defined as the ratio of the earthquake predominant frequency to the structure fundamental frequency the introduction of relative frequency f e f s is aimed at eliminating effects of structural property noting that the f e values of both e 1 and e 2 wave are 1 13 hz the one of e 3 wave is 8 38 hz in fig 8 and the f s value of a pile given by theoretical calculation is 1 01 for the e 2 and e 3 waves with same strength while different frequency the k h value under the e 2 wave is greater than that under the e 3 wave as a result of the implicit resonance where the predominant frequency of e 2 is high closer to the structure fundamental frequency than e 3 it can be further seen from fig 10 that lateral interference increase as d l increases the reason is attributed to greater hydrodynamic pressure if in larger water depth in addition an important implication from fig 10 is that pile group effect is more significantly affected by water depth when the pile spacing is relatively small the careful compared results illustrate that pile group interaction k h lateral interference for the side by side arrangement is noticeably affected by relative spacing s d and it depends primarily on relative spacing s d which is consequently regarded as the most relevant influencing parameter for pile group effect 4 1 2 tandem arrangement from eq 8a pile group effect k for two piles in tandem arrangement where the angle of the centre connexion line of the piles relative to the seismic wave direction is 0 in a more concrete form can be expressed as 10 k z k f group t max f single t max 1 2 1 2 f group t max f single t max where for this configuration generally k z k 1 k 2 as the result of the asymmetry of seismic wave characterized by unequal positive and negative peak levels the relationships between pile group effect k z and relative spacing s d are shown in figs 11 and 12 as seen k z increases gradually from 1 to 1 with increasing s d that is pile group interaction named longitudinal interference enhances with decreasing the distance between two piles which results in a reduction of hydrodynamic force on each one of two piles in tandem arrangement compared with that on single isolated pile k h values are less than 1 for s d 4 5 and its minimum value can reach 0 74 for e 1 d l 1 and s d 1 5 which represents the smallest calculated relative spacing indicating longitudinal interference could achieve the average hydrodynamic force on two piles in tandem arrangement decrease of up to 26 over that on single isolated pile i e the hydrodynamic force of pile group with two piles is 26 smaller than the resultant force of two isolated piles and neglecting pile group effect may cause overestimation of the resulting hydrodynamic force for this configuration it can be predicted that the k z value will further decrease by decreasing s d until it reaches its minimum possible value s d 1 pile group effect becomes negligible when s d 4 5 and all piles behave like a single isolated pile in terms of the earthquake induced hydrodynamic force it can be also observed from fig 11 that the greater earthquake strength and relative frequency f e f s the more noticeable interference effect is it can be further seen from fig 12 that longitudinal interference increase as d l increases in addition an important implication is that pile group effect is more significantly affected by water depth when s d is relatively small overall pile group interaction k z for the tandem arrangement is noticeably affected by s d and it depends primarily on s d which is consequently regarded as the most relevant influencing parameter for pile group effect just like the case of side by side arrangement 4 2 interference characteristics of more than two piles 4 2 1 three piles in side by side arrangement in the previous section we discussed the interference characteristics of two piles and obtained k h in section 4 1 1 and k z in section 4 1 2 for a pile group with more than two piles in rectangular arrangement the hydrodynamic force of a pile in the group is affected by the neighbouring piles in side by side and tandem arrangement unless the relative spacing s d is large enough it can be concluded from the previous analysis that the lateral interference will amplify the hydrodynamic force on a pile within a group in side by side arrangement while the longitudinal interference will reduce the hydrodynamic force on a pile within a group in tandem arrangement so the pile group interaction of the rectangular arrangement is clearly a combination of both pile group interaction observed in side by side and tandem arrangement the pile group effect k might as well be calculated approximately by a formula which can be expressed as 11 k 1 m 1 k h 1 n 1 k z m n it should be noted that the equation 11 is inspired by total flow resistance coefficient also called drag coefficient in the literature of deng and xiu 2009 which is expressed as 12 c d 1 m 1 k h 1 n 1 k z c d where c d is drag coefficient of a pile c d denotes total drag coefficient of a pile group m and n denote column and row number of piles in a group respectively k h and k z represent lateral drag interference coefficient and sheltering effect coefficient for a given three piles in side by side arrangement where l 30 m s 5 m and d 1 8 m table 3 lists the resulting hydrodynamic forces on single isolated pile pile group and each pile of this group it is apparent from the listed data that the hydrodynamic force on the middle pile is greater than that on the two neighbouring side piles the amplification of the hydrodynamic force on the middle pile in side by side arrangement is more noticeable than the side pile due to the influence of two neighbouring piles from both sides the values of k obtained by both simulation and formula are also listed in table 3 by comparison the formula calculated value is relatively close to the simulated value where the maximum error of both is 3 7 for the cases of different seismic waves and different water depths the numerical difference of k is not significantly large where the maximum relative variation rate is 9 indicating that group pile effect k is not noticeably affected by the seismic wave type and water depth but it is worth noting that the seismic excitation frequency has a great influence on hydrodynamic force on whether single pile or pile group hydrodynamic force is so closely related to water acting area that it is also significantly affected by the water depth the results illustrating the relationship between k i and s d for three piles in side by side arrangement with s d changing from 1 5 to 5 are shown in fig 13 as seen k i decreases with increasing s d until to reach constant value 1 at about s d 5 obviously s d is the most relevant influencing parameter for different s d k 2 k 1 and k 3 k 1 and k 3 are almost equal i e the hydrodynamic force on the middle pile is still highly greater than that on the two side piles especially s d in the range of relative small values the middle pile in this arrangement is in fact affected by two neighbouring piles while only one pile influences the side pile therefore the lower hydrodynamic force amplification for side pile in side by side arrangement as compared to that obtained for the middle pile is physically justified 4 2 2 three piles in tandem arrangement for a given three piles in tandem arrangement where l 30 m s 5 m and d 1 8 m the resulting hydrodynamic forces on single isolated pile pile group and each pile of this group are listed in table 4 it can be seen from the table that the hydrodynamic force on each pile within the group is slightly smaller than that on single isolated pile which is attributed to pile group effect note that the reduction of hydrodynamic force on the middle pile in tandem arrangement is more noticeable than the side pile owing to the influence of two neighbouring piles from both sides front and back the same characteristics exist for different s d k i i 1 2 and 3 increases as s d increases until to reach constant value 1 at about s d 5 it is similar to the side by side arrangement merely pile group effect makes hydrodynamic force reduced here the detailed description figures are omitted here for brevity comparison from the listed data in table 3 shows that the formula calculated k value is relatively close to the simulated value where the maximum error is 9 6 for the cases of different seismic waves and different water depths the values of k are relatively close where the maximum relative variation rate is 9 4 consequently it is still concluded that s d is the most relevant influencing parameter for pile group effect 4 2 3 four piles in 2 2 arrangement for a given pile group with four piles in 2 2 arrangement l 30 m s 5 m and d 1 8 m the resulting hydrodynamic forces on single isolated pile pile group and each pile of this group are listed in table 5 it can be informed from the table that the hydrodynamic force on each pile in the group is slightly smaller than that on single isolated pile as the result of pile group effect for the symmetrical arrangement of s d 2 78 each pile in the group is exposed to both lateral and longitudinal interference from the symmetric neighbouring piles so that k values are grouped around k 1 indicating that there is inconspicuous pile group effect for seismic wave e 2 and e 3 k value hardly varies with water depth in general for the cases of different seismic waves and different water depths the values of k are relatively close where the maximum relative variation rate is 10 also the formula calculated k value is relatively close to the simulated value where the maximum error is 9 1 therefore it is proved that the proposed approximate formula is reasonable but it is only suitable for the rectangular arrangement with orthogonal angler to seismic wave direction 4 2 4 nine piles in 3 3 arrangement for a given pile group with nine piles in 3 3 arrangement l 30 m s 5 m and d 1 8 m the resulting hydrodynamic forces are shown in fig 14 it is observed from fig 14 that hydrodynamic force on each pile is significantly affected by the combination of seismic wave and water depth for a given seismic wave and water depth the scatter between the hydrodynamic force values of piles within group and single isolated pile is very small and the data points are concentrated around the optimal line the variation range of k i is 0 93 1 04 and k is very close to 1 the results show pile group effect k is not highly sensitive to seismic wave attributes and d l pile group effect on hydrodynamic force on whole pile group with square arrangement or approximate square arrangement generally can be ignored yet whether pile group effect on hydrodynamic force on single pile within the group can be neglected or not mainly depends on relative spacing s d in fact the hydrodynamic force of single pile in pile group is more concerned than that of pile group in design the important implication to be observed alertly from fig 14 in the manuscript is that the hydrodynamic force on corner piles numbered 1 3 7 and 9 is greater than that on centre pile numbered 5 in order to make the multiple curves drawn in a picture easier to distinguish and identify the piles numbered 2 5 and 8 in the group are selected as the representative and the hydrodynamic force time history curves are plotted in figs 15 and 16 it can be seen that the vibration paces of each pile in the group during earthquake are almost consistent and consequently the peak values of earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces occur at the same moment corresponding to the maximum value of seismic wave displacement time history due to no significant seismic wave passage effect as the result of short distance between piles and the assumption of seabed as a rigid body motion therefore the time of attaining maximum response for each pile is consistent and there is no obvious phase difference it is further verified that the simplified definition of pile group effect coefficient formula 8 is reasonable 4 3 interference characteristics of pile group of a sea crossing bridge a foundation of sea crossing cable stayed bridge adopts 31ф2 5 m bored piles sketch of pile foundation is depicted in fig 17 to simplify analysis it is assumed that the bored piles are fixed to the seabed at the mud level and free pile length namely vertical distance between mud level and bottom of cap is unified to 25 m where the cap is partially submerged in water at the ordinary water level regardless of the interaction between water and soil as well as the influence of the structure above cap the analysis model is shown in fig 18 as seen in fig 19 two action modes namely transverse and longitudinal excitation are discussed below where e 1 is chosen as the excitation seismic wave the first noticeable implication to be drawn from fig 20 is that most of the data points are below the red dashed line for different cases i e the hydrodynamic force of most piles within pile group is smaller than that of single isolated pile and for the case with cap the hydrodynamic force of all piles is less than that of single isolated pile due to the double contribution of pile group effect and cap action the calculation results show that the hydrodynamic force on the piles with cap is reduced by 20 2 34 9 compared to the hydrodynamic force on the piles without cap pile group effect k changes from 0 96 in the absence of cap to 0 69 in the presence of cap as listed in table 6 where s d is 2 56 4 5 and the range of k i is 0 88 1 05 for the case of no cap indicating that the hydrodynamic force on a pile is significantly affected by the cap but the relative pile spacing is also the important influencing parameter it is stated from the streamline distribution nephogram in fig 21 that streamline construction with curved and interlaced features reveals the apparent mutual interference effect between piles generally the stiffness of a whole pile group cap structure is much greater than that of an isolated pile group structure without cap therefore the influence of the pile cap on hydrodynamic force on piles is mainly because the pile cap strengthens the overall stiffness of pile group structure thereby reducing the hydrodynamic force generated by elastic deformation the second important implication from fig 20 is that the direction of seismic wave action will change the hydrodynamic force of single pile in pile group while it is noted from table 6 that it has no obvious effect on the hydrodynamic force on pile group as seen from table 6 for different action directions of seismic waves there is no significant difference in the uplift force while the horizontal force has a great change as the result of different hydrodynamic action areas on the side of cap in view of the large bottom area of the cap the uplift force is much greater than the horizontal force note that the uplift force is greater than the hydrostatic buoyancy due to the water fluctuation caused by the earthquake the third important implication to be observed alertly from fig 20 is that the hydrodynamic force on corner piles numbered 1 5 27 and 31 is greater than that on centre pile no 16 therefore the former deserves a key concern and it is necessary to strengthen pertinently the stiffness of piles in the group so as to promote overall seismic performance of sea crossing bridge 5 pile group effect of hydrodynamic forces during earthquakes considering current influence 5 1 interference characteristics of two piles in side by side arrangement for a given pile group with two piles in side by side arrangement l 30 m d 25 m and d 1 8 m assume that seismic wave e 1 is consistent with the direction of current and both are perpendicular to the direction of pile arrangement table 7 lists the values of lateral interference k h and the results illustrating the relationship between k h and relative spacing s d 1 5 6 for different current velocity of v are plotted in fig 22 as seen in fig 22 the value of k h deceases gradually from 1 to 1 with increasing s d and it is stated that lateral interference reduces as the distance between two piles increases indicating that pile group effect in the earthquake current combined flow field results in the amplification of hydrodynamic force on each pile within the group compared with single isolated pile this magnification has not disappeared until s d 6 it is noted that pile group effect is affected by current velocity where the influence law relative to current velocity is not pronounced but one thing is for sure compared with the case of only earthquake induced flow field under the same conditions the highest magnification slightly decreases and the range of s d influencing pile group effect has been expanded due to current driving effect the upper limit value of s d influencing pile group effect changes from 4 5 where only earthquake acts to 6 where earthquake and current act together 5 2 interference characteristics of two piles in tandem arrangement for a given pile group with two piles in tandem arrangement l 30 m d 25 m and d 1 8 m assume that seismic wave e 1 is consistent with the direction of current and both are parallel to the direction of pile arrangement table 8 lists the values of longitudinal interference k z and the results illustrating the relationship between k z and relative spacing s d 1 5 6 5 for different v are plotted in fig 23 it is observed from fig 23 that the value of k z increases gradually from 1 to 1 with increasing s d i e longitudinal interference reduces as the distance between two piles increases indicating that pile group effect in the earthquake current combined flow field results in the reduction of hydrodynamic force on each pile within the group compared with single isolated pile this reduction has almost disappeared when about s d 6 like the case of side by side arrangement pile group effect is affected by current velocity where the influence law relative to current velocity is also not pronounced one thing is still certain that the range of s d influencing pile group effect has been expanded due to current driving effect compared with the case of only earthquake induced flow field under the same conditions when k z 1 s d 4 5 for the earthquake induced flow field while about s d 6 for the earthquake current combined flow field 6 pile group effect of hydrodynamic forces during earthquakes considering wave influence table 9 lists the results of k h for two piles in side by side arrangement under the combined action of earthquake e 1 and wave assuming that seismic wave is consistent with the direction of wave and both are perpendicular to the direction of pile arrangement where l 30 m d 25 m d 1 8 m h 3 m and t 6s it can be seen from the table that the value of k h decreases with the increase of s d that is the lateral interference between two piles decreases as s d increases the k h values are greater than 1 for s d 5 indicating that pile group effect in the coexistence field of earthquake and wave makes the magnification of hydrodynamic force on piles within the group compared to single isolated pile this magnification has almost vanished for s d 5 and all piles behave like a single isolated pile in terms of the hydrodynamic force the characteristics of pile groups in the coexisting field of earthquake and wave are different from those in the earthquake induced flow fields but not large on balance the effect of wave on earthquake induced hydrodynamic force is weaker than that of current the wave field and the earthquake induced flow fields are essentially same as the oscillating flow but the boundary layer separation is not noticeable under the seismic excitation where the drag force is generally smaller than the inertial force in addition the dominant frequency of seismic wave excitation is often higher than the loading frequency of regular wave and the keulegan carpenter kc number kc u max t d where u max is the maximum horizontal wave induced flow velocity t is wave period d is pile diameter in the earthquake induced flow field tends to be smaller than that in the wave field so the earthquake induced flow field is not exactly equivalent to the wave field table 10 shows the results of k z for two piles in tandem arrangement under the combined action of earthquake e 1 and wave supposing that seismic wave is the same as the direction of wave and both are parallel to the direction of pile arrangement where l 30 m d 25 m d 1 8 m h 3 m and t 6s as seen in table 10 the value of k z increases with the increase of s d i e the longitudinal interference between two piles decreases as relative spacing increases the k z values are less than 1 for s d 5 5 indicating that pile group effect in the coexistence field of earthquake and wave makes the reduction of hydrodynamic force on piles within the group compared to single isolated pile this reduction has almost vanished for about s d 5 5 it is noted that compared with the case of only earthquake induced flow field under the same conditions the highest reduction at s d 2 decreases while the range of s d influencing pile group effect has been expanded due to the presence of wave 7 conclusions deep water pile groups exposed to earthquake as well as to earthquake current and earthquake wave were investigated but the focus was put on the former to study pile group effect on the hydrodynamic force on a pile during earthquakes different pile arrangements including single side by side tandem 2 2 3 3 and a sea crossing bridge foundation were performed by the proven numerical method based on the second development on ansys software the obtained key results may be summarized as follows 1 comparison between the proposed numerical simulation method and morison method shows the presented method has a high accuracy and reliability which can be used as an alternative for hydrodynamic analysis one point to be clarified is that morison equation s hydrodynamic coefficients i e c d and c m are taken as constants without changing with water depth consequently by the morison method a conservative result may be given when relative water depth is small while a unsafe result may be obtained when relative water depth is large 2 earthquake induced hydrodynamic force consists of two parts namely one part generated by rigid motion and other part generated by elastic vibration as these two peaks do not occur at the same time in general the maximum value of total hydrodynamic force can t be simply added by the two ones 3 under the action of earthquake the lateral interference between two piles in side by side arrangement results in the magnification of hydrodynamic force on each pile within the group compared to single isolated pile while the longitudinal interference between two piles in tandem arrangement causes the reduction of hydrodynamic force on each pile within the group compared to single isolated pile and both decrease by increasing relative spacing s d which have not disappeared until s d 4 5 but until s d 6 in the earthquake current combined field and until about s d 5 5 in the earthquake wave combined field compared with the case of only earthquake induced flow field under the same conditions the highest magnification or reduction in the coexisting field slightly decreases while the range of s d influencing pile group effect has been expanded due to the presence of current and wave 4 pile group effect is more or less affected by earthquake strength relative frequency f e f s relative water depth d l and relative spacing s d however s d is the most relevant influencing parameter 5 it is proved that the proposed approximate formula for pile group effect k is reasonable but it is only suitable for the rectangular arrangement with orthogonal angle to seismic wave direction the pile group effect on hydrodynamic force on whole pile group with square arrangement can be ignored yet its influence on hydrodynamic force on a single pile within the group may not be neglected especially at small relative pile spacing 6 for a sea crossing bridge foundation the hydrodynamic force on single pile is affected by both pile group effect and cap action k is equal to 0 69 implying that failure to take these influencing factors into account may seriously overestimate the hydrodynamic force of the single pile and consequently resulting in a significant increase in project cost results show the hydrodynamic force on corner pile is greater than that on centre pile therefore the former deserves a key concern and it is necessary to strengthen pertinently the stiffness of piles in the group so as to improve overall seismic performance of sea crossing bridge based on the results of this study a substantial improvement of the understanding of pile group effect on the hydrodynamic force of a pile has been achieved which might lead to a safer design of sea crossing bridge

22069,pile group effect is crucial for correct estimation of the hydrodynamic force on a pile within a pile group foundation of sea crossing bridge during earthquakes unlike the case of single isolated pile a numerical calculation model considering fluid structure interaction under the combined loads of earthquakes waves and currents is established based on the second development on ansys software a detailed analysis of pile group effect in the earthquake induced oscillatory flow field is carried out by the presented method that is validated in advance pile group effect in the earthquake current combined flow field as well as in the earthquake wave combined flow field are further discussed pile group effect has almost disappeared when relative spacing s d 4 5 and all piles behave like a single isolated pile in terms of earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces yet in the coexistence field the range of s d influencing pile group effect has been expanded due to the presence of current and wave for a sea crossing bridge foundation pile group effect coefficient k is equal to 0 69 implying noticeable interference effects and results show the hydrodynamic force on corner pile is greater than that on centre pile strengthening section reinforcement pertinently so as to improve overall seismic performance keywords pile group effect fluid structure interaction numerical method earthquake wave current 1 introduction in order to utmostly shorten the traffic distance between major cities in coastal regions in recent years many countries have built many sea crossing bridges at coastal and offshore locations and are planning to build more sea crossing bridges most of these bridges are located in zones characterized by high seismic hazard levels which are not only subjected to common wave current loads but also are affected by earthquakes earthquake excitation can cause additional hydrodynamic pressure on the submerged part of bridge besides structural inertia force li 2013 yang 2017 therefore the working conditions of the sea crossing bridges are more complex than that of the conventional bridges unlike the case of wave forces morion et al 1950 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 guo et al 2015 huang et al 2018 and wave current forces li 1991 malenica et al 1995 cokgor 2002 song 2006 nie et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 as the most frequently used loads on ocean engineering structures less attention has been paid to earthquake induced hydrodynamic force that affects potentially structural safety the original morison equation morion et al 1950 was used only to calculate the wave force on pile standing in water later morison equation was developed to calculate the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure by penzien and kaul 1972 yang and li 2013 expanded morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure during earthquakes caused by inner water and outer water simultaneously for circular and rectangular hollow piers li et al 2019 investigated the coefficients in morison equation for earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure of cylinders huang and li 2011 proposed hydrodynamic pressure formula based on the radiation wave theory for newtonian incompressible fluid flow and analyzed the influence of hydrodynamic pressure on the seismic response of bridge piers the results indicated that the dynamic characteristics of pier changed and the seismic response is augmented because of the hydrodynamic pressure effect the aforementioned hydrodynamic pressure calculations during earthquakes usually assume that the fluid is originally in quiescence without consideration of wave or current motion actually earthquake wave and current may be simultaneously applied to bridges in the marine environment so far the understanding of the coupling mechanism of multi disaster loads is not clear enough li and huang 2012 established a method of dynamic response analysis for bridges in deep water under combined actions of earthquake and wave using the linear radiation wave theory and diffraction wave theory the results indicated dynamic responses of bridge in deep water under separate earthquake and wave actions are nonlinear and cannot be combined by superposition yuan and liu 2013 studied the load effect of bridge pier under combined wave and earthquake actions by the extended morison equation it is noticed that both linear radiation wave theory and diffraction wave theory are suitable for dealing with inviscid incompressible flows for the large scale pier or platform members this assumption is reasonable because of the insignificant viscous effect however for the small scale piles namely slender piles the viscous effect is important and cannot be ignored thereupon the prerequisites of these two theories are no longer valid although the semi empirical morison equation has high accuracy for the small scale component calculation it is not suitable for the closely spaced pile group used widely in sea crossing bridges due to no consideration of interference effects that affect the flow field around the oscillating piles currently it is still difficult to conduct large scale underwater shaking table test especially for the coexistence field e g earthquake current combined flow field earthquake wave combined flow field earthquake wave current combined flow field and so on therefore the seismic analysis method for pile group foundations of sea crossing bridges is poor which is a problem that needs to be solved urgently current literatures about pile group effect mainly focus on currents and waves lack of concern about the earthquake induced flow field obviously earthquake and wave are two different conditions li et al 2019 furthermore pile group effect in the coexistence field such as the earthquake current field the earthquake wave field as well as the earthquake wave current field is seldom discussed in the present paper a systematical study on pile group effect in the earthquake induced flow field the earthquake current field and earthquake wave field is carried out by the numerical method based on the second development on ansys procedure in addition a reasonable approximate formula for pile group effect is proposed 2 numerical method of pile water coupling vibration analysis 2 1 method of fluid structure interaction fsi analysis when a bridge is in the ocean and suffers from wave currents and earthquakes and the hydrodynamic force acted as an external force on bridge the governing equation of transient structural dynamics can be refined as 1 m x t c x t k x t m x g t f h t where m c and k represent the structural mass matrix damping matrix and stiffness matrix respectively x t ẋ t and ẍ t represent the structural relative displacement velocity and acceleration vectors respectively ẍ g t is the acceleration vectors of seismic ground motion f h t is the fluid force vectors exerted on the bridge structure including wave current force and earthquake induced hydrodynamic force the structural governing equation can be discretized using the finite element method fem meanwhile the general governing equations of fluid dynamics e g navier stokes equations are discretized using the finite volume method fvm in the numerical model the navier stokes equations are complemented with the volume of fluid vof method to model the gas liquid interface which can be written in the vector as 2 ρ d u d t ρ f p μ 3 div u μ 2 u in which u is the fluid velocity f is the body acceleration ρ is the fluid density p is the fluid pressure and μ is the dynamic viscosity represents hamilton operator namely differential operator and div denotes divergence operator characterized by fluid volume expansion rate in unit time obviously this term of div u is equal to zero for the incompressible fluid according to pressure and velocity boundary conditions the mutual real time feedback of the calculation results between fluid field and structure is implemented by the interface this coupling process can be described in detail as the structure in water will generate deformations because of fluid pressure meanwhile the fluid field will be affected by the motional structure with rigid body displacement and deformation and the distribution and magnitude of fluid pressure will be changed accordingly the final results are obtained by multiple iterations with an advanced numerical method which is conducted by ansys combined with cfx in ansys workbench platform where the simulation is performed between transient structural ansys and fluid flow cfx and both modules are not only developed independently but also connected through the system coupling module to make a two way fluid structure coupling computational framework the flow of the cfx ansys two way fsi analysis is introduced in fig 1 2 2 wave and current generation the vof method is used to track the free surface profile by introducing a fluid volume fraction a q a q denotes the ratio of the volume occupied by the q phase fluid to the total volume whose value is between 0 and 1 including 0 and 1 when a q 1 the q phase substance is full when a q 0 the q phase substance is empty and when 0 a q 1 it means that the multiphase flow interface for the two phase flow patterns of air and water in this paper there are the following relationships 3 a q t u a q x v a q y w a q z 0 q 1 2 4 q 1 2 a q 1 in which u v and w are the fluid velocity components in x y and z directions respectively the sketch of a cfx numerical flume model is depicted in fig 2 where the length of flume is usually greater than 3 times wavelength and the width is not less than 5 times pile diameter to reduce boundary interference wave generation adopts the boundary generating wave method by defining analytical expressions of the velocity and the wave surface which vary with time at the inlet boundary this method has strong operability and wide application range and is particularly convenient for simultaneous generation of wave and current for the case it only needs to superimpose current velocity components on the basis of wave velocity components at the inlet boundary fluids are forced to make periodic alternating movements in a specified form at the inlet and outlet boundary defined by opening velocity which can eliminate wave reflections from the outlet boundary and the relative static pressure is set as zero at the top boundary defined by opening pressure both side surfaces of the flume are defined as symmetric boundary conditions while the bottom of the flume is defined as no slip wall the pile water coupling surface is used to transfer the real time data between bridge pile and flow field the initial conditions of the transient calculation can be set up by compiling cel codes according to the preset wave velocity wave surface profile and corresponding hydrostatic pressure so as to save the iterative calculation time for forming a stable wave field in the calculation model for a water air two phase flow of compressible viscous fluids the water density is ρ f 1000 kg m3 the dynamic viscosity of water is μ f 0 8899 10 3 pa s the air density is ρ a 1 185

dimensional regular linear wave as an example wave height h 3 m wave period t 6s water depth d 25 m the wave profile generated by the numerical method can be seen clearly as shown in fig 3 2 3 earthquake simulation at the bottom of flume a non slip horizontal wall boundary characterized by sand grain roughness with length dimension h s 8 mm is used to approximate a seabed where seabed movement caused by earthquake is regarded as rigid motion ignoring seabed water interaction and consequently the focus is rather put on bridge structure water interaction aimed at promoting analysis efficiency of the problems involved the bottom of pile fixed with seabed moves synchronously with the seabed and earthquake excitation is conducted by the user defined function in ansys cfx module if a seismic excitation input to the seabed tied up with the bottom of pile is the displacement time history of seismic wave the structural absolute displacement including rigid and elastic displacement will be obtained then the hydrodynamic force exerted on the structure consists of two parts namely the one generated by rigid motion and the other one generated by elastic vibration if a seismic acceleration time history is applied to the entire structure and the bottom of pile remains stationary the hydrodynamic force caused only by the structural elastic vibration can be obtained in the numerical model the fluid domain is discretized using the fvm on structured non uniform hexahedral grids meanwhile the finite element discretization for bridge structure is performed using 20 node hexahedron element solid 186 within cfx the standard two equation k epsilon model is chosen as turbulence calculation model the scalable wall function is used to model near wall region the solver s discrete format is set to high resolution and the second order backward euler scheme is used for time integration fig 4 shows the time history of hydrodynamic forces on a circular vertical pile length l 30 m diameter d 1 8 m and water depth d 25 m excited by the north south component of the 1940 el centro earthquake the peak value of total hydrodynamic force generated by both rigid motion and elastic vibration is 140 14 kn corresponding to a maximum absolute displacement of 14 0 cm and the peak value of hydrodynamic force generated by elastic vibration is 125 62 kn corresponding to a maximum elastic displacement of 12 5 cm it can be seen that the elastic vibration induced hydrodynamic force accounts for a large proportion in total hydrodynamic force noting that the aforementioned two peaks do not occur at the same time in other words the maximum value of the elastic vibration induced hydrodynamic force and the maximum value of the rigid motion induced hydrodynamic force do not occur at the same moment therefore the maximum value of total hydrodynamic force can t be simply added by the two ones 3 numerical model validation an earthquake motion can be decomposed into a series of harmonic motions with different amplitudes frequencies and phases and the superposition law can be used to add up hydrodynamic force of each harmonic motion to form the total hydrodynamic force under the earthquake yang et al 2017 harmonic motion was chosen as excitations exerted on a cylinder the physical experimental data of a single cylinder vibrating in still water by yang et al 2018 are used to confirm the correctness of modeling method and the related parameters the numerical model has the same dimensions and suffers the same external excitation as the physical experimental model the comparison of the time histories of hydrodynamic forces between the physical experimental model and the numerical model is shown in fig 5 it can be observed that the amplitudes of the hydrodynamic forces change from 0 to a constant value as the amplitudes of the harmonic waves change from 0 to 0 025 m gradually during the first several cycles and the two curves coincide well indicating the solution of the present numerical model is trustable table 1 lists results of the water flow forces given by the present numerical method and the experimental test by deng and zhang 2007 for currents past pile groups of two piles in tandem arrangement the comparison between experimental and simulated results shows numerical simulation has good agreement to physical experiment where the relative error is less than 9 morison formula penzien and kaul 1972 characterized by simple expression and clear physical meaning has preferable accuracy and reliability for small scale components such as piles and is chosen as the validation tool fig 6 shows the response time history of a pile with circular cross section l 30 m and d 1 8 m subjected to the combined loads of wave current and earthquake at different relative water depth d l for case h 3 m t 6s current velocity u c 2 m s obtained by the present method two way fsi analysis and the morison method wave and current are in the positive x direction the north south east west and vertical components of el centro wave selected for seismic excitation are in the direction of x z and y respectively and the coordinate directions are shown in fig 2 the drag coefficient c d and inertial coefficient c m affected by current in morison equation are taken as 1 21 and 1 38 respectively specified in the code of hydrology for harbour and waterway published by china communications press 2015 here the maximum structural displacement absolute displacement occurs at the top of pile and the maximum equivalent stress von mises occurs at the bottom of pile it can be observed from fig 6 that the response curves obtained by the two methods agree well with each other especially when d l is relatively small table 2 lists the peak values of responses and their relative errors represented by r 0 where r 0 is defined as 5 r 0 response peak value by the present method response peak value by morison method response peak value by morison method 100 given that r 0 values are small and acceptable it can be concluded that the numerical simulation method in this paper is of high accuracy and reliability as an alternative for deep water pile seismic analysis it can be seen that the value of r 0 changes with d l from negative to positive noting that morison equation s hydrodynamic coefficients i e c d and c m are taken as constants without changing with water depth which imply that the calculation results given by the morison method are conservative when d l is small and unsafe when d l is large 4 analysis of hydrodynamic forces on pile groups during earthquakes the circular cross section piles with rectangular arrangement as depicted in fig 7 are widely used as the foundation of sea crossing bridge therefore the following analysis mainly focuses on this form for a given pipe group arrangement pile group effect is quantitatively reflected by two indexes of k and k i which are defined respectively as let 6a f t f group t f single t m n t 0 t max 6b f i t f i t f single t t 0 t max if at some point t0 t 0 0 t max f t o and f i t o always meet the requirements of the following formula respectively 7a f t 0 1 f t 1 7b f i t 0 1 f i t 1 then k f t o and k i f i t o in eqs 6a and 6b f group t f single t and f i t are the hydrodynamic force on a pile group a single isolated pile and any a pile within a pile group during earthquake respectively subscript i 1 to total number of piles in a group m and n denote column and row number of piles in a group respectively t represents time and t max is the end time of the earthquake in fact the vibration paces of all piles among a pile group during earthquakes are almost consistent and consequently the peak values of earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces occur at the same time due to no significant seismic wave passage effect as the result of short distance between piles and the assumption of seabed as a rigid body motion which are also confirmed by the simulated results like that in other words the time of attaining maximum response for each pile is consistent and there is no obvious phase difference hence k and k i can be simplified and rewritten in the other form 8a k f group t max f single t max m n 8b k i f i t max f single t max where f group t max f single t max and f i t max represent the peak values of earthquake induced hydrodynamic force on a pile group a single isolated pile and any a pile within a pile group respectively meanings of other symbols are same as aforementioned as we all known the north south and vertical components of el centro wave have significant difference in frequency spectrum as shown in fig 8 and the former strength is stronger than that of the latter so these two waves and the amplitude modulated north south wave whose amplitude is equal to the vertical component are designed as three comparative testing seismic waves numbered as e 1 e 2 and e 3 respectively to investigate the influence of earthquakes with different strength and frequencies on pile group effect in the flow field 4 1 interference characteristics of two piles in side by side and tandem arrangements 4 1 1 side by side arrangement from eq 8a the pile group effect k for two piles in side by side arrangement where the seismic wave direction is orthogonal to the centre connexion line of the piles located next to each other in a more concrete form can be expressed as 9 k h k f group t max f single t max 2 1 1 2 f group t max f single t max by symmetry k h is equal to k i i 1 2 the relationships between pile group effect k h and relative spacing s d namely the ratio of centre to centre spacing of piles to diameter are demonstrated in figs 9 and 10 as seen k h deceases gradually from 1 to 1 with increasing s d and it is stated that pile group interaction i e lateral interference enhances as the distance between two piles decreases k h values are greater than 1 for s d 4 5 and its maximum value can reach 1 27 for e 1 d l 1 and s d 1 5 which represents the smallest calculated relative spacing implying the resulting hydrodynamic force on each one of two piles in side by side arrangement increases up to 27 in comparison with that on single isolated pile and ignoring the pile group effect will lead to unsafe results for this configuration it can be predicted that the k h value will further increase by decreasing s d until it reaches its minimum possible value s d 1 for s d 4 5 k h is equal to 1 indicating that there is no interaction between piles and each pile behaves like a single isolated pile it can be also observed from fig 9 that the lateral interference increases with the increase of earthquake strength while decreases with the increase of relative frequency f e f s where f e f s is defined as the ratio of the earthquake predominant frequency to the structure fundamental frequency the introduction of relative frequency f e f s is aimed at eliminating effects of structural property noting that the f e values of both e 1 and e 2 wave are 1 13 hz the one of e 3 wave is 8 38 hz in fig 8 and the f s value of a pile given by theoretical calculation is 1 01 for the e 2 and e 3 waves with same strength while different frequency the k h value under the e 2 wave is greater than that under the e 3 wave as a result of the implicit resonance where the predominant frequency of e 2 is high closer to the structure fundamental frequency than e 3 it can be further seen from fig 10 that lateral interference increase as d l increases the reason is attributed to greater hydrodynamic pressure if in larger water depth in addition an important implication from fig 10 is that pile group effect is more significantly affected by water depth when the pile spacing is relatively small the careful compared results illustrate that pile group interaction k h lateral interference for the side by side arrangement is noticeably affected by relative spacing s d and it depends primarily on relative spacing s d which is consequently regarded as the most relevant influencing parameter for pile group effect 4 1 2 tandem arrangement from eq 8a pile group effect k for two piles in tandem arrangement where the angle of the centre connexion line of the piles relative to the seismic wave direction is 0 in a more concrete form can be expressed as 10 k z k f group t max f single t max 1 2 1 2 f group t max f single t max where for this configuration generally k z k 1 k 2 as the result of the asymmetry of seismic wave characterized by unequal positive and negative peak levels the relationships between pile group effect k z and relative spacing s d are shown in figs 11 and 12 as seen k z increases gradually from 1 to 1 with increasing s d that is pile group interaction named longitudinal interference enhances with decreasing the distance between two piles which results in a reduction of hydrodynamic force on each one of two piles in tandem arrangement compared with that on single isolated pile k h values are less than 1 for s d 4 5 and its minimum value can reach 0 74 for e 1 d l 1 and s d 1 5 which represents the smallest calculated relative spacing indicating longitudinal interference could achieve the average hydrodynamic force on two piles in tandem arrangement decrease of up to 26 over that on single isolated pile i e the hydrodynamic force of pile group with two piles is 26 smaller than the resultant force of two isolated piles and neglecting pile group effect may cause overestimation of the resulting hydrodynamic force for this configuration it can be predicted that the k z value will further decrease by decreasing s d until it reaches its minimum possible value s d 1 pile group effect becomes negligible when s d 4 5 and all piles behave like a single isolated pile in terms of the earthquake induced hydrodynamic force it can be also observed from fig 11 that the greater earthquake strength and relative frequency f e f s the more noticeable interference effect is it can be further seen from fig 12 that longitudinal interference increase as d l increases in addition an important implication is that pile group effect is more significantly affected by water depth when s d is relatively small overall pile group interaction k z for the tandem arrangement is noticeably affected by s d and it depends primarily on s d which is consequently regarded as the most relevant influencing parameter for pile group effect just like the case of side by side arrangement 4 2 interference characteristics of more than two piles 4 2 1 three piles in side by side arrangement in the previous section we discussed the interference characteristics of two piles and obtained k h in section 4 1 1 and k z in section 4 1 2 for a pile group with more than two piles in rectangular arrangement the hydrodynamic force of a pile in the group is affected by the neighbouring piles in side by side and tandem arrangement unless the relative spacing s d is large enough it can be concluded from the previous analysis that the lateral interference will amplify the hydrodynamic force on a pile within a group in side by side arrangement while the longitudinal interference will reduce the hydrodynamic force on a pile within a group in tandem arrangement so the pile group interaction of the rectangular arrangement is clearly a combination of both pile group interaction observed in side by side and tandem arrangement the pile group effect k might as well be calculated approximately by a formula which can be expressed as 11 k 1 m 1 k h 1 n 1 k z m n it should be noted that the equation 11 is inspired by total flow resistance coefficient also called drag coefficient in the literature of deng and xiu 2009 which is expressed as 12 c d 1 m 1 k h 1 n 1 k z c d where c d is drag coefficient of a pile c d denotes total drag coefficient of a pile group m and n denote column and row number of piles in a group respectively k h and k z represent lateral drag interference coefficient and sheltering effect coefficient for a given three piles in side by side arrangement where l 30 m s 5 m and d 1 8 m table 3 lists the resulting hydrodynamic forces on single isolated pile pile group and each pile of this group it is apparent from the listed data that the hydrodynamic force on the middle pile is greater than that on the two neighbouring side piles the amplification of the hydrodynamic force on the middle pile in side by side arrangement is more noticeable than the side pile due to the influence of two neighbouring piles from both sides the values of k obtained by both simulation and formula are also listed in table 3 by comparison the formula calculated value is relatively close to the simulated value where the maximum error of both is 3 7 for the cases of different seismic waves and different water depths the numerical difference of k is not significantly large where the maximum relative variation rate is 9 indicating that group pile effect k is not noticeably affected by the seismic wave type and water depth but it is worth noting that the seismic excitation frequency has a great influence on hydrodynamic force on whether single pile or pile group hydrodynamic force is so closely related to water acting area that it is also significantly affected by the water depth the results illustrating the relationship between k i and s d for three piles in side by side arrangement with s d changing from 1 5 to 5 are shown in fig 13 as seen k i decreases with increasing s d until to reach constant value 1 at about s d 5 obviously s d is the most relevant influencing parameter for different s d k 2 k 1 and k 3 k 1 and k 3 are almost equal i e the hydrodynamic force on the middle pile is still highly greater than that on the two side piles especially s d in the range of relative small values the middle pile in this arrangement is in fact affected by two neighbouring piles while only one pile influences the side pile therefore the lower hydrodynamic force amplification for side pile in side by side arrangement as compared to that obtained for the middle pile is physically justified 4 2 2 three piles in tandem arrangement for a given three piles in tandem arrangement where l 30 m s 5 m and d 1 8 m the resulting hydrodynamic forces on single isolated pile pile group and each pile of this group are listed in table 4 it can be seen from the table that the hydrodynamic force on each pile within the group is slightly smaller than that on single isolated pile which is attributed to pile group effect note that the reduction of hydrodynamic force on the middle pile in tandem arrangement is more noticeable than the side pile owing to the influence of two neighbouring piles from both sides front and back the same characteristics exist for different s d k i i 1 2 and 3 increases as s d increases until to reach constant value 1 at about s d 5 it is similar to the side by side arrangement merely pile group effect makes hydrodynamic force reduced here the detailed description figures are omitted here for brevity comparison from the listed data in table 3 shows that the formula calculated k value is relatively close to the simulated value where the maximum error is 9 6 for the cases of different seismic waves and different water depths the values of k are relatively close where the maximum relative variation rate is 9 4 consequently it is still concluded that s d is the most relevant influencing parameter for pile group effect 4 2 3 four piles in 2 2 arrangement for a given pile group with four piles in 2 2 arrangement l 30 m s 5 m and d 1 8 m the resulting hydrodynamic forces on single isolated pile pile group and each pile of this group are listed in table 5 it can be informed from the table that the hydrodynamic force on each pile in the group is slightly smaller than that on single isolated pile as the result of pile group effect for the symmetrical arrangement of s d 2 78 each pile in the group is exposed to both lateral and longitudinal interference from the symmetric neighbouring piles so that k values are grouped around k 1 indicating that there is inconspicuous pile group effect for seismic wave e 2 and e 3 k value hardly varies with water depth in general for the cases of different seismic waves and different water depths the values of k are relatively close where the maximum relative variation rate is 10 also the formula calculated k value is relatively close to the simulated value where the maximum error is 9 1 therefore it is proved that the proposed approximate formula is reasonable but it is only suitable for the rectangular arrangement with orthogonal angler to seismic wave direction 4 2 4 nine piles in 3 3 arrangement for a given pile group with nine piles in 3 3 arrangement l 30 m s 5 m and d 1 8 m the resulting hydrodynamic forces are shown in fig 14 it is observed from fig 14 that hydrodynamic force on each pile is significantly affected by the combination of seismic wave and water depth for a given seismic wave and water depth the scatter between the hydrodynamic force values of piles within group and single isolated pile is very small and the data points are concentrated around the optimal line the variation range of k i is 0 93 1 04 and k is very close to 1 the results show pile group effect k is not highly sensitive to seismic wave attributes and d l pile group effect on hydrodynamic force on whole pile group with square arrangement or approximate square arrangement generally can be ignored yet whether pile group effect on hydrodynamic force on single pile within the group can be neglected or not mainly depends on relative spacing s d in fact the hydrodynamic force of single pile in pile group is more concerned than that of pile group in design the important implication to be observed alertly from fig 14 in the manuscript is that the hydrodynamic force on corner piles numbered 1 3 7 and 9 is greater than that on centre pile numbered 5 in order to make the multiple curves drawn in a picture easier to distinguish and identify the piles numbered 2 5 and 8 in the group are selected as the representative and the hydrodynamic force time history curves are plotted in figs 15 and 16 it can be seen that the vibration paces of each pile in the group during earthquake are almost consistent and consequently the peak values of earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces occur at the same moment corresponding to the maximum value of seismic wave displacement time history due to no significant seismic wave passage effect as the result of short distance between piles and the assumption of seabed as a rigid body motion therefore the time of attaining maximum response for each pile is consistent and there is no obvious phase difference it is further verified that the simplified definition of pile group effect coefficient formula 8 is reasonable 4 3 interference characteristics of pile group of a sea crossing bridge a foundation of sea crossing cable stayed bridge adopts 31ф2 5 m bored piles sketch of pile foundation is depicted in fig 17 to simplify analysis it is assumed that the bored piles are fixed to the seabed at the mud level and free pile length namely vertical distance between mud level and bottom of cap is unified to 25 m where the cap is partially submerged in water at the ordinary water level regardless of the interaction between water and soil as well as the influence of the structure above cap the analysis model is shown in fig 18 as seen in fig 19 two action modes namely transverse and longitudinal excitation are discussed below where e 1 is chosen as the excitation seismic wave the first noticeable implication to be drawn from fig 20 is that most of the data points are below the red dashed line for different cases i e the hydrodynamic force of most piles within pile group is smaller than that of single isolated pile and for the case with cap the hydrodynamic force of all piles is less than that of single isolated pile due to the double contribution of pile group effect and cap action the calculation results show that the hydrodynamic force on the piles with cap is reduced by 20 2 34 9 compared to the hydrodynamic force on the piles without cap pile group effect k changes from 0 96 in the absence of cap to 0 69 in the presence of cap as listed in table 6 where s d is 2 56 4 5 and the range of k i is 0 88 1 05 for the case of no cap indicating that the hydrodynamic force on a pile is significantly affected by the cap but the relative pile spacing is also the important influencing parameter it is stated from the streamline distribution nephogram in fig 21 that streamline construction with curved and interlaced features reveals the apparent mutual interference effect between piles generally the stiffness of a whole pile group cap structure is much greater than that of an isolated pile group structure without cap therefore the influence of the pile cap on hydrodynamic force on piles is mainly because the pile cap strengthens the overall stiffness of pile group structure thereby reducing the hydrodynamic force generated by elastic deformation the second important implication from fig 20 is that the direction of seismic wave action will change the hydrodynamic force of single pile in pile group while it is noted from table 6 that it has no obvious effect on the hydrodynamic force on pile group as seen from table 6 for different action directions of seismic waves there is no significant difference in the uplift force while the horizontal force has a great change as the result of different hydrodynamic action areas on the side of cap in view of the large bottom area of the cap the uplift force is much greater than the horizontal force note that the uplift force is greater than the hydrostatic buoyancy due to the water fluctuation caused by the earthquake the third important implication to be observed alertly from fig 20 is that the hydrodynamic force on corner piles numbered 1 5 27 and 31 is greater than that on centre pile no 16 therefore the former deserves a key concern and it is necessary to strengthen pertinently the stiffness of piles in the group so as to promote overall seismic performance of sea crossing bridge 5 pile group effect of hydrodynamic forces during earthquakes considering current influence 5 1 interference characteristics of two piles in side by side arrangement for a given pile group with two piles in side by side arrangement l 30 m d 25 m and d 1 8 m assume that seismic wave e 1 is consistent with the direction of current and both are perpendicular to the direction of pile arrangement table 7 lists the values of lateral interference k h and the results illustrating the relationship between k h and relative spacing s d 1 5 6 for different current velocity of v are plotted in fig 22 as seen in fig 22 the value of k h deceases gradually from 1 to 1 with increasing s d and it is stated that lateral interference reduces as the distance between two piles increases indicating that pile group effect in the earthquake current combined flow field results in the amplification of hydrodynamic force on each pile within the group compared with single isolated pile this magnification has not disappeared until s d 6 it is noted that pile group effect is affected by current velocity where the influence law relative to current velocity is not pronounced but one thing is for sure compared with the case of only earthquake induced flow field under the same conditions the highest magnification slightly decreases and the range of s d influencing pile group effect has been expanded due to current driving effect the upper limit value of s d influencing pile group effect changes from 4 5 where only earthquake acts to 6 where earthquake and current act together 5 2 interference characteristics of two piles in tandem arrangement for a given pile group with two piles in tandem arrangement l 30 m d 25 m and d 1 8 m assume that seismic wave e 1 is consistent with the direction of current and both are parallel to the direction of pile arrangement table 8 lists the values of longitudinal interference k z and the results illustrating the relationship between k z and relative spacing s d 1 5 6 5 for different v are plotted in fig 23 it is observed from fig 23 that the value of k z increases gradually from 1 to 1 with increasing s d i e longitudinal interference reduces as the distance between two piles increases indicating that pile group effect in the earthquake current combined flow field results in the reduction of hydrodynamic force on each pile within the group compared with single isolated pile this reduction has almost disappeared when about s d 6 like the case of side by side arrangement pile group effect is affected by current velocity where the influence law relative to current velocity is also not pronounced one thing is still certain that the range of s d influencing pile group effect has been expanded due to current driving effect compared with the case of only earthquake induced flow field under the same conditions when k z 1 s d 4 5 for the earthquake induced flow field while about s d 6 for the earthquake current combined flow field 6 pile group effect of hydrodynamic forces during earthquakes considering wave influence table 9 lists the results of k h for two piles in side by side arrangement under the combined action of earthquake e 1 and wave assuming that seismic wave is consistent with the direction of wave and both are perpendicular to the direction of pile arrangement where l 30 m d 25 m d 1 8 m h 3 m and t 6s it can be seen from the table that the value of k h decreases with the increase of s d that is the lateral interference between two piles decreases as s d increases the k h values are greater than 1 for s d 5 indicating that pile group effect in the coexistence field of earthquake and wave makes the magnification of hydrodynamic force on piles within the group compared to single isolated pile this magnification has almost vanished for s d 5 and all piles behave like a single isolated pile in terms of the hydrodynamic force the characteristics of pile groups in the coexisting field of earthquake and wave are different from those in the earthquake induced flow fields but not large on balance the effect of wave on earthquake induced hydrodynamic force is weaker than that of current the wave field and the earthquake induced flow fields are essentially same as the oscillating flow but the boundary layer separation is not noticeable under the seismic excitation where the drag force is generally smaller than the inertial force in addition the dominant frequency of seismic wave excitation is often higher than the loading frequency of regular wave and the keulegan carpenter kc number kc u max t d where u max is the maximum horizontal wave induced flow velocity t is wave period d is pile diameter in the earthquake induced flow field tends to be smaller than that in the wave field so the earthquake induced flow field is not exactly equivalent to the wave field table 10 shows the results of k z for two piles in tandem arrangement under the combined action of earthquake e 1 and wave supposing that seismic wave is the same as the direction of wave and both are parallel to the direction of pile arrangement where l 30 m d 25 m d 1 8 m h 3 m and t 6s as seen in table 10 the value of k z increases with the increase of s d i e the longitudinal interference between two piles decreases as relative spacing increases the k z values are less than 1 for s d 5 5 indicating that pile group effect in the coexistence field of earthquake and wave makes the reduction of hydrodynamic force on piles within the group compared to single isolated pile this reduction has almost vanished for about s d 5 5 it is noted that compared with the case of only earthquake induced flow field under the same conditions the highest reduction at s d 2 decreases while the range of s d influencing pile group effect has been expanded due to the presence of wave 7 conclusions deep water pile groups exposed to earthquake as well as to earthquake current and earthquake wave were investigated but the focus was put on the former to study pile group effect on the hydrodynamic force on a pile during earthquakes different pile arrangements including single side by side tandem 2 2 3 3 and a sea crossing bridge foundation were performed by the proven numerical method based on the second development on ansys software the obtained key results may be summarized as follows 1 comparison between the proposed numerical simulation method and morison method shows the presented method has a high accuracy and reliability which can be used as an alternative for hydrodynamic analysis one point to be clarified is that morison equation s hydrodynamic coefficients i e c d and c m are taken as constants without changing with water depth consequently by the morison method a conservative result may be given when relative water depth is small while a unsafe result may be obtained when relative water depth is large 2 earthquake induced hydrodynamic force consists of two parts namely one part generated by rigid motion and other part generated by elastic vibration as these two peaks do not occur at the same time in general the maximum value of total hydrodynamic force can t be simply added by the two ones 3 under the action of earthquake the lateral interference between two piles in side by side arrangement results in the magnification of hydrodynamic force on each pile within the group compared to single isolated pile while the longitudinal interference between two piles in tandem arrangement causes the reduction of hydrodynamic force on each pile within the group compared to single isolated pile and both decrease by increasing relative spacing s d which have not disappeared until s d 4 5 but until s d 6 in the earthquake current combined field and until about s d 5 5 in the earthquake wave combined field compared with the case of only earthquake induced flow field under the same conditions the highest magnification or reduction in the coexisting field slightly decreases while the range of s d influencing pile group effect has been expanded due to the presence of current and wave 4 pile group effect is more or less affected by earthquake strength relative frequency f e f s relative water depth d l and relative spacing s d however s d is the most relevant influencing parameter 5 it is proved that the proposed approximate formula for pile group effect k is reasonable but it is only suitable for the rectangular arrangement with orthogonal angle to seismic wave direction the pile group effect on hydrodynamic force on whole pile group with square arrangement can be ignored yet its influence on hydrodynamic force on a single pile within the group may not be neglected especially at small relative pile spacing 6 for a sea crossing bridge foundation the hydrodynamic force on single pile is affected by both pile group effect and cap action k is equal to 0 69 implying that failure to take these influencing factors into account may seriously overestimate the hydrodynamic force of the single pile and consequently resulting in a significant increase in project cost results show the hydrodynamic force on corner pile is greater than that on centre pile therefore the former deserves a key concern and it is necessary to strengthen pertinently the stiffness of piles in the group so as to improve overall seismic performance of sea crossing bridge based on the results of this study a substantial improvement of the understanding of pile group effect on the hydrodynamic force of a pile has been achieved which might lead to a safer design of sea crossing bridge
