5960,calculating the capture time of contaminant to a well is important in the context of both groundwater protection and aquifer remediation although partially penetrating wells are much more commonly used than fully penetrating wells there is no analytical solution for capture time calculations probably due to the challenges of mathematically modeling such types of wells in this study an analytical solution of capture time was developed based on the assumption that a partially penetrating well was installed in a homogeneous and semi infinite aquifer for an example case the capture time result by the analytical solution fitted well with result by a high resolution particle tracking method established according to the fourth order runge kutta algorithm the impacts of different parameters are analyzed and results indicate that the effects of both screen length l and anisotropic ratio a 2 on capture time t are spatially dependent such comparisons also demonstrate that the influence of the lower boundary is stronger as penetration increases in the end we compare the analytical solution for a line sink with that for a point sink and demonstrate that larger differences occur near the wellbore however at a sufficiently large distance from the wellbore the capture time distributions become the same for both source types keywords capture time partially penetrating well analytical solution runge kutta algorithm particle tracking 1 introduction concern of different types of times associated with groundwater systems is critically important in terms of groundwater management and aquifer remediation among other application in steady state condition the groundwater travel time is defined as the time spent that groundwater flows between two points along a pathline in particular the groundwater capture time is the time a fluid or contaminant particle takes to flow into an extraction well zhan 1999b the groundwater transit time was specifically defined as the time interval between the recharge and discharge points chesnaux et al 2005 and the groundwater residence time is the time that has elapsed since water entered the aquifer etcheverry and perrochet 2000 estimation of these times are useful to predict the arrival time of contaminants to water supply wells and to determine wellhead protection area analytical solutions can provide quick assessments of above mentioned times without concerns of numerical models such as discretization related cut off errors convergence issues and requirements of many input parameters values that may not be available they can provide physical insights into the problems which are needed for actual engineering designs before calling for a full scale complex numerical model analytical solutions are also indispensable for benchmarking any numerical models under simplified conditions in terms of the capture time which is the concern of this study zhan 1999b and zhan and cao 2000 analytically calculated the capture time of horizontal wells with and without regional flow respectively zhan 1999a derived closed form solutions for capture times considering both pumping injecting and pumping pumping double well systems when flow becomes steady state or quasi steady state where the quasi steady state implies that the hydraulic head may still vary with time but the flow velocity becomes essentially independent of time a typical example of the quasi steady state is late time flow near a constant rate pumping well where the groundwater flow velocity becomes stable but the cone of depression is still evolving with time continuously luo and kitanidis 2004 presented analytical and semi analytical solutions to evaluate the fluid residence times within the recirculation zone created by an extraction injection well pair zhan and sun 2007 presented analytical solution of capture time to a pumping well considering the presence of unilateral regional flow based on a radial steady state dupuit forchheimer flow model simpson et al 2003 developed an analytical model for computing residence time for the flow near a fully penetrating well in an unconfined aquifer without recharge the non dimensional solution is presented as a nomograph later simpson 2005 zhou and haitjema 2012 presented approximate solutions for travel time to a well in unconfined aquifers with and without recharge by simplifying the solution of simpson et al 2003 in a semi confined leaky aquifer travel time was approximately calculated by the numerical integration of the riemann sum zhou 2011 considering redistribution of groundwater evapotranspiration chen et al 2014 developed an analytical solution of travel time to a pumping well in an unconfined aquifer chesnaux et al 2005 developed an analytical solution for transit times within dupuit type flow systems in an unconfined aquifer however the groundwater is discharging to a down gradient fixed head boundary instead of a well in a similar way braunsfurth and schneider 2010 derived analytical solution for transit time in leaky aquifers up to date no analytical solution is available for capture time to a partially penetrating well yet which will be the subject of this investigation under field conditions wells usually only partially penetrate aquifers especially when aquifer thickness is large in a groundwater remediation perspective contaminated groundwater is usually limited to within a certain depth of the aquifer for instance contamination associated with light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls is usually limited to the shallow portion of the aquifer and it will be much more effective to use a partially penetrating well ppw instead of a fully penetrating well fpw to recover such contaminants in this study we focus on developing an analytical method for capture time around a ppw in a semi infinite aquifer which has rarely been discussed before 2 mathematical model consider a line sink of finite length l in a semi infinite homogeneous aquifer as illustrated in fig 1 the partially penetrating well is screened from the upper confining layer and is perpendicular to the confining layer the well s discharge rate q l3 t is assumed to be uniformly distributed along the screen the hydraulic behaviors of such a ppw in a semi infinite aquifer is equivalent to that of a well with a screen of finite length 2l in an infinite aquifer with 2q discharge rate bear 1979 in the absence of ambient flow groundwater flow to a ppw is three dimensional but with radial symmetry flow to such a line sink is axisymmetric in the r z plane the well penetration is assumed to be much smaller than the aquifer thickness so that the influence from the lower boundary is regarded as secondary the lower boundary influence will be further discussed later as vertical anisotropy is commonly seen in real world aquifer setting it must be considered when developing the analytical method below fortunately the solution for a vertically anisotropic aquifer can be easily obtained using a coordinate transformation based on the solution of an isotropic aquifer therefore in the following we will first present the solution for an isotropic aquifer and then illustrate the procedures of how to obtain the solution for a vertically anisotropic aquifer in section 5 2 using a coordinate transformation method if necessary the coordinate transformation method can also be used to deal with a three dimensionally anisotropic aquifer in which hydraulic conductivities are all different in three directions including two horizontal directions of x and y and one vertical direction of z for this regard one may consult zhan and zlotnik 2002 for how to formulate groundwater flow equation in a three dimensionally anisotropic aquifer into a dimensionless equation for an equivalent isotropic system in a cylindrical coordinate systems the above steady state axisymmetric flow to a single well can be described by the well known laplace equation bear 1979 1 2 ϕ r 2 1 r ϕ r 2 ϕ z 2 0 where ϕ represents the hydraulic head function r and z are the radial and vertical coordinates respectively the boundary

conductivity h l is the reference hydraulic head at infinity and it is a constant under steady state condition and assuming that the well radius rw is infinitesimal polubarinova kochina 1962 and bear 1979 presented the exact analytical solution for the hydraulic head function ϕ based on their work we derived the streamline function ψ in this study the detailed derivation for ψ was provided in appendix 1 ϕ and ψ are 3 ϕ r z m sinh 1 u sinh 1 v 4 ψ r z k m r u 2 1 v 2 1 5 u z l r v z l r where m q 4πkl the dimension of ϕ and m is l and ψ is l3 t u and v are intermediate variables dependent on r z and l fig 2 presents the flow net of a partially penetrating well in a semi infinite aquifer the hydraulic head contour are confocal half ellipsoids the foci of these ellipsoids are at points 0 l in this isotropic domain the hydraulic head and streamline families are orthogonal to each other since steady state flow was taken into account the streamline is meaningful the r and z components of groundwater flow velocities are 6 v r k n e ϕ r v z k n e ϕ z where ne is the effective porosity it is dimensionless by differentiating eq 3 we obtain 7 ϕ r m sign r r u u 2 1 v v 2 1 8 ϕ z m r 1 u 2 1 1 v 2 1 3 analytical solution of capture time based on eqs 4 and 5 we can define a constant λ for an arbitrary streamline in the steady flow field as shown in eq 9 the dimension of λ is l hence the streamline function is ψ 2kmλ 9 z l 2 r 2 z l 2 r 2 2 λ along this specified streamline the capture time t from an initial location r 0 z 0 to the well where r 0 can be obtained by an integration equation as eq 10 zhan 1999b 10 t 0 r 0 d r v r n e k 0 r 0 d r ϕ r an explanation for eq 10 was provided in supplementary materials substituting eq 7 in to eq 10 will result in 11 t n e k 0 r 0 d r m sign r r u u 2 1 v v 2 1 n e km 0 r 0 r d r u u 2 1 v v 2 1 in appendix 2 we demonstrated that eq 12 can be derived from eq 11 thus the capture time t from r 0 z 0 to a ppw becomes 12 t n e 2 k m l 2

solution is simple which can be easily programmed and applied for quick estimation of capture time to a ppw fig 3 shows the results of capture time t for the example case calculated by using eq 12 the values of parameter q k and l are the same as those in fig 2 additionally the effective porosity ne 0 2 in fig 3 a the contour map represents the distribution of capture time t in the r z plane it just looks like the half ellipsoids similar to the hydraulic head in fig 2 and it also demonstrates that less capture time would be spent if the initial location is closer to the well in fig 3 b and c the curves of capture time versus radial coordinate r and vertical z are given obviously a larger distance r or z leads to more capture time to the well given two points p1 r 1 z 1 and p2 r 2 z 2 on the same streamline and the capture time from p1 and p2 to the well are t 1 and t 2 respectively it is easy to obtain the travel time t travel between the two points as t travel t 1 t 2 4 comparison with particle tracking method for practical applications numerical groundwater flow modeling combined with particle tracking is frequently used to compute travel times bair et al 1990 chen et al 2014 pollock 2016 in this section a particle tracking method was introduced to calculate the capture time to a ppw then the particle tracking results for an example case were compared with the results by the proposed analytical solution the runge kutta method philip and walter 1992 faybishenko et al 1995 van peursem et al 1999 muffels et al 2014 xia et al 2019 has been widely used to trace particle paths in two dimensional 2d plane and three dimensional 3d space here we adopted the fourth order runge kutta algorithm for particle tracking in the r z plane based on the velocity vector equations of eq 6 considering a particle moving from the initial coordinates r 0 z 0 to the final rn zn through n steps the beginning position is denoted as ri zi and the end is ri 1 zi 1 for the ith step and this advance is over a time interval δti according to the fourth order runge kutta algorithm the coordinates ri 1 zi 1 is calculated as 13 r i 1 r i l 1 2 l 2 2 l 3 l 4 6 z i 1 z i m 1 2 m 2 2 m 3 m 4 6 where 14 l 1 δ t i v r r i z i m 1 δ t i v z r i z i l 2 δ t i v r r i l 1 2 z i m 1 2 m 2 δ t i v z r i l 1 2 z i m 1 2 l 3 δ t i v r r i l 2 2 z i m 2 2 m 3 δ t i v z r i l 2 2 z i m 2 2 l 4 δ t i v r r i l 3 z i m 3 m 4 δ t i v z r i l 3 z i m 3 the r coordinate of the final point is rn 0 the capture time by particle tracking method t ptm from r 0 z 0 to ppw 0 zn is the accumulative total of time intervals for all the n steps 15 t ptm i 1 n δ t i where the time interval δti δd max vr ri zi vz ri zi and δd is a constant distance interval this is an adaptive scheme for particle tracking which takes small time steps when velocity is high while large time step for low velocity philip and walter 1992 capture times for the example case are shown in fig 4 and the results are calculated by both analytical solution and runge kutta particle tracking method values of parameters q k l ne are the same as assigned in figs 2 and 3 the r value ranges from rw 0 05 m to 10l 30 m while z is from 0 to10l which are much broader than the r and z ranges in fig 3 the capture time of particles to the well ranges from less than a second t 10 5 d in the vicinity of the well to a few days where r z 30 m overall it is obvious that the capture times calculated by the analytical solution perfectly coincide with the results of the runge kutta method thus the effectiveness of the analytical solution is demonstrated the distance interval is δd 0 01 m for this example case significant errors may occur around the well where the releasing particle is quite close to the well such inaccuracy is mainly caused by the relatively larger distance interval δd in the runge kutta algorithm and too short a distance to travel for particles therefore this problem can be simply addressed by assigning a smaller δd to guarantee the high precision of the particle tracking method albeit it will require more time for calculation 5 discussions 5 1 effects of parameters in this section we investigated the effects of parameters on capture time t namely the length of screen l pumping rate q hydraulic conductivity k and effective porosity ne according to eq 12 and m q 4πkl the capture time t is irrelevant to hydraulic conductivity k in the steady state flow filed given the screen length l and a specified coordinates r 0 z 0 λ can be determined therefore t is inversely proportional to the pumping rate q while directly proportional to the effective porosity ne nevertheless given q ne and r 0 z 0 it exhibits complicated nonlinear relation between t and the screen length l based on the previous example case we specified several locations with fixed r 0 z 0 and investigated the impact of l on t curves display different trends of t with l in fig 5 the l ranges from rw 0 05 m to 5 m the plots with decreasing trend are located at the bottom left of the figure while the increasing ones at the top right in general it demonstrates that t mainly decreases with l in areas where z is larger than r while t increases with l in areas where z is smaller than r when plotting fig 5 a2 and a3 there exists a dramatic decreasing trend of t with l when the screen approaches the specified spot however t increases slightly afterwards with l 5 2 effects of anisotropic aquifer anisotropy is universally presented in almost all the aquifers in real world which should not be ignored in this study specifically aquifer anisotropy significantly affects the shape and size of the capture zone around a ppw zlotnik 1997 thus the impact on the capture time would be important especially when flow near the wellbore is strongly three dimensional to address the problems of flow through a given region of anisotropic medium bear and dagan 1965 provided a transformation method to convert an anisotropic medium into an equivalent isotropic one based on this method the effects of anisotropic hydraulic conductivity are incorporated by scaling of coordinates philip and walter 1992 zhan 1999b which was applied to derive an analytical solution of the capture time in an anisotropic aquifer in this section for a homogeneous and anisotropic aquifer with horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities kr and kz we assign kr kz a 2 where a greater than 0 is the dimensionless square root of the anisotropic ratio according to the coordinates scaling method we have 16 k e k r k z a k z 17 r k e k r r r a z k e k z z a z where ke is an effective hydraulic conductivity and r and z are the coordinates in the equivalent isotropic aquifer therefore based on eq 12 the capture time is 18 t 2 π n e l q l 2 3 z 0 3 λ 3 1 λ z 0 λ 2 where r 0 r 0 a z 0 a z 0 l a l λ z 0 l 2 r 0 2 z 0 l 2 r 0 2 2 where r 0 z 0 is the initial position of the particle fig 6 presents the distribution of capture time t calculated by eq 18 for two anisotropic aquifer cases a kz 10kr and kz 0 1 m d b kr 10kz and kz 0 1 m d the other parameters are exactly the same as the ones used in the isotropic aquifer described earlier compared with fig 3 a the capture time contours in fig 6 a are shrunk in the horizontal direction but are elongated in the vertical direction on the contrary the contours in fig 6 b exhibit an opposite variation this result indicates that a larger a 2 leads to the enhancement of the horizontal flow while the vertical flow is limited the change for capture time is dependent on the initial position of the particle for example we chose two points p1 and p2 which are symmetrical with respect to the z axis and another pair the points p3 and p4 the capture time t 1 for p1 in fig 6 a is larger than t 2 for p2 in fig 6 b due to different anisotropies while the capture time t 3 for p3 is smaller than t 4 for p4 5 3 influence of lower boundary we now consider the case in which the ppw is installed in a confined aquifer as shown in fig 7 specifically we assume m l is the aquifer thickness then there is no flow across the lower boundary where z m the other boundary conditions are exactly the same as the semi infinite one demonstrated in section 2 the infinite distant dirichlet boundary condition the hydraulic head distribution and the streamlines were illustrated in fig 7 a for this confined case in this section we first established the mathematical model for groundwater flow in the confined aquifer which was applied to obtain capture time by particle tracking method then we evaluated the influence of the lower boundary if the analytical solution in eq 12 was adopted to calculate capture time for the confined aquifer case there are some analytical solutions with different assumptions for hydraulics of a ppw chang and chen 2003 ataie ashtiani et al 2012 which usually concerned a complicated boundary condition for the ppw wellbore to avoid dealing with that we adopted the method provided by philip and walter 1992 for steady state groundwater flow in a homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer it begins with the hydraulic head solution for a point sink in an infinite aquifer the point sink is then integrated to derive the solution for a line sink ultimately the image theory and linear superposition is applied to obtain the hydraulic head in a confined aquifer the essence of this approach is to treat the ppw as a uniformly distributed line sink which of course is an approximation of the wellbore boundary condition the validity of this approach can be understood when considering a few factors first it has been demonstrated in numerous previous investigations that the difference of the uniform and other type boundary conditions for treating a ppw is only noticeable in regions that are very close to the wellbore near field such a difference essentially disappears when moving away from the wellbore i e when the radial distance r is greater than 1 5 m hantush 1961 cassiani and kabala 1998 second the capture time depends on the initial horizontal distance from the ppw in a nonlinear fashion zhan 1999a zhan 1999b specifically when the horizontal distance increases the capture time increases in a rate much faster than the linear trend super linear this implies that over the entire travel time for a water or contaminant particle to travel from an initial far field location to the ppw a much greater portion of the total capture time is spent at regions far from the wellbore far field where flow velocity is much slower and much less travel time will be spent at near field this means that the uniform flux approximation of a line sink which may cause some minor discrepancy for the near field flow velocity will not result some appreciable errors in terms of the overall capture time computation thus can be regarded as a secondary effect consider a single line sink of length l centered at r 0 z zc in a r z plane as shown in fig 7 the solution for head distribution h r z is 19 h r z q 4 π k l ln z z c l 2 r 2 z z c l 2 2 z z c l 2 r 2 z z c l 2 2 this equation describes the head changes at any location in an infinite aquifer caused by a line sink it is then differentiated to obtain the hydraulic head gradient and velocity field 20 v r k n e h r v z k n e h z 21 h r q r 4 π k l 1 a z z c l 2 a 1 b z z c l 2 b 22 h z q 4 π k l 1 a 1 b 23 a r 2 z z c l 2 2 b r 2 z z c l 2 2 where vr and vz are the r and z components of velocities respectively according to the principle of linear superposition the effect of upper and lower confining beds in a confined aquifer can be accounted for by adding infinite image wells as illustrated in fig 7 b thus the overall velocity can be determined by summing all the individual contributions from both real and image wells because all the wells are centered at r 0 but different zc thus when eqs 20 23 were applied to calculate the velocity only zc needs to be changed for different wells the bulk velocities vr and vz are shown below 24 v r n 1 n v r v z n 1 n v z theoretically the number n is infinite in practice however n becomes finite if we set an acceptable tolerance ε for the change of velocity we found that the tolerance ε equals to 10 7 worked well for most cases once the velocity field is available the capture time to a ppw can be calculated using the aforementioned runge kutta particle tracking method as well we denoted tlb as the capture time for the model with a lower boundary which is obtained by the runge kutta particle tracking method while tsi as the capture time calculated by the analytical solution in eq 12 for the semi infinite aquifer in addition we defined a variable εlb to measure the relative errors as shown in eq 25 if we use the proposed analytical solution to predict the capture time for confined aquifer model 25 ε lb t si t lb t lb as we have demonstrated before there exists monotonous linear relations between tsi and the pumping rate q and the effective porosity ne in addition tlb is inversely proportional to q and proportional to ne therefore εlb is independent of q and ne finally the degree of penetration l m became the only factor of concern fig 8 displays the εlb distribution in the r z plane for four penetration cases namely l m 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively both r and z range from 0 to m as shown in fig 8 for all the four cases the εlb is negative in the bottom left part which means tsi underestimates tlb in this area nevertheless tlb is overestimated in the right part with a larger horizontal distance r generally the area of underestimation decreases as the degree of penetration increases in the vicinity of wellbore the absolute value of relative error εlb is less than 5 indicating that the proposed analytical solution is more effective there in each plot the maximum negative εlb is at the bottom left corner 0 m showing that negative discrepancy increases as it approaches the lower boundary and the lower boundary is becoming more influential in addition a larger degree of penetration leads to a larger maximum negative εlb for example it is 0 3 in fig 8 a with the penetration l m 0 2 while it is 0 6 in fig 8 d with l m 0 8 5 4 comparison with point sink model a special kind of ppw is the with a zero penetration it was considered as a point sink with spherically converging flow towards it bear 1979 assuming that the well s bottom has the shape of a hemisphere of radius rw and the radius of influence of the well r rw we can obtain the steady state drawdown s as 26 s q 2 π k ρ where ρ r 2 z 2 ρ is the distance from a specified location r z to the point sink 0 0 if we denote tp as the capture time to the point sink model it can be calculated by 27 t p 0 ρ 0 d ρ v ρ n e k 0 ρ 0 d ρ d s d ρ on the basis of eq 27 we have d s d ρ q 2 π k ρ 2 substituting it into eq 27 one can obtain the expression of tp as 28 t p n e k 0 ρ 0 2 π k ρ 2 d ρ q 2 π n e q 0 ρ 0 ρ 2 d ρ 2 π n e 3 q ρ 0 3 where ρ 0 r 0 2 z 0 2 and r 0 z 0 is the position where the particle is released we evaluated the error of capture time if the analytical solution for a point sink model was used for a line sink in the following paragraphs to avoid misunderstanding we denoted tl as capture time to a line sink the analytical solution in eq 12 can be rewritten as 29 t l 2 π n e 3 q l l 2 z 0 3 λ 3 1 3 λ z 0 3 λ 2 a variable εpl was defined to evaluate the relative error when we substitute tp for tl as shown in eq 30 30 ε pl t p t l t l in terms of eqs 28 and 29 both tp and tl have linear relation with q and ne therefore εpt is independent of q and ne given a position with coordinate r 0 z 0 εpt is only determined by the screen length l hence we can adopt the dimensionless form r l and z l to analyze the εpt distribution fig 9 presents the distribution of relative error εpt in the dimensionless r z plane which can be divided into two parts tp underestimates tl in the top right part while tp overestimates tl in the bottom left part the maximum positive error occurs in vicinity of screen where the value of εpt is as high as more than a thousand which means tp is larger than a thousand times tl the maximum negative error is at the top left corner the εpt is almost 1 there in addition fig 9 illustrates that at a sufficiently large distance from the finite line sink the capture time distribution is the same as that of a point sink having the same total discharge specifically the relative error is less than 10 when the horizontal distance r is approximately larger than 3 5l or z is larger than 5 5l 5 5 limitations although the proposed analytical solution is simple and convenient for quick estimation of capture time several limitations are worth noting for consideration in future investigations first of all the well radius is not explicitly included in the mathematical model and the skin effect was ignored for practical application finite well radius and thickness of the skin zone need to be considered ataie ashtiani et al 2012 in addition the analytical solution in this study is not appropriate if the ppw is not screened from the top confining layer of aquifer a further limitation of the analytical solution exists due to the assumption that the influence of regional groundwater flow was ignored therefore it should not be used for situations where the regional flow is strong the steady state assumption used for conducting the capture time computation also deserves some discussion this assumption is based on a few considerations first the capture time computation is most effective in assessing the long term flow and solute advective transport near a pumping well thus steady state flow condition is likely to be established near a pumping well one thing to note is that the steady state condition used in this study only concerns the flow velocity which does not change with time it does not require the hydraulic head to be constant with time in fact in a confined aquifer near a constant rate pumping well the hydraulic head will constantly change with time in a uniform fashion after a sufficiently long time of pumping but the flow velocity becomes independent of time the reason for this is because the flow velocity only depends on the hydraulic gradient not the hydraulic head itself therefore as long as the hydraulic head at different locations varies with time in the same fashion the hydraulic gradient can remain independent of time some previous studies have called such a condition i e flow velocity is independent of time but hydraulic head can vary with time in a uniform fashion as quasi steady state wen et al 2006 zhan and bian 2006 wen et al 2009 second the potential theory which involves potential function streamline function capture zone and capture time is based on the laplace equation eq 1 with a presumption of steady state flow this theory becomes much less effective and even awkward when flow is transient or flow velocity depends on time that is because the potential function streamline function and the size and shape of the capture zone are all continuously changing with time thus the computation of capture time can only be approximated in a sequence of time steps during each time step the flow may be regarded as quasi steady state and the concepts of potential function can be used in an approximate manner however when moving to the next time step a new quasi steady state flow condition has to be used and the potential function has to be updated all of this will make the analytical treatment tedious and awkward thus numerical simulations rather than analytical methods are probably preferred when flow is transient 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the capture time to a partially penetrating well in a semi infinite aquifer under the steady state flow condition an analytical solution was developed and then compared with particle tracking method in an example case the analytical results agree very well with those by the particle tracking method in addition the analytical solution for anisotropic medium was developed by scaling of coordinates the analytical solution was further investigated from three aspects first the impacts of different parameters on the capture time were analyzed results are the capture time t is irrelevant to hydraulic conductivity k and is inversely proportional to pumping rate q while directly proportional to effective porosity ne the impact of screen length l on t is depending on the location for particle releasing in general t decreases with l where the vertical distance z is larger than horizontal distance r while t increases with l where the r is larger z specifically the effect of anisotropic ratio a 2 on t is spatially dependent as well second the influence of the lower boundary was investigated through the relative error which was defined to measure the difference between the analytical solution for semi infinite aquifer and the particle tracking method result for the confined with finite thickness conclusions can be drawn as a larger degree of penetration leads to larger discrepancy which indicates the lower boundary is more influential as penetration increases in the vicinity of well the proposed analytical solution is effective to predict capture time in confined aquifer with relative error less than 5 third analytical solution for the point sink model with zero penetration was compared if it was adopted for the usual ppw results indicate that the relative error of capture time is less than 10 when

5960,calculating the capture time of contaminant to a well is important in the context of both groundwater protection and aquifer remediation although partially penetrating wells are much more commonly used than fully penetrating wells there is no analytical solution for capture time calculations probably due to the challenges of mathematically modeling such types of wells in this study an analytical solution of capture time was developed based on the assumption that a partially penetrating well was installed in a homogeneous and semi infinite aquifer for an example case the capture time result by the analytical solution fitted well with result by a high resolution particle tracking method established according to the fourth order runge kutta algorithm the impacts of different parameters are analyzed and results indicate that the effects of both screen length l and anisotropic ratio a 2 on capture time t are spatially dependent such comparisons also demonstrate that the influence of the lower boundary is stronger as penetration increases in the end we compare the analytical solution for a line sink with that for a point sink and demonstrate that larger differences occur near the wellbore however at a sufficiently large distance from the wellbore the capture time distributions become the same for both source types keywords capture time partially penetrating well analytical solution runge kutta algorithm particle tracking 1 introduction concern of different types of times associated with groundwater systems is critically important in terms of groundwater management and aquifer remediation among other application in steady state condition the groundwater travel time is defined as the time spent that groundwater flows between two points along a pathline in particular the groundwater capture time is the time a fluid or contaminant particle takes to flow into an extraction well zhan 1999b the groundwater transit time was specifically defined as the time interval between the recharge and discharge points chesnaux et al 2005 and the groundwater residence time is the time that has elapsed since water entered the aquifer etcheverry and perrochet 2000 estimation of these times are useful to predict the arrival time of contaminants to water supply wells and to determine wellhead protection area analytical solutions can provide quick assessments of above mentioned times without concerns of numerical models such as discretization related cut off errors convergence issues and requirements of many input parameters values that may not be available they can provide physical insights into the problems which are needed for actual engineering designs before calling for a full scale complex numerical model analytical solutions are also indispensable for benchmarking any numerical models under simplified conditions in terms of the capture time which is the concern of this study zhan 1999b and zhan and cao 2000 analytically calculated the capture time of horizontal wells with and without regional flow respectively zhan 1999a derived closed form solutions for capture times considering both pumping injecting and pumping pumping double well systems when flow becomes steady state or quasi steady state where the quasi steady state implies that the hydraulic head may still vary with time but the flow velocity becomes essentially independent of time a typical example of the quasi steady state is late time flow near a constant rate pumping well where the groundwater flow velocity becomes stable but the cone of depression is still evolving with time continuously luo and kitanidis 2004 presented analytical and semi analytical solutions to evaluate the fluid residence times within the recirculation zone created by an extraction injection well pair zhan and sun 2007 presented analytical solution of capture time to a pumping well considering the presence of unilateral regional flow based on a radial steady state dupuit forchheimer flow model simpson et al 2003 developed an analytical model for computing residence time for the flow near a fully penetrating well in an unconfined aquifer without recharge the non dimensional solution is presented as a nomograph later simpson 2005 zhou and haitjema 2012 presented approximate solutions for travel time to a well in unconfined aquifers with and without recharge by simplifying the solution of simpson et al 2003 in a semi confined leaky aquifer travel time was approximately calculated by the numerical integration of the riemann sum zhou 2011 considering redistribution of groundwater evapotranspiration chen et al 2014 developed an analytical solution of travel time to a pumping well in an unconfined aquifer chesnaux et al 2005 developed an analytical solution for transit times within dupuit type flow systems in an unconfined aquifer however the groundwater is discharging to a down gradient fixed head boundary instead of a well in a similar way braunsfurth and schneider 2010 derived analytical solution for transit time in leaky aquifers up to date no analytical solution is available for capture time to a partially penetrating well yet which will be the subject of this investigation under field conditions wells usually only partially penetrate aquifers especially when aquifer thickness is large in a groundwater remediation perspective contaminated groundwater is usually limited to within a certain depth of the aquifer for instance contamination associated with light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls is usually limited to the shallow portion of the aquifer and it will be much more effective to use a partially penetrating well ppw instead of a fully penetrating well fpw to recover such contaminants in this study we focus on developing an analytical method for capture time around a ppw in a semi infinite aquifer which has rarely been discussed before 2 mathematical model consider a line sink of finite length l in a semi infinite homogeneous aquifer as illustrated in fig 1 the partially penetrating well is screened from the upper confining layer and is perpendicular to the confining layer the well s discharge rate q l3 t is assumed to be uniformly distributed along the screen the hydraulic behaviors of such a ppw in a semi infinite aquifer is equivalent to that of a well with a screen of finite length 2l in an infinite aquifer with 2q discharge rate bear 1979 in the absence of ambient flow groundwater flow to a ppw is three dimensional but with radial symmetry flow to such a line sink is axisymmetric in the r z plane the well penetration is assumed to be much smaller than the aquifer thickness so that the influence from the lower boundary is regarded as secondary the lower boundary influence will be further discussed later as vertical anisotropy is commonly seen in real world aquifer setting it must be considered when developing the analytical method below fortunately the solution for a vertically anisotropic aquifer can be easily obtained using a coordinate transformation based on the solution of an isotropic aquifer therefore in the following we will first present the solution for an isotropic aquifer and then illustrate the procedures of how to obtain the solution for a vertically anisotropic aquifer in section 5 2 using a coordinate transformation method if necessary the coordinate transformation method can also be used to deal with a three dimensionally anisotropic aquifer in which hydraulic conductivities are all different in three directions including two horizontal directions of x and y and one vertical direction of z for this regard one may consult zhan and zlotnik 2002 for how to formulate groundwater flow equation in a three dimensionally anisotropic aquifer into a dimensionless equation for an equivalent isotropic system in a cylindrical coordinate systems the above steady state axisymmetric flow to a single well can be described by the well known laplace equation bear 1979 1 2 ϕ r 2 1 r ϕ r 2 ϕ z 2 0 where ϕ represents the hydraulic head function r and z are the radial and vertical coordinates respectively the boundary

1979 presented the exact analytical solution for the hydraulic head function ϕ based on their work we derived the streamline function ψ in this study the detailed derivation for ψ was provided in appendix 1 ϕ and ψ are 3 ϕ r z m sinh 1 u sinh 1 v 4 ψ r z k m r u 2 1 v 2 1 5 u z l r v z l r where m q 4πkl the dimension of ϕ and m is l and ψ is l3 t u and v are intermediate variables dependent on r z and l fig 2 presents the flow net of a partially penetrating well in a semi infinite aquifer the hydraulic head contour are confocal half ellipsoids the foci of these ellipsoids are at points 0 l in this isotropic domain the hydraulic head and streamline families are orthogonal to each other since steady state flow was taken into account the streamline is meaningful the r and z components of groundwater flow velocities are 6 v r k n e ϕ r v z k n e ϕ z where ne is the effective porosity it is dimensionless by differentiating eq 3 we obtain 7 ϕ r m sign r r u u 2 1 v v 2 1 8 ϕ z m r 1 u 2 1 1 v 2 1 3 analytical solution of capture time based on eqs 4 and 5 we can define a constant λ for an arbitrary streamline in the steady flow field as shown in eq 9 the dimension of λ is l hence the streamline function is ψ 2kmλ 9 z l 2 r 2 z l 2 r 2 2 λ along this specified streamline the capture time t from an initial location r 0 z 0 to the well where r 0 can be obtained by an integration equation as eq 10 zhan 1999b 10 t 0 r 0 d r v r n e k 0 r 0 d r ϕ r an explanation for eq 10 was provided in supplementary materials substituting eq 7 in to eq 10 will result in 11 t n e k 0 r 0 d r m sign r r u u 2 1 v v 2 1 n e km 0 r 0 r d r u u 2 1 v v 2 1 in appendix 2 we demonstrated that eq 12 can be derived from eq 11 thus the capture time t from r 0 z 0 to a ppw becomes 12 t n e 2 k m l 2 3 z 0 3 λ 3 1 λ z 0 λ 2 where λ z 0 l 2 r 0 2 z 0 l 2 r 0 2 2 the streamline constant λ is determined by the particle s initial location r 0 z 0 and the prescribed screen length l this analytical solution is simple which can be easily programmed and applied for quick estimation of capture time to a ppw fig 3 shows the results of capture time t for the example case calculated by using eq 12 the values of parameter q k and l are the same as those in fig 2 additionally the effective porosity ne 0 2 in fig 3 a the contour map represents the distribution of capture time t in the r z plane it just looks like the half ellipsoids similar to the hydraulic head in fig 2 and it also demonstrates that less capture time would be spent if the initial location is closer to the well in fig 3 b and c the curves of capture time versus radial coordinate r and vertical z are given obviously a larger distance r or z leads to more capture time to the well given two points p1 r 1 z 1 and p2 r 2 z 2 on the same streamline and the capture time from p1 and p2 to the well are t 1 and t 2 respectively it is easy to obtain the travel time t travel between the two points as t travel t 1 t 2 4 comparison with particle tracking method for practical applications numerical groundwater flow modeling combined with particle tracking is frequently used to compute travel times bair et al 1990 chen et al 2014 pollock 2016 in this section a particle tracking method was introduced to calculate the capture time to a ppw then the particle tracking results for an example case were compared with the results by the proposed analytical solution the runge kutta method philip and walter 1992 faybishenko et al 1995 van peursem et al 1999 muffels et al 2014 xia et al 2019 has been widely used to trace particle paths in two dimensional 2d plane and three dimensional 3d space here we adopted the fourth order runge kutta algorithm for particle tracking in the r z plane based on the velocity vector equations of eq 6 considering a particle moving from the initial coordinates r 0 z 0 to the final rn zn through n steps the beginning position is denoted as ri zi and the end is ri 1 zi 1 for the ith step and this advance is over a time interval δti according to the fourth order runge kutta algorithm the coordinates ri 1 zi 1 is calculated as 13 r i 1 r i l 1 2 l 2 2 l 3 l 4 6 z i 1 z i m 1 2 m 2 2 m 3 m 4 6 where 14 l 1 δ t i v r r i z i m 1 δ t i v z r i z i l 2 δ t i v r r i l 1 2 z i m 1 2 m 2 δ t i v z r i l 1 2 z i m 1 2 l 3 δ t i v r r i l 2 2 z i m 2 2 m 3 δ t i v z r i l 2 2 z i m 2 2 l 4 δ t i v r r i l 3 z i m 3 m 4 δ t i v z r i l 3 z i m 3 the r coordinate of the final point is rn 0 the capture time by particle tracking method t ptm from r 0 z 0 to ppw 0 zn is the accumulative total of time intervals for all the n steps 15 t ptm i 1 n δ t i where the time interval δti δd max vr ri zi vz ri zi and δd is a constant distance interval this is an adaptive scheme for particle tracking which takes small time steps when velocity is high while large time step for low velocity philip and walter 1992 capture times for the example case are shown in fig 4 and the results are calculated by both analytical solution and runge kutta particle tracking method values of parameters q k l ne are the same as assigned in figs 2 and 3 the r value ranges from rw 0 05 m to 10l 30 m while z is from 0 to10l which are much broader than the r and z ranges in fig 3 the capture time of particles to the well ranges from less than a second t 10 5 d in the vicinity of the well to a few days where r z 30 m overall it is obvious that the capture times calculated by the analytical solution perfectly coincide with the results of the runge kutta method thus the effectiveness of the analytical solution is demonstrated the distance interval is δd 0 01 m for this example case significant errors may occur around the well where the releasing particle is quite close to the well such inaccuracy is mainly caused by the relatively larger distance interval δd in the runge kutta algorithm and too short a distance to travel for particles therefore this problem can be simply addressed by assigning a smaller δd to guarantee the high precision of the particle tracking method albeit it will require more time for calculation 5 discussions 5 1 effects of parameters in this section we investigated the effects of parameters on capture time t namely the length of screen l pumping rate q hydraulic conductivity k and effective porosity ne according to eq 12 and m q 4πkl the capture time t is irrelevant to hydraulic conductivity k in the steady state flow filed given the screen length l and a specified coordinates r 0 z 0 λ can be determined therefore t is inversely proportional to the pumping rate q while directly proportional to the effective porosity ne nevertheless given q ne and r 0 z 0 it exhibits complicated nonlinear relation between t and the screen length l based on the previous example case we specified several locations with fixed r 0 z 0 and investigated the impact of l on t curves display different trends of t with l in fig 5 the l ranges from rw 0 05 m to 5 m the plots with decreasing trend are located at the bottom left of the figure while the increasing ones at the top right in general it demonstrates that t mainly decreases with l in areas where z is larger than r while t increases with l in areas where z is smaller than r when plotting fig 5 a2 and a3 there exists a dramatic decreasing trend of t with l when the screen approaches the specified spot however t increases slightly afterwards with l 5 2 effects of anisotropic aquifer anisotropy is universally presented in almost all the aquifers in real world which should not be ignored in this study specifically aquifer anisotropy significantly affects the shape and size of the capture zone around a ppw zlotnik 1997 thus the impact on the capture time would be important especially when flow near the wellbore is strongly three dimensional to address the problems of flow through a given region of anisotropic medium bear and dagan 1965 provided a transformation method to convert an anisotropic medium into an equivalent isotropic one based on this method the effects of anisotropic hydraulic conductivity are incorporated by scaling of coordinates philip and walter 1992 zhan 1999b which was applied to derive an analytical solution of the capture time in an anisotropic aquifer in this section for a homogeneous and anisotropic aquifer with horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities kr and kz we assign kr kz a 2 where a greater than 0 is the dimensionless square root of the anisotropic ratio according to the coordinates scaling method we have 16 k e k r k z a k z 17 r k e k r r r a z k e k z z a z where ke is an effective hydraulic conductivity and r and z are the coordinates in the equivalent isotropic aquifer therefore based on eq 12 the capture time is 18 t 2 π n e l q l 2 3 z 0 3 λ 3 1 λ z 0 λ 2 where r 0 r 0 a z 0 a z 0 l a l λ z 0 l 2 r 0 2 z 0 l 2 r 0 2 2 where r 0 z 0 is the initial position of the particle fig 6 presents the distribution of capture time t calculated by eq 18 for two anisotropic aquifer cases a kz 10kr and kz 0 1 m d b kr 10kz and kz 0 1 m d the other parameters are exactly the same as the ones used in the isotropic aquifer described earlier compared with fig 3 a the capture time contours in fig 6 a are shrunk in the horizontal direction but are elongated in the vertical direction on the contrary the contours in fig 6 b exhibit an opposite variation this result indicates that a larger a 2 leads to the enhancement of the horizontal flow while the vertical flow is limited the change for capture time is dependent on the initial position of the particle for example we chose two points p1 and p2 which are symmetrical with respect to the z axis and another pair the points p3 and p4 the capture time t 1 for p1 in fig 6 a is larger than t 2 for p2 in fig 6 b due to different anisotropies while the capture time t 3 for p3 is smaller than t 4 for p4 5 3 influence of lower boundary we now consider the case in which the ppw is installed in a confined aquifer as shown in fig 7 specifically we assume m l is the aquifer thickness then there is no flow across the lower boundary where z m the other boundary conditions are exactly the same as the semi infinite one demonstrated in section 2 the infinite distant dirichlet boundary condition the hydraulic head distribution and the streamlines were illustrated in fig 7 a for this confined case in this section we first established the mathematical model for groundwater flow in the confined aquifer which was applied to obtain capture time by particle tracking method then we evaluated the influence of the lower boundary if the analytical solution in eq 12 was adopted to calculate capture time for the confined aquifer case there are some analytical solutions with different assumptions for hydraulics of a ppw chang and chen 2003 ataie ashtiani et al 2012 which usually concerned a complicated boundary condition for the ppw wellbore to avoid dealing with that we adopted the method provided by philip and walter 1992 for steady state groundwater flow in a homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer it begins with the hydraulic head solution for a point sink in an infinite aquifer the point sink is then integrated to derive the solution for a line sink ultimately the image theory and linear superposition is applied to obtain the hydraulic head in a confined aquifer the essence of this approach is to treat the ppw as a uniformly distributed line sink which of course is an approximation of the wellbore boundary condition the validity of this approach can be understood when considering a few factors first it has been demonstrated in numerous previous investigations that the difference of the uniform and other type boundary conditions for treating a ppw is only noticeable in regions that are very close to the wellbore near field such a difference essentially disappears when moving away from the wellbore i e when the radial distance r is greater than 1 5 m hantush 1961 cassiani and kabala 1998 second the capture time depends on the initial horizontal distance from the ppw in a nonlinear fashion zhan 1999a zhan 1999b specifically when the horizontal distance increases the capture time increases in a rate much faster than the linear trend super linear this implies that over the entire travel time for a water or contaminant particle to travel from an initial far field location to the ppw a much greater portion of the total capture time is spent at regions far from the wellbore far field where flow velocity is much slower and much less travel time will be spent at near field this means that the uniform flux approximation of a line sink which may cause some minor discrepancy for the near field flow velocity will not result some appreciable errors in terms of the overall capture time computation thus can be regarded as a secondary effect consider a single line sink of length l centered at r 0 z zc in a r z plane as shown in fig 7 the solution for head distribution h r z is 19 h r z q 4 π k l ln z z c l 2 r 2 z z c l 2 2 z z c l 2 r 2 z z c l 2 2 this equation describes the head changes at any location in an infinite aquifer caused by a line sink it is then differentiated to obtain the hydraulic head gradient and velocity field 20 v r k n e h r v z k n e h z 21 h r q r 4 π k l 1 a z z c l 2 a 1 b z z c l 2 b 22 h z q 4 π k l 1 a 1 b 23 a r 2 z z c l 2 2 b r 2 z z c l 2 2 where vr and vz are the r and z components of velocities respectively according to the principle of linear superposition the effect of upper and lower confining beds in a confined aquifer can be accounted for by adding infinite image wells as illustrated in fig 7 b thus the overall velocity can be determined by summing all the individual contributions from both real and image wells because all the wells are centered at r 0 but different zc thus when eqs 20 23 were applied to calculate the velocity only zc needs to be changed for different wells the bulk velocities vr and vz are shown below 24 v r n 1 n v r v z n 1 n v z theoretically the number n is infinite in practice however n becomes finite if we set an acceptable tolerance ε for the change of velocity we found that the tolerance ε equals to 10 7 worked well for most cases once the velocity field is available the capture time to a ppw can be calculated using the aforementioned runge kutta particle tracking method as well we denoted tlb as the capture time for the model with a lower boundary which is obtained by the runge kutta particle tracking method while tsi as the capture time calculated by the analytical solution in eq 12 for the semi infinite aquifer in addition we defined a variable εlb to measure the relative errors as shown in eq 25 if we use the proposed analytical solution to predict the capture time for confined aquifer model 25 ε lb t si t lb t lb as we have demonstrated before there exists monotonous linear relations between tsi and the pumping rate q and the effective porosity ne in addition tlb is inversely proportional to q and proportional to ne therefore εlb is independent of q and ne finally the degree of penetration l m became the only factor of concern fig 8 displays the εlb distribution in the r z plane for four penetration cases namely l m 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively both r and z range from 0 to m as shown in fig 8 for all the four cases the εlb is negative in the bottom left part which means tsi underestimates tlb in this area nevertheless tlb is overestimated in the right part with a larger horizontal distance r generally the area of underestimation decreases as the degree of penetration increases in the vicinity of wellbore the absolute value of relative error εlb is less than 5 indicating that the proposed analytical solution is more effective there in each plot the maximum negative εlb is at the bottom left corner 0 m showing that negative discrepancy increases as it approaches the lower boundary and the lower boundary is becoming more influential in addition a larger degree of penetration leads to a larger maximum negative εlb for example it is 0 3 in fig 8 a with the penetration l m 0 2 while it is 0 6 in fig 8 d with l m 0 8 5 4 comparison with point sink model a special kind of ppw is the with a zero penetration it was considered as a point sink with spherically converging flow towards it bear 1979 assuming that the well s bottom has the shape of a hemisphere of radius rw and the radius of influence of the well r rw we can obtain the steady state drawdown s as 26 s q 2 π k ρ where ρ r 2 z 2 ρ is the distance from a specified location r z to the point sink 0 0 if we denote tp as the capture time to the point sink model it can be calculated by 27 t p 0 ρ 0 d ρ v ρ n e k 0 ρ 0 d ρ d s d ρ on the basis of eq 27 we have d s d ρ q 2 π k ρ 2 substituting it into eq 27 one can obtain the expression of tp as 28 t p n e k 0 ρ 0 2 π k ρ 2 d ρ q 2 π n e q 0 ρ 0 ρ 2 d ρ 2 π n e 3 q ρ 0 3 where ρ 0 r 0 2 z 0 2 and r 0 z 0 is the position where the particle is released we evaluated the error of capture time if the analytical solution for a point sink model was used for a line sink in the following paragraphs to avoid misunderstanding we denoted tl as capture time to a line sink the analytical solution in eq 12 can be rewritten as 29 t l 2 π n e 3 q l l 2 z 0 3 λ 3 1 3 λ z 0 3 λ 2 a variable εpl was defined to evaluate the relative error when we substitute tp for tl as shown in eq 30 30 ε pl t p t l t l in terms of eqs 28 and 29 both tp and tl have linear relation with q and ne therefore εpt is independent of q and ne given a position with coordinate r 0 z 0 εpt is only determined by the screen length l hence we can adopt the dimensionless form r l and z l to analyze the εpt distribution fig 9 presents the distribution of relative error εpt in the dimensionless r z plane which can be divided into two parts tp underestimates tl in the top right part while tp overestimates tl in the bottom left part the maximum positive error occurs in vicinity of screen where the value of εpt is as high as more than a thousand which means tp is larger than a thousand times tl the maximum negative error is at the top left corner the εpt is almost 1 there in addition fig 9 illustrates that at a sufficiently large distance from the finite line sink the capture time distribution is the same as that of a point sink having the same total discharge specifically the relative error is less than 10 when the horizontal distance r is approximately larger than 3 5l or z is larger than 5 5l 5 5 limitations although the proposed analytical solution is simple and convenient for quick estimation of capture time several limitations are worth noting for consideration in future investigations first of all the well radius is not explicitly included in the mathematical model and the skin effect was ignored for practical application finite well radius and thickness of the skin zone need to be considered ataie ashtiani et al 2012 in addition the analytical solution in this study is not appropriate if the ppw is not screened from the top confining layer of aquifer a further limitation of the analytical solution exists due to the assumption that the influence of regional groundwater flow was ignored therefore it should not be used for situations where the regional flow is strong the steady state assumption used for conducting the capture time computation also deserves some discussion this assumption is based on a few considerations first the capture time computation is most effective in assessing the long term flow and solute advective transport near a pumping well thus steady state flow condition is likely to be established near a pumping well one thing to note is that the steady state condition used in this study only concerns the flow velocity which does not change with time it does not require the hydraulic head to be constant with time in fact in a confined aquifer near a constant rate pumping well the hydraulic head will constantly change with time in a uniform fashion after a sufficiently long time of pumping but the flow velocity becomes independent of time the reason for this is because the flow velocity only depends on the hydraulic gradient not the hydraulic head itself therefore as long as the hydraulic head at different locations varies with time in the same fashion the hydraulic gradient can remain independent of time some previous studies have called such a condition i e flow velocity is independent of time but hydraulic head can vary with time in a uniform fashion as quasi steady state wen et al 2006 zhan and bian 2006 wen et al 2009 second the potential theory which involves potential function streamline function capture zone and capture time is based on the laplace equation eq 1 with a presumption of steady state flow this theory becomes much less effective and even awkward when flow is transient or flow velocity depends on time that is because the potential function streamline function and the size and shape of the capture zone are all continuously changing with time thus the computation of capture time can only be approximated in a sequence of time steps during each time step the flow may be regarded as quasi steady state and the concepts of potential function can be used in an approximate manner however when moving to the next time step a new quasi steady state flow condition has to be used and the potential function has to be updated all of this will make the analytical treatment tedious and awkward thus numerical simulations rather than analytical methods are probably preferred when flow is transient 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the capture time to a partially penetrating well in a semi infinite aquifer under the steady state flow condition an analytical solution was developed and then compared with particle tracking method in an example case the analytical results agree very well with those by the particle tracking method in addition the analytical solution for anisotropic medium was developed by scaling of coordinates the analytical solution was further investigated from three aspects first the impacts of different parameters on the capture time were analyzed results are the capture time t is irrelevant to hydraulic conductivity k and is inversely proportional to pumping rate q while directly proportional to effective porosity ne the impact of screen length l on t is depending on the location for particle releasing in general t decreases with l where the vertical distance z is larger than horizontal distance r while t increases with l where the r is larger z specifically the effect of anisotropic ratio a 2 on t is spatially dependent as well second the influence of the lower boundary was investigated through the relative error which was defined to measure the difference between the analytical solution for semi infinite aquifer and the particle tracking method result for the confined with finite thickness conclusions can be drawn as a larger degree of penetration leads to larger discrepancy which indicates the lower boundary is more influential as penetration increases in the vicinity of well the proposed analytical solution is effective to predict capture time in confined aquifer with relative error less than 5 third analytical solution for the point sink model with zero penetration was compared if it was adopted for the usual ppw results indicate that the relative error of capture time is less than 10 when r is approximately larger than 3 5l or z is larger than 5 5l declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

5961,a better understanding of responses of the regional water energy cycle to land use cover change lucc is important for ecological restoration in the agro pastoral ecotone northwest china apenwc in this study we examined the responses to various types of lucc in the apenwc during the implementation of the grain for green project between 1993 and 2010 using the weather research and forecasting wrf model the performance of the wrf model was validated by multiple types of observations results show that the wrf can accurately simulate regional water and energy processes in the apenwc and that the water energy cycles in the region are strongly affected by vegetation dynamics during the period of 1993 and 2010 the most obviously increased land cover types were the grassland and barren land and the decreased land cover types were shrublands and croplands in the study region a significantly negative correlation r2 0 78 between land surface temperature lst and albedo was found associated with a 0 5 c reduction in the annual mean surface temperature in the apenwc between 1993 and 2010 negative correlations between changes in evapotranspiration et and albedo during the period in all seasons were also detected except summer when the correlation was positive r2 0 49 this is attributed to transpiration from plants being the main contributor to et in summer and hence total et the changes resulted in an increase of et by 19 79 mm in summer and decreases of et by 1 15 mm 13 22 mm and 0 96 mm respectively in spring fall and winter the lucc also resulted in reductions in precipitation of 2 3 7 31 and 7 8 mm in spring summer and fall respectively by altering local et and vapor flux cycles in the apenwc and the study region contributed additional moisture from the local et into the north of the region the findings show that the grassland expansion reduces mean land surface temperature which will delay germination of seeds and initiation of vegetation growth in spring increases in seasonal et and reductions in seasonal precipitation will lead to soil drying exacerbating risks of summer drought in the apenwc the findings provide important information in facilitating formulation of effective strategies for sustainable development and ecological restoration in the apenwc and similar regions keywords land use cover change land surface temperature evapotranspiration

use cover change lucc has become a focal point of global change roy and avissar 2002 foley 2005 rigden and li 2017 studies have demonstrated that lucc is a main driver of regional climate change bounoua et al 2002 pielke et al 2011 it can directly alter land surface properties such as surface albedo ground roughness soil heat and moisture which have important effects on surface water energy

on surface hydrological processes bai et al 2018 legesse et al 2003 lejeune et al 2014 mao and cherkauer 2009 mohan and kandya 2015 wijesekara et al 2012 and land atmosphere interaction huang and margulis 2010 pielke et al 2011 studies have indicated that surface vegetation change significantly affects the surface hydrological processes and water energy cycle zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2016b cheng et al 2017 for example qiao et al 2017 found that woody plant encroachment reduces annual runoff and shifts runoff mechanisms deforestation increases catchment erosion and nutrient annual discharges and surface runoff woodward et al 2014 guzha et al 2018 these studies indicate that the impacts of lucc vary over space and different climate and environmental conditions lucc alters water and energy exchanges between the atmosphere and land surface and strongly influences weather and climate over local and regional scales orlowsky and seneviratne 2010 zabel et al 2011 harding et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 gao and wu 2014 zhang et al 2015 boone et al 2016 one of the most important surface parameters is albedo the ability of land surface to reflect solar radiation this is a major determinant of energy fluxes at the land surface and its changes can significantly change land surface temperature and regional energy balance liu et al 2014 mohan and kandya 2015 qu et al 2013 land surface temperature lst is a key parameter for radiation and heat fluxes at the land surface atmosphere interface which are largely controlled by the difference between the lst and near surface air temperature liu et al 2016a its effects have been extensively studied in relation to weather forecasting climate change hydrological cycles and agricultural processes deng et al 2018 zhang and liang 2018 changes in lst have clear effects on regional et dias et al 2015 and et in turn significantly influences soil moisture conditions by changing the surface energy distribution zhao et al 2008 as a major component of both hydrological cycles and the surface energy balance et has also been affected in recent years by anthropogenic lucc and climate change li et al 2017 as an important source of precipitation in hydrological cycles changes in et and vapor flux transportation also significantly affect local precipitation patterns hagos et al 2014 wang et al 2016 xue et al 2010 since lst et and precipitation are all extremely sensitive to lucc li et al 2017 wang et al 2015b assessment of lucc s effects on these factors is crucial for deep understanding of surface water and energy exchange processes precipitation is an important resource for maintaining the sustainable development of agriculture and other related socio economic activities in the agro pastoral ecotone northwest china apenwc generally there are two sources of precipitation in a region 1 water vapor evaporated within the region and 2 water vapor transported into the region from outside brubaker et al 1993 the response of precipitation to lucc is a higher percentage of the precipitation from the water vapor evaporated within the region zhao et al 2016 and wei et al 2012 indicated that the local water cycles have most contribution to the precipitation over northwest china the relationships between local et precipitable water and precipitation recycling may be good indicators of regional hydrological variations zhang et al 2012a bagley et al 2014 hu and dominguez 2015 thus identifying and investigating the variation of precipitation processes due to lucc is crucial for understanding the regional hydrological cycle land atmosphere feedback and extreme weather events such as droughts liu et al 2015 this in turn is essential for understanding exchanges of heat moisture and momentum in the atmospheric boundary layer the interactions between the land surface and overlying atmosphere boundary layer take place within a fully coupled land atmosphere system where the states temperature moisture content of the air and land surface can strongly influence one another huang and margulis 2010 qin and xie 2017 xia et al 2019 the surface water and energy exchange processes of ecological transition zones are especially sensitive to lucc cao et al 2015 thus these regions are ideal locations to study the effects of lucc on regional climate the agro pastoral ecotone in arid and semi arid northwest china faces many ecological problems including sparse vegetation frequent sandstorms overgrazing soil erosion and ecosystem degradations chen et al 2008 wu et al 2013a since 1998 chinese government has initiated several large scale reforestation programs such as grain for green and northern china s vegetation belt programs to return cropland to grassland and forestland the apenwc has been experiencing a large scale change in land cover huang et al 2007 wu et al 2013b wei et al 2018 as a result surface vegetation change has had strong effects on surface water and energy exchange processes liu et al 2011 indicated a decrease in precipitation in most parts of the farming pastoral ecotone of northern china over the last 50 years zhao et al 2017 found that the seasonal mean et of cropland is greater than that of grassland from 2009 to 2013 in the agro pastoral ecotone of northern china furthermore there are also strong spatial temporal variations in surface water and energy factors due to complex land atmospheric feedback effects on local climate and hydrological process associated with intense landscape heterogeneity huang and margulis 2010 2011 bryan et al 2015 over the last 50 years meteorological records have shown a rise in temperature and decrease in precipitation in most parts of the agro pastoral ecotone of northern china the agrarian sector went through a series of reforms and changes in government policies on land use have led to extensive changes in land cover liu et al 2011 li et al 2015 zhou et al 2013 many studies examined how different land use cover patterns affected summer temperature in the agro pastoral ecotone of northern china cao et al 2015 wei et al 2018 and the response of crop water consumption to a warming trend and a reduction of precipitation from 1960 to 2007 zhao et al 2013 feng et al 2012 studied the spatial and temporal effects of a large ecological restoration project on water yield across the loess plateau region in northern china in this dynamic heterogeneous agro pastoral ecosystem cropland grassland shrub lands and artificial forests constantly change back and forth the surface water energy exchanges are more complex and dynamic but poorly understood little is done on how lucc affects energy balance and water cycle and land surface atmosphere interactions at the regional scale in the apenwc in addition in the arid and semi arid region of china ground meteorological observatory sites are sparsely distributed it is a challenge to obtain high resolution spatial and temporal weather and land surface observation data some high resolution data can be obtained from satellite based sensors such as the moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer modis and soil moisture active passive smap sensors however such data only provide snapshots of conditions during the transit of the satellites regional climate models are potentially effective tools for understanding spatial temporal distributions of the key local land surface atmosphere interactions gao et al 2017 silverman et al 2013 wagner et al 2016 xia et al 2017 however previous studies show that simplified general circulation models cannot fully simulate fine scale land surface and atmospheric states and often do not accurately capture the detailed diurnal land atmosphere interactions thus huang and margulis 2010 advocated use of a fully coupled land surface model and atmosphere boundary layer model for exploring land atmosphere interactions more accurately in recent years a state of the art regional weather research and forecasting model wrf has been increasingly used to dynamically downscale general circulation model results to spatial resolutions of around 10 40 km and simulate land surface atmosphere interactions numerical research has indicated that the model can effectively simulate land surface water and energy exchange processes wan and xu 2011 wen et al 2012 yuan et al 2017 in this study we fill a gap in our understanding of response of regional water and energy cycles to lucc in agro pastoral ecotone northwest china the objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate the performance of a wrf model in the study region 2 to determine changes of key surface water energy factors lst et and precipitation caused by the lucc and 3 to assess the role of lst et and precipitation in land atmosphere interactions in the agro pastoral ecotone northwest china 2 methodology and materials 2 1 study area the apenwc extends from ca 106 228 e to 110 903 e and 36 816 n to 40 194 n fig 1 it is a semiarid region with an annual average relative humidity of 13 and mean annual precipitation of 250 450 mm main land cover types include grassland farmland forest and shrub land and desert and dynamic conversion between grassland and farmland occurs frequently wei et al 2018 it is one of the world s largest ecotones highly sensitive to changes in climate conditions and surface physical properties cao et al 2015 there have been serious historical and recent environmental changes in the apenwc including grassland degradation desertification and biodiversity loss li et al 2018 wang et al 2015a since 1998 the chinese government has implemented numerous policies and programs to restore ecosystems and improve environmental protection such as the large scale grain for green program the three north shelter forest program and beijing tianjin sand source control program returning cropland to grassland and forest land huang et al 2007 wu et al 2013b since 2000 significant lucc has taken place in the apenwc fu et al 2011 indicated that the area of woodland and grassland had increased 4 3 and 6 6 respectively during 2000 2008 farmland had decreased about 10 8 during the same period meanwhile area of desert and residential area increased 0 3 and 8 5 respectively however little has been done to assess the impacts of the lucc on energy and water exchange processes and water cycles in the region thus this study aims to better understand effects of these large scale ecosystem rehabilitation programs and lucc on regional water energy exchange processes 2 2 model description the wrf model was developed collaboratively by the us national center for atmospheric research ncar and national centers for environmental prediction ncep the wrf is a next generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction

boundary layer schemes in addition land surface models lsms compute heat and moisture fluxes over the surface providing lower boundaries for atmospheric models a detailed description of the model can be obtained at http www mmm ucar edu wrf users the non hydrostatic wrf version 3 8 1 modeling system was used in this study 2 3 model configuration and experimental design the simulation domain is shown in fig 1 a single nested grid system is used in this study the domain is centered at 38 5 n and 108 e with dimensions of 60 60 horizontal grid points with spacing of 10 km the 6 h 0 5 0 5 ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr https rda ucar edu datasets ds093 0 from the ncep provided initial and lateral boundary conditions for the wrf model in order to evaluate the performance of wrf model and obtain a suite of optimal physical schemes for the wrf to best simulate land surface processes in the arid region of northwestern china we conducted a series of wrf testing runs using its sixteen microphysics four cumulus and six planetary boundary layer schemes to identify the optimal suite schemes for our domain sensitivity tests were first conducted covering june october 2010 using standardized deviations sds correlation coefficient and root mean square errors rmses to compare precipitation and temperature patterns after obtaining the optimal physical schemes of simulation through test experiments we re ran the wrf model by changing the land use data of the model fig 2 the simulation time began at 1200 utc september 1 2009 and ended at 1200 utc december 31 2010 the first three months from september 1 2009 to november 30 2009 were considered as spin up time and therefore excluded from the analysis we carried out two simulation experiments to look into the response of surface water and energy to lucc two land use cover datasets were used in the experiment from september 1 2009 to december 31 2010 exp1993 1993 land use cover data and exp2010 2010 land use cover data were used in the experiments two simulations used the same schemes and climate driven data 2 4 validation datasets in order to verify and evaluate the simulation results we selected five national weather stations dongsheng henshan yulin dingbian and etuoke banner stations data set provided by china meteorological administration http data cma cn in our study area to verify simulated 2 m air temperature and precipitation and modis land products were selected to validate land surface temperature https lpdaac usgs gov dataset discovery modis the modis land surface temperature product is an 8 daily composite including daytime and nighttime configured onto a 0 05 5 6 km latitude longitude grid furthermore china meteorological forcing dataset http westdc westgis ac cn was chosen for collaborative evaluation 2 5 model evaluation criteria to assess the model s performance in terms of the fit between observed and simulated data we used three criteria advocated by taylor 2001 moriasi et al 2007 and gleckler et al 2008 the correlation coefficient r standard deviation sd and normalized standard deviation nsd 1 r i 1 n x i obs x i obs x i sim x i sim i 1 n x i obs x i obs 2 i 1 n x i sim x i sim 2 2 sd 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 3 nsd s d sim s d obs here x i obs and x i sim are the observed and simulated values for month or year i while x i obs and x i sim are the average observed and simulated data during the simulation period s d obs and s d sim are the observed and simulated values of standard deviation sd 2 6 the vertical integrated water vapor flux to evaluate the impacts of moisture transportation on precipitation in the apenwc the precipitable water and vertically integrated horizontal water vapor fluxes were calculated by the following equation 4 w 1 g p surface 200 h p a q d p 5 q 1 g p surface 200 h p a vq d p where w and q are the precipitable water and vertically integrated water vapor flux q g psurface and v represent the specific humidity gravity surface pressure and horizontal wind vector respectively zhang et al 2017 2 7 model evaluation in this study we focus on three categories of the physical parameterization schemes the microphysics planetary boundary layer and cumulus schemes all of which are directly related to regional water and energy exchanges rajeevan et al 2010 ács et al 2014 teixeira et al 2014 fig 3 shows taylor diagrams for rainfall and 2 m air temperatures the arcs in the diagrams show correlation coefficients while the horizontal and vertical axes indicate the ratio of the standard deviation sd of the simulated data to the observations all simulations show high correlation coefficients 0 8 0 95 for 2 m air temperatures but the simulated precipitation is sensitive to all physics schemes with normalized standardized deviations of 0 5 0 8 and correlation coefficients of 0 3 0 8 we selected a set of physical options for the wrf model based on comparisons of the simulation outputs with the recorded 2 m air temperature and rainfall data fig 4 the planetary boundary layer processes were resolved with the uw university of washington boundary layer scheme from cam5 cesm 1 0 1 the microphysics was described with the thompson scheme new for v3 1 and the cumulus clouds was simulated with a newer tiedtke scheme the rapid radiative transfer model rrtm and dudhia shortwave radiation scheme were used to calculate long wave and short wave radiation and their transfer within the atmosphere respectively the community land model version 4 clm4 adapted from cam with 10 soil layers was used to simulate land surface processes within the wrf after selecting the above options we re ran wrf model with simulation time beginning at 12 00 september 1 2009 and ending at 12 00 december 31 2010 fig 4 shows the temporal variation and scatter diagram for precipitation and land surface temperature 2 m air temperature the coefficients of determination r2 values for monthly accumulated precipitation and air surface temperature are 0 71 and 0 9 according to the scatter diagram the simulation results show a higher consistency with the observed values in the temporal pattern of temperature and precipitation the results indicate that the wrf model can accurately simulate regional water and energy processes in the apenwc 3 results 3 1 lucc from 1993 to 2010 the generated lucc matrix and associated changes in land cover assigned to specific land use categories in the study period in the apenwc are shown in table 1 fig 2 shows the distribution of the land cover in 1993 left and 2010 right and table 2 shows changes in areas of land use categories from 1993 to 2010 based on the changes of land use cover listed in table 1 in the apenwc the most obviously increased land cover types were the grasslands and barren land increasing by 8 22 and 13 22 respectively as a result of conversion from croplands with 5 86 and shrublands with 12 49 into grasslands and from shrublands with 13 01 into barren or sparsely vegetated land the total croplands decreased by 5 06 and shrublands decreased by 17 25 tables 1 and 2 3 2 land surface temperature response as discussed above the energy and water exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere e g sensible and latent heat fluxes are largely controlled by the difference between the land surface temperature and near surface air temperature hagos et al 2014 cao et al 2015 boone et al 2016 due to the lack of regional scale surface temperature records for northwest china previous studies on effects of land use change on surface temperature in the region have generally relied on remote sensing data however such data only provide snapshots of conditions during the transit of satellites and thus provide limited indication of temporal patterns of surface temperature therefore we ran the wrf model with two land use data sets of 1993 and 2010 as inputs to eliminate the influence of external conditions and isolated changes in surface temperature directly caused by the lucc spatially averaged seasonal differences in simulated lst between exp1993 and exp2010 d ts lst2010 lst1993 fig 5 were 0 45 0 99 0 24 and 0 33 c in spring mam march april may mam summer jja june july august jja fall son september october november son and winter djf december january february djf respectively the minimum and maximum differences were 3 57 and 1 40 c respectively in summer as can be seen in fig 5 due to the transformation of a large area of shrublands into grassland the average monthly lst in this area decreased especially in spring and summer and in both seasons the lst was clearly higher in barren land than in grassland the spatial distribution of lst indicates that the strongest reductions in temperature were in areas where shrublands were transformed into grasslands but this trend was weak or non existent in winter conversely the strongest increases were in areas where grasslands were transformed into shrublands or barren land in summer the lst time series indicate that the daily surface temperature was maximal and minimal at approximately 1400 and 0500 respectively to improve our understanding of effects of changes in albedo on lst we plotted the relationship between changes in lst d ts ts2010 ts1993 and albedo d albedo albedo2010 albedo1993 for all grid points within the regions fig 6 the results show a significant negative correlation with r2 values of 0 91 0 94 0 85 and 0 43 in spring summer fall and winter respectively as shown in fig 7 the simulations indicate a clear tendency for the annual mean surface temperature to decline during the study period due to increases in albedo 3 3 evapotranspiration response et an important element of both the hydrological cycle and surface energy balance is affected by changes in both lucc and climate here we only consider the effects of the lucc by keeping the atmospheric forcing field constant thereby isolating effects of the lucc on et the spatial distribution of seasonal difference in et between the two simulations d et et2010 et1993 is shown in fig 8 the spatially weighted averaged differences of all grids are 1 15 19 79 13 22 and 0 96 mm for spring summer fall and winter respectively conversion of shrublands to grasslands resulted in an increase in et in summer and a decrease in fall conversely conversion of grassland to shrublands resulted in a decrease in et in summer as shown in fig 9 we also found that differences in evapotranspiration d et et2010 et1993 and albedo d albedo albedo2010 albedo1993 in the two simulations for all grid points within the region were negatively correlated in spring fall and winter r2 values 0 13 0 72 and 0 14 respectively however they were significantly positively correlated in summer r2 0 49 3 4 precipitation response the seasonal precipitation and vertically integrated water vapor simulation are shown in fig 10 the simulated precipitation was concentrated in the east of the region and most of the moisture came from the west in spring mam in summer jja precipitation is mainly concentrated in the southeast the majority of the moisture came from the south the greater east asian monsoon and indian ocean monsoon become the major moisture source in fall son the precipitation pattern was similar to the spring pattern and the majority of the moisture came from the west and southwest in winter djf the pattern of moisture sources was similar to the spring pattern but there was very little precipitation to better understand precipitation s response to the lucc seasonal moisture sources must be characterized thus we investigated the seasonal changes in moisture sources and compared their differences during spring summer fall and winter fig 11 shows differences in the spatial distributions of simulated seasonal precipitation during the four seasons with vectors representing the differences in seasonal vertically integrated water vapor fluxes as can be seen from the fig 11 precipitation is very sensitive to the lucc with spatially averaged differences of 2 30 7 31 and 7 80 mm in spring summer and fall respectively but no difference in winter when there was extremely little precipitation in the region the differences in vertically integrated seasonal water vapor flux can help us identify regions that contributed most to the changes in moisture transport generally the more moisture is transported into a region the more moisture source contributes to the precipitation over the region and vice versa zhang et al 2017 from fig 10 the moisture over the region came mainly from the westerlies east asian monsoon and indian ocean monsoon however from fig 11 according to the difference in the moisture between the two simulations exp2010 exp1993 and comparing the fig 10 the moisture over the region declined in spring mam the moisture came from the westerlies decreased in the west of the region but this change is very weak in summer jja the moisture from the east asian monsoon and indian ocean monsoon decreased in the south of the region however in the north the moisture increased and the area within the apenwc contributed greatly to providing the extra moisture transported into the north of the region in fall son the pattern was similar to the spring pattern and the moisture from the west decreased in the west of the region but there is an increase in the east of the region negative differences in the moisture flux mean more moisture was transported away from the region resulting in reduced in moisture in areas within the region there are many connections between land surface characteristics and water cycle from the perspective of atmospheric moisture balance the reduction in precipitation is a result of changes in local surface et and atmospheric moisture convergence wei et al 2016 fig 12 shows the relationship between precipitation change and the change in et the points in fig 12 would fall on the lines of 1 1 if all the precipitation change is explained by changes in et however this was not the case and coefficients of determination between d precipitation and d et were 0 349 0 001 0 260 and 0 063 in spring summer fall and winter respectively these findings show that et was not the only factor that affected precipitation and the lucc affects availability of moisture not only through changes in et but also more importantly through changes in atmosphere circulation and vapor flux transport hagos et al 2014 hua et al 2016 guo et al 2018 4 discussion in this study we first determined the optimal suite of wrf physics schemes by sensitivity tests we then used 6 h 0 5 0 5 ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr data and land use products of 1993 and 2010 to drive wrf simulations of land surface water and energy exchange processes associated with the different land use and land cover types in the apenwc from september 2009 to december 2010 results of the sensitivity analysis and comparison of simulations and observations clearly show that the wrf model can accurately simulate regional water and energy processes in the study region in addition data presented in fig 2 and tables 1 and 2 show that land use and land cover changed substantially between 1993 and 2010 in the region the strongest changes were increases in grasslands and barren or sparsely vegetated land with accompanying reductions in croplands associated with the large scale national grain for green program then we analyzed responses of surface water and energy cycles to the lucc in the region 4 1 energy cycle the water and energy exchange processes combine the water and energy transfer of surface vegetation soil and atmospheric boundary layer into a whole are the focus and hotspot of current earth system science research in our study we analyzed the response of surface temperature evapotranspiration and precipitation to the land use and land cover change our analysis of responses of surface temperature et and precipitation to the lucc show that the lucc affected surface temperatures by altering the land surface albedo which strongly influences energy fluxes between land surfaces and the atmosphere as increases in albedo reduce the energy available for turbulent fluxes of heat and moisture across the boundary boone et al 2016 hence in parts of the region where shrublands were transformed into grasslands land surface temperature decreased and vice versa surface temperature is an important determinant of sensible and latent heat fluxes and thus amounts of energy that are vertically transported into the ground sohrabinia et al 2012 changes in surface temperature also influence local et et is an important component of both the hydrological cycle and surface energy balance previous studies have shown that lucc affects et by changing water energy factors such as air temperature wind speed and relative humidity dias et al 2015 li et al 2017 olchev et al 2008 in general et in a region has two main contributors 1 soil evaporation and or water body and 2 vegetation transpiration interception within the region in the apenwc the shrublands belong to open shrublands its coverage is less than 20 but when the shrublands transformed into grassland the grassland coverage is 60 90 or even more in spring and winter due to low temperature short sunshine durations and dormant vegetation soil evaporation is the main contributor of the total et in the study region thus et is low and the variation is very small however when the shrublands transformed into grasslands in summer et is much higher and largely derived from plant transpiration and interception evaporation which accounts for most of the total et besides summer is the rainy season in the apenwc due to shrub s root architecture higher and deeper infiltration and lateral redistribution of water existed beneath shrublands as compared with grassland in the shrublands rainfall partition induced by shrub s root architecture results in preferential water flow into deep soil layer compared with grassland li et al 2013 however in arid semi arid areas et is limited mostly by soil water li et al 2016 summer rainfall causes the shrublands soil to store more water in deeper soil in the fall soil evaporation is greater in open shrublands compared with grassland but in areas where shrublands were transformed into grasslands the grasses withered causing major drops in plant transpiration and inhibition of soil evaporation in the fall therefore the total et sharply decreased compared with shrublands 4 2 water budget increases in et and reductions in precipitation will lead to soil drying and may exacerbate droughts in summer across the region feng et al 2012 found that water yield in 38 of the loess plateau area might have decreased 1 48 mm per year as a result of lucc zhang et al 2012b indicated that the region located in the upper reaches of the yellow river experienced upward trends in the total drought area in addition liu et al 2016b found that the southwest of the loess plateau has a significant increasing trend of drought severity based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index the increase in drought area may cause damage to agricultural production and regional food security our finding is similar to those found in the loess plateau and the upper reaches of the yellow river basin in northwest china knowledge of the spatial temporal distribution of water is crucial for the sustainable development of agriculture and other socio economic activities hagos et al 2014 precipitation is the main source of moisture in the apenwc and our results show that the potential feedback of the lucc on local climate may have reduced precipitation to study luuc s effects on precipitation in detail we first considered et and water vapor transportation fig 13 a shows various fluxes associated with precipitation processes in the apenwc in general precipitation p has two sources in a region 1 water vapor evaporated within the region contributed to precipitation called recycled precipitation pr and 2 water vapor transported into the region from outside contributed precipitation called advective precipitation pa so the p is the sum of pa and pr the upward evaporative flux is represented by e and inflow and outflow of advective moisture is represented by fin and fout respectively in our two experiments we changed land use data of the wrf model and control fin to remain unchanged subsequent analysis revealed a positive correlation between changes in precipitation and et with r2 values of 0 394 0 001 0 260 and 0 063 in spring summer fall and winter respectively indicating that et makes a contribution to precipitation in the region and the lucc changes recycled precipitation pr the ratio of precipitation contributed from water vapor evaporated within the region pr versus the total precipitation p is known as the precipitation recycling ratio prr this ratio indicates the importance of the interactions between the atmosphere and land surface and is an indicator of general climatic sensitivity to lucc brubaker et al 1993 dominguez et al 2006 eltahir and bras 2010 fig 13b shows the temporal variability of prr in the apenwc the prr is 0 15 0 46 and averaged prr is 0 273 and 0 268 in different land use data experiment of 1993 and 2010 implying that about 27 averaged two prr of the precipitation comes from the local et the other 73 from the external water vapor inflow in order to further understand how lucc affects precipitation processes we considered the primary mechanism of moisture transport the greater east asian monsoon indian ocean monsoon the local and nearby sources in the westerlies were the main moisture contributors to the precipitation in our study region fig 10 based on our simulations however due to grain for green and northern china s vegetation belt programs the apenwc has been experiencing a large scale change in land use cover in summer moisture from these sources decreased in the south of the region fig 11c but in the north the moisture increased and areas within the apenwc strongly contributed to the additional moisture transported into the north in summary surface et and atmospheric moisture from external water vapor inflows play important roles in precipitation processes and the atmospheric moisture balance in the region and the lucc strongly affected both processes the results show that the impacts of lucc on regional water energy cycle are significant but the impacts of lucc on regional land surface water energy cycle and its variations are still under investigation and not fully understood researches have also indicated possible teleconnections between regional lucc and climate over remote areas hasler et al 2009 snyder 2010 mahmood et al 2014 for example the deforestation leads to a regional warming in low latitude but a cooling effect in high latitude claussen et al 2001 snyder et al 2004 2010 cui et al 2006 indicated that the impacts of lucc on the east asian atmospheric circulation and monsoon precipitation in tibet plateau sen et al 2004 also reported that deforestation has an effect of weakening of the monsoon flow over the tibetan plateau and eastern china thus the teleconnections should be further investigated to understand their impacts on water and energy cycles 4 3 limitations and future research in the study we evaluated the performance of wrf simulation using observed temperature and precipitation data it is important to note limitations associated with uncertainties in the model which inevitably affect the accuracy of regional outputs for example because landscape heterogeneity what spatial resolution is best in simulating the land surface processes over regional scale remains a challenge in the study region in addition surface water energy exchange processes are complex and cannot be directly monitored although our results show that the lucc substantially affected water and energy exchange in the apenwc thus precise description of land surface properties is important for rigorous and accurate numerical modeling simulations future studies need to consider these issues in simulating effects of the lucc on land surface processes in the study region 5 conclusions in this work we have used a state of the art regional climate model wrf model to simulate regional water and energy processes associated with land use and cover in the arid apenwc between 1993 and 2010 we first evaluated the model s performance for the region and then assessed responses of regional water energy processes to the lucc our main finding are as follows 1 the wrf model can accurately simulate regional water and energy processes in the agro pastoral ecotone 2 land use cover changed substantially between 1993 and 2010 in the study area the strongest changes were increases in grasslands and barren or sparsely vegetated land associated with the chinese government s large scale grain for green program 3 expansion of grasslands reduces energy available for turbulent fluxes of heat mean surface temperature and hence soil evaporation spatially averaged et decreased in spring fall and winter but increased in summer this is because et derived from transpiration in summer accounts for most total et but in other seasons grass is withered plant transpiration rates are very low and withered vegetation inhibits soil evaporation 4 the greater east asian monsoon indian ocean monsoon together with local and nearby sources in the westerlies were found to be the most important contributors of moisture to the precipitation response of precipitation to the lucc is extremely sensitive which has reduced precipitation in the region the differences in the simulated moisture fluxes also indicate that moisture over this region declined which means the study region contributed additional moisture from the local et into the north of the region the results suggest that land cover change especially expansion of grasslands have reduced land surface temperature in the apenwc increases in et and reductions in precipitation will lead to soil drying and may exacerbate droughts in summer across the region the findings provides useful information for formulating optimal strategies for animal husbandry ecological restoration and sustainable development in the apenwc and similar regions credit authorship contribution statement xuejin wang data

5961,a better understanding of responses of the regional water energy cycle to land use cover change lucc is important for ecological restoration in the agro pastoral ecotone northwest china apenwc in this study we examined the responses to various types of lucc in the apenwc during the implementation of the grain for green project between 1993 and 2010 using the weather research and forecasting wrf model the performance of the wrf model was validated by multiple types of observations results show that the wrf can accurately simulate regional water and energy processes in the apenwc and that the water energy cycles in the region are strongly affected by vegetation dynamics during the period of 1993 and 2010 the most obviously increased land cover types were the grassland and barren land and the decreased land cover types were shrublands and croplands in the study region a significantly negative correlation r2 0 78 between land surface temperature lst and albedo was found associated with a 0 5 c reduction in the annual mean surface temperature in the apenwc between 1993 and 2010 negative correlations between changes in evapotranspiration et and albedo during the period in all seasons were also detected except summer when the correlation was positive r2 0 49 this is attributed to transpiration from plants being the main contributor to et in summer and hence total et the changes resulted in an increase of et by 19 79 mm in summer and decreases of et by 1 15 mm 13 22 mm and 0 96 mm respectively in spring fall and winter the lucc also resulted in reductions in precipitation of 2 3 7 31 and 7 8 mm in spring summer and fall respectively by altering local et and vapor flux cycles in the apenwc and the study region contributed additional moisture from the local et into the north of the region the findings show that the grassland expansion reduces mean land surface temperature which will delay germination of seeds and initiation of vegetation growth in spring increases in seasonal et and reductions in seasonal precipitation will lead to soil drying exacerbating risks of summer drought in the apenwc the findings provide important information in facilitating formulation of effective strategies for sustainable development and ecological restoration in the apenwc and similar regions keywords land use cover change land surface temperature evapotranspiration

margulis 2010 pielke et al 2011 studies have indicated that surface vegetation change significantly affects the surface hydrological processes and water energy cycle zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2016b cheng et al 2017 for example qiao et al 2017 found that woody plant encroachment reduces annual runoff and shifts runoff mechanisms deforestation increases catchment erosion and nutrient annual discharges and surface runoff woodward et al 2014 guzha et al 2018 these studies indicate that the impacts of lucc vary over space and different climate and environmental conditions lucc alters water and energy exchanges between the atmosphere and land surface and strongly influences weather and climate over local and regional scales orlowsky and seneviratne 2010 zabel et al 2011 harding et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 gao and wu 2014 zhang et al 2015 boone et al 2016 one of the most important surface parameters is albedo the ability of land surface to reflect solar radiation this is a major determinant of energy fluxes at the land surface and its changes can significantly change land surface temperature and regional energy balance liu et al 2014 mohan and kandya 2015 qu et al 2013 land surface temperature lst is a key parameter for radiation and heat fluxes at the land surface atmosphere interface which are largely controlled by the difference between the lst and near surface air temperature liu et al 2016a its effects have been extensively studied in relation to weather forecasting climate change hydrological cycles and agricultural processes deng et al 2018 zhang and liang 2018 changes in lst have clear effects on regional et dias et al 2015 and et in turn significantly influences soil moisture conditions by changing the surface energy distribution zhao et al 2008 as a major component of both hydrological cycles and the surface energy balance et has also been affected in recent years by anthropogenic lucc and climate change li et al 2017 as an important source of precipitation in hydrological cycles changes in et and vapor flux transportation also significantly affect local precipitation patterns hagos et al 2014 wang et al 2016 xue et al 2010 since lst et and precipitation are all extremely sensitive to lucc li et al 2017 wang et al 2015b assessment of lucc s effects on these factors is crucial for deep understanding of surface water and energy exchange processes precipitation is an important resource for maintaining the sustainable development of agriculture and other related socio economic activities in the agro pastoral ecotone northwest china apenwc generally there are two sources of precipitation in a region 1 water vapor evaporated within the region and 2 water vapor transported into the region from outside brubaker et al 1993 the response of precipitation to lucc is a higher percentage of the precipitation from the water vapor evaporated within the region zhao et al 2016 and wei et al 2012 indicated that the local water cycles have most contribution to the precipitation over northwest china the relationships between local et precipitable water and precipitation recycling may be good indicators of regional hydrological variations zhang et al 2012a bagley et al 2014 hu and dominguez 2015 thus identifying and investigating the variation of precipitation processes due to lucc is crucial for understanding the regional hydrological cycle land atmosphere feedback and extreme weather events such as droughts liu et al 2015 this in turn is essential for understanding exchanges of heat moisture and momentum in the atmospheric boundary layer the interactions between the land surface and overlying atmosphere boundary layer take place within a fully coupled land atmosphere system where the states temperature moisture content of the air and land surface can strongly influence one another huang and margulis 2010 qin and xie 2017 xia et al 2019 the surface water and energy exchange processes of ecological transition zones are especially sensitive to lucc cao et al 2015 thus these regions are ideal locations to study the effects of lucc on regional climate the agro pastoral ecotone in arid and semi arid northwest china faces many ecological problems including sparse vegetation frequent sandstorms overgrazing soil erosion and ecosystem degradations chen et al 2008 wu et al 2013a since 1998 chinese government has initiated several large scale reforestation programs such as grain for green and northern china s vegetation belt programs to return cropland to grassland and forestland the apenwc has been experiencing a large scale change in land cover huang et al 2007 wu et al 2013b wei et al 2018 as a result surface vegetation change has had strong effects on surface water and energy exchange processes liu et al 2011 indicated a decrease in precipitation in most parts of the farming pastoral ecotone of northern china over the last 50 years zhao et al 2017 found that the seasonal mean et of cropland is greater than that of grassland from 2009 to 2013 in the agro pastoral ecotone of northern china furthermore there are also strong spatial temporal variations in surface water and energy factors due to complex land atmospheric feedback effects on local climate and hydrological process associated with intense landscape heterogeneity huang and margulis 2010 2011 bryan et al 2015 over the last 50 years meteorological records have shown a rise in temperature and decrease in precipitation in most parts of the agro pastoral ecotone of northern china the agrarian sector went through a series of reforms and changes in government policies on land use have led to extensive changes in land cover liu et al 2011 li et al 2015 zhou et al 2013 many studies examined how different land use cover patterns affected summer temperature in the agro pastoral ecotone of northern china cao et al 2015 wei et al 2018 and the response of crop water consumption to a warming trend and a reduction of precipitation from 1960 to 2007 zhao et al 2013 feng et al 2012 studied the spatial and temporal effects of a large ecological restoration project on water yield across the loess plateau region in northern china in this dynamic heterogeneous agro pastoral ecosystem cropland grassland shrub lands and artificial forests constantly change back and forth the surface water energy exchanges are more complex and dynamic but poorly understood little is done on how lucc affects energy balance and water cycle and land surface atmosphere interactions at the regional scale in the apenwc in addition in the arid and semi arid region of china ground meteorological observatory sites are sparsely distributed it is a challenge to obtain high resolution spatial and temporal weather and land surface observation data some high resolution data can be obtained from satellite based sensors such as the moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer modis and soil moisture active passive smap sensors however such data only provide snapshots of conditions during the transit of the satellites regional climate models are potentially effective tools for understanding spatial temporal distributions of the key local land surface atmosphere interactions gao et al 2017 silverman et al 2013 wagner et al 2016 xia et al 2017 however previous studies show that simplified general circulation models cannot fully simulate fine scale land surface and atmospheric states and often do not accurately capture the detailed diurnal land atmosphere interactions thus huang and margulis 2010 advocated use of a fully coupled land surface model and atmosphere boundary layer model for exploring land atmosphere interactions more accurately in recent years a state of the art regional weather research and forecasting model wrf has been increasingly used to dynamically downscale general circulation model results to spatial resolutions of around 10 40 km and simulate land surface atmosphere interactions numerical research has indicated that the model can effectively simulate land surface water and energy exchange processes wan and xu 2011 wen et al 2012 yuan et al 2017 in this study we fill a gap in our understanding of response of regional water and energy cycles to lucc in agro pastoral ecotone northwest china the objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate the performance of a wrf model in the study region 2 to determine changes of key surface water energy factors lst et and precipitation caused by the lucc and 3 to assess the role of lst et and precipitation in land atmosphere interactions in the agro pastoral ecotone northwest china 2 methodology and materials 2 1 study area the apenwc extends from ca 106 228 e to 110 903 e and 36 816 n to 40 194 n fig 1 it is a semiarid region with an annual average relative humidity of 13 and mean annual precipitation of 250 450 mm main land cover types include grassland farmland forest and shrub land and desert and dynamic conversion between grassland and farmland occurs frequently wei et al 2018 it is one of the world s largest ecotones highly sensitive to changes in climate conditions and surface physical properties cao et al 2015 there have been serious historical and recent environmental changes in the apenwc including grassland degradation desertification and biodiversity loss li et al 2018 wang et al 2015a since 1998 the chinese government has implemented numerous policies and programs to restore ecosystems and improve environmental protection such as the large scale grain for green program the three north shelter forest program and beijing tianjin sand source control program returning cropland to grassland and forest land huang et al 2007 wu et al 2013b since 2000 significant lucc has taken place in the apenwc fu et al 2011 indicated that the area of woodland and grassland had increased 4 3 and 6 6 respectively during 2000 2008 farmland had decreased about 10 8 during the same period meanwhile area of desert and residential area increased 0 3 and 8 5 respectively however little has been done to assess the impacts of the lucc on energy and water exchange processes and water cycles in the region thus this study aims to better understand effects of these large scale ecosystem rehabilitation programs and lucc on regional water energy exchange processes 2 2 model description the wrf model was developed collaboratively by the us national center for atmospheric research ncar and national centers for environmental prediction ncep the wrf is a next generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction

computation and system extensibility skamarock et al 2008 it offers multiple options for parameterizing subgrid scale physical processes e g convection microphysics radiation and the planetary boundary layer schemes in addition land surface models lsms compute heat and moisture fluxes over the surface providing lower boundaries for atmospheric models a detailed description of the model can be obtained at http www mmm ucar edu wrf users the non hydrostatic wrf version 3 8 1 modeling system was used in this study 2 3 model configuration and experimental design the simulation domain is shown in fig 1 a single nested grid system is used in this study the domain is centered at 38 5 n and 108 e with dimensions of 60 60 horizontal grid points with spacing of 10 km the 6 h 0 5 0 5 ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr https rda ucar edu datasets ds093 0 from the ncep provided initial and lateral boundary conditions for the wrf model in order to evaluate the performance of wrf model and obtain a suite of optimal physical schemes for the wrf to best simulate land surface processes in the arid region of northwestern china we conducted a series of wrf testing runs using its sixteen microphysics four cumulus and six planetary boundary layer schemes to identify the optimal suite schemes for our domain sensitivity tests were first conducted covering june october 2010 using standardized deviations sds correlation coefficient and root mean square errors rmses to compare precipitation and temperature patterns after obtaining the optimal physical schemes of simulation through test experiments we re ran the wrf model by changing the land use data of the model fig 2 the simulation time began at 1200 utc september 1 2009 and ended at 1200 utc december 31 2010 the first three months from september 1 2009 to november 30 2009 were considered as spin up time and therefore excluded from the analysis we carried out two simulation experiments to look into the response of surface water and energy to lucc two land use cover datasets were used in the experiment from september 1 2009 to december 31 2010 exp1993 1993 land use cover data and exp2010 2010 land use cover data were used in the experiments two simulations used the same schemes and climate driven data 2 4 validation datasets in order to verify and evaluate the simulation results we selected five national weather stations dongsheng henshan yulin dingbian and etuoke banner stations data set provided by china meteorological administration http data cma cn in our study area to verify simulated 2 m air temperature and precipitation and modis land products were selected to validate land surface temperature https lpdaac usgs gov dataset discovery modis the modis land surface temperature product is an 8 daily composite including daytime and nighttime configured onto a 0 05 5 6 km latitude longitude grid furthermore china meteorological forcing dataset http westdc westgis ac cn was chosen for collaborative evaluation 2 5 model evaluation criteria to assess the model s performance in terms of the fit between observed and simulated data we used three criteria advocated by taylor 2001 moriasi et al 2007 and gleckler et al 2008 the correlation coefficient r standard deviation sd and normalized standard deviation nsd 1 r i 1 n x i obs x i obs x i sim x i sim i 1 n x i obs x i obs 2 i 1 n x i sim x i sim 2 2 sd 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 3 nsd s d sim s d obs here x i obs and x i sim are the observed and simulated values for month or year i while x i obs and x i sim are the average observed and simulated data during the simulation period s d obs and s d sim are the observed and simulated values of standard deviation sd 2 6 the vertical integrated water vapor flux to evaluate the impacts of moisture transportation on precipitation in the apenwc the precipitable water and vertically integrated horizontal water vapor fluxes were calculated by the following equation 4 w 1 g p surface 200 h p a q d p 5 q 1 g p surface 200 h p a vq d p where w and q are the precipitable water and vertically integrated water vapor flux q g psurface and v represent the specific humidity gravity surface pressure and horizontal wind vector respectively zhang et al 2017 2 7 model evaluation in this study we focus on three categories of the physical parameterization schemes the microphysics planetary boundary layer and cumulus schemes all of which are directly related to regional water and energy exchanges rajeevan et al 2010 ács et al 2014 teixeira et al 2014 fig 3 shows taylor diagrams for rainfall and 2 m air temperatures the arcs in the diagrams show correlation coefficients while the horizontal and vertical axes indicate the ratio of the standard deviation sd of the simulated data to the observations all simulations show high correlation coefficients 0 8 0 95 for 2 m air temperatures but the simulated precipitation is sensitive to all physics schemes with normalized standardized deviations of 0 5 0 8 and correlation coefficients of 0 3 0 8 we selected a set of physical options for the wrf model based on comparisons of the simulation outputs with the recorded 2 m air temperature and rainfall data fig 4 the planetary boundary layer processes were resolved with the uw university of washington boundary layer scheme from cam5 cesm 1 0 1 the microphysics was described with the thompson scheme new for v3 1 and the cumulus clouds was simulated with a newer tiedtke scheme the rapid radiative transfer model rrtm and dudhia shortwave radiation scheme were used to calculate long wave and short wave radiation and their transfer within the atmosphere respectively the community land model version 4 clm4 adapted from cam with 10 soil layers was used to simulate land surface processes within the wrf after selecting the above options we re ran wrf model with simulation time beginning at 12 00 september 1 2009 and ending at 12 00 december 31 2010 fig 4 shows the temporal variation and scatter diagram for precipitation and land surface temperature 2 m air temperature the coefficients of determination r2 values for monthly accumulated precipitation and air surface temperature are 0 71 and 0 9 according to the scatter diagram the simulation results show a higher consistency with the observed values in the temporal pattern of temperature and precipitation the results indicate that the wrf model can accurately simulate regional water and energy processes in the apenwc 3 results 3 1 lucc from 1993 to 2010 the generated lucc matrix and associated changes in land cover assigned to specific land use categories in the study period in the apenwc are shown in table 1 fig 2 shows the distribution of the land cover in 1993 left and 2010 right and table 2 shows changes in areas of land use categories from 1993 to 2010 based on the changes of land use cover listed in table 1 in the apenwc the most obviously increased land cover types were the grasslands and barren land increasing by 8 22 and 13 22 respectively as a result of conversion from croplands with 5 86 and shrublands with 12 49 into grasslands and from shrublands with 13 01 into barren or sparsely vegetated land the total croplands decreased by 5 06 and shrublands decreased by 17 25 tables 1 and 2 3 2 land surface temperature response as discussed above the energy and water exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere e g sensible and latent heat fluxes are largely controlled by the difference between the land surface temperature and near surface air temperature hagos et al 2014 cao et al 2015 boone et al 2016 due to the lack of regional scale surface temperature records for northwest china previous studies on effects of land use change on surface temperature in the region have generally relied on remote sensing data however such data only provide snapshots of conditions during the transit of satellites and thus provide limited indication of temporal patterns of surface temperature therefore we ran the wrf model with two land use data sets of 1993 and 2010 as inputs to eliminate the influence of external conditions and isolated changes in surface temperature directly caused by the lucc spatially averaged seasonal differences in simulated lst between exp1993 and exp2010 d ts lst2010 lst1993 fig 5 were 0 45 0 99 0 24 and 0 33 c in spring mam march april may mam summer jja june july august jja fall son september october november son and winter djf december january february djf respectively the minimum and maximum differences were 3 57 and 1 40 c respectively in summer as can be seen in fig 5 due to the transformation of a large area of shrublands into grassland the average monthly lst in this area decreased especially in spring and summer and in both seasons the lst was clearly higher in barren land than in grassland the spatial distribution of lst indicates that the strongest reductions in temperature were in areas where shrublands were transformed into grasslands but this trend was weak or non existent in winter conversely the strongest increases were in areas where grasslands were transformed into shrublands or barren land in summer the lst time series indicate that the daily surface temperature was maximal and minimal at approximately 1400 and 0500 respectively to improve our understanding of effects of changes in albedo on lst we plotted the relationship between changes in lst d ts ts2010 ts1993 and albedo d albedo albedo2010 albedo1993 for all grid points within the regions fig 6 the results show a significant negative correlation with r2 values of 0 91 0 94 0 85 and 0 43 in spring summer fall and winter respectively as shown in fig 7 the simulations indicate a clear tendency for the annual mean surface temperature to decline during the study period due to increases in albedo 3 3 evapotranspiration response et an important element of both the hydrological cycle and surface energy balance is affected by changes in both lucc and climate here we only consider the effects of the lucc by keeping the atmospheric forcing field constant thereby isolating effects of the lucc on et the spatial distribution of seasonal difference in et between the two simulations d et et2010 et1993 is shown in fig 8 the spatially weighted averaged differences of all grids are 1 15 19 79 13 22 and 0 96 mm for spring summer fall and winter respectively conversion of shrublands to grasslands resulted in an increase in et in summer and a decrease in fall conversely conversion of grassland to shrublands resulted in a decrease in et in summer as shown in fig 9 we also found that differences in evapotranspiration d et et2010 et1993 and albedo d albedo albedo2010 albedo1993 in the two simulations for all grid points within the region were negatively correlated in spring fall and winter r2 values 0 13 0 72 and 0 14 respectively however they were significantly positively correlated in summer r2 0 49 3 4 precipitation response the seasonal precipitation and vertically integrated water vapor simulation are shown in fig 10 the simulated precipitation was concentrated in the east of the region and most of the moisture came from the west in spring mam in summer jja precipitation is mainly concentrated in the southeast the majority of the moisture came from the south the greater east asian monsoon and indian ocean monsoon become the major moisture source in fall son the precipitation pattern was similar to the spring pattern and the majority of the moisture came from the west and southwest in winter djf the pattern of moisture sources was similar to the spring pattern but there was very little precipitation to better understand precipitation s response to the lucc seasonal moisture sources must be characterized thus we investigated the seasonal changes in moisture sources and compared their differences during spring summer fall and winter fig 11 shows differences in the spatial distributions of simulated seasonal precipitation during the four seasons with vectors representing the differences in seasonal vertically integrated water vapor fluxes as can be seen from the fig 11 precipitation is very sensitive to the lucc with spatially averaged differences of 2 30 7 31 and 7 80 mm in spring summer and fall respectively but no difference in winter when there was extremely little precipitation in the region the differences in vertically integrated seasonal water vapor flux can help us identify regions that contributed most to the changes in moisture transport generally the more moisture is transported into a region the more moisture source contributes to the precipitation over the region and vice versa zhang et al 2017 from fig 10 the moisture over the region came mainly from the westerlies east asian monsoon and indian ocean monsoon however from fig 11 according to the difference in the moisture between the two simulations exp2010 exp1993 and comparing the fig 10 the moisture over the region declined in spring mam the moisture came from the westerlies decreased in the west of the region but this change is very weak in summer jja the moisture from the east asian monsoon and indian ocean monsoon decreased in the south of the region however in the north the moisture increased and the area within the apenwc contributed greatly to providing the extra moisture transported into the north of the region in fall son the pattern was similar to the spring pattern and the moisture from the west decreased in the west of the region but there is an increase in the east of the region negative differences in the moisture flux mean more moisture was transported away from the region resulting in reduced in moisture in areas within the region there are many connections between land surface characteristics and water cycle from the perspective of atmospheric moisture balance the reduction in precipitation is a result of changes in local surface et and atmospheric moisture convergence wei et al 2016 fig 12 shows the relationship between precipitation change and the change in et the points in fig 12 would fall on the lines of 1 1 if all the precipitation change is explained by changes in et however this was not the case and coefficients of determination between d precipitation and d et were 0 349 0 001 0 260 and 0 063 in spring summer fall and winter respectively these findings show that et was not the only factor that affected precipitation and the lucc affects availability of moisture not only through changes in et but also more importantly through changes in atmosphere circulation and vapor flux transport hagos et al 2014 hua et al 2016 guo et al 2018 4 discussion in this study we first determined the optimal suite of wrf physics schemes by sensitivity tests we then used 6 h 0 5 0 5 ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr data and land use products of 1993 and 2010 to drive wrf simulations of land surface water and energy exchange processes associated with the different land use and land cover types in the apenwc from september 2009 to december 2010 results of the sensitivity analysis and comparison of simulations and observations clearly show that the wrf model can accurately simulate regional water and energy processes in the study region in addition data presented in fig 2 and tables 1 and 2 show that land use and land cover changed substantially between 1993 and 2010 in the region the strongest changes were increases in grasslands and barren or sparsely vegetated land with accompanying reductions in croplands associated with the large scale national grain for green program then we analyzed responses of surface water and energy cycles to the lucc in the region 4 1 energy cycle the water and energy exchange processes combine the water and energy transfer of surface vegetation soil and atmospheric boundary layer into a whole are the focus and hotspot of current earth system science research in our study we analyzed the response of surface temperature evapotranspiration and precipitation to the land use and land cover change our analysis of responses of surface temperature et and precipitation to the lucc show that the lucc affected surface temperatures by altering the land surface albedo which strongly influences energy fluxes between land surfaces and the atmosphere as increases in albedo reduce the energy available for turbulent fluxes of heat and moisture across the boundary boone et al 2016 hence in parts of the region where shrublands were transformed into grasslands land surface temperature decreased and vice versa surface temperature is an important determinant of sensible and latent heat fluxes and thus amounts of energy that are vertically transported into the ground sohrabinia et al 2012 changes in surface temperature also influence local et et is an important component of both the hydrological cycle and surface energy balance previous studies have shown that lucc affects et by changing water energy factors such as air temperature wind speed and relative humidity dias et al 2015 li et al 2017 olchev et al 2008 in general et in a region has two main contributors 1 soil evaporation and or water body and 2 vegetation transpiration interception within the region in the apenwc the shrublands belong to open shrublands its coverage is less than 20 but when the shrublands transformed into grassland the grassland coverage is 60 90 or even more in spring and winter due to low temperature short sunshine durations and dormant vegetation soil evaporation is the main contributor of the total et in the study region thus et is low and the variation is very small however when the shrublands transformed into grasslands in summer et is much higher and largely derived from plant transpiration and interception evaporation which accounts for most of the total et besides summer is the rainy season in the apenwc due to shrub s root architecture higher and deeper infiltration and lateral redistribution of water existed beneath shrublands as compared with grassland in the shrublands rainfall partition induced by shrub s root architecture results in preferential water flow into deep soil layer compared with grassland li et al 2013 however in arid semi arid areas et is limited mostly by soil water li et al 2016 summer rainfall causes the shrublands soil to store more water in deeper soil in the fall soil evaporation is greater in open shrublands compared with grassland but in areas where shrublands were transformed into grasslands the grasses withered causing major drops in plant transpiration and inhibition of soil evaporation in the fall therefore the total et sharply decreased compared with shrublands 4 2 water budget increases in et and reductions in precipitation will lead to soil drying and may exacerbate droughts in summer across the region feng et al 2012 found that water yield in 38 of the loess plateau area might have decreased 1 48 mm per year as a result of lucc zhang et al 2012b indicated that the region located in the upper reaches of the yellow river experienced upward trends in the total drought area in addition liu et al 2016b found that the southwest of the loess plateau has a significant increasing trend of drought severity based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index the increase in drought area may cause damage to agricultural production and regional food security our finding is similar to those found in the loess plateau and the upper reaches of the yellow river basin in northwest china knowledge of the spatial temporal distribution of water is crucial for the sustainable development of agriculture and other socio economic activities hagos et al 2014 precipitation is the main source of moisture in the apenwc and our results show that the potential feedback of the lucc on local climate may have reduced precipitation to study luuc s effects on precipitation in detail we first considered et and water vapor transportation fig 13 a shows various fluxes associated with precipitation processes in the apenwc in general precipitation p has two sources in a region 1 water vapor evaporated within the region contributed to precipitation called recycled precipitation pr and 2 water vapor transported into the region from outside contributed precipitation called advective precipitation pa so the p is the sum of pa and pr the upward evaporative flux is represented by e and inflow and outflow of advective moisture is represented by fin and fout respectively in our two experiments we changed land use data of the wrf model and control fin to remain unchanged subsequent analysis revealed a positive correlation between changes in precipitation and et with r2 values of 0 394 0 001 0 260 and 0 063 in spring summer fall and winter respectively indicating that et makes a contribution to precipitation in the region and the lucc changes recycled precipitation pr the ratio of precipitation contributed from water vapor evaporated within the region pr versus the total precipitation p is known as the precipitation recycling ratio prr this ratio indicates the importance of the interactions between the atmosphere and land surface and is an indicator of general climatic sensitivity to lucc brubaker et al 1993 dominguez et al 2006 eltahir and bras 2010 fig 13b shows the temporal variability of prr in the apenwc the prr is 0 15 0 46 and averaged prr is 0 273 and 0 268 in different land use data experiment of 1993 and 2010 implying that about 27 averaged two prr of the precipitation comes from the local et the other 73 from the external water vapor inflow in order to further understand how lucc affects precipitation processes we considered the primary mechanism of moisture transport the greater east asian monsoon indian ocean monsoon the local and nearby sources in the westerlies were the main moisture contributors to the precipitation in our study region fig 10 based on our simulations however due to grain for green and northern china s vegetation belt programs the apenwc has been experiencing a large scale change in land use cover in summer moisture from these sources decreased in the south of the region fig 11c but in the north the moisture increased and areas within the apenwc strongly contributed to the additional moisture transported into the north in summary surface et and atmospheric moisture from external water vapor inflows play important roles in precipitation processes and the atmospheric moisture balance in the region and the lucc strongly affected both processes the results show that the impacts of lucc on regional water energy cycle are significant but the impacts of lucc on regional land surface water energy cycle and its variations are still under investigation and not fully understood researches have also indicated possible teleconnections between regional lucc and climate over remote areas hasler et al 2009 snyder 2010 mahmood et al 2014 for example the deforestation leads to a regional warming in low latitude but a cooling effect in high latitude claussen et al 2001 snyder et al 2004 2010 cui et al 2006 indicated that the impacts of lucc on the east asian atmospheric circulation and monsoon precipitation in tibet plateau sen et al 2004 also reported that deforestation has an effect of weakening of the monsoon flow over the tibetan plateau and eastern china thus the teleconnections should be further investigated to understand their impacts on water and energy cycles 4 3 limitations and future research in the study we evaluated the performance of wrf simulation using observed temperature and precipitation data it is important to note limitations associated with uncertainties in the model which inevitably affect the accuracy of regional outputs for example because landscape heterogeneity what spatial resolution is best in simulating the land surface processes over regional scale remains a challenge in the study region in addition surface water energy exchange processes are complex and cannot be directly monitored although our results show that the lucc substantially affected water and energy exchange in the apenwc thus precise description of land surface properties is important for rigorous and accurate numerical modeling simulations future studies need to consider these issues in simulating effects of the lucc on land surface processes in the study region 5 conclusions in this work we have used a state of the art regional climate model wrf model to simulate regional water and energy processes associated with land use and cover in the arid apenwc between 1993 and 2010 we first evaluated the model s performance for the region and then assessed responses of regional water energy processes to the lucc our main finding are as follows 1 the wrf model can accurately simulate regional water and energy processes in the agro pastoral ecotone 2 land use cover changed substantially between 1993 and 2010 in the study area the strongest changes were increases in grasslands and barren or sparsely vegetated land associated with the chinese government s large scale grain for green program 3 expansion of grasslands reduces energy available for turbulent fluxes of heat mean surface temperature and hence soil evaporation spatially averaged et decreased in spring fall and winter but increased in summer this is because et derived from transpiration in summer accounts for most total et but in other seasons grass is withered plant transpiration rates are very low and withered vegetation inhibits soil evaporation 4 the greater east asian monsoon indian ocean monsoon together with local and nearby sources in the westerlies were found to be the most important contributors of moisture to the precipitation response of precipitation to the lucc is extremely sensitive which has reduced precipitation in the region the differences in the simulated moisture fluxes also indicate that moisture over this region declined which means the study region contributed additional moisture from the local et into the north of the region the results suggest that land cover change especially expansion of grasslands have reduced land surface temperature in the apenwc increases in et and reductions in precipitation will lead to soil drying and may exacerbate droughts in summer across the region the findings provides useful information for formulating optimal strategies for animal husbandry ecological restoration and sustainable development in the apenwc and similar regions credit authorship contribution statement xuejin wang data

5962,the magnitude of sediment yield following forest timber harvest is controlled by increases in both sediment supply and streamflow since the relation between sediment transport and streamflow typically follows a power law small increases in streamflow may translate into large increases in sediment transport interpreting the geomorphic effects of streamflow increases is confounded by the fact that timber harvest influences both the hydrologic regime and sediment supply of a watershed simultaneously making it difficult to isolate the streamflow effect alone here we report on a novel approach to this problem using long term data from two paired catchments located in the h j andrews experimental forest oregon usa we use observed streamflow from the treated clearcut and control watersheds to reconstruct a natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed one that represents streamflow response in conditions prior to harvest we combine this reconstructed natural streamflow time series with observed relations between streamflow and sediment transport to quantify the background sediment yield and disentangle the relative effects of changes in hydrology and sediment supply results indicate that while increases in streamflow can account for modest increases in sediment transport this is dwarfed by the increased supply of sediment that accompanies most timber harvest these results have broad relevance to forest timber harvest and fuel management practices worldwide and can be used to constrain or set bounds on likely effects of more modest i e thinning techniques keywords forest management streamflow sediment yield paired catchment 1 introduction and background felling and removing trees changes virtually all aspects of a forest s water and sediment budget canopy interception and transpiration are reduced throughfall and soil evaporation are increased and snow accumulation and melt dynamics are changed in a complex fashion at the same time soils are stripped bare and exposed to erosion by various mechanisms access roads root strength declines increasing potential for mass movements and sediment may be directly delivered to streams by ground disturbance these effects are intrinsic to forest timber harvest and fuel reduction activities although the absolute changes to hydrologic and geomorphic processes will vary with the logging methods employed the intensity and geography of disturbance and the underlying hydrogeomorphic setting of the landscape the hydrologic and geomorphic effects of forest harvest have been the focus of scientific research for over a century both in the u s and abroad e g robinson et al 2003 andréassian 2004 cosandey et al 2005 brown et al 2005 neary 2016 mcdonnell et al 2018 evaristo and mcdonnell 2019 starting with the first paired catchment experiments in wagon wheel gap west virginia usa and extending to investigations in paired and non paired catchments from both temperate and tropical locales numerous studies have documented the effects of cutting trees and related activities on a host of physical processes including peak and low flows annual water yields suspended and bedload sediment yields and channel morphology taken together our understanding of the hydrogeomorphic consequences of forest harvest is probably better than for most other land use activities with the possible exception of agriculture although well established in the literature the paired catchment experimental design has acknowledged limitations grant et al 2008 alila et al 2009 even in carefully selected adjacent or nested basin pairs there are both fundamental and evolving differences in how water and sediment are received and processed due to climate vegetation soils topography and geology pre and post treatment periods vary in length and do not necessarily include similar ranges and sequences of flows and field measurements include a range of inherent changes in instrumentation along with measurement and analytical errors making strong statistical inference challenging some researchers have even challenged the underlying basis for comparing control treatment in terms of standard flow metrics choosing instead to compare frequency relationships alila et al 2009 there are also issues related to scaling of results as most paired catchments are limited to first and second order streams zhang et al 2017 still in a conventional control treatment analysis of harvest effects on hydrology metrics extracted from streamflow e g instantaneous peaks annual 7 day average low flow and total annual flow are compared pre and post treatment and the difference is interpreted as the forest treatment effect linear regression is easily applied to these types of data and has been widely used along with time series analysis and auto and cross correlation to explore changes in magnitude and trend biederman et al 2015 caldwell et al 2016 hallema et al 2018 1 1 results from paired watershed studies in the pacific northwest paired watershed studies examining the effects of forest timber harvest on peak flows and water yield have been particularly contentious with much of the attention focused on studies from the extensive forest lands in the u s pacific northwest despite decades of studies and for many of the reasons cited above consensus has not been reached out on the magnitude persistence and mechanisms responsible for peak flow and water yield changes following timber harvest studies examining the same long term streamflow data from paired catchment studies in the h j andrews experimental forest and other basins in western oregon for example reached conflicting conclusions on the magnitude and causes of peak flow changes setting off an extensive debate in the literature alila et al 2009 beschta et al 2000 grant et al 2008 harr 1986 jones 2000 jones and grant 1996 2001a 2001b thomas and megahan 1998 2001 there is however broad agreement that hydrologic changes following timber harvest do occur in many forest environments in the pacific northwest and beyond e g gomi et al 2005 grant et al 2008 moore and wondzell 2005 key issues affecting the magnitude of streamflow changes include the type intensity and spatial extent of timber harvesting with clearcutting representing the most extreme case while forest management practices have evolved over time and clearcutting is no longer practiced on u s federal land it is still the primary timber harvest method used across the globe the world s forests shrank by 1 3 million square kilometers between 1990 and 2015 a trend that is highly likely continue in the future world bank 2016 moreover salvage logging has also increased triggered by increased fire and drought related tree mortality due to climate change although highly location specific salvage logging operations in many ways resemble conventional clearcutting thorn et al 2018 the long term data on extreme treatment presented here provides key insights as an end member on processes responsible for land and water quality degradation following landscape scale disturbances in addition to research on the hydrologic effects of forest management many studies have investigated sediment production and transport following forest harvest in the pacific northwest and other regions e g ambers 2001 bathurst and iroumé 2014 beschta

1972 stednick 2008 stott 2005 swank et al 2014 swanson and fredriksen 1982 timber harvest operations such as felling and yarding can alter hillslope hydrology and increase surface erosion by compacting soils and removing organic litter although clear cutting alone can increase sediment production somewhat studies have shown much larger increases in sediment movement on hillslopes and in channels after slash burning bathurst and iroumé 2014 grant and wolff 1991 lewis et al 2001 mersereau and dyrness 1972 in the steep wet landscape of the pacific northwest where sediment yields from small watersheds are commonly dominated by episodic mass wasting events the most significant changes to sediment transport processes following timber harvest may be related to increased rates of mass movement including landslides and debris flows caused by reduced hillslope stability due to loss of root strength grant and wolff 1991 montgomery et al 2000 rice et al 1979 cutting riparian vegetation can also alter the sediment transport regime within a watershed by reducing wood recruitment to channels and increasing debris flow runout thereby affecting sediment storage patterns in a basin lancaster et al 2001 though beyond the scope of this study road building and the construction of landings on steep slopes can also have substantial impacts on hillslope hydrology and sediment production e g tague and band 2001 wemple et al 1996 2001 accelerated sediment production following changes in land use and land cover is widely viewed as an environmental problem causing channel bed aggradation which increases the risk of flooding and enhances bank erosion and impacting fish habitat by aggrading pools raising water temperatures and blanketing spawning gravels with fine grained sediment lisle 1989 lisle and hilton 1992 increased sediment transport rates can also affect water quality which may adversely affect drinking water supplies aquatic habitat and recreational values 1 2 coupling hydrologic and geomorphic responses to forest harvest most studies typically evaluate the effects of timber harvest on streamflow and sediment transport separately even while acknowledging that the two are intimately coupled from a geomorphic perspective changes in either the frequency or magnitude of streamflow will directly affect sediment transport specifically sediment transport q s whether as suspended load or bedload is typically related to streamflow q by a power law 1 q s aq b for both suspended and bedload transport the b exponent is typically greater than one meaning that any change in streamflow will have a corresponding exponential effect on sediment transport while both the a and b coefficients vary widely by landscape and channel system reported values of b for example range from 1 42 to 2 96 for suspended load in rivers in different physiographic settings morehead et al 2003 and 2 30 to 5 06 for bedload in gravel bed rivers in idaho emmett and wolman 2001 this relationship implies that if timber harvest increases streamflow in a transport limited basin it will also increase basin sediment transport and yield independent of any changes in sediment supply few studies have explicitly examined this coupling however and explored the relative or absolute role of either streamflow changes or increased sediment supply on sediment transport for the small number of studies that have looked at the relation between streamflow and sediment transport the literature is again often contradictory a review paper on suspended sediment transport in headwater streams for example points to both sediment supply and increased streamflow as being responsible for elevated sediment transport following timber harvest but acknowledges that was lack the ability to disentangle the relative effects of each gomi et al 2005 other review papers on forest harvest effects on water quality and quantity however treat effects on streamflow and sediment production and transport separately anderson and lockaby 2011 croke and hairsine 2006 hubbart et al 2007 grant et al 2008 moore and wondzell 2005 stednick 2008 reiter et al 2009 most case studies of forest harvest impacts report streamflow or water yield and sediment effects as if they are independent i e hotta et al 2007 karwan et al 2007 klein et al 2012 kreutzweiser and capell 2001 lewis and keppeler 2007 mcbroom et al 2008 stott 2005 stott et al 2001 swank et al 2001 webb et al 2012 grant and wolff 1991 used a multivariate streamflow model to predict sediment transport following timber harvest in oregon usa but did not separate out the effects of logging on streamflow as part of their model bywater reyes et al 2017 used generalized least squares regression model in the trask river watershed western oregon usa and concluded a lithologically mediated response of forest management on suspended sediment yield a similar analysis for the western cascades emphasized the importance of cumulative annual streamflow and physiography bywater reyes et al 2018 lewis and others 2001 lewis and keppeler 2007 also developed a multivariate sediment transport model for caspar creek in california usa and concluded that increased streamflow volume following logging was the single most important explanatory variable for elevated suspended sediment transport distinguishing between the effects of streamflow increases versus sediment supply increases caused by disturbances associated specifically with logging is important in order to target effective mitigation strategies for example if increased sediment flux down channels is driven primarily by increased streamflow then mitigation strategies should focus on reducing cutover area managing cutting pattern and block size and increasing residual stand densities on the other hand if sediment supply is driven primarily by ground disturbance and increased erosion rates following timber harvest then alternative logging strategies that limit the area of ground disruption or soil exposure and maintaining effective riparian buffers around streams to limit sediment delivery are likely to be more effective approaches to reducing basin sediment yields in this paper we utilize a reverse regression technique to evaluate the relative and absolute importance of increased sediment transport due to changes in streamflow versus increased sediment supply due to forest timber harvest alone we begin by developing a reverse regression technique for reconstructing the natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed we define natural streamflow as the expected water production from a catchment unaltered by forest management or any other disturbance we then describe how to combine measured and reconstructed streamflow for the treated watershed with observed regressions between streamflow and sediment transport pre and post harvest in order to refine estimates of suspended and bedload sediment yields due to timber harvest from both changes in streamflow and changes in sediment supply we next illustrate this approach using paired catchment data from two small and well studied sites in the h j andrews experimental forest in oregon usa finally we conclude with a discussion of the broader implications of this technique for understanding the relative effects of changes in hydrology and sediment supply to sediment yield following forest management 2 analytical approach our goal is to compare total sediment flux with and without changes in streamflow using a before after control impact baci design method from a paired catchment study in the h j andrews experimental forest in oregon usa this requires disentangling forest timber harvest related increases in basin sediment transport due to increased streamflow from changes due to increased sediment supply fig 1 here we discuss the logic underlying our approach in the following section we develop the approach analytically it is relatively straightforward to calculate total pre and post treatment sediment yields for the treated watershed that includes background yield and streamflow effects using the observed pre and post treatment streamflow time series and corresponding sediment rating curves the post treatment streamflow time series reflects any changes in hydrology that have occurred as the result of timber harvest and when combined with the post treatment sediment rating curve the resulting sediment yields incorporate the effects of both changes in streamflow and increased sediment supply along with the background sediment yield fig 1 scenario 1a this result can be compared with estimates of sediment transport that reflect the increase in streamflow alone we do this by first coupling the post treatment streamflow time series with the observed pre treatment sediment transport relationship to estimate background sediment yield and any increase or decrease in the sediment yield due to timber harvest driven changes in streamflow fig 1 scenario 1b second we couple the reconstructed natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed during the post treatment time period described in following section 2 1 with the pre treatment sediment transport relation to estimate background sediment yield transport for the treated watershed fig 1 scenario 2b subtracting this background sediment yield from scenario 1b therefore provides an estimate of sediment transport due solely to the change in streamflow 2 1 reconstructing a natural streamflow time series for the post treatment period analytically we can describe relationships between measured streamflow from the control and treated catchments using the conventional linear regression method for the pre and post treatment time periods 2 log q trt pre c 1 c 2 l o g q ctrl pre 3 log q trt post c 3 c 4 l o g q ctrl post c 5 t where q trt and q ctrl are drainage area weighted measured streamflow in the treated and control watersheds respectively t is time in years since the end of treatment subscripts pre and post refer to the pre or post treatment time periods and c1 through c5 are the regression coefficients from 2 and 3 we can reconstruct two possible streamflow time series for the treated watershed in the post treatment period using both forward and reverse regression 2 1 1 forward regression the standard forward regression technique applies the pre treatment relationship 2 to the post treatment measured streamflow in the control watershed q ctrl post to reconstruct natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed q trt post during the post treatment period as if the watershed not been harvested 4 log q trt post c 1 c 2 l o g q ctrl post this predicted streamflow q trt post is based on a simple extension of the pre treatment streamflow relationship between the control and treated watersheds while at first glance this forward regression might seem to be the logical approach several factors argue against this as the sole method first we want to reconstruct a natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed that accurately captures the flow behavior realized on the treated watershed during the post treatment period fig 2 a reconstructed natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed using forward regression will likely resemble the flow realized in the control watershed as opposed to those in the treated watershed fig 2b second we wanted to account for the fact that flows in the treated watershed following harvest were non stationary and showed a gradual return towards the pre treatment condition as forests recovered as noted by previous studies beschta et al 2000 jones and grant 1996 thomas and megahan 1998 using the stationary pre treatment relationship between control and treated watersheds would not have captured this trend and its effect on sediment yield 2 1 2 reverse regression we use the reverse regression technique to account for the fact that the streamflow behavior realized over the post treatment period may be different from those in the pre treatment period even in its natural state due to climate variability we reconstructed an additional set of natural streamflow time series based on post treatment streamflow in the treated watershed to do this we create a reverse regression of the post treatment streamflow following 3 with the treated watershed q trt post as an independent variable and control watershed streamflow q ctrl post as a dependent variable 5a log q ctrl post c 6 c 7 l o g q trt post c 8 t we use this reverse regression equation to generate alternate synthetic streamflow time series for the control watershed q ctrl post based on q trt post for the post treatment time period 5b log q ctrl post c 6 c 7 l o g q trt post c 8 t the resulting synthetic streamflow q ctrl post for the control watershed is a function of measured post treatment streamflow in the treated watershed q trt post and time since treatment t fig 2c it is worth noting here that instead of applying the inverse solution for unknown q ctrl post with known q trt post in equation 3 we establish the reverse regression 5a by reversing the roles of the explanatory variable and the response reverse regression appears to have a slight edge in terms of the width of the prediction interval parker et al 2010 we then use the transformed streamflow time series for the control watershed from 5b in the pre treatment period equation 2 to predict streamflow in the treated basin for the post treatment period as if the watershed had not been harvested fig 2d 6 log q trt post c 1 c 2 l o g q ctrl post this modeled streamflow q trt post provides an estimate of runoff for the same time period and climatic conditions as the post treatment period as illustrated in fig 2 streamflow time series derived using the reverse regression technique more closely resemble the overall shape and timing of the observed streamflow in the treated watershed than the conventional forward regression method 3 methods 3 1 study area the study watersheds are in the h j andrews experimental forest in the western

17 8 c in july smith 2002 rainfall intensities are rarely high enough to generate overland flow except where ground is compacted by logging roads or skid trails the study watersheds are located in what is termed as the transient snow zone between 400 and 1 100 m elevation and can receive rain or snow harr 1986 rain on snow events in the transient snow zone commonly generate floods jennings and

watersheds are provided in grant and wolff 1991 and rothacher et al 1967 the streams draining the two catchments are steep step pool channels with gravel to boulder beds and occasional bedrock outcrops the channel of ws2 the forested control has abundant large coarse woody debris as both individual pieces and log jams distributed along the channel deposits of fine sediment sand and finer is limited to channel margins shallow pools behind woody debris and bed interstices streams generally run quite clear except during storms suspended load is primarily clay products bedload is typically a mixture of gravel sand and particulate organics ws1 was 100 clear cut from fall 1962 through summer 1966 using a skyline suspension system to minimize soil disturbance and eliminate the need for roads

sediment production transport and export over the entire period of the study grant and wolff 1991 in particular large storms in 1964 and 1996 both with recurrence intervals of 50 100 years dominate the sediment transport history several small debris slides occurred in ws1 on hillslopes following logging during the period 1965 1972 but did not transform into debris flows grant and wolff 1991 3 2 hydrologic data and natural streamflow time series reconstruction streamflow monitoring in the h j andrews experimental forest began in october 1952 to assess the hydrologic and water quality changes associated with logging and provide baseline data for small forested catchments at different elevations rothacher et al 1967 continuous streamflow measurements are recorded at calibrated gage stations in trapezoidal flumes at the mouth of each study basin for this analysis we used 15 minute streamflow data for ws1 and ws2 johnson and rothacher 2018 along with daily precipitation and daily average air temperature data from cs2met daly and mckee 2019 cs2met station is located at an elevation of 460 m downstream from ws2 gauge fig 3 we used the split sample approach for the least squared linear regression model fitting and validation of the pre treatment regression model between the control and treated watershed streamflow observed streamflow during the pre treatment period water years 1953 1962 was divided between model fitting water years 1953 1957 and validation water years 1958 1962 periods before fitting a final model using the entire period water years 1953 1962 for the purpose of streamflow time series reconstruction during the post treatment period streamflow data for the treatment period water years 1963 1966 were excluded as the values may have been impacted by the logging activities fig 4 coefficient of determination r 2 root mean squared error rmse along with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used to evaluate model performence additionally probability density function plots were produced using observed and reconstructed streamflow time series during pre and post treatment periods to ensure the robustness of our reconstruction approach in reproducing the natural streamflow in the treated watershed 3 3 sediment sampling and rating curve development vertically integrated suspended sediment grab samples were taken throughout the pre treatment period starting in 1956 and through 1988 after treatment johnson and fredriksen 2017 in ws1 and ws2 fig 4 several additional samples were collected during high flows after 1988 but not included in this analysis reduced grab sampling frequency was because of funding and logistical issues samples were collected in pint i us pint 0 473 l bottles at the end of the flumes on the rising peak and falling limbs of storm hydrographs and during inter storm periods from october to may all samples were screened to remove particles 2 mm dried and weighed when replicate samples were collected the average sediment concentration was used bedload accumulation was measured annually between 1957 and 2016 by surveying the bottom elevation of sediment basins below the gage stations johnson and rothacher 2017 bedload accumulation volumes were then converted to mass using an average bulk density of 1 0 g cm3 a value determined from sediment bulk density measurements in the ws1 and ws2 settling ponds grant and wolff 1991 fredriksen 1970b swanson et al 1982 the total volume of material was reduced by 35 an estimate of the organic content trapped in the sediment basins each year swanson et al 1982 although the accumulation of organic material probably varied with climate basin and land use we use a constant fraction because detailed records of organic content were not available for ws1 and ws2 there may be some minor double counting of suspended sediment due to settle out in the reservoirs we believe this amount to be minimal because of the small size of the sediment basins and turbulent flows we created rating curves using the pre 1956 1966 and post treatment 1967 1988 sediment and streamflow data in order to determine sediment flux and annual yield pre treatment suspended sediment was regressed as a function of log log polynomial streamflow along with measures of periodicity in the sampling due to snow and other factors table 2 fig 5 fourier sine and cosine series of sample day and time along with days since the beginning of the water year were used to capture periodic signals in the suspended sediment samples since the treated watershed was replanted soon after harvest time since harvest was added as an additional independent variable for capturing recovery and predicting its role on post treatment sediment flux annual maximum 15 minute streamflow for the current year annual maximum 15 minute streamflow for the preceding year mean annual flow annual average mean daily temperature total annual precipitation annual maximum 1 day total precipitation and time since harvest for post treatment only were identified as a potential predictors for annual bedload yield during pre 1957 1966 and post treatment 1967 2016 periods however most of these explanatory variables were statistically insignificant see section 4 3 all the annual independent and explanatory variables were derived on a water year basis both suspended sediment and bedload data during the treatment period 1963 1966 were included in the pre treatment rating curves as mentioned previously clearcutting in ws1 began in 1962 but bedload yields in the treated watershed did not increase until after the burn in 1966 supplementary figure s1 effect of treatment activities during the 1963 1966 period on the suspended sediment rating curve was statistically non significant p 0 14 all rating curves were corrected for bias introduced by the log transformation using a smearing transformation factor uhrich et al 2014 that does not require the assumption of log normally distributed residuals duan 1983 derived suspended sediment and bedload rating curves for the pre and post treatment periods were applied to the observed pre and post treatment observed and reconstructed natural streamflow time series to create continuous sediment flux and budget we calculated three different measures of sediment yield for the post treatment time period fig 1 1a an estimate of actual sediment transported including changes in both flow regime and sediment supply 2b the predicted amount of background sediment yield if the basin had been left in a natural state and 1b the predicted amount of background sediment transported along with additional sediment produced due to treatment induced changes in streamflow the portion of sediment attributed to changes in streamflow alone can be computed by subtracting the background 2b from 1b 4 results 4 1 effect of forest treatment on streamflow and water yield comparison of streamflow for ws1 treated and ws2 control using a linear regression model with forest harvest as a binary variable pre treatment 0 post treatment 1 shows a statistically significant shift p 0 001 in the streamflow relationship between the two watersheds due to forest harvest table 3 there is a noticeable shift in the distribution of flows during the post treatment as compared to pre treatment period more so in the treated watershed than those in the control fig 6 much of the shift in streamflow was in the lower range of flows i e left side of the probability density plot we found no statistically significant impact of treatment on annual 15 minute maximum streamflow p 0 67 for both treatment and interaction terms these results are consistent with previous findings showing an increase in streamflow following treatment particularly for small storms beschta et al 2000 jones and grant 1996 thomas and megahan 1998 in terms of annual water yield there is an increase in the treated watershed streamflow by 10 or 136 mm year over the 51 years of post treatment period fig 7 we attribute the increase in water yield to forest harvest as there was no statistically significant difference based on one way anova with post hoc tukey hsd between the pre and post treatment annual precipitation p 0 8 or temperature p 0 8 we investigated the watershed recovery in terms of streamflow using the aforementioned linear regression model after dividing the post treatment data into five recovery decades i e 1967 1976 1977 1986 1987 1996 1997 2006 2007 2016 however both treatment and interaction term estimates remained statistically significant throughout the 5 recovery decades supplementary table s1 this suggests that even after 51 years of watershed recovery post treatment streamflow remains different from the pre treatment period stage streamflow rating curves for ws1 and ws2 have been recently updated using new calibration points between 1996 and 2017 and streamflow beginning water year 1999 was re calculated henshaw et al 2018 as a result annual water yield declined between 18 and 24 in ws1 and by 2 in ws2 when compared with the water yield estimated using the original rating curves although we believe the updated ratings curves are more accurate applying multiple rating curves can produce abrupt changes in the streamflow rate and hence complicates long term analysis to further investigate the shifts in streamflow cumulative monthly random residual time series of streamflow for the treated and control watersheds and precipitation from cs2met were plotted from october 1952 to september 2017 fig 8 monthly streamflow and precipitation residual time series with respect to the mean standardized values were developed using the approach described by mair and fares 2010 overall the trends in ws1 and ws2 streamflow generally follow the observed trends in the precipitation an upward shift in ws1 and ws2 streamflow is evident half way through the timber harvest likely driven by the large storms between november 1964 and january 1965 the combined precipitation during this time was over 1900 mm making it the wettest consecutive three months on record while ws2 streamflow following this storm continued to decline driven by a downward trend in precipitation streamflow in ws1 showed the highest 10 years of sustained increase immediately after the broadcast burn in the fall of 1966 this beginning of sustained increase in ws1 streamflow was despite below average precipitation from 1966 to 1970 these diverging shifts in ws1 and ws2 streamflow and precipitation strongly suggest timber harvest caused the increase in ws1 streamflow another noticeable downward shift in ws1 streamflow occurred between 2001 and 2017 which may have been driven by recent below normal precipitation a similar recovery pattern is also evident from the double mass analysis fig 7 4 2 reconstructed ws1 natural streamflow as described earlier we used two approaches based on forward and reverse regression techniques to reconstruct the natural streamflow time series for ws1 irrespective of the time period there was a strong relation between the treated and control watershed streamflow with prediction accuracy over 90 supplementary figure s2 table 4 performance of the regression model did not diminish when applied against an independent sample for validation fig 9 giving us confidence in the temporal transferability of the model time since recovery variable t in equation 5a was a statistically significant p 0 05 predictor along with the treated watershed streamflow of post treatment streamflow in the control watershed overall the reverse regression technique performed better nse 0 99 in transferring the pre treatment streamflow characteristics of ws1 and ws2 to the post treatment period when compared with the forward regression nse 0 91 the forward regression reconstruction method tends to over estimate streamflow especially during low flows fig 9 and is unable to reproduce the observed streamflow distribution during the post treatment period fig 6b reconstructed streamflow using forward regression largely mimics the bi modal post treatment streamflow distribution in the control watershed as opposed to the tri modal distribution observed in the treated watershed in contrast the reverse regression technique as described in section 2 1 2 was able to maintain the tri modal streamflow distribution behavior in the treated watershed 4 3 sediment rating curves and recovery among the candidates of independent variables only streamflow fourier terms sin k 1 and cos k 1 were statistically significant in predicting the pre treatment suspended sediment flux table 2 for the post treatment suspended sediment flux only streamflow sin k 1 and time since harvest were statistically significant using the first power of streamflow alone explained 82 and 83 of the variability in the suspended sediment flux during the pre and post treatment periods respectively supplementary figure s3 hence adding these additional predictors improved the model by 4 8 in terms of additional explained variance time since treatment alone increased the post treatment rating curve model r 2 by 5 akaike information criteria aic during the pre treatment period was 590 for first power streamflow only model 1 and 509 for the final model in the post treatment period aic declined the lower the aic the better the model from 1 175 for first power of streamflow only model 1 017 for first power streamflow and time since harvest model to 822 for the final model table 2 comparing the observed and predicted suspended sediment flux along with 95 prediction interval showed a similar relatively narrow range i e a high degree of precision of the regression results fig 5a approximately 96 of the data points are within the range of values predicted by this regression model the bedload yield was related only to annual maximum 15 minute streamflow during the pre treatment and maximum streamflow and time since harvest during the post treatment period supplementary figure s3 table 2 mean annual streamflow annual precipitation average annual mean daily temperature annual maximum 1 day total precipitation and annual maximum 15 minute streamflow of the preceding year were all statistically insignificant p 0 05 in terms of prediction interval only two data points water years 1991 and 1973 were outside the bound for post treatment and none for the pre treatment fig 5b the linear model over predicted the annual bedload yield in 1991 3 mg km2 observed vs 13 mg km2 and under predicted in 1973 86 mg km2 observed vs 23 mg km2 a relatively wide range of prediction interval for the pre treatment regression model suggests higher prediction uncertainty only 62 of the variation in pre treatment bedload yield can be explained by this linear model as opposed to 80 during the post treatment timber harvest shows a statistically significant p 0 001 impact on sediment streamflow relationships table 5 for suspended sediment there is a statistically significant shift in both slope and intercept terms following treatment in contrast for bedload only a shift in intercept was statistically significant this may very well be driven by the differences in the length of record suspended sediment data was limited to 1957 1988 and hence limited recovery time when compared with bedload data which extends until 2016 the sediment flux to streamflow relationship shows a gradual recovery supplementary tables s2 s3 the annual maximum streamflow and bedload sediment relationship by recovery decade shows that the forest harvest has a significant impact on the intercept but not on the slope of the relationship supplementary figure s4 4 4 post treatment sediment yields we estimate 4 774 mg km2 of suspended sediment and 2 391 mg km2 of bedload was transported out of ws1 in the 51 years following treatment giving average annual yields of 94 and 47 mg km2 for suspended and bedload respectively fig 10 table 6 total average annual yield was 140 mg km2 examining the total pre and post treatment sediment yields from ws1 through time reveals both the initial increase and roughly exponential decline in sediment yields following treatment fig 10 annual sediment output from ws1 remained relatively constant 22 mg km2 before and during the treatment period but increased dramatically after the broadcast burn following timber harvest in 1966 while suspended load declined to pre treatment levels in the first two decades following treatment bedload remained elevated causing the bedload proportion of the total load to increase through time bedload accounted for only 17 of the total sediment budget during the pre treatment period but increased to almost 97 of the total sediment output during the last decade i e 2011 2017 background bedload and suspended sediment yields estimated using the reconstructed natural streamflow time series based on the reverse regression technique were 32 and 284 mg km2 respectively table 6 this translates into a mean annual total bedload suspended sediment yield of 6 mg km2 these estimates of background sediment yields are within the range of erosion rates reported for the pacific northwest swanson et al 1982 changes in sediment supply overwhelmingly dominate streamflow in terms of increased sediment flux changes in streamflow alone account for 477 mg km2 10 of the suspended load and 113 mg km2 5 of the bedload over the post treatment period increase in suspended sediment yield due to increase in sediment supply is 84 of the measured post treatment total suspended sediment yield in terms of bedload 93 of the total measured bedload yield during the post treatment period can be attributed to an increase in sediment supply the first 10 years following treatment yielded 75 of the total post treatment suspended load but only 33 of the bedload fig 11 suspended load continued to decrease dramatically in the subsequent 2 recovery decades with 14 of the total post treatment yield occurring during decade 2 9 during decade 3 2 during decade 4 and 1 during decade 5 bedload yield did not decrease at the same rate 22 22 14 and 9 during the recovery decades 2 3 4 and 5 respectively a similar recovery was noted in the cumulative suspended sediment yield attributed to increase in streamflow both total and increased streamflow attributed suspended sediment stabilized after 1999 we do not see a similar recovery pattern in the bedload yield attributed to change in streamflow rather bedload shows a gradual annual increase with a linear slope of 2 34 mg km2 r 2 0 98 in contrast cumulative background suspended and bedload yields increased annually by 5 59 mg km2 r 2 0 99 and 0 64 mg km2 r 2 0 97 respectively the first 10 years following treatment yielded 32 of the total post treatment suspended load attributed to increase in streamflow which is significantly higher than the 16 of the cumulative background suspended sediment yield and comparable to 33 of the total bedload driven by increased streamflow the background bedload yield in the first 10 years following treatment was 11 of the total bedload as compared with 26 of the bedload attributed to increase in streamflow fig 11 4 5 sediment transport effectiveness clearcutting forests in this region results in a sharp increase in suspended sediment transport by the stream network across the entire range of flows comparing the density function of post treatment and background suspended sediment yield versus streamflow shows a dramatic increase in the effectiveness of all flows following treatment fig 12 a sediment transport effectiveness curves generated by taking the first derivative of the cumulative density function for the 51 year post treatment period provide information about the distribution of flows responsible for transporting suspended sediment for the two scenarios fig 12b the peaks of the curves fig 12a indicate that flows with recurrence intervals between 2 and 5 years are responsible for transporting the majority of the sediment for both scenarios not only is the maximum effective streamflow for both scenarios different but the shape of the two curves suggests that larger flows are more effective following treatment fig 12b slopes of the cumulative density functions for the 5 recovery decades relax over time indicating that this shift in effectiveness towards higher flows exists immediately following treatment and that larger flows carry a smaller proportion of sediment as the vegetation recovers fig 12b 5 discussion 5 1 sediment yield our paired catchment results from the h j andrews experimental forest demonstrate that the sharp increases in sediment transport following logging can be confidently attributed to the increase in sediment supply and delivery to streams due to the ground disturbances associated with logging rather than increased streamflow streamflow increases modestly change the effectiveness of streams to carry sediment but are responsible for 10 of the increased suspended load and 5 of the increased bedload these results are the same regardless of whether reverse table 6 or forward supplementary table s4 regression is used to establish the post treatment differences in streamflow and despite the power law relation between streamflow and sediment transport increased sediment supply and delivery to streams contributes overwhelmingly to increased sediment yield in the first few years following harvest this effect diminishes more or less exponentially over time as both bare areas revegetate and streamflow returns towards pre treatment levels the implication of this finding is that actions to reduce sediment delivery following logging should target reducing ground disturbance above promoting hydrologic recovery of the watershed say by replanting although both sets of actions will reduce erosion rates reducing ground disturbance can be successfully accomplished by logging methods that minimize stripping vegetation and bare areas and reducing compaction most notably by suspending logs while transporting them and avoiding dragging them across the ground these methods were actually employed in ws1 as discussed below and the area and extent of soil erosion was undoubtedly less than had the site been tractor yarded dyrness 1965 maintaining vegetated strips or buffers around streams has also been shown to be an effective way of limiting direct input of sediment to streams gomi et al 2006 although such practices have become the norm on federal lands in the pacific northwest and elsewhere over the past 20 30 years they are less commonly adopted in other settings particularly in the tropics putz et al 2008 clearcut logging overall has dramatically declined as a forest management practice on federal lands and has largely been replaced by an ecosystem based management strategy aimed at creating variable stand structures and densities across the landscape north et al 2009 because both canopy removal and ground disturbance are significantly less both the hydrologic and erosional consequences of these lighter treatments are correspondingly less than those described here grant et al 2008 in the context of present pacific northwest logging practices therefore it is tempting to view the ws1 treatment and corresponding consequences as an end member case of an out dated logging disturbance this needs to be qualified on several counts first ws1 was deliberately logged without roads or skid trails and cut logs were lifted by a skyline suspension system rather than being dragged across the ground a neighboring watershed ws3 that was also a part of the original paired watershed study had only 25 of its canopy area removed by a skyline suspension system but 6 of the basin was roaded resulting in twice the area of deep soil disturbance and three times the area of compaction as ws1 dyrness 1967 as a consequence of these differences most notably as a result of mass failures initiated at roads ws3 produced four times the erosion as ws1 over the same period underscoring the importance of mass movement events triggered by logging grant and wolff 1991 so even within the limited scope of the original paired watershed study ws1 was less disturbed and produced less sediment than ws3 previous studies have also highlighted the importance of storm history in relation to the timing of logging logging was incomplete in ws1 at the time of a major regional flood in 1964 resulting in less erosion than might have otherwise occurred grant and wolff 1991 other forest practices that were common at the time that ws1 was logged may also have influenced results for example the practice of burning residual forest material slash following logging and removing woody debris from streams may have exacerbated sediment delivery and transport in the years following logging post harvest declines in suspended sediment transport in the decades following treatment even below pre harvest rates in some years fig 5b can be attributed to a combination of dense vegetation regrowth increased delivery of woody debris to the ws1 channel and possibly increased bed stability during periods between large storms all of these factors limit the applicability of an end member attribution for ws1 further context is that erosion rates overall are significantly lower by several orders of magnitude for the western cascades of oregon than for many other steep mountainous areas walling and webb 1996 much of this is due to lithologic and climatic differences our results must therefore be placed within these larger contexts in order to interpret the magnitude of land use effects and absolute degree of disturbance captured by the paired watershed study the applicability of our findings to other watersheds beyond the pacific northwest and u s is inevitably conditioned by differences in topography geology forest and soil properties and logging practices while the absolute magnitude of changes in hydrology and sediment transport cannot be widely extrapolated beyond the region we would anticipate that the very strong control of sediment delivery over hydrologic change is likely to be observed elsewhere as long as forest cover is maintained if however land use changes result in dramatic increases in impermeable areas and soil compaction particularly in tropical areas e g ziegler et al 2006 or urbanization it is likely that hydrologic changes will play an increasingly important role in mediating accelerated sediment transport our results highlight both the strengths and limitations of paired small watershed studies as a means of evaluating the effects of land management treatments on watershed processes long term paired basin studies provide an unparalleled means of empirically and quantitatively assessing the consequences of land use activities at a scale that is large enough to be relevant for land management yet small enough to provide insight into specific physical mechanisms driving changes andreassian 2004 they represent real time full scale landscape experiments and have provided a foundation for characterizing both the magnitudes and variabilities of hydrologic and geomorphic response to disturbances over time scales of years to decades such timescales are sufficient to capture a range of climatic conditions and also provide a basis for measuring recovery or return towards pre disturbance conditions it is difficult to imagine arriving at these data by any other means data from these experiments can be used to derive sediment transport and transport efficiency relationships that can be generalized to other watersheds and settings and they can be used to compare responses across biogeoclimatic gradients and help populate and test regional scale sediment transport models i e o connor et al 2014 yet the diversity of responses from paired watershed studies underscores the complexities of interpreting responses to land use disturbances in simple cause and effect terms andréassian 2004 mcdonnell et al 2018 moreover our comparison of forward and reverse regression techniques shows that different methods produce different results but similar interpretations when comparing control treatment pairs this inevitably raises the question of what is the right approach to compare controls and treatments a question for which there is no simple answer reverse regression better captures the changes in hydrograph due to climate variability but may ignore the fact that forest harvest may also alter the shape of the hydrograph forward regression is based on the assumption that pre treatment relationships between the control and treated watersheds are temporally transferable on balance we favor the reverse regression approach if the goal is to more closely capture the actual flow variability that can occur during the post treatment period due to climate non stationarity 5 2 uncertainty in the sediment budget several assumptions underlying our approach deserve comment the one potentially having the largest impact on the results of this study involves changes in the streambed elevation and flow rating curves over time large flood events such as those in 1965 and 1996 are major drivers of not only the sediment budget but also channel geometry and stream bed morphology bywater reyes et al 2018 show an increase in lookout creek mainstem of the h j andrews experimental forest bed elevation by 0 2 and 0 3 m during 1965 and 1996 floods respectively although streambed usually recovers to pre flood levels applying a static streamflow rating curve to a temporally evolving channel geometry adds a degree of uncertainty in the estimated runoff change in streambed elevation is less of an issue though when measuring streamflow using fixed flumes as in the case of ws1 and ws2 measurements of suspended sediment stopped in the 1980 s for logistical and budgetary reasons we assumed that the sediment rating curves are representative of all possible values over the entire streamflow range while the high density of measured points n 406 pre treatment and n 570 post treatment makes this a reasonable assumption for low to moderate streamflows sampled flow range 0 0001 1 52 m3 s pre treatment and 0 00025 1 46 m3 s post treatment the infrequency of high flows and therefore paucity of sediment samples collected at high streamflows may lead to underestimates of total suspended sediment yield the range of flows observed in the two watersheds during the post treatment period varied over 0 2 39 m3 s in spite of these assumptions the method appears to produce reasonably robust results we tested it by comparing suspended sediment yields estimated from a rating curve to three week composite suspended sediment samples collected proportional to streamflow for the control ws2 results from the regression approach compared favorably with the measured sediment yields r 2 0 83 n 280 furthermore our estimates of average annual background sediment yield for ws1 6 10 mg km2 suspended and 0 6 1 6 mg km2 bedload are similar to the 9 mg km2 suspended and 3 2 mg km2 bedload values reported from a nearby watershed watershed 10 equipped with an automatic pumping water sampler and bedload trap swanson et al 1982 while the focus of this study has been exclusively on the effects of clearcut logging a similar paired watershed approach could be used in other intensively managed or disturbed landscapes an intriguing possibility posed by a more widespread adoption and utilization of data from long term paired watershed studies across a range of intensively managed landscapes i e agricultural those burned by wildfire or shifting agriculture urbanized restored by various means is that we could begin to more rigorously assess the effects of land use across the full panoply of management types in various geographic settings one outcome of this type of multiple land use comparisons is that we could begin to better recognize the full range of land use effects on erosional processes and rates and populate conceptual models of disturbance e g figure 6 7 in turner and gardner 2015 with actual quantitative measurements this would help compare different land uses in terms of both their relative and absolute effects on sediment production transport and yield giving a stronger foundation for land use decisions and global sediment transport models 6 conclusions long term paired streamflow and sediment data from small experimental catchments permit disentangling the separate effects of increased sediment supply and increased runoff on sediment transport following timber harvest our results suggest that streamflow increases alone produce modest increases in sediment transport rates resulting in nearly twice as much sediment transported out of ws1 following treatment than would have been transported had the basin not been harvested changes in sediment supply following harvest have far more influence twenty fold on the sediment transport regime clearcutting ws1 increased the effectiveness of all sediment transporting flows by approximately an order of magnitude and increased the relative effectiveness of larger magnitude less frequent flows in the first decade following treatment sediment yields following harvest declined approximately exponentially over time as both sediment source areas and vegetation recovered annual suspended sediment yields returned to pre treatment levels in the first two decades following treatment yet bedload yields remained high throughout the duration of this study results of this study hold promise for better targeting land

5962,the magnitude of sediment yield following forest timber harvest is controlled by increases in both sediment supply and streamflow since the relation between sediment transport and streamflow typically follows a power law small increases in streamflow may translate into large increases in sediment transport interpreting the geomorphic effects of streamflow increases is confounded by the fact that timber harvest influences both the hydrologic regime and sediment supply of a watershed simultaneously making it difficult to isolate the streamflow effect alone here we report on a novel approach to this problem using long term data from two paired catchments located in the h j andrews experimental forest oregon usa we use observed streamflow from the treated clearcut and control watersheds to reconstruct a natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed one that represents streamflow response in conditions prior to harvest we combine this reconstructed natural streamflow time series with observed relations between streamflow and sediment transport to quantify the background sediment yield and disentangle the relative effects of changes in hydrology and sediment supply results indicate that while increases in streamflow can account for modest increases in sediment transport this is dwarfed by the increased supply of sediment that accompanies most timber harvest these results have broad relevance to forest timber harvest and fuel management practices worldwide and can be used to constrain or set bounds on likely effects of more modest i e thinning techniques keywords forest management streamflow sediment yield paired catchment 1 introduction and background felling and removing trees changes virtually all aspects of a forest s water and sediment budget canopy interception and transpiration are reduced throughfall and soil evaporation are increased and snow accumulation and melt dynamics are changed in a complex fashion at the same time soils are stripped bare and exposed to erosion by various mechanisms access roads root strength declines increasing potential for mass movements and sediment may be directly delivered to streams by ground disturbance these effects are intrinsic to forest timber harvest and fuel reduction activities although the absolute changes to hydrologic and geomorphic processes will vary with the logging

locales numerous studies have documented the effects of cutting trees and related activities on a host of physical processes including peak and low flows annual water yields suspended and bedload sediment yields and channel morphology taken together our understanding of the hydrogeomorphic consequences of forest harvest is probably better than for most other land use activities with the possible exception of agriculture although well established in the literature the paired catchment experimental design has acknowledged limitations grant et al 2008 alila et al 2009 even in carefully selected adjacent or nested basin pairs there are both fundamental and evolving differences in how water and sediment are received and processed due to climate vegetation soils topography and geology pre and post treatment periods vary in length and do not necessarily include similar ranges and sequences of flows and field measurements include a range of inherent changes in instrumentation along with measurement and analytical errors making strong statistical inference challenging some researchers have even challenged the underlying basis for comparing control treatment in terms of standard flow metrics choosing instead to compare frequency relationships alila et al 2009 there are also issues related to scaling of results as most paired catchments are limited to first and second order

watershed studies in the pacific northwest paired watershed studies examining the effects of forest timber harvest on peak flows and water yield have been particularly contentious with much of the attention focused on studies from the extensive forest lands in the u s pacific northwest despite decades of studies and for many of the reasons cited above consensus has not been reached out on the magnitude persistence and mechanisms responsible for peak flow and water yield changes following timber harvest studies examining the same long term streamflow data from paired catchment studies in the h j andrews experimental forest and other basins in western oregon for example reached conflicting conclusions on the magnitude and causes of peak flow changes setting off an extensive debate in the literature alila et al 2009 beschta et al 2000 grant et al 2008 harr 1986 jones 2000 jones and grant 1996 2001a 2001b thomas and megahan 1998 2001 there is however broad agreement that hydrologic changes following timber harvest do occur in many forest environments in the pacific northwest and beyond e g gomi et al 2005 grant et al 2008 moore and wondzell 2005 key issues affecting the magnitude of streamflow changes include the type intensity and spatial extent of timber harvesting with clearcutting representing the most extreme case while forest management practices have evolved over time and clearcutting is no longer practiced on u s federal land it is still the primary timber harvest method used across the globe the world s forests shrank by 1 3 million square kilometers between 1990 and 2015 a trend that is highly likely continue in the future world bank 2016 moreover salvage logging has also increased triggered by increased fire and drought related tree mortality due to climate change although highly location specific salvage logging operations in many ways resemble conventional clearcutting thorn et al 2018 the long term data on extreme treatment presented here provides key insights as an end member on processes responsible for land and water quality degradation following landscape scale disturbances in addition to research on the hydrologic effects of forest management many studies have investigated sediment production and transport following forest harvest in the pacific northwest and other regions e g ambers 2001 bathurst and iroumé 2014 beschta

1972 stednick 2008 stott 2005 swank et al 2014 swanson and fredriksen 1982 timber harvest operations such as felling and yarding can alter hillslope hydrology and increase surface erosion by compacting soils and removing organic litter although clear cutting alone can increase sediment production somewhat studies have shown much larger increases in sediment movement on hillslopes and in channels after slash burning bathurst and iroumé 2014 grant and wolff 1991 lewis et al 2001 mersereau and dyrness 1972 in the steep wet landscape of the pacific northwest where sediment yields from small watersheds are commonly dominated by episodic mass wasting events the most significant changes to sediment transport processes following timber harvest may be related to increased rates of mass movement including landslides and debris flows caused by reduced hillslope stability due to loss of root strength grant and wolff 1991 montgomery et al 2000 rice et al 1979 cutting riparian vegetation can also alter the sediment transport regime within a watershed by reducing wood recruitment to channels and increasing debris flow runout thereby affecting sediment storage patterns in a basin lancaster et al 2001 though beyond the scope of this study road building and the construction of landings on steep slopes can also have substantial impacts on hillslope hydrology and sediment production e g tague and band 2001 wemple et al 1996 2001 accelerated sediment production following changes in land use and land cover is widely viewed as an environmental problem causing channel bed aggradation which increases the risk of flooding and enhances bank erosion and impacting fish habitat by aggrading pools raising water temperatures and blanketing spawning gravels with fine grained sediment lisle 1989 lisle and hilton 1992 increased sediment transport rates can also affect water quality which may adversely affect drinking water supplies aquatic habitat and recreational values 1 2 coupling hydrologic and geomorphic responses to forest harvest most studies typically evaluate the effects of timber harvest on streamflow and sediment transport separately even while acknowledging that the two are intimately coupled from a geomorphic perspective changes in either the frequency or magnitude of streamflow will directly affect sediment transport specifically sediment transport q s whether as suspended load or bedload is typically related to streamflow q by a power law 1 q s aq b for both suspended and bedload transport the b exponent is typically greater than one meaning that any change in streamflow will have a corresponding exponential effect on sediment transport while both the a and b coefficients vary widely by landscape and channel system reported values of b for example range from 1 42 to 2 96 for suspended load in rivers in different physiographic settings morehead et al 2003 and 2 30 to 5 06 for bedload in gravel bed rivers in idaho emmett and wolman 2001 this relationship implies that if timber harvest increases streamflow in a transport limited basin it will also increase basin sediment transport and yield independent of any changes in sediment supply few studies have explicitly examined this coupling however and explored the relative or absolute role of either streamflow changes or increased sediment supply on sediment transport for the small number of studies that have looked at the relation between streamflow and sediment transport the literature is again often contradictory a review paper on suspended sediment transport in headwater streams for example points to both sediment supply and increased streamflow as being responsible for elevated sediment transport following timber harvest but acknowledges that was lack the ability to disentangle the relative effects of each gomi et al 2005 other review papers on forest harvest effects on water quality and quantity however treat effects on streamflow and sediment production and transport separately anderson and lockaby 2011 croke and hairsine 2006 hubbart et al 2007 grant et al 2008 moore and wondzell 2005 stednick 2008 reiter et al 2009 most case studies of forest harvest impacts report streamflow or water yield and sediment effects as if they are independent i e hotta et al 2007 karwan et al 2007 klein et al 2012 kreutzweiser and capell 2001 lewis and keppeler 2007 mcbroom et al 2008 stott 2005 stott et al 2001 swank et al 2001 webb et al 2012 grant and wolff 1991 used a multivariate streamflow model to predict sediment transport following timber harvest in oregon usa but did not separate out the effects of logging on streamflow as part of their model bywater reyes et al 2017 used generalized least squares regression model in the trask river watershed western oregon usa and concluded a lithologically mediated response of forest management on suspended sediment yield a similar analysis for the western cascades emphasized the importance of cumulative annual streamflow and physiography bywater reyes et al 2018 lewis and others 2001 lewis and keppeler 2007 also developed a multivariate sediment transport model for caspar creek in california usa and concluded that increased streamflow volume following logging was the single most important explanatory variable for elevated suspended sediment transport distinguishing between the effects of streamflow increases versus sediment supply increases caused by disturbances associated specifically with logging is important in order to target effective mitigation strategies for example if increased sediment flux down channels is driven primarily by increased streamflow then mitigation strategies should focus on reducing cutover area managing cutting pattern and block size and increasing residual stand densities on the other hand if sediment supply is driven primarily by ground disturbance and increased erosion rates following timber harvest then alternative logging strategies that limit the area of ground disruption or soil exposure and maintaining effective riparian buffers around streams to limit sediment delivery are likely to be more effective approaches to reducing basin sediment yields in this paper we utilize a reverse regression technique to evaluate the relative and absolute importance of increased sediment transport due to changes in streamflow versus increased sediment supply due to forest timber harvest alone we begin by developing a reverse regression technique for reconstructing the natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed we define natural streamflow as the expected water production from a catchment unaltered by forest management or any other disturbance we then describe how to combine measured and reconstructed streamflow for the treated watershed with observed regressions between streamflow and sediment transport pre and post harvest in order to refine estimates of suspended and bedload sediment yields due to timber harvest from both changes in streamflow and changes in sediment supply we next illustrate this approach using paired catchment data from two small and well studied sites in the h j andrews experimental forest in oregon usa finally we conclude with a discussion of the broader implications of this technique for understanding the relative effects of changes in hydrology and sediment supply to sediment yield following forest management 2 analytical approach our goal is to compare total sediment flux with and without changes in streamflow using a before after control impact baci design method from a paired catchment study in the h j andrews experimental forest in oregon usa this requires disentangling forest timber harvest related increases in basin sediment transport due to increased streamflow from changes due to increased sediment supply fig 1 here we discuss the logic underlying our approach in the following section we develop the approach analytically it is relatively straightforward to calculate total pre and post treatment sediment yields for the treated watershed that includes background yield and streamflow effects using the observed pre and post treatment streamflow time series and corresponding sediment rating curves the post treatment streamflow time series reflects any changes in hydrology that have occurred as the result of timber harvest and when combined with the post treatment sediment rating curve the resulting sediment yields incorporate the effects of both changes in streamflow and increased sediment supply along with the background sediment yield fig 1 scenario 1a this result can be compared with estimates of sediment transport that reflect the increase in streamflow alone we do this by first coupling the post treatment streamflow time series with the observed pre treatment sediment transport relationship to estimate background sediment yield and any increase or decrease in the sediment yield due to timber harvest driven changes in streamflow fig 1 scenario 1b second we couple the reconstructed natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed during the post treatment time period described in following section 2 1 with the pre treatment sediment transport relation to estimate background sediment yield transport for the treated watershed fig 1 scenario 2b subtracting this background sediment yield from scenario 1b therefore provides an estimate of sediment transport due solely to the change in streamflow 2 1 reconstructing a natural streamflow time series for the post treatment period analytically we can describe relationships between measured streamflow from the control and treated catchments using the conventional linear regression method for the pre and post treatment time periods 2 log q trt pre c 1 c 2 l o g q ctrl pre 3 log q trt post c 3 c 4 l o g q ctrl post c 5 t where q trt and q ctrl are drainage area weighted measured streamflow in the treated and control watersheds respectively t is time in years since the end of treatment subscripts pre and post refer to the pre or post treatment time periods and c1 through c5 are the regression coefficients from 2 and 3 we can reconstruct two possible streamflow time series for the treated watershed in the post treatment period using both forward and reverse regression 2 1 1 forward regression the standard forward regression technique applies the pre treatment relationship 2 to the post treatment measured streamflow in the control watershed q ctrl post to reconstruct natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed q trt post during the post treatment period as if the watershed not been harvested 4 log q trt post c 1 c 2 l o g q ctrl post this predicted streamflow q trt post is based on a simple extension of the pre treatment streamflow relationship between the control and treated watersheds while at first glance this forward regression might seem to be the logical approach several factors argue against this as the sole method first we want to reconstruct a natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed that accurately captures the flow behavior realized on the treated watershed during the post treatment period fig 2 a reconstructed natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed using forward regression will likely resemble the flow realized in the control watershed as opposed to those in the treated watershed fig 2b second we wanted to account for the fact that flows in the treated watershed following harvest were non stationary and showed a gradual return towards the pre treatment condition as forests recovered as noted by previous studies beschta et al 2000 jones and grant 1996 thomas and megahan 1998 using the stationary pre treatment relationship between control and treated watersheds would not have captured this trend and its effect on sediment yield 2 1 2 reverse regression we use the reverse regression technique to account for the fact that the streamflow behavior realized over the post treatment period may be different from those in the pre treatment period even in its natural state due to climate variability we reconstructed an additional set of natural streamflow time series based on post treatment streamflow in the treated watershed to do this we create a reverse regression of the post treatment streamflow following 3 with the treated watershed q trt post as an independent variable and control watershed streamflow q ctrl post as a dependent variable 5a log q ctrl post c 6 c 7 l o g q trt post c 8 t we use this reverse regression equation to generate alternate synthetic streamflow time series for the control watershed q ctrl post based on q trt post for the post treatment time period 5b log q ctrl post c 6 c 7 l o g q trt post c 8 t the resulting synthetic streamflow q ctrl post for the control watershed is a function of measured post treatment streamflow in the treated watershed q trt post and time since treatment t fig 2c it is worth noting here that instead of applying the inverse solution for unknown q ctrl post with known q trt post in equation 3 we establish the reverse regression 5a by reversing the roles of the explanatory variable and the response reverse regression appears to have a slight edge in terms of the width of the prediction interval parker et al 2010 we then use the transformed streamflow time series for the control watershed from 5b in the pre treatment period equation 2 to predict streamflow in the treated basin for the post treatment period as if the watershed had not been harvested fig 2d 6 log q trt post c 1 c 2 l o g q ctrl post this modeled streamflow q trt post provides an estimate of runoff for the same time period and climatic conditions as the post treatment period as illustrated in fig 2 streamflow time series derived using the reverse regression technique more closely resemble the overall shape and timing of the observed streamflow in the treated watershed than the conventional forward regression method 3 methods 3 1 study area the study watersheds are in the h j andrews experimental forest in the western cascades range of oregon fig 3 bedrock consists of tertiary volcaniclastic rocks with some isolated basalt flows sherrod and smith 2000 swanson and james 1975 the steep dissected surface of the study area has been shaped by a variety of fluvial glacial and mass wasting processes swanson and james 1975 with primary channels oriented southeast to northwest mass movements ranging from shallow failures that generate rapid moving debris flows to large massive slump earthflow complexes are primary sources of sediment and organic material to the stream hillslope soils are shallow to moderately deep and moderately productive varying with depth and topographic position rothacher et al 1967 climate is characterized by mild wet winters and warm dry summers rothacher et al 1967 annual precipitation averaged 2 300 mm per year for the duration of this study with most falling as light rain between november and april historical mean monthly temperatures range from 0 6 c in january to 17 8 c in july smith 2002 rainfall intensities are rarely high enough to generate overland flow except where ground is compacted by logging roads or skid trails the study watersheds are located in what is termed as the transient snow zone between 400 and 1 100 m elevation and can receive rain or snow harr 1986 rain on snow events in the transient snow zone commonly generate floods jennings and jones 2015 watersheds 1 ws1 and 2 ws2 are part of a paired study in which the adjacent catchments were selected for similar size aspect and topography fig 3 table 1 detailed descriptions of the watersheds are provided in grant and wolff 1991 and rothacher et al 1967 the streams draining the two catchments are steep step pool channels with gravel to boulder beds and occasional bedrock outcrops the channel of ws2 the forested control has abundant large coarse woody debris as both individual pieces and log jams distributed along the channel deposits of fine sediment sand and finer is limited to channel margins shallow pools behind woody debris and bed interstices streams generally run quite clear except during storms suspended load is primarily clay products bedload is typically a mixture of gravel sand and particulate organics ws1 was 100 clear cut from fall 1962 through summer 1966 using a skyline suspension system to minimize soil disturbance and eliminate the need for roads within the basin fig 4 logging debris was then broadcast burned in october 1966 and removed from the streams although the original specifications were to remove only wood introduced to the channel by logging while leaving the natural debris most of the pre logging legacy wood in the lower part of the watershed was also removed ws1 was reseeded in the spring 1967 with douglas fir and fill in planted in 1968 tree basal area and bole trunk biomass in ws1 have increased continuously since harvest while understory vegetation 1 4 m initially increased in density peaking above 3 000 stems ha around 1990 and then decreased as the canopy closed halpbern and lutz 2013 lutz and halpbern 2006 ws2 is vegetated primarily with 100 to 500 year old douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii mixed with western hemlock tsuga heterophylla and western red cedar thuja plicata halpbern and lutz 2013 rothacher et al 1967 logging storm and mass movement histories in ws1 have contributed to patterns of sediment production transport and export over the entire period of the study grant and wolff 1991 in particular large storms in 1964 and 1996 both with recurrence intervals of 50 100 years dominate the sediment transport history several small debris slides occurred in ws1 on hillslopes following logging during the period 1965 1972 but did not transform into debris flows grant and wolff 1991 3 2 hydrologic data and natural streamflow time series reconstruction streamflow monitoring in the h j andrews experimental forest began in october 1952 to assess the hydrologic and water quality changes associated with logging and provide baseline data for small forested catchments at different elevations rothacher et al 1967 continuous streamflow measurements are recorded at calibrated gage stations in trapezoidal flumes at the mouth of each study basin for this analysis we used 15 minute streamflow data for ws1 and ws2 johnson and rothacher 2018 along with daily precipitation and daily average air temperature data from cs2met daly and mckee 2019 cs2met station is located at an elevation of 460 m downstream from ws2 gauge fig 3 we used the split sample approach for the least squared linear regression model fitting and validation of the pre treatment regression model between the control and treated watershed streamflow observed streamflow during the pre treatment period water years 1953 1962 was divided between model fitting water years 1953 1957 and validation water years 1958 1962 periods before fitting a final model using the entire period water years 1953 1962 for the purpose of streamflow time series reconstruction during the post treatment period streamflow data for the treatment period water years 1963 1966 were excluded as the values may have been impacted by the logging activities fig 4 coefficient of determination r 2 root mean squared error rmse along with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used to evaluate model performence additionally probability density function plots were produced using observed and reconstructed streamflow time series during pre and post treatment periods to ensure the robustness of our reconstruction approach in reproducing the natural streamflow in the treated watershed 3 3 sediment sampling and rating curve development vertically integrated suspended sediment grab samples were taken throughout the pre treatment period starting in 1956 and through 1988 after treatment johnson and fredriksen 2017 in ws1 and ws2 fig 4 several additional samples were collected during high flows after 1988 but not included in this analysis reduced grab sampling frequency was because of funding and logistical issues samples were collected in pint i us pint 0 473 l bottles at the end of the flumes on the rising peak and falling limbs of storm hydrographs and during inter storm periods from october to may all samples were screened to remove particles 2 mm dried and weighed when replicate samples were collected the average sediment concentration was used bedload accumulation was measured annually between 1957 and 2016 by surveying the bottom elevation of sediment basins below the gage stations johnson and rothacher 2017 bedload accumulation volumes were then converted to mass using an average bulk density of 1 0 g cm3 a value determined from sediment bulk density measurements in the ws1 and ws2 settling ponds grant and wolff 1991 fredriksen 1970b swanson et al 1982 the total volume of material was reduced by 35 an estimate of the organic content trapped in the sediment basins each year swanson et al 1982 although the accumulation of organic material probably varied with climate basin and land use we use a constant fraction because detailed records of organic content were not available for ws1 and ws2 there may be some minor double counting of suspended sediment due to settle out in the reservoirs we believe this amount to be minimal because of the small size of the sediment basins and turbulent flows we created rating curves using the pre 1956 1966 and post treatment 1967 1988 sediment and streamflow data in order to determine sediment flux and annual yield pre treatment suspended sediment was regressed as a function of log log polynomial streamflow along with measures of periodicity in the sampling due to snow and other factors table 2 fig 5 fourier sine and cosine series of sample day and time along with days since the beginning of the water year were used to capture periodic signals in the suspended sediment samples since the treated watershed was replanted soon after harvest time since harvest was added as an additional independent variable for capturing recovery and predicting its role on post treatment sediment flux annual maximum 15 minute streamflow for the current year annual maximum 15 minute streamflow for the preceding year mean annual flow annual average mean daily temperature total annual precipitation annual maximum 1 day total precipitation and time since harvest for post treatment only were identified as a potential predictors for annual bedload yield during pre 1957 1966 and post treatment 1967 2016 periods however most of these explanatory variables were statistically insignificant see section 4 3 all the annual independent and explanatory variables were derived on a water year basis both suspended sediment and bedload data during the treatment period 1963 1966 were included in the pre treatment rating curves as mentioned previously clearcutting in ws1 began in 1962 but bedload yields in the treated watershed did not increase until after the burn in 1966 supplementary figure s1 effect of treatment activities during the 1963 1966 period on the suspended sediment rating curve was statistically non significant p 0 14 all rating curves were corrected for bias introduced by the log transformation using a smearing transformation factor uhrich et al 2014 that does not require the assumption of log normally distributed residuals duan 1983 derived suspended sediment and bedload rating curves for the pre and post treatment periods were applied to the observed pre and post treatment observed and reconstructed natural streamflow time series to create continuous sediment flux and budget we calculated three different measures of sediment yield for the post treatment time period fig 1 1a an estimate of actual sediment transported including changes in both flow regime and sediment supply 2b the predicted amount of background sediment yield if the basin had been left in a natural state and 1b the predicted amount of background sediment transported along with additional sediment produced due to treatment induced changes in streamflow the portion of sediment attributed to changes in streamflow alone can be computed by subtracting the background 2b from 1b 4 results 4 1 effect of forest treatment on streamflow and water yield comparison of streamflow for ws1 treated and ws2 control using a linear regression model with forest harvest as a binary variable pre treatment 0 post treatment 1 shows a statistically significant shift p 0 001 in the streamflow relationship between the two watersheds due to forest harvest table 3 there is a noticeable shift in the distribution of flows during the post treatment as compared to pre treatment period more so in the treated watershed than those in the control fig 6 much of the shift in streamflow was in the lower range of flows i e left side of the probability density plot we found no statistically significant impact of treatment on annual 15 minute maximum streamflow p 0 67 for both treatment and interaction terms these results are consistent with previous findings showing an increase in streamflow following treatment particularly for small storms beschta et al 2000 jones and grant 1996 thomas and megahan 1998 in terms of annual water yield there is an increase in the treated watershed streamflow by 10 or 136 mm year over the 51 years of post treatment period fig 7 we attribute the increase in water yield to forest harvest as there was no statistically significant difference based on one way anova with post hoc tukey hsd between the pre and post treatment annual precipitation p 0 8 or temperature p 0 8 we investigated the watershed recovery in terms of streamflow using the aforementioned linear regression model after dividing the post treatment data into five recovery decades i e 1967 1976 1977 1986 1987 1996 1997 2006 2007 2016 however both treatment and interaction term estimates remained statistically significant throughout the 5 recovery decades supplementary table s1 this suggests that even after 51 years of watershed recovery post treatment streamflow remains different from the pre treatment period stage streamflow rating curves for ws1 and ws2 have been recently updated using new calibration points between 1996 and 2017 and streamflow beginning water year 1999 was re calculated henshaw et al 2018 as a result annual water yield declined between 18 and 24 in ws1 and by 2 in ws2 when compared with the water yield estimated using the original rating curves although we believe the updated ratings curves are more accurate applying multiple rating curves can produce abrupt changes in the streamflow rate and hence complicates long term analysis to further investigate the shifts in streamflow cumulative monthly random residual time series of streamflow for the treated and control watersheds and precipitation from cs2met were plotted from october 1952 to september 2017 fig 8 monthly streamflow and precipitation residual time series with respect to the mean standardized values were developed using the approach described by mair and fares 2010 overall the trends in ws1 and ws2 streamflow generally follow the observed trends in the precipitation an upward shift in ws1 and ws2 streamflow is evident half way through the timber harvest likely driven by the large storms between november 1964 and january 1965 the combined precipitation during this time was over 1900 mm making it the wettest consecutive three months on record while ws2 streamflow following this storm continued to decline driven by a downward trend in precipitation streamflow in ws1 showed the highest 10 years of sustained increase immediately after the broadcast burn in the fall of 1966 this beginning of sustained increase in ws1 streamflow was despite below average precipitation from 1966 to 1970 these diverging shifts in ws1 and ws2 streamflow and precipitation strongly suggest timber harvest caused the increase in ws1 streamflow another noticeable downward shift in ws1 streamflow occurred between 2001 and 2017 which may have been driven by recent below normal precipitation a similar recovery pattern is also evident from the double mass analysis fig 7 4 2 reconstructed ws1 natural streamflow as described earlier we used two approaches based on forward and reverse regression techniques to reconstruct the natural streamflow time series for ws1 irrespective of the time period there was a strong relation between the treated and control watershed streamflow with prediction accuracy over 90 supplementary figure s2 table 4 performance of the regression model did not diminish when applied against an independent sample for validation fig 9 giving us confidence in the temporal transferability of the model time since recovery variable t in equation 5a was a statistically significant p 0 05 predictor along with the treated watershed streamflow of post treatment streamflow in the control watershed overall the reverse regression technique performed better nse 0 99 in transferring the pre treatment streamflow characteristics of ws1 and ws2 to the post treatment period when compared with the forward regression nse 0 91 the forward regression reconstruction method tends to over estimate streamflow especially during low flows fig 9 and is unable to reproduce the observed streamflow distribution during the post treatment period fig 6b reconstructed streamflow using forward regression largely mimics the bi modal post treatment streamflow distribution in the control watershed as opposed to the tri modal distribution observed in the treated watershed in contrast the reverse regression technique as described in section 2 1 2 was able to maintain the tri modal streamflow distribution behavior in the treated watershed 4 3 sediment rating curves and recovery among the candidates of independent variables only streamflow fourier terms sin k 1 and cos k 1 were statistically significant in predicting the pre treatment suspended sediment flux table 2 for the post treatment suspended sediment flux only streamflow sin k 1 and time since harvest were statistically significant using the first power of streamflow alone explained 82 and 83 of the variability in the suspended sediment flux during the pre and post treatment periods respectively supplementary figure s3 hence adding these additional predictors improved the model by 4 8 in terms of additional explained variance time since treatment alone increased the post treatment rating curve model r 2 by 5 akaike information criteria aic during the pre treatment period was 590 for first power streamflow only model 1 and 509 for the final model in the post treatment period aic declined the lower the aic the better the model from 1 175 for first power of streamflow only model 1 017 for first power streamflow and time since harvest model to 822 for the final model table 2 comparing the observed and predicted suspended sediment flux along with 95 prediction interval showed a similar relatively narrow range i e a high degree of precision of the regression results fig 5a approximately 96 of the data points are within the range of values predicted by this regression model the bedload yield was related only to annual maximum 15 minute streamflow during the pre treatment and maximum streamflow and time since harvest during the post treatment period supplementary figure s3 table 2 mean annual streamflow annual precipitation average annual mean daily temperature annual maximum 1 day total precipitation and annual maximum 15 minute streamflow of the preceding year were all statistically insignificant p 0 05 in terms of prediction interval only two data points water years 1991 and 1973 were outside the bound for post treatment and none for the pre treatment fig 5b the linear model over predicted the annual bedload yield in 1991 3 mg km2 observed vs 13 mg km2 and under predicted in 1973 86 mg km2 observed vs 23 mg km2 a relatively wide range of prediction interval for the pre treatment regression model suggests higher prediction uncertainty only 62 of the variation in pre treatment bedload yield can be explained by this linear model as opposed to 80 during the post treatment timber harvest shows a statistically significant p 0 001 impact on sediment streamflow relationships table 5 for suspended sediment there is a statistically significant shift in both slope and intercept terms following treatment in contrast for bedload only a shift in intercept was statistically significant this may very well be driven by the differences in the length of record suspended sediment data was limited to 1957 1988 and hence limited recovery time when compared with bedload data which extends until 2016 the sediment flux to streamflow relationship shows a gradual recovery supplementary tables s2 s3 the annual maximum streamflow and bedload sediment relationship by recovery decade shows that the forest harvest has a significant impact on the intercept but not on the slope of the relationship supplementary figure s4 4 4 post treatment sediment yields we estimate 4 774 mg km2 of suspended sediment and 2 391 mg km2 of bedload was transported out of ws1 in the 51 years following treatment giving average annual yields of 94 and 47 mg km2 for suspended and bedload respectively fig 10 table 6 total average annual yield was 140 mg km2 examining the total pre and post treatment sediment yields from ws1 through time reveals both the initial increase and roughly exponential decline in sediment yields following treatment fig 10 annual sediment output from ws1 remained relatively constant 22 mg km2 before and during the treatment period but increased dramatically after the broadcast burn following timber harvest in 1966 while suspended load declined to pre treatment levels in the first two decades following treatment bedload remained elevated causing the bedload proportion of the total load to increase through time bedload accounted for only 17 of the total sediment budget during the pre treatment period but increased to almost 97 of the total sediment output during the last decade i e 2011 2017 background bedload and suspended sediment yields estimated using the reconstructed natural streamflow time series based on the reverse regression technique were 32 and 284 mg km2 respectively table 6 this translates into a mean annual total bedload suspended sediment yield of 6 mg km2 these estimates of background sediment yields are within the range of erosion rates reported for the pacific northwest swanson et al 1982 changes in sediment supply overwhelmingly dominate streamflow in terms of increased sediment flux changes in streamflow alone account for 477 mg km2 10 of the suspended load and 113 mg km2 5 of the bedload over the post treatment period increase in suspended sediment yield due to increase in sediment supply is 84 of the measured post treatment total suspended sediment yield in terms of bedload 93 of the total measured bedload yield during the post treatment period can be attributed to an increase in sediment supply the first 10 years following treatment yielded 75 of the total post treatment suspended load but only 33 of the bedload fig 11 suspended load continued to decrease dramatically in the subsequent 2 recovery decades with 14 of the total post treatment yield occurring during decade 2 9 during decade 3 2 during decade 4 and 1 during decade 5 bedload yield did not decrease at the same rate 22 22 14 and 9 during the recovery decades 2 3 4 and 5 respectively a similar recovery was noted in the cumulative suspended sediment yield attributed to increase in streamflow both total and increased streamflow attributed suspended sediment stabilized after 1999 we do not see a similar recovery pattern in the bedload yield attributed to change in streamflow rather bedload shows a gradual annual increase with a linear slope of 2 34 mg km2 r 2 0 98 in contrast cumulative background suspended and bedload yields increased annually by 5 59 mg km2 r 2 0 99 and 0 64 mg km2 r 2 0 97 respectively the first 10 years following treatment yielded 32 of the total post treatment suspended load attributed to increase in streamflow which is significantly higher than the 16 of the cumulative background suspended sediment yield and comparable to 33 of the total bedload driven by increased streamflow the background bedload yield in the first 10 years following treatment was 11 of the total bedload as compared with 26 of the bedload attributed to increase in streamflow fig 11 4 5 sediment transport effectiveness clearcutting forests in this region results in a sharp increase in suspended sediment transport by the stream network across the entire range of flows comparing the density function of post treatment and background suspended sediment yield versus streamflow shows a dramatic increase in the effectiveness of all flows following treatment fig 12 a sediment transport effectiveness curves generated by taking the first derivative of the cumulative density function for the 51 year post treatment period provide information about the distribution of flows responsible for transporting suspended sediment for the two scenarios fig 12b the peaks of the curves fig 12a indicate that flows with recurrence intervals between 2 and 5 years are responsible for transporting the majority of the sediment for both scenarios not only is the maximum effective streamflow for both scenarios different but the shape of the two curves suggests that larger flows are more effective following treatment fig 12b slopes of the cumulative density functions for the 5 recovery decades relax over time indicating that this shift in effectiveness towards higher flows exists immediately following treatment and that larger flows carry a smaller proportion of sediment as the vegetation recovers fig 12b 5 discussion 5 1 sediment yield our paired catchment results from the h j andrews experimental forest demonstrate that the sharp increases in sediment transport following logging can be confidently attributed to the increase in sediment supply and delivery to streams due to the ground disturbances associated with logging rather than increased streamflow streamflow increases modestly change the effectiveness of streams to carry sediment but are responsible for 10 of the increased suspended load and 5 of the increased bedload these results are the same regardless of whether reverse table 6 or forward supplementary table s4 regression is used to establish the post treatment differences in streamflow and despite the power law relation between streamflow and sediment transport increased sediment supply and delivery to streams contributes overwhelmingly to increased sediment yield in the first few years following harvest this effect diminishes more or less exponentially over time as both bare areas revegetate and streamflow returns towards pre treatment levels the implication of this finding is that actions to reduce sediment delivery following logging should target reducing ground disturbance above promoting hydrologic recovery of the watershed say by replanting although both sets of actions will reduce erosion rates reducing ground disturbance can be successfully accomplished by logging methods that minimize stripping vegetation and bare areas and reducing compaction most notably by suspending logs while transporting them and avoiding dragging them across the ground these methods were actually employed in ws1 as discussed below and the area and extent of soil erosion was undoubtedly less than had the site been tractor yarded dyrness 1965 maintaining vegetated strips or buffers around streams has also been shown to be an effective way of limiting direct input of sediment to streams gomi et al 2006 although such practices have become the norm on federal lands in the pacific northwest and elsewhere over the past 20 30 years they are less commonly adopted in other settings particularly in the tropics putz et al 2008 clearcut logging overall has dramatically declined as a forest management practice on federal lands and has largely been replaced by an ecosystem based management strategy aimed at creating variable stand structures and densities across the landscape north et al 2009 because both canopy removal and ground disturbance are significantly less both the hydrologic and erosional consequences of these lighter treatments are correspondingly less than those described here grant et al 2008 in the context of present pacific northwest logging practices therefore it is tempting to view the ws1 treatment and corresponding consequences as an end member case of an out dated logging disturbance this needs to be qualified on several counts first ws1 was deliberately logged without roads or skid trails and cut logs were lifted by a skyline suspension system rather than being dragged across the ground a neighboring watershed ws3 that was also a part of the original paired watershed study had only 25 of its canopy area removed by a skyline suspension system but 6 of the basin was roaded resulting in twice the area of deep soil disturbance and three times the area of compaction as ws1 dyrness 1967 as a consequence of these differences most notably as a result of mass failures initiated at roads ws3 produced four times the erosion as ws1 over the same period underscoring the importance of mass movement events triggered by logging grant and wolff 1991 so even within the limited scope of the original paired watershed study ws1 was less disturbed and produced less sediment than ws3 previous studies have also highlighted the importance of storm history in relation to the timing of logging logging was incomplete in ws1 at the time of a major regional flood in 1964 resulting in less erosion than might have otherwise occurred grant and wolff 1991 other forest practices that were common at the time that ws1 was logged may also have influenced results for example the practice of burning residual forest material slash following logging and removing woody debris from streams may have exacerbated sediment delivery and transport in the years following logging post harvest declines in suspended sediment transport in the decades following treatment even below pre harvest rates in some years fig 5b can be attributed to a combination of dense vegetation regrowth increased delivery of woody debris to the ws1 channel and possibly increased bed stability during periods between large storms all of these factors limit the applicability of an end member attribution for ws1 further context is that erosion rates overall are significantly lower by several orders of magnitude for the western cascades of oregon than for many other steep mountainous areas walling and webb 1996 much of this is due to lithologic and climatic differences our results must therefore be placed within these larger contexts in order to interpret the magnitude of land use effects and absolute degree of disturbance captured by the paired watershed study the applicability of our findings to other watersheds beyond the pacific northwest and u s is inevitably conditioned by differences in topography geology forest and soil properties and logging practices while the absolute magnitude of changes in hydrology and sediment transport cannot be widely extrapolated beyond the region we would anticipate that the very strong control of sediment delivery over hydrologic change is likely to be observed elsewhere as long as forest cover is maintained if however land use changes result in dramatic increases in impermeable areas and soil compaction particularly in tropical areas e g ziegler et al 2006 or urbanization it is likely that hydrologic changes will play an increasingly important role in mediating accelerated sediment transport our results highlight both the strengths and limitations of paired small watershed studies as a means of evaluating the effects of land management treatments on watershed processes long term paired basin studies provide an unparalleled means of empirically and quantitatively assessing the consequences of land use activities at a scale that is large enough to be relevant for land management yet small enough to provide insight into specific physical mechanisms driving changes andreassian 2004 they represent real time full scale landscape experiments and have provided a foundation for characterizing both the magnitudes and variabilities of hydrologic and geomorphic response to disturbances over time scales of years to decades such timescales are sufficient to capture a range of climatic conditions and also provide a basis for measuring recovery or return towards pre disturbance conditions it is difficult to imagine arriving at these data by any other means data from these experiments can be used to derive sediment transport and transport efficiency relationships that can be generalized to other watersheds and settings and they can be used to compare responses across biogeoclimatic gradients and help populate and test regional scale sediment transport models i e o connor et al 2014 yet the diversity of responses from paired watershed studies underscores the complexities of interpreting responses to land use disturbances in simple cause and effect terms andréassian 2004 mcdonnell et al 2018 moreover our comparison of forward and reverse regression techniques shows that different methods produce different results but similar interpretations when comparing control treatment pairs this inevitably raises the question of what is the right approach to compare controls and treatments a question for which there is no simple answer reverse regression better captures the changes in hydrograph due to climate variability but may ignore the fact that forest harvest may also alter the shape of the hydrograph forward regression is based on the assumption that pre treatment relationships between the control and treated watersheds are temporally transferable on balance we favor the reverse regression approach if the goal is to more closely capture the actual flow variability that can occur during the post treatment period due to climate non stationarity 5 2 uncertainty in the sediment budget several assumptions underlying our approach deserve comment the one potentially having the largest impact on the results of this study involves changes in the streambed elevation and flow rating curves over time large flood events such as those in 1965 and 1996 are major drivers of not only the sediment budget but also channel geometry and stream bed morphology bywater reyes et al 2018 show an increase in lookout creek mainstem of the h j andrews experimental forest bed elevation by 0 2 and 0 3 m during 1965 and 1996 floods respectively although streambed usually recovers to pre flood levels applying a static streamflow rating curve to a temporally evolving channel geometry adds a degree of uncertainty in the estimated runoff change in streambed elevation is less of an issue though when measuring streamflow using fixed flumes as in the case of ws1 and ws2 measurements of suspended sediment stopped in the 1980 s for logistical and budgetary reasons we assumed that the sediment rating curves are representative of all possible values over the entire streamflow range while the high density of measured points n 406 pre treatment and n 570 post treatment makes this a reasonable assumption for low to moderate streamflows sampled flow range 0 0001 1 52 m3 s pre treatment and 0 00025 1 46 m3 s post treatment the infrequency of high flows and therefore paucity of sediment samples collected at high streamflows may lead to underestimates of total suspended sediment yield the range of flows observed in the two watersheds during the post treatment period varied over 0 2 39 m3 s in spite of these assumptions the method appears to produce reasonably robust results we tested it by comparing suspended sediment yields estimated from a rating curve to three week composite suspended sediment samples collected proportional to streamflow for the control ws2 results from the regression approach compared favorably with the measured sediment yields r 2 0 83 n 280 furthermore our estimates of average annual background sediment yield for ws1 6 10 mg km2 suspended and 0 6 1 6 mg km2 bedload are similar to the 9 mg km2 suspended and 3 2 mg km2 bedload values reported from a nearby watershed watershed 10 equipped with an automatic pumping water sampler and bedload trap swanson et al 1982 while the focus of this study has been exclusively on the effects of clearcut logging a similar paired watershed approach could be used in other intensively managed or disturbed landscapes an intriguing possibility posed by a more widespread adoption and utilization of data from long term paired watershed studies across a range of intensively managed landscapes i e agricultural those burned by wildfire or shifting agriculture urbanized restored by various means is that we could begin to more rigorously assess the effects of land use across the full panoply of management types in various geographic settings one outcome of this type of multiple land use comparisons is that we could begin to better recognize the full range of land use effects on erosional processes and rates and populate conceptual models of disturbance e g figure 6 7 in turner and gardner 2015 with actual quantitative measurements this would help compare different land uses in terms of both their relative and absolute effects on sediment production transport and yield giving a stronger foundation for land use decisions and global sediment transport models 6 conclusions long term paired streamflow and sediment data from small experimental catchments permit disentangling the separate effects of increased sediment supply and increased runoff on sediment transport following timber harvest our results suggest that streamflow increases alone produce modest increases in sediment transport rates resulting in nearly twice as much sediment transported out of ws1 following treatment than would have been transported had the basin not been harvested changes in sediment supply following harvest have far more influence twenty fold on the sediment transport regime clearcutting ws1 increased the effectiveness of all sediment transporting flows by approximately an order of magnitude and increased the relative effectiveness of larger magnitude less frequent flows in the first decade following treatment sediment yields following harvest declined approximately exponentially over time as both sediment source areas and vegetation recovered annual suspended sediment yields returned to pre treatment levels in the first two decades following treatment yet bedload yields remained high throughout the duration of this study results of this study hold promise for better targeting land management and restoration activities to minimize the long term impacts consequences and legacies of intensive land use disturbances declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

introduction permeability is the most imperative building property of soils and it is used for understanding infiltration runoff drainage and settlement process mishra et al 2010 also the management of water resources drinking water supply water detonations ground water storage and surface water storage are highly affected with seepage properties of soil seepage is connected specifically to permeability of soil media k determined by darcy s law darcy 1856 permeability is a basic soil property depicting the hydraulic activities of unsaturated soils and it is identified with the properties of water and soil dong et al 2018 the permeability of various types of soils such as silty clay loamy sandy varies wildly it is demanding to decide the permeability for the reason that of the variation in mineral composition and the multifaceted texture of the soil dong et al 2018 the permeability is likely the most vital hydrogeological parameter alongside other parameters as it affects the stream of flow and relocation of contaminants underneath the ground surface particularly in aquifers system and soils li 2014 the variability in permeability creates problem in construction of drainage structures canals check dams and other civil and soil water structures the permeability of soil may be determined in the field or in the laboratory however field measurement of soil permeability is very complex generally expensive work concentrated and tedious vienken and dietrich 2011 fereshte 2014 a number of methods have been developed to estimate the permeability of soil mckinlay and safiullah 1980 lapierre et al 1990 vereecken et al 1990 alyamani and sen 1993 fredlund et al 1994 pape et al 1999 nelson 2005 shahnazari and vahabikashi 2011 but these methods require complex parameters and have limitations assumption and low accuracy therefore indirect techniques have been developed to simulate the permeability of soil based on basic soil properties such as soil texture sand silt and clay particle density bulk density and total carbon content using data driven algorithms akbulut 2005 donohue and wensrich 2008 ghanbarian alavijeh et al 2010 nosrati et al 2012 emami et al 2012 sihag et al 2017 sihag 2018 the data driven algorithms have no limitations assumptions and also have higher simulation accuracy as compared to other models chapuis 2012 it is the

temperature estimation kisi et al 2015 2017 singh et al 2018a b have been reported by the researchers after review of potential of different algorithms authors decided that mlp svm canfis random forest decision tree algorithms and their wavelet transform may be applied to predict the permeability of soil some of basic questions rose related to pre handling of vectors such as how many input vectors what should be specific relation between input and output vectors for development of the best model the gamma test gt is determination of the meaningful relation between input and output vector in non linear modelling techniques during pre development of vector the input and output relation were chosen based on least value of gamma test and standard error se value noori et al 2011 the general details of gamma test may be obtained from given citation remesan et al 2008 lafdani et al 2013 the gamma test gt is one of the most popular techniques to assess the most governing input and output relation singh et al 2018a b the low correlation between input and output combination and large number of input vector have high complication and high chance of overfitting of developed model kumar et al 2018 this was the reason for applying the gamma test for selection of governing input vectors to reduce complexity and chance of overfitting of models the present study was undertaken with the objectives as a to select specific input output vector relation based on gamma test b to concentrate on development of techniques for prediction of the soil permeability from soil texture sand

is a supervised learning method and it is combination of different hyper parameters that support in approximating complex connection between input and output ayyadevara 2018 the hyper parameters such as learning rate momentum hidden layers iteration and number of neurons were used during the development of mlp system the mlp networks were made up of three different layers viz information input hidden and yield output the information level layer is generally the independent factor and utilized to simulate the yield output level layer kumar et al 2018 the hidden level layer is utilized to change the information factors into a simulated yield the activation function is used to change the information signal into a yield signal in mlp system in present scenario tan hyperbolic transfer function was used because this function is marginally more rapid and better than logistic and sigmoid transfer functions maier and dandy 1998 the learning algorithm adjusts weights and biases for minimizing the overall inaccuracy in mlp kisi 2007 the levenberg marquardt algorithm is highly capable to minimize the overall error rezaeianzadeh et al 2010 in this scenario hyper parameter namely learning rate 0 2 momentum 0 1 iteration 1000 hidden level 1 and neuron 2 to 40 were applied for development of efficient model table 2 the facts and fundamental literature of mlp was reported by these researchers kisi 2007 rezaeianzadeh et al 2010 singh et al 2016a the mlp and canfis models were developed using neurosolution 5 0 2 2 2 canfis algorithm the canfis algorithm is the combined form

scenario gaussian membership functions mfs and takagi sugeno kang fuzzy tsk fuzzy model were applied for development of canfis model the value of mfs 2 to 6 threshold 0 001 and iteration 1000 were used to develop canfis model table 2 the information and elementary concept about canfis can be assessed from several literature tabari et al 2012 aziz et al 2013 pradhan et al 2018 singh et al 2018b 2 2 3 svm algorithm svm is a supervised learning technique which is applied to solve the prediction pattern recognitions regression and classification problem svm algorithm is frequently used more than other machine learning techniques for example neural systems are firmly identified with structural risk minimization hypotheses in statistics smola et al 2007 the basic theory of svm algorithm vapnik 1998 was developed for solving regression and classification problem in this study radial basis kernel function was used to develop svm model and the hyper parameters of model were defined using a large number of trials in modeling approaches table 2 details about technique are found in the literature kisi and cimen 2010 chen et al 2010 kisi 2015 barzegar et al 2017 yu et al 2017 r studio 3 5 1 was used for development of svm rf and dt models 2 2 4 dt algorithm a decision tree is used for prediction of a target by learning decision methods the decision tree is a supervised learning data driven technique and used for solving the regression classification and prediction by learning decision techniques it is constructing of groups as a tree structure and partitions a data set into smaller subsets a decision tree is started from the root node known as the first parent each node can be split into left and right child nodes these nodes can be further split and they themselves become parent nodes of their resulting children nodes in the meantime a related decision tree is gradually created the last outcome is a tree with decision hubs nods and leaf hubs a decision hub has at least two branches leaf hub is a representation to an arrangement the highest decision hub in a tree which relates to the finest forecaster is called root hub lee et al 2013 fakhari and moghadam 2013 nasridinov et al 2013 the details of parameters used in decision tree algorithm is presented in table 2 similar studies have been conducted by various researchers harb et al 2009 loh 2014 fakhari and moghadam 2013 czajkowski and kretowski 2016 nagalla et al 2017 2 2 5 rf algorithm rf algorithm was first presented by leo breiman in 2001 rf algorithm is a flexible simply hyper parameter optimization and easily applicable machine learning algorithm rf algorithm avoids avoiding overfitting problem during model development rf algorithm can be applied to solve a classification regression strategy and prediction problems additionally excessive superiority of rf algorithm is that it is very simply to determine the virtual importance of respectively feature in the forecasting in regression tree indicator derives the numerical values instead of class labels utilized by the arbitrary tree classifier karimi et al 2018 the rf model is built though fitting single trees in group bagging system the error of the bagged trees is equivalent that of the single tree while the error of bagging is decreased by decrease in the relationship between trees hastie et al 2009 the full developed trees are not pruned back and it is one of the real points of interest of random forest model over other tree strategies quinlan 1992 rf algorithm is developed based on the decision of the pruning techniques and not the variable choice measures influence the execution of tree based methods pal and mather 2003 the ideal parameters were required for designing random forest model given in table 2 the fundamental theory of random forest can acquire from chen et al 2017 singh et al 2017c shiri 2018 2 2 6 wavelet transform the wavelet transform algorithm is an efficient and powerful mathematical algorithm that gives an optimum time frequency representation of an interpreted data in the time and frequency perspective the modeling of permeability or hydraulic conductivity processes using the initial data that is without or with zero resolution makes the internal mechanism problematic to understand resolution of component is the separation of data into various frequency components in present the study haar wavelet algorithm haar 1910 was used to determine the wavelet transform the literature of wavelet algorithm is well known and described by researcher si and zeleke 2005 goyal 2014 hu and si 2016 the original discrete time series c0 t can be resolved by atrous decomposition algorithm as 2 c r t l h l c r 1 t 2 r l r 1 2 3 w r t c r 1 t c r t r 1 2 where h l is the discrete low pass filter cr t and wr t r 1 2 are respectively sub time series of scale coefficient and wavelet coefficient at rth resolution stage in the current research five data driven algorithms and wavelets models were applied to predict permeability of soil and also performance of algorithms were assessed based on rmse wi nse pi and cc values obtained from observed and simulated values of permeability of soil during training and testing periods the qualitative results of different algorithms mlp canfis svm dt and rf and wavelets w mlp w canfis w dt w rf models were analyzed in terms of scatter plot and time series plot between observed and predicted permeability of soil during testing period gamma test was applied to evaluate most dominant input vector for prediction of soil permeability sensitivity was analyzed with increasing and decreasing value of each input vector the flow chart of model development is presented in fig 2 2 3 model performance evaluation the model performance was estimated by different statistical indicates namely nash sutcliffe efficiency nse performance index pi root mean square error rmse willmott s index of agreement wi and correlation coefficient cc the details of statistical indicator can be assessed from given citations rezaie balf et al 2018 singh 2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 gamma test the gamma test result is illustrated in table 3 after masking the sand silt and clay from inputs vector values of gamma and se had high deviation with respect to no masking 111111 masking of pd bd and oc also showed deviation with respect to no masking but it was less compared to masking sand silt and clay therefore sand silt and clay input vectors affected the soil permeability output vector more compared to other input pd bd and oc vectors it was observed that clay particle of soil extremely affects the permeability of soil in non linear relation the particle density of soil had the least effect on soil permeability after analyzing twenty two models based on minimum value of gamma and se model 20 having governing inputs as sand silt clay and oc was selected as it had minimum values of gamma 0 05614 and se 0 00424 the gamma and se values of all models are presented by histogram plot in fig 3 3 2 wavelet and non wavelet data driven algorithms the results of mlp canfis svm dt and rf algorithms were analyzed into two phases table 4 first phase was training model development phase and another testing phase for validating developed model the performance of models were assessed based on higher values of wi close to 1 for good and close to 0 for poor nse close to 1 for good and close to 0 for poor cc close to 1 for good and close to 1 for poor and least values of rmse close to 0 for good and higher values for poor pi close to 0 for good and higher values for poor during both phases the rf model has value of nse 0 827 wi 0 950 cc 0 910 rmse 2 789 cm hr pi 0 212 in training phase and nse 0 849 wi 0 956 cc 0 922 rmse 2 304 cm hr pi 0 165 in testing phase after comparing the results of mlp canfis svm dt and rf models models capability rf dt svm canfis mlp was determined for soil permeability prediction the performance of all models was found to be satisfactory the rf and dt models had higher values of wi nse cc and least values of rmse pi during training and testing phases as compared to mlp canfis svm models it was finally observed that random forest and decision tree models outperformed other models for prediction of soil permeability the wt was innovative algorithm coupled with data driven algorithms namely mlp canfis svm rf and dt models in the current study the results of wavelet based data driven algorithm viz w mlp w canfis w svm w dt and w rf models are presented in table 4 the w rf algorithm estimated the best values of nse 0 880 wi 0 970 cc 0 942 rmse 1 725 cm hr and pi 0 144 during model calibration and also the best values of nse 0 900 wi 0 972 cc 0 950 rmse 1 530 cm hr and pi 0 108 during validation of model based on statistical indices of all developed models during training and testing phase it was observed that all the models were capable to predict the permeability of soil after comparing all developed models output it was also observed that w dt and w rf algorithms outperformed w mlp w canfis and w svm models for prediction of soil permeability it was observed that the results of data driven algorithms were mainly dependent on their hyper parameters the defining of appropriate value of hyper parameters in data driven modelling is very complex in the current study this was solved by trial and error so this may be reason behind the lower performance of mlp canfis and svm algorithms as compared to rf and dt models the performance of all developed models may be improved by optimizing the hyper parameters of algorithm by different metaheuristic optimizing techniques it was seen that all data driven algorithms results were improved by coupling wavelet algorithms in soil permeability prediction it was also observed that wavelet based data driven algorithms performance was better than only data driven algorithms the qualitative analysis of developed data driven models were assessed through visual interpretation of time series scatter plots and taylor diagram the time series and scatter diagram were plotted between observed soil permeability and predicted soil permeability during testing phase figs 4 6 it may be inferred from time series and scatter plots that mlp and canfis models had high deviation from observed soil permeability compared to svm dt and rf models taylor diagram was plotted between standard deviation and correlation of observed and simulated by different models it was observed from taylor diagram that rf model has the better correlation as compared to other models 3 3 sensitivity investigation of different variables the prospective of gamma test for input assortment and potential of independent vector in regression problem can be evaluated through sensitivity analysis the best model random forest was used to measure sensitivity the sensitivity analysis was achieved through 10 increase and decrease of the parameter values the sensitivity investigation singh et al 2018a was carried out in terms of relative sensitivity rs the sensitivity investigation results of developed model are illustrated in table 5 it was observed from results that bulk density and particle density have values of rs 1 481 and 1 294 in training and 0 487 and 0 648 in testing of model the rs values for soil texture parameters clay sand and silt were estimated as 23 957 17 894 and 18 177 respectively during the development stage of model similarly the rs values of clay sand and silt were calculated as 18 487 15 012 and 16 254 in validation stage of developed model after comparing results of all variables it was observed that soil texture clay sand silt was the most sensitive parameter for prediction of soil permeability by way of data driven algorithms in the same way it was also observed that clay soil particles has the highest influence on the soil permeability as compared to other parameters based on sensitivity analysis results it can be stated that the rank of sensitive parameters was clay silt sand oc bd pd for prediction of soil permeability by the data driven algorithms the minimum and maximum permeability of soil values varied from 1 03 to 18 39 cm hr the permeability of soil was found to be depending on large numbers of parameters such as percentage of sand silt clay and organic carbon soil salinity compaction of soil viscosity of water pore size distribution etc the bulk and particles density were dependent on soil texture in the present study most of the soil samples were sandy sandy loam and loam therefore the deviation in bulk and particles density of soil was found to be less this may be the reason for less effect of bulk and particles density on permeability of soil 4 summary and conclusions this research was conducted in three parts first part was collection of soil sample from different locations of field second part was analysis of soil samples in laboratory and third part was analysis and modelling of data in third part five different non wavelet data driven algorithms mlp canfis svm dt and rf and wavelet data driven algorithms w mlp w canfis w svm w dt and w rf were applied for simulation of soil permeability based on various physical properties of soil after analyzing the results of gamma test it was concluded that soil particle viz sand silt clay and oc parameters are appropriate input combination among sand silt clay bd pd and oc parameters for prediction of soil permeability these selected parameters can

introduction permeability is the most imperative building property of soils and it is used for understanding infiltration runoff drainage and settlement process mishra et al 2010 also the management of water resources drinking water supply water detonations ground water storage and surface water storage are highly affected with seepage properties of soil seepage is connected specifically to permeability of soil media k determined by darcy s law darcy 1856 permeability is a basic soil property depicting the hydraulic activities of unsaturated soils and it is identified with the properties of water and soil dong et al 2018 the permeability of various types of soils such as silty clay loamy sandy varies wildly it is demanding to decide the permeability for the reason that of the variation in mineral composition and the multifaceted texture of the soil dong et al 2018 the permeability is likely the most vital hydrogeological parameter alongside other parameters as it affects the stream of flow and relocation of contaminants underneath the ground surface particularly in aquifers system and soils li 2014 the variability in permeability creates problem in construction of drainage structures canals check dams and other civil and soil water structures the permeability of soil may be determined in the field or in the laboratory however field measurement of soil permeability is very complex generally expensive work concentrated and tedious vienken and dietrich 2011 fereshte 2014 a number of methods have been developed to estimate the permeability of soil mckinlay and safiullah 1980 lapierre et al 1990 vereecken et al 1990 alyamani and sen 1993 fredlund et al 1994 pape et al 1999 nelson 2005 shahnazari and vahabikashi 2011 but these methods require complex parameters and have limitations assumption and low accuracy therefore indirect techniques have been developed to simulate the permeability of soil based on basic soil properties such as soil texture sand silt and clay particle density bulk density and total carbon content using data driven algorithms akbulut 2005 donohue and wensrich 2008 ghanbarian alavijeh et al 2010 nosrati et al 2012 emami et al 2012 sihag et al 2017 sihag 2018 the data driven algorithms have no limitations assumptions and also have higher simulation accuracy as compared to other models chapuis 2012 it is the motive behind that the authors decided to predict permeability of soil using data driven algorithms in modern studies some applications and recommendations of data driven algorithm namely multilayer perceptron mlp co active neuro fuzzy inference system canfis support vector machine svm decision tree dt self organizing map som and random forest rf algorithms in different fields such as rainfall

temperature estimation kisi et al 2015 2017 singh et al 2018a b have been reported by the researchers after review of potential of different algorithms authors decided that mlp svm canfis random forest decision tree algorithms and their wavelet transform may be applied to predict the permeability of soil some of basic questions rose related to pre handling of vectors such as how many input vectors what should be specific relation between input and output vectors for development of the best model the gamma test gt is determination of the meaningful relation between input and output vector in non linear modelling techniques during pre development of vector the input and output relation were chosen based on least value of gamma test and standard error se value noori et al 2011 the general details of gamma test may be obtained from given citation remesan et al 2008 lafdani et al 2013 the gamma test gt is one of the most popular techniques to assess the most governing input and output relation singh et al 2018a b the low correlation between input and output combination and large number of input vector have high complication and high chance of overfitting of developed model kumar et al 2018 this was the reason for applying the gamma test for selection of governing input vectors to reduce complexity and chance of overfitting of models the present study was undertaken with the objectives as a to select specific input output vector relation based on gamma test b to concentrate on development of techniques for prediction of the soil permeability from soil texture sand

is a supervised learning method and it is combination of different hyper parameters that support in approximating complex connection between input and output ayyadevara 2018 the hyper parameters such as learning rate momentum hidden layers iteration and number of neurons were used during the development of mlp system the mlp networks were made up of three different layers viz information input hidden and yield output the information level layer is generally the independent factor and utilized to simulate the yield output level layer kumar et al 2018 the hidden level layer is utilized to change the information factors into a simulated yield the activation function is used to change the information signal into a yield signal in mlp system in present scenario tan hyperbolic transfer function was used because this function is marginally more rapid and better than logistic and sigmoid transfer functions maier and dandy 1998 the learning algorithm adjusts weights and biases for minimizing the overall inaccuracy in mlp kisi 2007 the levenberg marquardt algorithm is highly capable to minimize the overall error rezaeianzadeh et al 2010 in this scenario hyper parameter namely

neurosolution 5 0 software takagi sugeno and kang tsk fuzzy structure takagi and sugeno 1985 with two participation capacities were favored in this investigation the gaussian membership function was utilized for each information neuron these structures were selected on the basis of past investigations and the suggestions of scientists aytek 2008 wang et al 2017 pradhan et al 2018 in current scenario gaussian membership functions mfs and takagi sugeno kang fuzzy tsk fuzzy model were applied for development of canfis model the value of mfs 2 to 6 threshold 0 001 and iteration 1000 were used to develop canfis model table 2 the information and elementary concept about canfis can be assessed from several literature tabari et al 2012 aziz et al 2013 pradhan et al 2018 singh et al 2018b 2 2 3 svm algorithm svm is a supervised learning technique which is applied to solve the prediction pattern recognitions regression and classification problem svm algorithm is frequently used more than other machine learning techniques for example neural systems are firmly identified with structural risk minimization hypotheses in statistics smola et al 2007 the basic theory of svm algorithm vapnik 1998 was developed for solving regression and classification problem in this study radial basis kernel function was used to develop svm model and the hyper parameters of model were defined using a large number of trials in modeling approaches table 2 details about technique are found in the literature kisi and cimen 2010 chen et al 2010 kisi 2015 barzegar et al 2017 yu et al 2017 r studio 3 5 1 was used for development of svm rf and dt models 2 2 4 dt algorithm a decision tree is used for prediction of a target by learning decision methods the decision tree is a supervised learning data driven technique and used for solving the regression classification and prediction by learning decision techniques it is constructing of groups as a tree structure and partitions a data set into smaller subsets a decision tree is started from the root node known as the first parent each node can be split into left and right child nodes these nodes can be further split and they themselves become parent nodes of their resulting children nodes in the meantime a related decision tree is gradually created the last outcome is a tree with decision hubs nods and leaf hubs a decision hub has at least two branches leaf hub is a representation to an arrangement the highest decision hub in a tree which relates to the finest forecaster is called root hub lee et al 2013

2009 loh 2014 fakhari and moghadam 2013 czajkowski and kretowski 2016 nagalla et al 2017 2 2 5 rf algorithm rf algorithm was first presented by leo breiman in 2001 rf algorithm is a flexible simply hyper parameter optimization and easily applicable machine learning algorithm rf algorithm avoids avoiding overfitting problem during model development rf algorithm can be applied to solve a classification regression strategy and prediction problems additionally excessive superiority of rf algorithm is that it is very simply to determine the virtual importance of respectively feature in the forecasting in regression tree indicator derives the numerical values instead of class labels utilized by the arbitrary tree classifier karimi et al 2018 the rf model is built though fitting single trees in group bagging system the error of the bagged trees is equivalent that of the single tree while the error of bagging is decreased by decrease in the relationship between trees hastie et al 2009 the full developed trees are not pruned back and it is one of the real points of interest of random forest model over other tree strategies quinlan 1992 rf algorithm is developed based on the decision of the pruning techniques and not the variable choice measures influence the execution of tree based methods pal and mather 2003 the ideal parameters were required for designing random forest model given in table 2 the fundamental theory of random forest can acquire from chen et al 2017 singh et al 2017c shiri 2018 2 2 6 wavelet transform the wavelet transform algorithm is an efficient and powerful mathematical algorithm that gives an optimum time frequency representation of an interpreted data in the time and frequency perspective the modeling of permeability or hydraulic conductivity processes using the initial data that is without or with zero resolution makes the internal mechanism problematic to understand resolution of component is the separation of data into various frequency components in present the study haar wavelet algorithm haar 1910 was used to determine the wavelet transform the literature of wavelet algorithm is well known and described by researcher si and zeleke 2005 goyal 2014 hu and si 2016 the original discrete time series c0 t can be resolved by atrous decomposition algorithm as 2 c r t l h l c r 1 t 2 r l r 1 2 3 w r t c r 1 t c r t r 1 2 where h l is the discrete low pass filter cr t and wr t r 1 2 are respectively sub time series of scale coefficient and wavelet coefficient at rth resolution stage in the current research five data driven algorithms and wavelets models were applied to predict permeability of soil and also performance of algorithms were assessed based on rmse wi nse pi and cc values obtained from observed and simulated values of permeability of soil during training and testing periods the qualitative results of different algorithms mlp canfis svm dt and rf and wavelets w mlp w canfis w dt w rf models were analyzed in terms of scatter plot and time series plot between observed and predicted permeability of soil during testing period gamma test was applied to evaluate most dominant input vector for prediction of soil permeability sensitivity was analyzed with increasing and decreasing value of each input vector the flow chart of model development is presented in fig 2 2 3 model performance evaluation the model performance was estimated by different statistical indicates namely nash sutcliffe efficiency nse performance index pi root mean square error rmse willmott s index of agreement wi and correlation coefficient cc the details of statistical indicator can be assessed from given citations rezaie balf et al 2018 singh 2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 gamma test the gamma test result is illustrated in table 3 after masking the sand silt and clay from inputs vector values of gamma and se had high deviation with respect to no masking 111111 masking of pd bd and oc also showed deviation with respect to no masking but it was less compared to masking sand silt and clay therefore sand silt and clay input vectors affected the soil permeability output vector more compared to other input pd bd and oc vectors it was observed that clay particle of soil extremely affects the permeability of soil in non linear relation the particle density of soil had the least effect on soil permeability after analyzing twenty two models based on minimum value of gamma and se model 20 having governing inputs as sand silt clay and oc was selected as it had minimum values of gamma 0 05614 and se 0 00424 the gamma and se values of all models are presented by histogram plot in fig 3 3 2 wavelet and non wavelet data driven algorithms the results of mlp canfis svm dt and rf algorithms were analyzed into two phases table 4 first phase was training model development phase and another testing phase for validating developed model the performance of models were assessed based on higher values of wi close to 1 for good and close to 0 for poor nse close to 1 for good and close to 0 for poor cc close to 1 for good and close to 1 for poor and least values of rmse close to 0 for good and higher values for poor pi close to 0 for good and higher values for poor during both phases the rf model has value of nse 0 827 wi 0 950 cc 0 910 rmse 2 789 cm hr pi 0 212 in training phase and nse 0 849 wi 0 956 cc 0 922 rmse 2 304 cm hr pi 0 165 in testing phase after comparing the results of mlp canfis svm dt and rf models models capability rf dt svm canfis mlp was determined for soil permeability prediction the performance of all models was found to be satisfactory the rf and dt models had higher values of wi nse cc and least values of rmse pi during training and testing phases as compared to mlp canfis svm models it was finally observed that random forest and decision tree models outperformed other models for prediction of soil permeability the wt was innovative algorithm coupled with data driven algorithms namely mlp canfis svm rf and dt models in the current study the results of wavelet based data driven algorithm viz w mlp w canfis w svm w dt and w rf models are presented in table 4 the w rf algorithm estimated the best values of nse 0 880 wi 0 970 cc 0 942 rmse 1 725 cm hr and pi 0 144 during model calibration and also the best values of nse 0 900 wi 0 972 cc 0 950 rmse 1 530 cm hr and pi 0 108 during validation of model based on statistical indices of all developed models during training and testing phase it was observed that all the models were capable to predict the permeability of soil after comparing all developed models output it was also observed that w dt and w rf algorithms outperformed w mlp w canfis and w svm models for prediction of soil permeability it was observed that the results of data driven algorithms were mainly dependent on their hyper parameters the defining of appropriate value of hyper parameters in data driven modelling is very complex in the current study this was solved by trial and error so this may be reason behind the lower performance of mlp canfis and svm algorithms as compared to rf and dt models the performance of all developed models may be improved by optimizing the hyper parameters of algorithm by different metaheuristic optimizing techniques it was seen that all data driven algorithms results were improved by coupling wavelet algorithms in soil permeability prediction it was also observed that wavelet based data driven algorithms performance was better than only data driven algorithms the qualitative analysis of developed data driven models were assessed through visual interpretation of time series scatter plots and taylor diagram the time series and scatter diagram were plotted between observed soil permeability and predicted soil permeability during testing phase figs 4 6 it may be inferred from time series and scatter plots that mlp and canfis models had high deviation from observed soil permeability compared to svm dt and rf models taylor diagram was plotted between standard deviation and correlation of observed and simulated by different models it was observed from taylor diagram that rf model has the better correlation as compared to other models 3 3 sensitivity investigation of different variables the prospective of gamma test for input assortment and potential of independent vector in regression problem can be evaluated through sensitivity analysis the best model random forest was used to measure sensitivity the sensitivity analysis was achieved through 10 increase and decrease of the parameter values the sensitivity investigation singh et al 2018a was carried out in terms of relative sensitivity rs the sensitivity investigation results of developed model are illustrated in table 5 it was observed from results that bulk density and particle density have values of rs 1 481 and 1 294 in training and 0 487 and 0 648 in testing of model the rs values for soil texture parameters clay sand and silt were estimated as 23 957 17 894 and 18 177 respectively during the development stage of model similarly the rs values of clay sand and silt were calculated as 18 487 15 012 and 16 254 in validation stage of developed model after comparing results of all variables it was observed that soil texture clay sand silt was the most sensitive parameter for prediction of soil permeability by way of data driven algorithms in the same way it was also observed that clay soil particles has the highest influence on the soil permeability as compared to other parameters based on sensitivity analysis results it can be stated that the rank of sensitive parameters was clay silt sand oc bd pd for prediction of soil permeability by the data driven algorithms the minimum and maximum permeability of soil values varied from 1 03 to 18 39 cm hr the permeability of soil was found to be depending on large numbers of parameters such as percentage of sand silt clay and organic carbon soil salinity compaction of soil viscosity of water pore size distribution etc the bulk and particles density were dependent on soil texture in the present study most of the soil samples were sandy sandy loam and loam therefore the deviation in bulk and particles density of soil was found to be less this may be the reason for less effect of bulk and particles density on permeability of soil 4 summary and conclusions this research was conducted in three parts first part was collection of soil sample from different locations of field second part was analysis of soil samples in laboratory and third part was analysis and modelling of data in third part five different non wavelet data driven algorithms mlp canfis svm dt and rf and wavelet data driven algorithms w mlp w canfis w svm w dt and w rf were applied for simulation of soil permeability based on various physical properties of soil after analyzing the results of gamma test it was concluded that soil particle viz sand silt clay and oc parameters are appropriate input combination among sand silt clay bd pd and oc parameters for prediction of soil permeability these selected parameters can be applied in future studies for prediction of soil permeability finally it was concluded that rf algorithm was the best performing algorithm with high accuracy and efficiency for soil permeability prediction based on wavelet and non wavelet algorithms sensitivity results indicated that soil texture composition of sand silt and clay particle was the most sensitive vector as compared to oc bd and pd parameters it was recommended that rf model may be applied for soil permeability prediction in future works most of hydraulic structures are built on soil and if the soil under them is porous it may be result in the seepage of the water and may be also affect in piping action this will decrease the strength of the soil to support structural load therefore this research may be applied in design of canals check dams dam and drainage system similarly it may be applied in assessment of surface and ground water for planning and management ground water recharge from canals and monsoon rainfall for future research point of view authors suggest that the accuracy and efficiency of developed models may be increased by the hyper parameters optimization of algorithms declaration of

5964,to investigate the dynamics of phosphorus fractions and their influencing factors in the surface soils of estuarine wetlands experiencing different hydrological conditions before and after flow sediment regulation soil samples were collected in wetlands tidal flooding wetlands tfw freshwater restoration wetlands frw and freshwater flooding wetlands ffw of the yellow river estuary in each month from april to october of 2012 our results showed that the average contents of organic phosphorus op occurred in the following order frw soils 60 05 mg kg tfw soils 38 72 mg kg ffw soils 27 56 mg kg and accounted for less than 12 of total phosphorus tp in contrast to the pattern for op frw soils contained lower inorganic phosphorus ip levels than tfw and ffw soils from april to august p 0 05 after the flow sediment regulation the tp op moderately labile op ml op ferrous aluminum bound ip fe al p and occluded ip oc p in the three wetlands decreased the soluble and loosely bound ip s l p contents in tfw decreased while the s l p contents in frw soils increased the levels of phosphorus fractions were affected by water and salt conditions soil texture exchangeable mineral element contents and nutrient status the fe al p and oc p in the three types of wetland soils were released and the increase in s l p in frw soils after the flow sediment regulation might increase the risk of eutrophication in the coastal waters the findings of this study could contribute to providing basic data regarding phosphorus fractions in different flooding estuarine wetlands of the yellow river estuary and guiding flow sediment regulations and freshwater restoration to enhance the ecological functions of estuarine wetlands keywords phosphorus fractions influencing factors flow sediment regulation freshwater input estuarine wetlands 1 introduction phosphorus levels in wetland soils are excellent indicators of phosphorus migration physicochemical precipitation dissolution and adsorption desorption and biological biochemical mineralization immobilization processes bünemann 2015 ye et al 2019 the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of phosphorus can indirectly reflect the productivity eutrophication risks and functions of wetland ecosystems gao et al 2016 therefore the spatial and temporal dynamics of phosphorus in wetland soils have received considerable attention over the past years the total phosphorus tp in soils includes various fractions with different availabilities that can transform into each other gao et al 2019 according to ivanoff et al 1998 organic phosphorus op fractions include labile organic phosphorus l op moderately labile organic phosphorus ml op and non labile organic phosphorus nl op this categorization has been widely applied to analyze op fractions in many studies ngo et al 2013 debruler et al 2019 a modified sequential extraction method as described in bai et al 2017 was used in calcareous soils which divides soil inorganic phosphorus ip into four fractions including soluble and loosely bound phosphorus s l p iron aluminum bound phosphorus fe al p occluded phosphorus oc p and calcium bound phosphorus ca p the determination of phosphorus fractions is important for investigating the availability of phosphorus and its migration and transformation however limited information is available on the dynamics of soil phosphorus fractions in estuarine wetlands experiencing different flooding conditions especially with the effects of hydraulic engineering the yellow river estuary of china is formed by the deposition of the yellow river sediment as it enters the sea which has been severely affected by sediment deposition and land ocean interactions gao et al 2016 environmental degradation caused by natural threats and human activities such as flow cut off of the yellow river and droughts of wetlands is a major issue in the yellow river estuary of china some degradation control measures based on scientific knowledge must be taken to reverse the wetland degradation in the yellow river estuary wang et al 2012 to control the degradation in the yellow river estuarine wetland ecosystems and maintain the reservoir storage capacity the flow sediment regulation of the xiaolangdi reservoir which is one of the largest dams in the yellow river catchment has been implemented annually since 2002 usually lasting for 20 days from mid june to early july gao et al 2016 the flow sediment regulation is an active driver of soil physicochemical conditions including soil water and salinity soil texture and soil mineral element and nutrient contents which in turn regulate soil phosphorus fraction dynamics by affecting the processes of input and output sorption and desorption plant uptake and microbial transformation li et al 2017b the rapid discharge of water and sediment from the reservoir aggravated the imbalance of phosphorus in estuarine wetlands which most likely exerted significant impacts on the increased risks of eutrophication in coastal ecosystems zhang et al 2013 gao et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to investigate the spatial and seasonal distributions of soil phosphorus fractions in estuarine wetlands before and after the flow sediment regulations to protect water quality and wetland ecosystem health owing to the intense changes in hydrological and salt conditions estuarine wetlands experiencing different flooding conditions were formed in the study area i e tidal flooding wetlands tfw freshwater restoration wetlands frw and freshwater flooding wetlands ffw bai et al 2017 meanwhile the implementation of the flow sediment regulations further enhanced the complexity of soil environmental conditions in the wetlands of the yellow river estuary wang et al 2017 hydrological dynamics have significant effects on the environmental behaviors of phosphorus in wetland soils dupas et al 2015 it is important for water quality protection and for the improvement of the productivity and function of the whole estuarine wetland ecosystem to identify the effects of the flow sediment regulations on the phosphorus fractions in estuarine wetlands experiencing different flooding conditions moreover it is necessary to identify the key environmental factors that affect the phosphorus fractions in estuarine wetland soils to provide a theoretical basis for guiding and managing the flow sediment regulation schemes the primary objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of op ip and their fraction contents in the three estuarine wetland soils 2 to identify the changes in phosphorus fractions before and after the flow sediment regulation and 3 to reveal the key environmental factors influencing the phosphorus fractions during the flow sediment regulation thus providing basic theoretical support for the design of the flow sediment regulation scheme 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description in this study three typical estuarine wetlands experiencing different flooding conditions tfw frw and ffw in the yellow river estuary where the reed phragmites australis is the dominant species were selected as the sampling sites fig 1 tfw is located in the intertidal zone with the lowest terrain of the three sampling sites irregular semidiurnal tides with a reciprocating current that is almost parallel to the coast are important hydrological characteristics in tfw gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 ffw is located near the south of the yellow river and ffw was affected by the yellow river runoff so that the soil salinity was lower compared with the others bai et al 2017 the hydrological conditions of ffw are significantly influenced by the flow sediment regulations ffw soils remain flooded from the beginning of the flow sediment regulations to the end of summer august with the implementation of flow sediment regulations freshwater restoration was also implemented in the yellow river delta national nature reserve to control soil degradation and to improve productivity bai et al 2017 four reservoirs and one aqueduct were set up in the core area of the yellow river delta national nature reserve freshwater was delivered to the restored wetlands during the period of flow sediment regulations at the same time a dike that is 9 m long 3 4 m wide and 1 5 m high was built to avoid tidal erosion therefore frw are continuously flooded by the freshwater inputs and they are also important wetlands to restore wetland productivity and improve ecosystem functions in this region 2 2 sample collection and analysis the surface soil 0 10 cm samples with three replicates were collected from each of the three wetlands in each month from april to october in 2012 because of difficulties in sampling soil samples in july and september were not taken in frw a total of 57 soil samples were collected in the study period meanwhile a datalogger with temperature probes cr1000 campbell scientific usa was used to record soil temperature another three soil cores 100 cm3 in each wetland were collected in each sampling month for the determination of soil water content wc and bulk density bd all soil samples were put in zip lock polyethylene bags and brought to the laboratory immediately one part of the fresh soil samples was air dried and the visible plant litters coarse root materials and stones were removed some air dried soil samples were used for soil particle size analysis and others were ground with a mortar and pestle until all particles passed through a 0 149 mm nylon sieve for the determination of soil chemical properties the remaining fresh soil samples were immediately stored at 2 4 c for the determination of soil microbial biomass carbon mbc and nitrogen mbn and phosphatase the bd and wc contents were measured by drying at 105 c for 24 h in an oven soil electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured in a suspension of 1 5 soil water 5 g soil

1987 the soil phosphatase activity including acid and alkaline phosphatase acp and akp respectively was determined using the p nitrobenzene colorimetric method dick et al 2000 the soil properties of these soil samples are listed in table 1 phosphorus extracted from nonignited soils with 0 5 mol l h2so4 was considered to be ip whereas the increment in h2so4 extractable phosphorus after ignition

results 3 1 dynamics of op and op fractions in surface soils of three wetlands 3 1 1 op levels the spatial and temporal changes in the op contents in surface soils of the three wetlands experiencing different flooding conditions are shown in fig 2 the average contents of op decreased in the order from frw soils 60 05 mg kg tfw soils 38 72 mg kg ffw soils 27 56 mg kg and in all cases the op accounted for less than 12 of tp fig s1 the op content in tfw was significantly higher than that in ffw in july p 0 05 there were no significant differences in op content among tfw and ffw wetland soils in other months p 0 05 the op levels in frw soils were higher than those in tfw and ffw soils in june and august p 0 05 in tfw and ffw soils the op contents decreased from april to august and

ffw before the regulation and then increased after august with higher l op levels than ffw soils in september p 0 05 comparatively l op contents in frw soils presented s shape changes with time with the highest levels in may and october and the lowest levels in august generally l op levels were below 5 mg kg in the three wetland soils accounting for less than 9 of the op fig s2 they reached the lowest levels in summer june to august ml op contents varied from 0 56 to 30 13 mg kg in the three wetlands from april to october accounting for 2 58 to 60 06 of op fig s2 and significantly positively correlated with op p 0 01 fig s4 the ml op contents generally decreased in the three wetland soils in the whole studied period higher ml op levels were observed before regulation april to june than after regulation july to october in the three wetlands p 0 05 the contents of ml op also decreased significantly from june to july p 0 05 in tfw and frw compared with ffw soils tfw soils contained higher ml op contents in may to september frw soils showed higher ml op levels in may and june and lower ml op levels in august and october p 0 05 the nl op contents ranged from 3 38 to 63 55 mg kg in the three wetlands during the growing season accounting for 38 78 to 97 42 of op fig s2 significant positive correlations between nl op and op were also observed in three wetland soils p 0 01 fig s4

during the growing season except october the nl op contents in frw soils increased significantly in august after the flow sediment regulation p 0 05 3 2 dynamics of ip and ip fractions in surface soils of three wetlands 3 2 1 ip levels ip was the dominant phosphorous fraction in the three wetlands with ip tp ratios ranging from 91 80 to 96 18 in tfw soils 93 09 to 98 95 in ffw soils and 88 19 to 97 39 in frw soils fig s1 the dynamics of ip contents in surface soils of the three wetlands are shown in fig 4 ip contents in tfw and ffw soils generally showed a slight decreasing tendency during the whole growing season reaching the lowest level in september and then slightly increasing in october however ip levels in frw soils generally showed an s tendency and reached the lowest level in august and the highest level in october frw soils contained lower ip levels than tfw and ffw soils from april to august but exhibited higher levels in october compared with tfw and ffw soils p 0 05 no significant differences in ip levels were observed between ffw and tfw soils p 0 05 except for higher levels in ffw soils in april and may p 0 05 3 2 2 ip fractions the dynamics of ip fractions in surface soils from the three wetlands are illustrated in fig 5 generally s l p levels were low in wetland soils accounting for less than 0 3 of total op fig s3 the s l p contents in tfw soils 0 89 to 1 68 mg kg showed an increasing before decreasing tendency from april to october whereas they exhibited a decreasing before increasing tendency in frw 0 86 1 53 mg kg and ffw 0 88 1 67 mg kg soils during the growing season therefore before the regulation from april to june higher levels of s l p in tfw soils were observed compared with after the regulation from july to october p 0 05 the s l p contents in frw soils increased significantly after the regulation p 0 05 however no significant differences in s l p contents were observed among ffw soils before and after regulation p 0 05 fe al p contents accounted for 0 9 2 1 of ip in the three wetlands in the growing season with an average value of 1 3 fig s3 generally ffw soils contained higher fe al p contents 8 81 11 91 mg kg than tfw soils 6 15 8 68 mg kg and frw soils 5 73 9 14 mg kg and no significant differences in fe al p contents were observed between frw soils and tfw soils the fe al p contents in ffw soils showed a small change in the growing season with higher contents in april and lower contents in august and september however an increasing tendency was observed in tfw and frw soils before the flow sediment regulation p 0 05 and then fe al p contents decreased significantly after the flow sediment regulation p 0 05 oc p contents accounted for 7 1 to 22 5 of the ip in the three wetlands in the growing season with an average value of 14 2 fig s3 generally oc p levels were higher in tfw soils 90 02 125 10 mg kg than in ffw 61 41 124 96 mg kg and frw soils 46 57 93 59 mg kg and no significant differences were observed between ffw and frw soils the oc p contents in the tfw soils exhibited little change during the growing season whereas the oc p contents in the frw and ffw soils exhibited a slight decrease from april to august and then a slight increase until october a significant decrease in oc p was observed in frw soils from june to august p 0 05 in addition oc p in ffw decreased significantly after the flow sediment regulation from july to october p 0 05 the ca p contents accounted for 47 8 81 9 of the ip in the three wetlands in the growing season with an average value of 55 45 fig s3 so ip was dominant in the ca p fraction in the three wetland soils generally frw soils contained higher ca p levels 355 29 453 03 mg kg than tfw 326 05 to 363 99 mg kg and ffw 339 93 382 05 mg kg soils the ca p contents showed a small fluctuation and reached their lowest levels in the tfw and ffw soils in the growing season in september whereas in the frw soils ca p levels exhibited an increasing tendency with higher ca p levels after the flow sediment regulation than before the regulation p 0 05 3 3 relationships between phosphorus fractions and soil properties in three wetlands rda fig 6 and correlation analysis table s1 identified the relationships between different phosphorus fractions and soil environmental factors in tfw the eigenvalues of the four ordination axes were 0 587 0 197 0 118 and 0 066 and the first two axes could explain 78 5 of the effects of soil environmental factors on phosphorus fractions fig 6a the first rda axis was mainly positively correlated with soil salinity ec and cl and silt percentage and was mainly negatively correlated with soil nutrients som and tn clay percentage mbn and ca0 the second rda axis was mainly positively correlated with soil tc and fe and was mainly negatively correlated with soil bd cl som and al the soil tp and ip fractions existed in quadrants one and four whereas the op fractions presented in quadrants three and four as shown in fig 6a among them tp showed significantly positive correlations with ec and cl and negative correlations with tn and ca0 p 0 05 table s1 op was significantly positively correlated with bd and som p 0 01 table s1 there was a significant positive correlation between ip and silt and ip showed significant negative correlations with som and ca0 p 0 05 table s1 after the flow sediment regulation the sampling sites moved from quadrant four to quadrant two higher levels of tp ml op and s l p were observed before the flow sediment regulation from april to june compared to after the regulation from july to october p 0 05 the contents of ml op and fe al p also decreased significantly from june to july p 0 05 accompanied by a decrease in cl and sand percentage and an increase in clay percentage in environmental factors from june to july p 0 05 moreover there was an increasing trend of soil wc ca and ca0 after the regulation in frw the eigenvalues of the four ordination axes were 0 456 0 397 0 127 and 0 015 and the first two axes could explain 85 3 of the effects of soil environmental factors on phosphorus fractions fig 6b the first rda axis was mainly positively correlated with soil ph sand percentage and temperature and was mainly negatively correlated with soil som tc silt percentage and al the second rda axis was mainly negatively correlated with soil salinity ec cl and so4 2 nutrients som and tn tc and mineral elements ca0 al0 and fe0 soil tp and ip fractions existed in quadrants two and three and ca p and s l p existed in quadrant one whereas op fractions presented in quadrant four op and nl op quadrant two l op and quadrant three ml op as shown in fig 6b among them tp showed significantly positive correlations with ec and al and negative correlations with ph and temperature p 0 05 table s1 op was significantly positively correlated with soil salinity cl and so4 2 tn and mineral elements ca0 al0 and fe0 and negatively correlated with soil wc and clay percentage p 0 05 table s1 ip showed significant positive correlations with soil wc and al and negative correlations with soil ph and temperature p 0 05 table s1 all sampling sites in frw could be clearly discriminated as before the regulation from april to june and after the regulation august and october after the regulation the sampling sites moved from quadrants three and four to quadrants one and two higher levels of op ml op and fe al p and lower levels of s l p were observed before the regulation compared with after the regulation from july to october p 0 05 the contents of ml op fe al p and oc p also decreased significantly and nl op s l p and ca p contents increased significantly from june to august p 0 05 meanwhile there was an increasing trend of soil wc and a decreasing trend of soil som after regulation this trend was accompanied by a decrease in soil salinity cl and so4 2 ca0 contents and akp and an increase in soil ph and sand percentage in environmental factors from june to august p 0 05 in ffw approximately 84 8 of the variance could be explained by the first two axes and their eigenvalues were 0 719 and 0 129 respectively fig 6c the first rda axis was mainly positively correlated with soil tn and mineral elements and was mainly negatively correlated with soil wc the second rda axis was mainly positively correlated with soil silt percentage and negatively correlated with soil tn microbial biomass mbc and mbn and mineral elements soil phosphorus fractions were mainly present in quadrant four as shown in fig 6c among them tp showed significantly positive correlations with soil tn and mineral elements al and ca0 and negative correlations with soil wc p 0 01 table s1 op was significantly positively correlated with soil tc tn mbn and mineral elements ca al fe and ca0 p 0 05 and negatively correlated with soil wc p 0 01 table s1 for ip there was a significant positive correlation with soil al and a significant negative correlation with soil acp p 0 05 table s1 after the regulation the sampling sites moved from quadrants one and four to quadrants two and three before the regulation from april to june higher levels of tp oc op op l op and ml op were observed compared with after the regulation from july to october p 0 05 this shift was accompanied by an increase in soil wc clay percentage and akp in environmental factors from june to august p 0 05 moreover there was a decreasing trend of soil tc and tn after the regulation sem was used to further identify key environmental drivers of soil phosphorus fraction levels in the three wetlands fig 7 the model was significant chi square p value 0 05 and had an acceptable goodness of fit index gfi 0 807 and root mean square error of approximation rmsea 0 032 after the nonsignificant paths were removed the sem revealed that soil salinity nutrient status and soil texture had direct effects on soil op contents while soil exchangeable mineral element contents and nutrient status had direct effects on soil ip contents among these factors nutrient status had the greatest influence on op and ip with standardized coefficients of 1 and 0 9 respectively indicating that op and ip increased with increasing soil nutrients soil wc could indirectly affect soil phosphorus fraction contents by affecting soil salinity and exchangeable mineral elements the change in wc was accompanied by a change in soil texture because of the influence of the flow sediment regulation p 0 05 moreover there were significant correlations between soil salinity nutrient condition and texture p 0 05 soil exchangeable mineral element contents were significantly correlated with soil nutrients p 0 05 op and ip fractions can transform into each other this model could explain 61 and 46 of the variances in op and ip respectively 4 discussion 4 1 changes in soil phosphorus levels in three wetlands for the three wetlands tp existed predominantly in the ip fraction especially ca p in three wetlands and ip accounted for 88 19 to 98 95 of tp consistent with the results of qu et al 2018 that was because the yellow river estuary is dominated by calcareous soils ye et al 2014 op accounted for less than 12 of tp lu et al 2013 also observed comparable phosphorus levels in sediments in the northern part of china l op levels accounted for the least proportion of op and ml op contents ranging from 0 56 to 30 13 mg kg which was consistent with the results of zhu et al 2017 and lu et al 2013 nl op accounted for 38 78 97 42 of op this is consistent with the results of zhu 2017 who reported that soil op was predominantly in the nl op fraction in the yeyahu wetland of china therefore op levels showed the same dynamics as nl op moreover the contents of op and ip showed opposite dynamics because op and ip could transform into each other through mineralization and immobilization bünemann 2015 frw soils contained higher op levels and lower ip levels than tfw and ffw soils from april to august meanwhile frw soils contained higher som levels than tfw and ffw soils the plants grew best in frw leading to the most absorption of ip by plants and causing phosphorus to exist in the form of nl op in som schachtman et al 1998 4 2 effects of environmental factors on phosphorus fractions before and after regulation the phosphorus fractions in the different flooding wetlands showed inconsistent dynamics before and after flow sediment regulation because there were differences in environmental factors among the three wetlands salt stress strongly limits the productivity of the coastal soils in the yellow river estuary luo et al 2017 soil salinity decreased significantly due to freshwater input after the flow sediment regulation leading to an increase in reed biomass and an increase in the amount of assimilated nutrients accordingly the phosphorus absorbed by plants could not be returned to the soil quickly luo et al 2017 therefore the large decrease in many phosphorus fractions in the three wetlands after the regulation was largely caused by plant growth and absorption the tp contents in tfw and ffw soils decreased significantly after the regulation and the tn contents also showed a decreasing trend because both nitrogen and phosphorus are essential nutrients for plant growth verhoeven et al 1996 s l p is the smallest ip pool but has the highest activity and is easily absorbed by plants darilek 2010 the contents of s l p in tfw soil decreased significantly to meet the needs of fast growing plants after the regulation however there was a significant increase in the s l p contents and a significant decrease in the akp activities in frw soils after the regulation this could be explained by the abundance of bioavailable ip such as s l p in frw soils that could be absorbed and utilized by plants and microorganisms such that the microorganisms tend to produce less akp richardson and simpson 2011 phosphorus in frw was easily released to the overlying water after the flow sediment regulation because of the increase in s l p bai et al 2017 the increased fresh water input effectively increased soil wc after the regulation in the three wetlands the redox condition became reductive in the soil after the regulation since the oxygen supply diminishes with the amount of water mitsunobu et al 2006 fe al p includes phosphorus associated with oxides and hydroxides of fe and al wang et al 2013 the oc p are those that are bound in iron plaques of calcium phosphate iron phosphate aluminum phosphate and other phosphate forms yu et al 2015 phosphorus can be released from these phosphate forms when anoxic conditions prevail since phosphorus is liberated from the surface of reduced fe and al oxides and hydroxides or released from the iron plaque because of the reduction of fe2o3 wu et al 2015 li et al 2017a therefore the contents of fe al p in tfw and frw soils and the contents of oc p in frw and ffw soils decreased significantly after the regulation the contents of ca and ca0 in tfw soils increased after the regulation due to the input of ca from the fresh water and sediment inputs while an increase in ca p contents was not observed in tfw meanwhile the contents of ca p in frw soils were significantly increased after the regulation while a decrease in ca0 contents and an increase in ph were observed previous studies have shown that freshwater input caused a decrease in the salinity and an increase in the alkalinity of the soil bai et al 2015 wang et al 2016 this was caused by the release of ca mg and other metal cations after freshwater input cationic adsorption sites previously occupied by metal cations in the soil were replaced by hydrolyzed hydrogen ions so that the soil ph increased chen et al 2015 the increased ph value is conducive to the combination of ca0 and ip in soil to form ca p therefore the contents of ca p in estuarine wetland soils could be controlled by soil alkalinity op can be mineralized into ip under microbial oxidation and extracellular enzymatic processes to satisfy the needs of plant and microbial growth bünemann 2015 ml op in the three wetland soils decreased after the regulation because ml op is the main source of op mineralization zhu et al 2017 additionally a decreasing trend of som was observed in frw after the regulation since som can be decomposed by microorganisms driven by the need for energy and can be mineralized by extracellular enzymes secreted by plants and microorganisms which may be associated with the mineralization of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus weintraub and schimel 2003 therefore som and op showed the same trend of variability moreover akp activity increased significantly in ffw after the regulation which is consistent with the significant decrease in op l op and ml op in ffw because akp is characterized as a typically inducible enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphorus containing anhydrides zheng et al 2019 the flow sediment regulation had different effects on the soil texture of estuarine wetlands experiencing different flooding conditions the higher flow velocity of the freshwater input in frw resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of soil sand ahfir et al 2017 a large amount of sand was trapped in the frw and more clay particles were deposited in ffw and tfw due to lower freshwater flow velocity resulting in a significant increase in the percentage of clay in these two wetlands soil phosphorus dynamics could be greatly influenced by soil particle size distribution through its effects on phosphorus sorption and desorption capacities olsen and watanabe 1957 gérard s study showed that in most soils clay minerals should be considered as important phosphate binding constituents due to their high specific surface area gérard 2016 meanwhile phosphorus could be carried with clay sediments upstream sonzogni et al 1982 bai et al 2019 also showed that the water rich in ip from the upstream areas of the yellow river estuary introduced by flow sediment regulation significantly replenished the sediment ip pool of tfw and ffw after the regulation the nl op in frw soils increased significantly which may have been caused by the upstream input of organic residue during regulation zhao et al 2018 however in this study increases in phosphate contents in ffw and tfw were not observed this was associated with the fact that the flow sediment regulation could affect the amount of phosphorus assimilation of plants by affecting their growth schachtman et al 1998 moreover phosphorus levels in ffw and tfw soils were higher than those in water so that it promoted the release of soil phosphorus into water even though the flow sediment regulation induced an impulse delivery of phosphorus wang et al 2017 additionally the increase in water quantity with the changes in soil physicochemical properties e g soil ph and ec after the input of fresh water and sediments could influence the adsorption and desorption of phosphorus at the interface between soil and water the mineralization and immobilization of phosphorus and phosphorus leaching gaind and nain 2015 mullane et al 2015 bai et al 2017 phosphorus could also be transported between wetlands and outside areas with the input and output of fresh water and sediments johannesson et al 2015 the sem showed that soil wc salinity texture exchangeable mineral element contents and nutrient status were the key factors influencing soil phosphorus dynamics fig 7 generally soil wc increased and soil salinity decreased in the three wetlands so that the flow sediment regulation improved the growth of plants in the yellow river estuary wang et al 2016 however nutrient status e g som and tn had the greatest effects on op and ip fractions in the different flooding wetlands lebauer and treseder 2008 the primary productivity of the three wetlands was nearly limited by nitrogen the molar ratio of n p is 2 20 1 09 especially in tfw and ffw the molar ratio of n p 2 29 the nitrogen contents were not increased after the flow sediment regulation and thus the primary productivity in the three wetlands was still under nitrogen limited status additionally the soils in the three wetlands were under anaerobic reduction conditions caused by the excessive soil wc after the regulation which likely caused the release of some ip fractions fe al p and oc p from the wetland soils to the water thus increasing the migration of wetland phosphorus and possibly causing eutrophication in the coastal waters smith 2003 moreover bai et al 2019 showed that during the plant growing period from august to september phosphorus uptake by plants peaked in tfw and ffw therefore more research on the effects of the timing flow rate and duration of flow sediment regulation on soil phosphorus fraction dynamics environmental factors microorganisms and functional genes is still needed to determine the mechanisms influencing soil phosphorus transformation in estuarine wetlands a flow sediment regulation scheme to meet the needs of plant growth rhythms should be proposed which would be beneficial for improving phosphorus retention and the ecological restoration of estuarine wetlands other ecological restoration measures such as the addition of nitrogen fertilizer can be combined with flow sediment regulations and freshwater restoration to further restore vegetation and productivity in estuarine wetlands 5 conclusions we investigated the dynamics of soil phosphorus fractions in estuarine wetland soils experiencing different flooding conditions before and after flow sediment regulation the results showed that tp dominantly existed in the ip fraction especially ca p in three wetlands and op accounted for less than 12 of tp frw soils contained higher op levels and lower ip levels than tfw and ffw soils from april to august after the flow sediment regulation s l p in tfw tp in tfw and ffw and ml op in all three wetlands decreased mainly due to the freshwater input effectively reducing soil salinity and thus promoting plant growth and the absorption of nutrients fe al p and oc p decreased in the three wetland soils because continuous anaerobic conditions were formed after regulation and promoted their release generally the levels of phosphorus fractions were affected by water and salt conditions soil texture exchangeable mineral element contents and nutrient status the findings of this study can contribute to providing basic data regarding phosphorus fractions in estuarine wetland soils and guiding freshwater restoration and flow sediment regulation to enhance the ecological functions of estuarine wetlands however the amount of phosphorus migration including the phosphorus adsorbed by plants and input by litters the phosphorus adsorbed and desorbed at the interface between soil and water the phosphorus leached into the subsoil and the phosphorus input and output by flow and sediment should be measured quantitatively so that the effects of the flow sediment regulation on the phosphorus dynamics in estuarine wetlands can be further analyzed fe al p and oc p in the three wetlands was released and s l p in frw was increased after the regulation which might increase the risk of eutrophication in the coastal waters therefore a flow sediment regulation scheme to meet the needs of plant growth should be taken into consideration and such a scheme would be beneficial to control phosphorus fate and the water

5964,to investigate the dynamics of phosphorus fractions and their influencing factors in the surface soils of estuarine wetlands experiencing different hydrological conditions before and after flow sediment regulation soil samples were collected in wetlands tidal flooding wetlands tfw freshwater restoration wetlands frw and freshwater flooding wetlands ffw of the yellow river estuary in each month from april to october of 2012 our results showed that the average contents of organic phosphorus op occurred in the following order frw soils 60 05 mg kg tfw soils 38 72 mg kg ffw soils 27 56 mg kg and accounted for less than 12 of total phosphorus tp in contrast to the pattern for op frw soils contained lower inorganic phosphorus ip levels than tfw and ffw soils from april to august p 0 05 after the flow sediment regulation the tp op moderately labile op ml op ferrous aluminum bound ip fe al p and occluded ip oc p in the three wetlands decreased the soluble and loosely bound ip s l p contents in tfw decreased while the s l p contents in frw soils increased the levels of phosphorus fractions were affected by water and salt conditions soil texture exchangeable mineral element contents and nutrient status the fe al p and oc p in the three types of wetland soils were released and the increase in s l p in frw soils after the flow sediment regulation might increase the risk of eutrophication in the coastal waters the findings of this study could contribute to providing basic data regarding phosphorus fractions in different flooding estuarine wetlands of the yellow river estuary and guiding flow sediment regulations and freshwater restoration to enhance the ecological functions of estuarine wetlands keywords phosphorus fractions influencing factors flow sediment regulation freshwater input estuarine wetlands 1 introduction phosphorus levels in wetland soils are excellent indicators of phosphorus migration physicochemical precipitation dissolution and adsorption desorption and biological biochemical mineralization immobilization processes bünemann 2015 ye et al 2019 the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of phosphorus can indirectly reflect the productivity eutrophication risks and functions of wetland ecosystems gao et al 2016 therefore the spatial and temporal dynamics of phosphorus in wetland soils have received considerable attention over the past years the total phosphorus tp in soils includes various fractions with different availabilities that can transform into each other gao et al 2019 according to ivanoff et al 1998 organic phosphorus op fractions include labile organic phosphorus l op moderately labile organic phosphorus ml op and non labile organic phosphorus nl op this categorization has been widely applied to analyze op fractions in many studies ngo et al 2013 debruler et al 2019 a modified sequential extraction method as described in bai et al 2017 was used in calcareous soils which divides soil inorganic phosphorus ip into four fractions including soluble and loosely bound phosphorus s l p iron aluminum bound phosphorus fe al p occluded phosphorus oc p and calcium bound phosphorus ca p the determination of phosphorus fractions is important for investigating the availability of phosphorus and its migration and transformation however limited information is available on the dynamics of soil phosphorus fractions in estuarine wetlands experiencing different flooding conditions especially with the effects of hydraulic engineering the yellow river estuary of china is formed by the deposition of the yellow river sediment as it enters the sea which has been severely affected by sediment deposition and land ocean interactions gao et al 2016 environmental degradation caused by natural threats and human activities such as flow cut off of the yellow river and droughts of wetlands is a major issue in the yellow river estuary of china some degradation control measures based on scientific knowledge must be taken to reverse the wetland degradation in the yellow river estuary wang et al 2012 to control the degradation in the yellow river estuarine wetland ecosystems and maintain the reservoir storage capacity the flow sediment regulation of the xiaolangdi reservoir which is one of the largest dams in the yellow river catchment has been implemented annually since 2002 usually lasting for 20 days from mid june to early july gao et al 2016 the flow sediment regulation is an active driver of soil physicochemical conditions including soil water and salinity soil texture and soil mineral element and nutrient contents which in turn regulate soil phosphorus fraction dynamics by affecting the processes of input and output sorption and desorption plant uptake and microbial transformation li et al 2017b the rapid discharge of water and sediment from the reservoir aggravated the imbalance of phosphorus in estuarine wetlands which most likely exerted significant impacts on the increased risks of eutrophication in coastal ecosystems zhang et al 2013 gao et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to investigate the spatial and seasonal distributions of soil phosphorus fractions in estuarine wetlands before and after the flow sediment regulations to protect water quality and wetland ecosystem health owing to the intense changes in hydrological and salt conditions estuarine wetlands experiencing different flooding conditions were formed in the study area i e tidal flooding wetlands tfw freshwater restoration wetlands frw and freshwater flooding wetlands ffw bai et al 2017 meanwhile the implementation of the flow sediment regulations further enhanced the complexity of soil environmental conditions in the wetlands of the yellow river estuary wang et al 2017 hydrological dynamics have significant effects on the environmental behaviors of phosphorus in wetland soils dupas et al 2015 it is important for water quality protection and for the improvement of the productivity and function of the whole estuarine wetland ecosystem to identify the effects of the flow sediment regulations on the phosphorus fractions in estuarine wetlands experiencing different flooding conditions moreover it is necessary to identify the key environmental factors that affect the phosphorus fractions in estuarine wetland soils to provide a theoretical basis for guiding and managing the flow sediment regulation schemes the primary objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of op ip and their fraction contents in the three estuarine wetland soils 2 to identify the changes in phosphorus fractions before and after the flow sediment regulation and 3 to reveal the key environmental factors influencing the phosphorus fractions during the flow sediment regulation thus providing basic theoretical support for the design of the flow sediment regulation scheme 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description in this study three typical estuarine wetlands experiencing different flooding conditions tfw frw and ffw in the yellow river estuary where the reed phragmites australis is the dominant species were selected as the sampling sites fig 1 tfw is located in the intertidal zone with the lowest terrain of the three sampling sites irregular semidiurnal tides with a reciprocating current that is almost parallel to the coast are important hydrological characteristics in tfw gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 ffw is located near the south of the yellow river and ffw was affected by the yellow river runoff so that the soil salinity was lower compared with the others bai et al 2017 the hydrological conditions of ffw are significantly influenced by the flow sediment regulations ffw soils remain flooded from the beginning of the flow sediment regulations to the end of summer august with the implementation of flow sediment regulations freshwater restoration was also implemented in the yellow river delta national nature reserve to control soil degradation and to improve productivity bai et al 2017 four reservoirs and one aqueduct were set up in the core area of the yellow river delta national nature reserve freshwater was delivered to the restored wetlands during the period of flow sediment regulations at the same time a dike that is 9 m long 3 4 m wide and 1 5 m high was built to avoid tidal erosion therefore frw are continuously flooded by the freshwater inputs and they are also important wetlands to restore wetland productivity and improve ecosystem functions in this region 2 2 sample collection and analysis the surface soil 0 10 cm samples with three replicates were collected from each of the three wetlands in each month from april to october in 2012 because of difficulties in sampling soil samples in july and september were not taken in frw a total of 57 soil samples were collected in the study period meanwhile a datalogger with temperature probes cr1000 campbell scientific usa was used to record soil temperature another three soil cores 100 cm3 in each wetland were collected in each sampling month for the determination of soil water content wc and bulk density bd all soil samples were put in zip lock polyethylene bags and brought to the laboratory immediately one part of the fresh soil samples was air dried and the visible plant litters coarse

to 97 39 in frw soils fig s1 the dynamics of ip contents in surface soils of the three wetlands are shown in fig 4 ip contents in tfw and ffw soils generally showed a slight decreasing tendency during

1 68 mg kg showed an increasing before decreasing tendency from april to october whereas they exhibited a decreasing before increasing tendency in frw 0 86 1 53 mg kg and ffw 0 88 1 67 mg kg soils during the growing season therefore before the regulation from april to june higher levels of s l p in tfw soils were observed compared with after the regulation from july to october p 0 05 the s l p contents in frw soils increased significantly after the regulation p 0 05 however no significant differences in s l p contents were observed among ffw soils before and after regulation p 0 05 fe al p contents accounted for 0 9 2 1 of ip in the three wetlands in the growing season with an average value of 1 3 fig s3 generally ffw soils contained higher fe al p contents 8 81 11 91 mg kg than tfw soils 6 15 8 68 mg kg and frw soils 5 73 9 14 mg kg and no significant differences in fe al p contents were observed between frw soils and tfw soils the fe al p contents in ffw soils showed a small change in the growing season with higher contents in april and lower contents in august and september however an increasing tendency was observed in tfw and frw soils before the flow sediment regulation p 0 05 and then fe al p contents decreased significantly after the flow sediment regulation p 0 05 oc p contents accounted for 7 1 to 22 5 of the ip in the three wetlands in the growing season with an average value of 14 2 fig s3 generally oc p levels were higher in tfw soils 90 02 125 10 mg kg than in ffw 61 41 124 96 mg kg and frw soils 46 57 93 59 mg kg and no significant differences were observed between ffw and frw soils the oc p contents in the tfw soils exhibited little change during the growing season whereas the oc p contents in the frw and ffw soils exhibited a slight decrease from april to august and then a slight increase until october a significant decrease in oc p was observed in frw soils from june to august p 0 05 in addition oc p in ffw decreased significantly after the flow sediment regulation from july to october p 0 05 the ca p contents accounted for 47 8 81 9 of the ip in the three wetlands in the growing season with an average value of 55 45 fig s3 so ip was dominant in the ca p fraction in the three wetland soils generally frw soils contained higher ca p levels 355 29 453 03 mg kg than tfw 326 05 to 363 99 mg kg and ffw 339 93 382 05 mg kg soils the ca p contents showed a small fluctuation and reached their lowest levels in the tfw and ffw soils in the growing season in september whereas in the frw soils ca p levels exhibited an increasing tendency with higher ca p levels after the flow sediment regulation than before the regulation p 0 05 3 3 relationships between phosphorus fractions and soil properties in three wetlands rda fig 6 and correlation analysis table s1 identified the relationships between different phosphorus fractions and soil environmental factors in tfw the eigenvalues of the four ordination axes were 0 587 0 197 0 118 and 0 066 and the first two axes could explain 78 5 of the effects of soil environmental factors on phosphorus fractions fig 6a the first rda axis was mainly positively correlated with soil salinity ec and cl and silt percentage and was mainly negatively correlated with soil nutrients som and tn clay percentage mbn and ca0 the second rda axis was mainly positively correlated with soil tc and fe and was mainly negatively correlated with soil bd cl som and al the soil tp and ip fractions existed in quadrants one and four whereas the op fractions presented in quadrants three and

with bd and som p 0 01 table s1 there was a significant positive correlation between ip and silt and ip showed significant negative correlations with som and ca0 p 0 05 table s1 after the flow sediment regulation the sampling sites moved from quadrant four to quadrant two higher levels of tp ml op and s l p were observed before the flow sediment regulation from april to june compared to after the regulation from july to october p 0 05 the contents of ml op and fe al p also decreased significantly from june to july p 0 05 accompanied by a decrease in cl and sand percentage and an increase in clay percentage in environmental factors from june to july p 0 05 moreover there was an increasing trend of soil wc ca and ca0 after the regulation in frw the eigenvalues of the four ordination axes were 0 456 0 397 0 127 and 0 015 and the first two axes could explain 85 3 of the effects of soil environmental factors on phosphorus fractions fig 6b the first rda axis was mainly positively correlated with soil ph sand percentage and temperature and was mainly negatively correlated with soil som tc silt percentage and al the second rda axis was mainly negatively correlated with soil salinity ec cl and so4 2 nutrients som and tn tc and mineral elements ca0 al0 and fe0 soil tp and ip fractions existed in quadrants two and three and ca p and s l p existed in quadrant one whereas op fractions presented in quadrant four op and nl op quadrant two l op and quadrant three ml op as shown in fig 6b among them tp showed significantly positive correlations with ec and al and negative correlations with ph and temperature p 0 05 table s1 op was significantly positively correlated with soil salinity cl and so4 2 tn and mineral elements ca0 al0 and fe0 and negatively correlated with soil wc and clay percentage p 0 05 table s1 ip showed significant positive correlations with soil wc and al and negative correlations with soil ph and temperature p 0 05 table s1 all sampling sites in frw could be clearly discriminated as before the regulation from april to june and after the regulation august and october after the regulation the sampling sites moved from quadrants three and four to quadrants one and two higher levels of op ml op and fe al p and lower levels of s l p were observed before the regulation compared with after the regulation from july to october p 0 05 the contents of ml op fe al p and oc p also decreased significantly and nl op s l p and ca p contents increased significantly from june to august p 0 05 meanwhile there was an increasing trend of soil wc and a decreasing trend of soil som after regulation this trend was accompanied by a decrease in soil salinity cl and so4 2 ca0 contents and akp and an increase in soil ph and sand percentage in environmental factors from june to august p 0 05 in ffw approximately 84 8 of the variance could be explained by the first two axes and their eigenvalues were 0 719 and 0 129 respectively fig 6c the first rda axis was mainly positively correlated with soil tn and mineral elements and was mainly negatively correlated with soil wc the second rda axis was mainly positively correlated with soil silt percentage and negatively correlated with soil tn microbial biomass mbc and mbn and mineral elements soil phosphorus fractions were mainly present in quadrant four as shown in fig 6c among them tp showed significantly positive correlations with soil tn and mineral elements al and ca0 and negative correlations with soil wc p 0 01 table s1 op was significantly positively

to june higher levels of tp oc op op l op and ml op were observed compared with after the regulation from july to october p 0 05 this shift was accompanied by an increase in soil wc clay percentage and akp in environmental factors from june to august p 0 05 moreover there was a decreasing trend of soil tc and tn after the regulation sem was used to further identify key environmental drivers of soil phosphorus fraction levels in the three wetlands fig 7 the model was significant chi square p value 0 05 and had an acceptable goodness of fit index gfi 0 807 and root mean square error of approximation rmsea 0 032 after the nonsignificant paths were removed the sem revealed that soil salinity nutrient status and soil texture had direct effects on soil op contents while soil exchangeable mineral element contents and nutrient status had direct effects on soil ip contents among these factors nutrient status had the greatest influence on op and ip with standardized coefficients of 1 and 0 9 respectively indicating that op and ip increased with increasing soil nutrients soil wc could indirectly affect soil phosphorus fraction contents by affecting soil salinity and exchangeable mineral elements the change in wc was accompanied by a change in soil texture because of the influence of the flow sediment regulation p 0 05 moreover there were significant correlations between soil salinity nutrient condition and texture p 0 05 soil exchangeable mineral element contents were significantly correlated with soil nutrients p 0 05 op and ip fractions can transform into each other this model could explain 61 and 46 of the variances in op and ip respectively 4 discussion 4 1 changes in soil phosphorus levels in three wetlands for the three wetlands tp existed predominantly in the ip fraction especially ca p in three wetlands and ip accounted for 88 19 to 98 95 of tp consistent with the results of qu et al 2018 that was because the yellow river estuary is dominated by calcareous soils ye et al 2014 op accounted for less than 12 of tp lu et al 2013 also observed comparable phosphorus levels in sediments in the northern part of china l op levels accounted for the least proportion of op and ml op contents ranging from 0 56 to 30 13 mg kg which was consistent with the results of zhu et al 2017 and lu et al 2013 nl op accounted for 38 78 97 42 of op this is consistent with the results of zhu 2017 who reported that soil op was predominantly in the nl op fraction in the yeyahu wetland of china therefore op levels showed the same dynamics as nl op moreover the contents of op and ip showed opposite dynamics because op and ip could transform into each other through mineralization and immobilization bünemann 2015 frw soils contained higher op levels and lower ip levels than tfw and ffw soils from april to august meanwhile frw soils contained higher som levels than tfw and ffw soils the plants grew best in frw leading to the most absorption of ip by plants and causing phosphorus to exist in the form of nl op in som schachtman et al 1998 4 2 effects of environmental factors on phosphorus fractions before and after regulation the phosphorus fractions in the different flooding wetlands showed inconsistent dynamics before and after flow sediment regulation because there were differences in environmental factors among the three wetlands salt stress strongly limits the productivity of the coastal soils in the yellow river estuary luo et al 2017 soil salinity decreased significantly due to freshwater input after the flow sediment regulation leading to an increase in reed biomass and an increase in the amount of assimilated nutrients accordingly the phosphorus absorbed by plants could not be returned to the soil quickly luo et al 2017 therefore the large decrease in many phosphorus fractions in the three wetlands after the regulation was largely caused by plant growth and absorption the tp contents in tfw and ffw soils decreased significantly after the regulation and the tn contents also showed a decreasing trend because both nitrogen and phosphorus are essential nutrients for plant growth verhoeven et al 1996 s l p is the smallest ip pool but has the highest activity and is easily absorbed by plants darilek 2010 the contents of s l p in tfw soil decreased significantly to meet the needs of fast growing plants after the regulation however there was a significant increase in the s l p contents and a significant decrease in the akp activities in frw soils after the regulation this could be explained by the abundance of bioavailable ip such as s l p in frw soils that could be absorbed and utilized by plants and microorganisms such that the microorganisms tend to produce less akp richardson and simpson 2011 phosphorus in frw was easily released to the overlying water after the flow sediment regulation because of the increase in s l p bai et al 2017 the increased fresh water input effectively increased soil wc after the regulation in the three wetlands the redox condition became reductive in the soil after the regulation since the oxygen supply diminishes with the amount of water mitsunobu et al 2006 fe al p includes phosphorus associated with oxides and hydroxides of fe and al wang et al 2013 the oc p are those that are bound in iron plaques of calcium phosphate iron phosphate aluminum phosphate and other phosphate forms yu et al 2015 phosphorus can be released from these phosphate forms when anoxic conditions prevail since phosphorus is liberated from the surface of reduced fe and al oxides and hydroxides or released from the iron plaque because of the reduction of fe2o3 wu et al 2015 li et al 2017a therefore the contents of fe al p in tfw and frw soils and the contents of oc p in frw and ffw soils decreased significantly after the regulation the contents of ca and ca0 in tfw soils increased after the regulation due to the input of ca from the fresh water and sediment inputs while an increase in ca p contents was not observed in tfw meanwhile the contents of ca p in frw soils were significantly increased after the regulation while a decrease in ca0 contents and an increase in ph were observed previous studies have shown that freshwater input caused a decrease in the salinity and an increase in the alkalinity of the soil bai et al 2015 wang et al 2016 this was caused by the release of ca mg and other metal cations after freshwater input cationic adsorption sites previously occupied by metal cations in the soil were replaced by hydrolyzed hydrogen ions so that the soil ph increased chen et al 2015 the increased ph value is conducive to the combination of ca0 and ip in soil to form ca p therefore the contents of ca p in estuarine wetland soils could be controlled by soil alkalinity op can be mineralized into ip under microbial oxidation and extracellular enzymatic processes to satisfy the needs of plant and microbial growth bünemann 2015 ml op in the three wetland soils decreased after the regulation because ml op is the main source of op mineralization zhu et al 2017 additionally a decreasing trend of som was observed in frw after the regulation since som can be decomposed by microorganisms driven by the need for energy and can be mineralized by extracellular enzymes secreted by plants and microorganisms which may be associated with the mineralization of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus weintraub and schimel 2003 therefore som and op showed the same trend of variability moreover akp activity increased significantly in ffw after the regulation which is consistent with the significant decrease in op l op and ml op in ffw because akp is characterized as a typically inducible enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphorus containing anhydrides zheng et al 2019 the flow sediment regulation had different effects on the soil texture of estuarine wetlands experiencing different flooding conditions the higher flow velocity of the freshwater input in frw resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of soil sand ahfir et al 2017 a large amount of sand was trapped in the frw and more clay particles were deposited in ffw and tfw due to lower freshwater flow velocity resulting in a significant increase in the percentage of clay in these two wetlands soil phosphorus dynamics could be greatly influenced by soil particle size distribution through its effects on phosphorus sorption and desorption capacities olsen and watanabe 1957 gérard s study showed that in most soils clay minerals should be considered as important phosphate binding constituents due to their high specific surface area gérard 2016 meanwhile phosphorus could be carried with clay sediments upstream sonzogni et al 1982 bai et al 2019 also showed that the water rich in ip from the upstream areas of the yellow river estuary introduced by flow sediment regulation significantly replenished the sediment ip pool of tfw and ffw after the regulation the nl op in frw soils increased significantly which may have been caused by the upstream input of organic residue during regulation zhao et al 2018 however in this study increases in phosphate contents in ffw and tfw were not observed this was associated with the fact that the flow sediment regulation could affect the amount of phosphorus assimilation of plants by affecting their growth schachtman et al 1998 moreover phosphorus levels in ffw and tfw soils were higher than those in water so that it promoted the release of soil phosphorus into water even though the flow sediment regulation induced an impulse delivery of phosphorus wang et al 2017 additionally the increase in water quantity with the changes in soil physicochemical properties e g soil ph and ec after the input of fresh water and sediments could influence the adsorption and desorption of phosphorus at the interface between soil and water the mineralization and immobilization of phosphorus and phosphorus leaching gaind and nain 2015 mullane et al 2015 bai et al 2017 phosphorus could also be transported between wetlands and outside areas with the input and output of fresh water and sediments johannesson et al 2015 the sem showed that soil wc salinity texture exchangeable mineral element contents and nutrient status were the key factors influencing soil phosphorus dynamics fig 7 generally soil wc increased and soil salinity decreased in the three wetlands so that the flow sediment regulation improved the growth of plants in the yellow river estuary wang et al 2016 however nutrient status e g som and tn had the greatest effects on op and ip fractions in the different flooding wetlands lebauer and treseder 2008 the primary productivity of the three wetlands was nearly limited by nitrogen the molar ratio of n p is 2 20 1 09 especially in tfw and ffw the molar ratio of n p 2 29 the nitrogen contents were not increased after the flow sediment regulation and thus the primary productivity in the three wetlands was still under nitrogen limited status additionally the soils in the three wetlands were under anaerobic reduction conditions caused by the excessive soil wc after the regulation which likely caused the release of some ip fractions fe al p and oc p from the wetland soils to the water thus increasing the migration of wetland phosphorus and possibly causing eutrophication in the coastal waters smith 2003 moreover bai et al 2019 showed that during the plant growing period from august to september phosphorus uptake by plants peaked in tfw and ffw therefore more research on the effects of the timing flow rate and duration of flow sediment regulation on soil phosphorus fraction dynamics environmental factors microorganisms and functional genes is still needed to determine the mechanisms influencing soil phosphorus transformation in estuarine wetlands a flow sediment regulation scheme to meet the needs of plant growth rhythms should be proposed which would be beneficial for improving phosphorus retention and the ecological restoration of estuarine wetlands other ecological restoration measures such as the addition of nitrogen fertilizer can be combined with flow sediment regulations and freshwater restoration to further restore vegetation and productivity in estuarine wetlands 5 conclusions we investigated the dynamics of soil phosphorus fractions in estuarine wetland soils experiencing different flooding conditions before and after flow sediment regulation the results showed that tp dominantly existed in the ip fraction especially ca p in three wetlands and op accounted for less than 12 of tp frw soils contained higher op levels and lower ip levels than tfw and ffw soils from april to august after the flow sediment regulation s l p in tfw tp in tfw and ffw and ml op in all three wetlands decreased mainly due to the freshwater input effectively reducing soil salinity and thus promoting plant growth and the absorption of nutrients fe al p and oc p decreased in the three wetland soils because continuous anaerobic conditions were formed after regulation and promoted their release generally the levels of phosphorus fractions were affected by water and salt conditions soil texture exchangeable mineral element contents and nutrient status the findings of this study can contribute to providing basic data regarding phosphorus fractions in estuarine wetland soils and guiding freshwater restoration and flow sediment regulation to enhance the ecological functions of estuarine wetlands however the amount of phosphorus migration including the phosphorus adsorbed by plants and input by litters the phosphorus adsorbed and desorbed at the interface between soil and water the phosphorus leached into the subsoil and the phosphorus input and output by flow and sediment should be measured quantitatively so that the effects of the flow sediment regulation on the phosphorus dynamics in estuarine wetlands can be further analyzed fe al p and oc p in the three wetlands was released and s l p in frw was increased after the regulation which might increase the risk of eutrophication in the coastal waters therefore a flow sediment regulation scheme to meet the needs of plant growth should be taken into consideration and such a scheme would be beneficial to control phosphorus fate and the water
