14690,anthropogenic activities and climate change have significantly increased mercury hg levels in seawater however the processes and sources of hg in differing marine compartments e g estuary marine continental shelf mcs or pelagic area have not been well studied which makes it difficult to understand hg cycling in marine ecosystems to address this issue the total hg thg concentration methylmercury mehg concentration and stable hg isotopes were determined in seawater and fish samples collected from differing marine compartments of the south china sea scs the results showed that the estuarine seawater exhibited substantially higher thg and mehg concentrations than those in the mcs and pelagic seawater significantly negative δ202hg 1 63 0 42 in estuarine seawater compared with that in pelagic seawater 0 58 0 08 may suggest watershed input and domestic sewage discharge of hg in the estuarine compartment the δ199hg value in estuarine fish 0 39 0 35 was obviously lower than that in mcs 1 10 0 54 and pelagic fish 1 15 0 46 which showed that relatively little mehg photodegradation occurred in the estuarine compartment the hg isotope binary mixing model based on δ200hg revealed that approximately 74 mehg in pelagic fish is derived from atmospheric hg ii deposition and over 60 mehg in mcs fish is derived from sediments mehg sources for estuarine fish may be highly complex e g sediment or riverine atmospheric input and further investigations are warranted to clarify the contribution of each source our study showed that hg stable isotopes in seawater and marine fish can be used to identify the processes and sources of hg in different marine compartments this finding is of great relevance to the development of marine hg food web models and the management of hg in fish graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords marine compartments seawater marine fish mercury sources isotope fractionation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mercury hg is a globally distributed pollutant and its toxicity depends on its chemical form mason et al 2012 methylmercury mehg is one of the organic forms of hg that can cause long term developmental delays in children and cardiovascular negative effects in adults bellanger et al 2013 mehg is mainly formed by anaerobic microbial methylation of inorganic hg ihg and can biomagnify at each successive trophic level tl in aqueous food webs which subsequently makes predatory fish exhibit concentrations that are approximately a million times higher than those in the water column krabbenhoft and sunderland 2013 marine ecosystems are exposed to a wide variety of hg sources owing to their exposure and proximity to the atmosphere land and rivers croizier et al 2020 anthropogenic hg emissions into the atmosphere are 5 to 10 fold higher than natural emissions and have resulted in surface seawater concentrations of hg that are approximately three times higher than pre anthropogenic levels lamborg et al 2014 watershed erosion can enhance the transport of large amounts of terrestrial hg to coastal seas mason et al 2012 and may be responsible for a large percentage of the riverine hg discharge into the ocean liu et al 2021a for instance high flow events under climate change can strongly contribute to this issue excessive hg input into marine ecosystems may be directly linked to an increased risk of mehg exposure through marine fish consumption krabbenhoft and sunderland 2013 schartup et al 2020 to better understand the health risks associated with mehg intake and to predict future mehg levels in marine fish in future growing efforts are needed to investigate the potential behaviour of hg in seawater and organisms in marine ecosystems however variations in hg sources mobility and underlying processes in differing marine compartments e g estuary marine continental shelf mcs or pelagic zone are complicated and have not been exhaustively studied mason et al 2012 maurice et al 2021 senn et al 2010 this lack of knowledge renders comprehensively understanding hg behaviour and bioaccumulation in marine ecosystems challenging perrot et al 2019 in recent studies hg stable isotopes are being increasingly used to obtain information for deciphering the environmental sources and processes of hg in natural ecosystems in recent studies blum et al 2014 kwon et al 2020 the kinetics processes and equilibrium exchange of hg can be delineated through mass dependant fractionation mdf and expressed as δ202hg kritee et al 2009 wiederhold et al 2010 zheng et al 2007 moreover hg is susceptible to mass independent fractionation mif in the environment bergquist and blum 2007 the mif of hg generally occurs through photochemical processes e g mehg photodegradation and hg2 photooxidation including odd mif and even mif tsui et al 2020a odd mif value is expressed as δ199hg or δ201hg whereas even mif value is denoted as δ200hg bergquist and blum 2007 the utilization of the hg isotope composition in water samples for hg source identification in the environment has gained considerable importance recent works have developed methods such as nanogold decorated silica monoliths absorption huber et al 2015 chlorine impregnated activated carbon preconcentration li et al 2019 and sulfide coprecipitation liu et al 2021b to accurately detect hg isotope values in natural water with ultratrace levels of hg previous observations have shown that the hg isotope composition in freshwater can be used to elucidate hg deposition pathways in forested watersheds and rivers jiskra et al 2017 tsui et al 2020b woerndle et al 2018 besides jiskra et al 2021 used hg isotopes and found that hg in seawater can be explained by the mixing of 42 atmospheric hg ⅱ gross deposition and 58 hg 0 gross uptake despite these findings the variations in hg isotopes in seawater from most marine compartments remain poorly understood consequently investigating hg isotope characteristics in seawater from differing marine compartments may provide novel insights into the fate of marine hg and global hg cycling furthermore because most of the hg in marine fish accumulates as mehg finding links between hg isotopes in marine fish and environmental media e g water column or sediment can help identify the sources and behaviour of mehg in marine food webs he et al 2023 gehrke et al 2011 found a correlation relationship between δ202hg between in coastal sediment and in fish in san francisco sf bay and proposed that mehg was mainly generated from local sediments given the absence of mif during most trophic transfer processes δ199hg values in marine organisms has been demonstrated to be an effective tracer for indicating the biogeochemical processes and production sites of mehg in seawater and sediment blum et al 2013 madigan et al 2018 maurice et al 2021 perrot et al 2019 sun et al 2020 δ200hg value is presumed to be exclusively generated by upper tropospheric and stratospheric photochemical reactions it is therefore identified as a conservative tracer for atmospheric hg deposition pathways in the environment fu et al 2021 he et al 2023 consequently we hypothesised that a combination of three dimensional hg isotope characteristics δ202hg δ199hg and δ200hg in marine fish seawater and coastal sediments could reveal the information on hg behaviour in the environment within differing marine compartments the south china sea scs is the largest semienclosed sea in the western tropical pacific ocean around developing asian countries it contains a variety of complex ecosystems and is vital in terms of global seafood production liu et al 2014 in this study we investigated total hg thg mehg concentrations and hg isotope characteristics in seawater and marine fish collected from estuarine mcs and pelagic zones of the scs carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n isotope ratios were also tested to determine the primary dietary sources tl and geographical differences in these fish lepak et al 2022 this study aimed to use hg isotopes to investigate the differences in hg sources in seawater and marine fish of differing marine compartments and to identify the underlying processes of hg in marine food webs so as to develop new insights into hg biogeochemical cycling in marine ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas and samples collection a total of 31 seawater and 89 wild marine fish samples were collected from the pearl river estuary pre estuarine area 24 seawater samples and 31 marine fish samples hainan island hni mcs area 2 seawater samples and 24 marine fish samples and xisha island xsi pelagic zone 5 seawater samples and 34 marine fish samples in the scs fig 1 from july 2021 to august 2021 details of the seawater sampling data sampling date longitude and latitude are provided in table s1 seawater samples were collected using an automatic water sampler ghy qcc15 10 l china approximately 100 ml of seawater from each sampling site was filtered with a 0 45 μm filter membrane and acidified with 0 2 ml ultrapure hno3 65 v v then stored in acid washed teflon bottles at 4 c before thg analysis as described in our previous work yang et al 2022 seawater for mehg analysis was also filtered by membrane and preserved with h2so4 9 mol l 0 2 ml for a 100 ml sample in addition 9 seawater samples 4 samples from the estuary 2 samples from the mcs and 3 samples from the pelagic zone were selected to detect the hg isotope composition 10 l were collected filtered through membrane and acidified with 20 ml ultrapure hno3 65 v v finally stored in the dark prior to isotope analysis li et al 2019 xia et al 2022 fish samples from the pre were collected through trawling whereas those from the hni and xsi were collected through sea fishing voyages the collected fish were preserved at 20 c in ice boxes and transported to the laboratory where the species weight and lengths of each fish were recorded table s2 muscle tissues were isolated from the fish samples lyophilised subjected to moisture content measurement homogenised using a pulveriser and finally stored at 4 c the average moisture content for all fish samples was 80 the details of the moisture content for each sample are given in table s2 2 2 thg and mehg analysis thg and mehg concentrations in seawater and fish samples were detected using cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectroscopy cvafs brooks rand model iii thg in the seawater samples was detected via brcl oxidation sncl2 reduction and dual amalgamation combined with cvafs measurements mehg in the seawater samples was detected using distillation aqueous phase ethylation gc separation and cvafs analysis following the method of fu et al 2010 the detection limits of thg and mehg for seawater samples were 0 1 ng l 1 and 0 009 ng l 1 respectively based on those detection limits 30 ml and 45 ml of each seawater samples were used to complete the thg and mehg concentration analyses respectively the deviations in thg and mehg in the duplicate seawater samples were 10 for thg in fish samples about 0 2 g fish tissue was digested with 5 ml hno3 65 v v at 95 c for 3 h and then hg concentrations were determined by the cvafs method as described in our previous work yang et al 2022 for mehg in fish samples approximately 0 1 g of samples was digested in 25 hno3 at 60 c for 12 h subsequently mehg concentrations were measured via aqueous ethylation purge trap and gas chromatography cvafs detection method with a 0 3 ng g 1 limit of detection the deviations in the duplicate fish samples were 15 the thg and mehg concentration recoveries in certified reference materials crms were 91 and 89 tort 3 n 11 respectively thg and mehg concentrations in fish samples were expressed as dry weights 2 3 c and n isotope analysis c δ13c and n δ15n stable isotope values in the fish samples were determined using a stable isotope instrument thermofisher mat253 usa ground fish tissue was packed in a tin capsule for c approximately 0 05 mg and n approximately 0 5 mg stable isotopic measurements the δ13c and δ15n isotopes were measured following established methodologies as documented in prior research and expressed as kim et al 2015 yang et al 2022 the quality control of δ13c and δ15n isotope measurements was performed using certified recovery materials c 3 δ13c 24 750 and n 1 δ15n 0 417 of the international atomic energy agency variations in both δ13c and δ15n in crms were considered 0 3 which confirms the accuracy of isotopic analysis to eliminate the δ13c fractionation effect associated with the lipid formation in fish a mathematical lipid correction based on the c n molar ratio was used and calculated as δ13ccorr hoffman et al 2015 lepak et al 2022 the c n molar ratios of all the samples are listed in table s2 in addition we estimated the tl for each fish sample using the corresponding δ15n values and baseline δ15n values the tl of each sample was calculated using eq 1 xu et al 2016 1 tl 1 δ 15 n sample δ 15 n baseline 3 4 0 where δ15nsample represents the δ15n values of the samples as reported in our previous study yang et al 2022 the δ15nbaseline corresponds to the δ15n values in producers of the different regions we measured the δ15n values of phytoplankton collected from the estuary mcs and pelagic zone of scs to estimate the baseline δ15n values 5 44 4 46 and 2 54 in the estuary mcs and pelagic zone respectively in different regions hong et al 2013 2 4 hg isotope analysis hg isotopes in the samples were measured using a nu plasma ii multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer mc icp ms at the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry institute of geochemistry chinese academy of sciences the hg isotopes in the seawater samples were analysed using the method proposed by li et al 2019 initially 10 l of the collected samples was oxidized with 0 1 brcl solution for at least 48 h to allow the hg species in the samples to be converted to hg2 thereafter we added 0 5 sncl2 to reduce hg2 to hg0 and it was purged with 2 5 l min of zero hg gas for 1 h to transfer the evaporated hg into a chlorinated activated carbon tube finally the hg in chlorinated activated carbon tube was removed by a pyrolysis device and absorbed into 5 ml of 40 anti aqua regia and stored at 4 c and kept in the dark prior to hg isotope analysis li et al 2019 the national institute of standards and technology standard reference materials 3133 nist srm 3133 was added to deionised water to be used as a crm n 3 for seawater hg isotope analysis yan et al 2023 for fish samples about 0 2 g of fish tissue was digested in 5 ml of hno3 at 95 c for 3 h and 0 5 ml of brcl 30 was subsequently added into the digested solution to maintain hg stability the hg2 digested solution was diluted using deionised water to approximate an acidity percentage of 20 and 1 ng g 1 of hg concentration before the hg isotope measurement tort 3 lobster n 3 and bcr 482 lichen n 3 were used as crms to estimate the pre treatment uncertainties of hg isotopes in the fish samples hg isotope solutions of seawater and fish were introduced into the mc icp ms by continuously reducing hg2 with 3 sncl2 and separating hg0 using a glass gas liquid phase separator the crms of nist srm 3177 n 3 and nist rm 8610 n 6 were used to estimate the analytical uncertainties table s3 summarizes δ202hg δ199hg δ200hg and δ201hg values of nist srm 3177 nist rm 8610 tort 3 and bcr 482 measured in this study and those reported by other laboratories according to the isotopic analysis precision of the mc icp ms the standard deviation sd for δ202hg δ199hg δ200hg and δ201hg were 0 10 0 04 0 04 and 0 04 respectively 2 5 hg isotope binary mixing model a binary mixing model was used to evaluate the quantitative contribution of mehg bioaccumulation from various environmental end member sources using the following equations 2 δ 200 h g f i s h δ 200 h g f 1 f 1 δ 200 h g f 2 f 2 3 f 1 f 2 1 where f1 and f2 represent the expected contribution of mehg derived from each source based on the observed δ200hg in marine fish the environmental end member sources depend on where the fish were collected from as described in the discussion section the sd values of the calculated contributions were estimated using a monte carlo error propagation approach n 10 000 using the python 3 9 software yang et al 2021 2 6 data analysis correlations between measured variables were characterized using linear regression analysis and the statistical significance of the correlation was evaluated using spss 19 0 and origin 2021 statistical software for windows in addition the york regression was used for δ199hg δ201hg slopes in this work york et al 2004 the thg concentration mehg concentration δ13c δ15n and hg isotope values of all samples were compared using a non parameter test mann whitney test at the 5 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 thg and mehg concentrations and hg isotope composition in seawater fig 2 a shows the thg and mehg concentrations in the seawater samples further information on the thg and mehg concentrations and mehg thg ratios for each seawater samples is given in table s4 overall the mean concentrations 1sd of thg in seawater were 5 52 4 96 ng l 1 1 22 24 4 ng l 1 2 40 0 745 ng l 1 1 88 2 93 ng l 1 and 1 27 0 399 ng l 1 0 77 1 70 ng l 1 in the estuary mcs and pelagic zone respectively fig 2a the differences in thg concentrations in seawater from the evaluated marine compartments were statistically significant p 0 05 mehg in seawater showed comparable contents between the pelagic zone and mcs p 0 05 which were 0 130 0 0566 ng l 1 0 0900 0 170 ng l 1 and 0 104 0 0288 ng l 1 0 0700 0 140 ng l 1 respectively however estuarine seawater exhibited significantly higher p 0 05 mehg values with an average of 0 251 0 160 ng l 1 0 100 0 650 ng l 1 fig 2a the average mehg thg ratios of seawater were 6 57 4 16 6 07 4 24 and 8 80 2 99 in the estuary mcs and pelagic zone respectively table s4 which were similar to previous observations stating that the mehg thg ratio in seawater is generally lower than 10 fu et al 2010 lamborg et al 2008 wang et al 2020 the thg and mehg concentration in mcs and pelagic seawater of this study were similar to those reported in background coastal sea environments such as those in the northern scs thg 0 8 2 3 ng l 1 mehg 0 05 0 22 ng l 1 bohai sea and yellow sea thg 0 75 3 94 ng l 1 mehg 0 05 0 22 ng l 1 and in the coast of black sea thg 0 32 2 0 ng l 1 mehg 0 01 0 2 ng l 1 fu et al 2010 lamborg et al 2008 wang et al 2020 however the thg concentration in estuarine seawater were nearly 4 folds higher than that in pelagic and mcs seawater and 2 folds for mehg in the same environments fig 2a especially anomalous high concentrations of thg 10 ng l 1 were found in the sampling sites of pre s3 10 2 ng l 1 pre s6 24 4 ng l 1 pre s7 10 2 ng l 1 fig 2a table s4 which suggested the potentially anthropogenic hg input to estuarine seawater therefore hg isotope compositions were further analysed to compare the differences in hg sources for the seawater collected from the three marine compartments the mean values of δ202hg δ199hg δ200hg and δ201hg measured in the scs seawater are presented in table 1 and detailed information on the hg isotope compositions of each seawater sample is given in table s5 in general δ202hg in all of seawater samples showed negative values and varied widely range from 2 23 to 0 50 this result resembled previous observations conducted in chinese coastal seawater fig 3 a such as guangxi and fujian coastal mangrove from 1 39 to 0 94 n 14 yundang lagoon from 2 18 to 1 06 n 7 and bohai sea from 1 28 to 1 14 n 2 huang et al 2020 2021 meng et al 2020 besides such values were slightly higher than those in terrestrial runoff such as those in the northern sweden forest runoff from 2 29 to 1 76 n 7 and in the northern minnesota forest stream from 2 12 to 1 32 n 24 jiskra et al 2017 woerndle et al 2018 in contrast δ199hg from 0 01 to 0 21 δ200hg from 0 05 to 0 08 and δ201hg from 0 07 to 0 09 spanned a relatively narrow range table s5 seawater collected from the three marine compartments showed comparable values p 0 05 of δ199hg estuary 0 09 0 10 mcs 0 10 0 14 pelagic zone 0 04 0 03 δ200hg estuary 0 01 0 06 mcs 0 01 0 03 pelagic zone 0 01 0 05 and δ201hg estuary 0 03 0 07 mcs 0 03 0 04 pelagic zone 0 01 0 03 table 1 similar δ199hg δ200hg and δ201hg values in seawater from different compartments lead to complications in distinguishing hg sources fig 3a however significant differences in δ202hg values were found between estuarine and pelagic seawater δ202hg in seawater of the estuary from 2 23 to 1 30 1 63 0 42 was significantly lower p 0 05 than that in the pelagic zone from 0 65 to 0 50 0 58 0 08 whereas mcs seawater presented similar δ202hg values from 1 16 to 0 72 0 94 0 31 compared with those in estuarine and pelagic zone seawater p 0 05 table 1 in addition a significant negative correlation was found between the thg concentration and δ202hg in all seawater samples fig 3b suggesting distinct sources of hg in the three marine compartments δ202hg values of the pelagic seawater are in the range of mediterranean and north atlantic seawater from 1 18 to 0 10 n 16 jiskra et al 2021 in the pelagic ocean atmospheric deposition dry and wet deposition represented the predominant pathway of hg input into the seawater moreover it has been reported that gas elemental hg gem and precipitation samples contain δ202hg values proximate to 0 jiskra et al 2021 tsui et al 2020b the relatively high value of δ202hg in pelagic seawater observed in this study may be explained by atmospheric hg deposition however terrestrial hg forest litter organic soil and mineral soil tend to present negative δ202hg value tsui et al 2020b woerndle et al 2018 for instance organic soil located at the surface layer of soil generally exhibits a δ202hg value lower than 1 5 demers et al 2013 kwon et al 2020 smith et al 2008 studies conducted in freshwater environments have demonstrated that hg bound to organic matter represents a large fraction of hg in runoff jiskra et al 2017 watershed inputs can erode and transport terrestrial hg into estuarine area leading to relatively low δ202hg values in estuarine seawater furthermore seawater in pre s7 showed high concentration of thg 10 2 ng l 1 and the highest negative value of δ202hg 2 23 rapid economic development and population increases have aggravated human discharge of hg around the estuarine areas of the scs yang et al 2022 yu et al 2010 previous observations have demonstrated that industrial sources of hg often present δ202hg values between 1 and 0 balogh et al 2015 emslie et al 2015 which suggests that high hg concentration in pre s7 was unaffected by industrial hg pollution in contrast zhang et al 2020 reported that domestic wastewater has markedly negative δ202hg values 2 48 0 10 compared to other kinds of sewage and terrestrial water input in pre and which is consistent with δ202hg in pre s7 therefore the hg isotope results showed that in addition to watershed input domestic wastewater may also act as an important hg source in estuarine areas with rapid population growth we propose that different sources of hg can to a large extent cause the hg in the estuarine and pelagic zone to exhibit distinct δ202hg values δ202hg values of the mcs may be explained by the mixing of estuarine and pelagic hg 3 2 hg levels and c and n isotope properties in marine fish the thg concentrations in marine fish samples have been reported in our previous work yang et al 2022 and are presented in fig 2b although pelagic fish showed significantly lower tl compared to mcs and estuarine fish table s6 we found that fish collected from mcs exhibited the highest thg concentration 742 520 ng g 1 followed by those from the pelagic zone 451 378 ng g 1 and the lowest thg concentration was found in estuarine fish 143 127 ng g 1 fig 2b similarly large variations in mehg concentrations 11 3 2040 μg kg were found in all fish samples table s6 fish from the different compartments exhibited significantly different mehg contents p 0 05 with concentrations in mcs 131 1690 ng g 1 635 464 ng g 1 pelagic zone 31 5 2040 ng g 1 403 362 ng g 1 estuary 11 3 421 ng g 1 116 119 ng g 1 fig 2b the average mehg thg ratios of marine fish were 75 1 17 1 85 6 10 0 and 86 5 9 57 in the estuary mcs and pelagic zone respectively table s6 details of the thg and mehg concentrations and the mehg thg ratios in the marine fish samples are given in table s6 although high thg and mehg concentrations were found in estuarine seawater the hg concentration in fish from the estuarine region was relatively low fig 2b this low value may be explained by the increased demand for fish driven by rapid population growth in the pre region which has resulted in a series of ecological modification effects such as food chain length shortage and hg biomagnification suppression tsui et al 2022 the δ13ccorr and δ15n values for all fish samples are presented in fig s1 other details of the δ13ccorr δ15n and tl values for each marine fish sample are provided in table s6 δ13ccorr value in fish varied from 23 3 to 11 6 with significantly different values p 0 05 were observed in the fish of the three compartments i e pelagic zone from 18 7 to 11 6 15 3 1 30 mcs from 21 3 to 12 0 16 5 2 40 estuary from 23 3 to 15 6 19 5 2 07 fig s1a given the conservation of δ13c enrichment depletion 0 4 during trophic transfer δ13c measurement is a useful approach for identifying the dietary sources of aquatic species xu et al 2016 marine fish have been previously shown to possess higher δ13c values 21 3 to 14 4 than those of freshwater fish 29 4 to 24 5 asante et al 2008 2010 gu et al 2018 wang et al 2011 this could be explained by the different δ13c signals exhibited by the primary organic matter in marine 21 0 to 18 0 and terrestrial 27 0 to 25 0 ecosystems fry 1988 peterson and fry 1987 relatively negative δ13ccorr values in estuarine fish may indicate terrestrial dietary sources whereas significantly less negative δ13ccorr values in pelagic fish may suggest marine dietary sources δ13ccorr characteristics of the mcs are likely attributable to the mixing of estuarine and pelagic diets fig s1a δ15n values were reported in our previous studies yang et al 2022 δ15n values in fish of pelagic zone 7 01 9 55 8 47 0 562 were significantly lower p 0 01 than those in mcs 7 42 15 3 11 8 2 09 and in the estuary 9 10 16 6 12 8 1 57 whereas those of mcs and estuarine fish were comparable p 0 05 fig s1b both trophic transfer enrichment and the food web baseline values of δ15n can affect the δ15n ratios in marine fish perrot et al 2019 senn et al 2010 xu et al 2016 δ15n baseline in ecosystems can be represented by bulk δ15n in phytoplankton differences in δ15n values section 2 3 amongst estuarine mcs and pelagic phytoplankton suggested distinct n input amongst the three marine compartments the overall tl of the collected fish ranged from 1 87 to 4 28 and the values of tl in mcs tl 3 16 0 615 and estuary tl 3 17 0 469 fish were comparable p 0 05 and both were higher than those in pelagic fish tl 2 74 0 165 p 0 01 table s6 hg levels c and n isotopes showed distinct patterns in the marine fish collected from the three marine compartments δ13ccorr and δ15n in all samples showed a significantly negative linear regression fig s2 however no correlation was observed between δ13ccorr and δ15n at each site indicating that c and n isotopes could be used to differentiate amongst fish from diverse geographical regions in marine ecosystems furthermore although hg levels dietary sources and food web structures were different we found that tl and log mehg were positively correlated in all regions fig s3 suggesting that biomagnification plays an important role in determining mehg concentration in marine fish 3 3 hg isotope composition and underlying processes of mehg in marine fish the mean values of δ202hg δ199hg δ200hg and δ201hg measured in the fish of this study are shown in table 1 a comparison of δ202hg and δ199hg in the fish and seawater samples is shown in fig 4 a fish samples presented a wide range of δ202hg from 0 61 to 1 23 δ199hg from 0 14 to 2 35 and δ201hg from 0 06 to 1 87 whereas they showed a relatively narrow range of δ200hg from 0 07 to 0 18 table s5 δ202hg in fish of the estuary from 0 53 to 0 46 0 07 0 27 and mcs from 0 61 to 0 28 0 20 0 24 were comparable p 0 05 however significantly heavier p 0 01 δ202hg were found in pelagic fish from 0 01 to 1 23 0 53 0 32 table 1 table s5 the mean value of δ202hg in mcs and estuarine fish were both close to 0 which is similar to those of organisms collected in the pre area 0 14 0 20 n 18 and the east coast of china 0 07 0 50 n 27 yang et al 2021 yin et al 2016 however the δ202hg values in pelagic fish were proximate to that in the north pacific ocean npo 0 63 0 42 n 28 blum et al 2013 δ199hg values were similar for both pelagic 0 60 2 34 1 15 0 46 and mcs 0 45 2 35 1 10 0 54 fish p 0 05 which are significantly higher p 0 01 than that in estuarine fish 0 14 1 55 0 39 0 35 table 1 table s5 similarly the results of δ201hg closely corresponded with the δ199hg measurements which ranged from 0 06 to 1 35 0 41 0 30 0 26 to 1 87 0 83 0 46 and 0 55 to 1 83 0 94 0 37 for estuarine mcs and pelagic fish respectively table 1 table s5 finally δ200hg values showed comparable patterns p 0 05 in fish of mcs 0 07 0 16 0 05 0 06 and estuary 0 02 0 11 0 07 0 02 whereas fish of pelagic zone had significantly higher p 0 01 δ200hg values 0 02 0 18 0 10 0 04 compared with those in the estuary and mcs table 1 table s5 details of the hg isotope compositions of each fish sample are provided in table s5 odd mif occurs alongside with mehg photodegradation and hg ii photoreduction in aquatic ecosystems bergquist and blum 2007 given the absence of photochemical reactions during trophic transfer processes δ199hg and δ201hg values in organisms reflect the odd mif composition of mehg prior to its entering the food web tsui et al 2020a moreover the δ199hg δ201hg ratio is a diagnostic method to identify the two photochemical reaction types with an experimental value of 1 36 for mehg photodegradation and 1 0 for hg ii photoreduction blum et al 2014 δ199hg and δ201hg values in all fish samples were positively correlated with a slope of 1 18 0 01 york regression fig 4b which is consistent with previous work conducted in coastal areas e g pre area slope 1 26 and the east coast of china slope 1 22 yang et al 2021 yin et al 2016 this result suggested that the odd mif in fish of this work is produced by mehg photodegradation processes in contrast hg isotopes detected in seawater generally indicate the ihg behaviour because of the high percentage of ihg in seawater relatively higher δ202hg and δ199hg values in mehg compared with those in ihg were mainly attributed to the mehg photodegradation fig 4a in this study notably smaller δ199hg and δ201hg values were observed in the estuarine fish than those in the great lakes open ocean plateau lakes and most of coastal bays except the bohai bay conversely mcs and pelagic fish exhibited relatively higher odd mif which were only lower than those of the open ocean and great lakes fig s4 all fish considered in the present study had a habitat depth of 200 m which reduced the vertical hg isotope variation in the ocean blum et al 2013 therefore we propose that much less mehg photodegradation occurred in estuarine seawater than in the mcs and pelagic seawater the extent of mehg photodegradation is affected by light intensity and dissolved organic carbon doc levels bergquist and blum 2007 lepak et al 2018 earlier findings demonstrated that the doc concentration in the pre region and in the northern slope of scs were comparable approximately 1 33 mg l and 0 91 mg l respectively he et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 however the water turbidity of the pre seawater 4 5 ntu is significantly higher than that in the open ocean of the scs 1 ntu wang et al 2021 thus the low extent of mehg photodegradation in the estuarine region of the scs can be explained by the high turbidity of seawater which directly reduces the light intensity we quantified the percentage of mehg photodegradation based on δ199hg using a previously reported method bergquist and blum 2007 which was expected to help elucidate the differences in the potential photochemical processes of mehg in the estuary mcs and pelagic zones of the scs we estimated that 12 9 31 13 and 33 11 of mehg occurred photodegradation prior to entering the food web in the estuary mcs and pelagic zones of scs respectively except for external hg input relatively weak mehg photodegradation may act as another factor to explain high mehg concentration in seawater of the estuarine region 3 4 primary sources of mehg in marine fish it has been reported that most biogeochemical processes do not cause even mif except for the atmospheric photooxidation process which can lead to positive δ200hg in precipitation chen et al 2012 thus δ200hg can be used as a proxy to investigate mehg sources related to atmospheric deposition in the environment jiskra et al 2021 a comparison of δ200hg values of estuary mcs and pelagic fish from the scs this study bohai bay bhb meng et al 2020 npo blum et al 2013 the east pacific ocean madigan et al 2018 and the great lakes lepak et al 2018 is shown in fig 5 previous works have found that fish collected from open ocean generally show positive δ200hg he et al 2023 which is consistent with the data found in pelagic fish the pelagic region of the scs with a depth 1000 m is barely affected by any external hg sources such as watershed and sediment disturbances in addition the presence of coral reefs indicate that no frequent volcanic activity in the scs since the early pleistocene zhan et al 2006 which excludes geological hg input to the pelagic zone of the scs therefore the pelagic zone can be considered to have absorbed hg from the atmosphere atmospheric hg can enter marine ecosystems through wet and dry hg ii deposition as well as hg 0 dissolution blum et al 2013 kwon et al 2020 hg ii is associated with cloud droplets and is concentrated in precipitation causing rainfall samples to have a positive δ200hg recent models suggest that in ocean regions the combination of wet and dry hg ii deposition maintain the δ200hg values between 0 11 and 0 20 around the latitude of 15 n meanwhile hg 0 showed an average δ200hg value of 0 06 median interquartile range 0 08 to 0 02 demers et al 2015 fu et al 2018 jiskra et al 2021 significant differences in δ200hg values were observed between hg ii and hg 0 end members p 0 001 thus the isotopic mixing binary model explained in section 2 5 can quantify the atmospheric contribution of hg ii and hg 0 in fish in the pelagic zone the results showed that atmospheric hg ii contributes 74 11 1sd of mehg to pelagic fish recent studies proposed that hg methylation in seawater generally occurs in the water column at the oxygen minimum zone omz krabbenhoft and sunderland 2013 blum et al 2013 hg ii can be transported from the ocean surface to the omz by binding to sinking particles which are finally methylated to mehg lepak et al 2018 motta et al 2022 sun et al 2020 subsequently mehg migrates to the upper ocean through upwelling and is absorbed by various algae and bacteria which finally accumulate in marine fish blum et al 2013 considering the absence of even mif during hg methylation upwelling transportation and mehg biomagnification mehg formed in marine fish tends to retain the δ200hg characteristics of hg ii conversely hg 0 in seawater has not been found to be directly involved in the hg methylation processes blum et al 2013 as a result the water column exhibits high lability and susceptibility to the methylation of hg ii leading to increased bioaccumulation of mehg in marine fish from atmospheric hg ii sources in addition as the mcs region is far from mainland of china and is weakly affected by riverine input fig 1 we propose that sedimentary and atmospheric inputs are the two predominant sources of mehg accumulated in fish the atmospheric hg input is mainly related to precipitation which is linked to latitude chen et al 2012 jiskra et al 2021 thus the comparable latitudes of the mcs and pelagic zones of the scs should yield similar δ200hg values for local fish fig 1 because pelagic fish possessed significantly higher values of δ200hg than scs coastal sediment p 0 006 the significantly lower δ200hg values in mcs fish may be attributable to the contribution of sediment hg again using the hg isotope binary mixing model we estimated the contribution of sedimentary hg to mcs fish section 2 5 the two end members were atmospheric hg and sedimentary hg the δ200hg values for atmospheric hg were considered equal to those for pelagic fish mean 0 10 interquartile range 0 09 0 11 and the δ200hg values for sediment mean 0 01 interquartile range 0 00 0 02 were provided by yin et al 2015 the results showed that sediment contributed 62 19 of the bioaccumulated mehg in mcs fish which is an important observation for the development of marine hg food web models overall δ200hg values in marine fish can provide information on atmospheric hg deposition particularly for understanding the contribution of hg ii and hg 0 to mehg bioaccumulation however because of the small variation in δ200hg in the environment the δ200hg binary mixing model has limitations to some extent for instance distinguishing end member and calculating uncertainties need to be achieved carefully further studies are required to develop highly precise hg measurement methods to enhance the application of δ200hg finally mehg accumulated in estuarine fish may be obtained from riverine inputs anthropogenic emissions section 3 1 sediment release and atmospheric deposition which represent a complex ecosystem bosignore et al 2015 yin et al 2015 2016 riverine hg input can elevate δ200hg values in estuarine fish which is consistent with relatively higher δ200hg signatures determined in watershed rivers in the estuarine zones of scs in a previous work mean 0 08 interquartile range 0 04 0 09 zhang et al 2020 however in the application of the δ200hg mixing model separating several endmembers is difficult therefore we did not quantify the mehg sources in estuarine fish advanced approaches e g mehg specific isotope analysis need to be developed to quantify mehg sources in estuarine fish and to establish comprehensive profiles for hg biogeochemical cycling in the marine ecosystems 4 conclusion hg isotopes were used to identify the sources and processes of hg in food webs within three differing marine compartments e g estuary mcs and pelagic zone the estuarine seawater had significantly higher thg and mehg levels than the mcs and pelagic seawater compared with the pelagic zone estuarine seawater had a lower δ202hg value suggesting hg sources from watershed input and human sewage discharge the combination of cn isotopes can contributed to distinguishing the dietary sources and trophic levels of fish from the differing marine compartments δ202hg δ199hg and δ201hg revealed the underlying processes of mehg accumulation in fish collected from the estuary mcs and pelagic zone estuarine regions occurred notably low mehg degradation due to its high water turbidity in addition δ200hg value was used to quantify hg sources in marine fish distinct δ200hg values in pelagic and coastal fish provide an overall profile of atmospheric hg deposition and helped us to understand contribution of hg ii and hg 0 moreover the δ200hg values presented information on the sedimentary hg burden to mehg bioaccumulation our observations support the idea that the analysis of hg isotopes in seawater and fish provide comprehensive on the behaviour of hg in marine ecosystems however quantifying hg sources in estuarine fish remains challenging optimization of isotope mixing model parameters and mehg specific isotope analysis are

14690,anthropogenic activities and climate change have significantly increased mercury hg levels in seawater however the processes and sources of hg in differing marine compartments e g estuary marine continental shelf mcs or pelagic area have not been well studied which makes it difficult to understand hg cycling in marine ecosystems to address this issue the total hg thg concentration methylmercury mehg concentration and stable hg isotopes were determined in seawater and fish samples collected from differing marine compartments of the south china sea scs the results showed that the estuarine seawater exhibited substantially higher thg and mehg concentrations than those in the mcs and pelagic seawater significantly negative δ202hg 1 63 0 42 in estuarine seawater compared with that in pelagic seawater 0 58 0 08 may suggest watershed input and domestic sewage discharge of hg in the estuarine compartment the δ199hg value in estuarine fish 0 39 0 35 was obviously lower than that in mcs 1 10 0 54 and pelagic fish 1 15 0 46 which showed that relatively little mehg photodegradation occurred in the estuarine compartment the hg isotope binary mixing model based on δ200hg revealed that approximately 74 mehg in pelagic fish is derived from atmospheric hg ii deposition and over 60 mehg in mcs fish is derived from sediments mehg sources for estuarine fish may be highly complex e g sediment or riverine atmospheric input and further investigations are warranted to clarify the contribution of each source our study showed that hg stable isotopes in seawater and marine fish can be used to identify the processes and sources of hg in different marine compartments this finding is of great relevance to the development of marine hg food web models and the management of hg in fish graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords marine compartments seawater marine fish mercury sources isotope fractionation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mercury hg is a globally distributed pollutant and its toxicity depends on its chemical form mason et al 2012 methylmercury mehg is one of the organic forms of hg that can cause long term developmental delays in children and cardiovascular negative effects in adults bellanger et al 2013 mehg is mainly formed by anaerobic microbial methylation of inorganic hg ihg and can biomagnify at each successive trophic level tl in aqueous food webs which subsequently makes predatory fish exhibit concentrations that are approximately a million times higher than those in the water column krabbenhoft and sunderland 2013 marine ecosystems are exposed to a wide variety of hg sources owing to their exposure and proximity to the atmosphere land and rivers croizier et al 2020 anthropogenic hg emissions into the atmosphere are 5 to 10 fold higher than natural emissions and have resulted in surface seawater concentrations of hg that are approximately three times higher than pre anthropogenic levels lamborg et al 2014 watershed erosion can enhance the transport of large amounts of terrestrial hg to coastal seas mason et al 2012 and may be responsible for a large percentage of the riverine hg discharge into the ocean liu et al 2021a for instance high flow events under climate change can strongly contribute to this issue excessive hg input into marine ecosystems may be directly linked to an increased risk of mehg exposure through marine fish consumption krabbenhoft and sunderland 2013 schartup et al 2020 to better understand the health risks associated with mehg intake and to predict future mehg levels in marine fish in future growing efforts are needed to investigate the potential behaviour of hg in seawater and organisms in marine ecosystems however variations in hg sources mobility and underlying processes in differing marine compartments e g estuary marine continental shelf mcs or pelagic zone are complicated and have not been exhaustively studied mason et al 2012 maurice et al 2021 senn et al 2010 this lack of knowledge renders comprehensively understanding hg behaviour and bioaccumulation in marine ecosystems challenging perrot et al 2019 in recent studies hg stable isotopes are being increasingly used to obtain information for deciphering the environmental sources and processes of hg in natural ecosystems in recent studies blum et al 2014 kwon et al 2020 the kinetics processes and equilibrium exchange of hg can be delineated through mass dependant fractionation mdf and expressed as δ202hg kritee et al 2009 wiederhold et al 2010 zheng et al 2007 moreover hg is susceptible to mass independent fractionation mif in the environment bergquist and blum 2007 the mif of hg generally occurs through photochemical processes e g mehg photodegradation and hg2 photooxidation including odd mif and even mif tsui et al 2020a odd mif value is expressed as δ199hg or δ201hg whereas even mif value is denoted as δ200hg bergquist and blum 2007 the utilization of the hg isotope composition in water samples for hg source identification in the environment has gained considerable importance recent works have developed methods such as nanogold decorated silica monoliths absorption huber et al 2015 chlorine impregnated activated carbon preconcentration li et al 2019 and sulfide coprecipitation liu et al 2021b to accurately detect hg isotope values in natural water with ultratrace levels of hg previous observations have shown that the hg isotope composition in freshwater can be used to elucidate hg deposition pathways in forested watersheds and rivers jiskra et al 2017 tsui et al 2020b woerndle et al 2018 besides jiskra et al 2021 used hg isotopes and found that hg in seawater can be explained by the mixing of 42 atmospheric hg ⅱ gross deposition and 58 hg 0 gross uptake despite these findings the variations in hg isotopes in seawater from most marine compartments remain poorly understood consequently investigating hg isotope characteristics in seawater from differing marine compartments may provide novel insights into the fate of marine hg and global hg cycling furthermore because most of the hg in marine fish accumulates as mehg finding links between hg isotopes in marine fish and environmental media e g water column or sediment can help identify the sources and behaviour of mehg in marine food webs he et al 2023 gehrke et al 2011 found a correlation relationship between δ202hg between in coastal sediment and in fish in san francisco sf bay and proposed that mehg was mainly generated from local sediments given the absence of mif during most trophic transfer processes δ199hg values in marine organisms has been demonstrated to be an effective tracer for indicating the biogeochemical processes and production sites of mehg in seawater and sediment blum et al 2013 madigan et al 2018 maurice et al 2021 perrot et al 2019 sun et al 2020 δ200hg value is presumed to be exclusively generated by upper tropospheric and stratospheric photochemical reactions it is therefore identified as a conservative tracer for atmospheric hg deposition pathways in the environment fu et al 2021 he et al 2023 consequently we hypothesised that a combination of three dimensional hg isotope characteristics δ202hg δ199hg and δ200hg in marine fish seawater and coastal sediments could reveal the information on hg behaviour in the environment within differing marine compartments the south china sea scs is the largest semienclosed sea in the western tropical pacific ocean around developing asian countries it contains a variety of complex ecosystems and is vital in terms of global seafood production liu et al 2014 in this study we investigated total hg thg mehg concentrations and hg isotope characteristics in seawater and marine fish collected from estuarine mcs and pelagic zones of the scs carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n isotope ratios were also tested to determine the primary dietary sources tl and geographical differences in these fish lepak et al 2022 this study aimed to use hg isotopes to investigate the differences in hg sources in seawater and marine fish of differing marine compartments and to identify the underlying processes of hg in marine food webs so as to develop new insights into hg biogeochemical cycling in marine ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas and samples collection a total of 31 seawater and 89 wild marine fish samples were collected from the pearl river estuary pre estuarine area 24 seawater samples and 31 marine fish samples hainan island hni mcs area 2 seawater samples and 24 marine fish samples and xisha island xsi pelagic zone 5 seawater samples and 34 marine fish samples in the scs fig 1 from july 2021 to august 2021 details of the seawater sampling data sampling date longitude and latitude are provided in table s1 seawater samples were collected using an automatic water sampler ghy qcc15 10 l china approximately 100 ml of seawater from each sampling site was filtered with a 0 45 μm filter membrane and acidified with 0 2 ml ultrapure hno3 65 v v then stored in acid washed teflon bottles at 4 c before thg analysis as described in our previous work yang et al 2022 seawater for mehg analysis was also filtered by membrane and preserved with h2so4 9 mol l 0 2 ml for a 100 ml sample in addition 9 seawater samples 4 samples from the estuary 2 samples from the mcs and 3 samples from the pelagic zone were selected to detect the hg isotope composition 10 l were collected filtered through membrane and acidified with 20 ml ultrapure hno3 65 v v finally stored in the dark prior to isotope analysis li et al 2019 xia et al 2022 fish samples from the pre were collected through trawling whereas those from the hni and xsi were collected through sea fishing voyages the collected fish were preserved at 20 c in ice boxes and transported to the laboratory where the species weight and lengths of each fish were recorded table s2 muscle tissues were isolated from the fish samples lyophilised subjected to moisture content measurement homogenised using a pulveriser and finally stored at 4 c the average moisture content for all fish samples was 80 the details of the moisture content for each sample are given in table s2 2 2 thg and mehg analysis thg and mehg concentrations in seawater and fish samples were detected using cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectroscopy cvafs brooks rand model iii thg in the seawater samples was detected via brcl oxidation sncl2 reduction and dual amalgamation combined with cvafs measurements mehg in the seawater samples was detected using distillation aqueous phase ethylation gc separation and cvafs analysis following the method of fu et al 2010 the detection limits of thg and mehg for seawater samples were 0 1 ng l 1 and 0 009 ng l 1 respectively based on those detection limits 30 ml and 45 ml of each seawater samples were used to complete the thg and mehg concentration analyses respectively the deviations in thg and mehg in the duplicate seawater samples were 10 for thg in fish samples about 0 2 g fish tissue was digested with 5 ml hno3 65 v v at 95 c for 3 h and then hg concentrations were determined by the cvafs method as described in our previous work yang et al 2022 for mehg in fish samples approximately 0 1 g of samples was digested in 25 hno3 at 60 c for 12 h subsequently mehg concentrations were measured via aqueous ethylation purge trap and gas chromatography cvafs detection method with a 0 3 ng g 1 limit of detection the deviations in the duplicate fish samples were 15 the thg and mehg concentration recoveries in certified reference materials crms were 91 and 89 tort 3 n 11 respectively thg and mehg concentrations in fish samples were expressed as dry weights 2 3 c and n isotope analysis c δ13c and n δ15n stable isotope values in the fish samples were determined using a stable isotope instrument thermofisher mat253 usa ground fish tissue was packed in a tin capsule for c approximately 0 05 mg and n approximately 0 5 mg stable isotopic measurements the δ13c and δ15n isotopes were measured following established methodologies as documented in prior research and expressed as kim et al 2015 yang et al 2022 the quality control of δ13c and δ15n isotope measurements was performed using certified recovery materials c 3 δ13c 24 750 and n 1 δ15n 0 417 of the international atomic energy agency variations in both δ13c and δ15n in crms were considered 0 3 which confirms the accuracy of isotopic analysis to eliminate the δ13c fractionation effect associated with the lipid formation in fish a mathematical lipid correction based on the c n molar ratio was used and calculated as δ13ccorr hoffman et al 2015 lepak et al 2022 the c n molar ratios of all the samples are listed in table s2 in addition we estimated the tl for each fish sample using the corresponding δ15n values and baseline δ15n values the tl of each sample was calculated using eq 1 xu et al 2016 1 tl 1 δ 15 n sample δ 15 n baseline 3 4 0 where δ15nsample represents the δ15n values of the samples as reported in our previous study yang et al 2022 the δ15nbaseline corresponds to the δ15n values in producers of the different regions we measured the δ15n values of phytoplankton collected from the estuary mcs and pelagic zone of scs to estimate the baseline δ15n values 5 44 4 46 and 2 54 in the estuary mcs and pelagic zone respectively in different regions hong et al 2013 2 4 hg isotope analysis hg isotopes in the samples were measured using a nu plasma ii multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer mc icp ms at the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry institute of geochemistry chinese academy of sciences the hg isotopes in the seawater samples were analysed using the method proposed by li et al 2019 initially 10 l of the collected samples was oxidized with 0 1 brcl solution for at least 48 h to allow the hg species in the samples to be converted to hg2 thereafter we added 0 5 sncl2 to reduce hg2 to hg0 and it was purged with 2 5 l min of zero hg gas for 1 h to transfer the evaporated hg into a chlorinated activated carbon tube finally the hg in chlorinated activated carbon tube was removed by a pyrolysis device and absorbed into 5 ml of 40 anti aqua regia and stored at 4 c and kept in the dark prior to hg isotope analysis li et al 2019 the national institute of standards and technology standard reference materials 3133 nist srm 3133 was added to deionised water to be used as a crm n 3 for seawater hg isotope analysis yan et al 2023 for fish samples about 0 2 g of fish tissue was digested in 5 ml of hno3 at 95 c for 3 h and 0 5 ml of brcl 30 was subsequently added into the digested solution to maintain hg stability the hg2 digested solution was diluted using deionised water to approximate an acidity percentage of 20 and 1 ng g 1 of hg concentration before the hg isotope measurement tort 3 lobster n 3 and bcr 482 lichen n 3 were used as crms to estimate the pre treatment uncertainties of hg isotopes in the fish samples hg isotope solutions of seawater and fish were introduced into the mc icp ms by continuously reducing hg2 with 3 sncl2 and separating hg0 using a glass gas liquid phase separator the crms of nist srm 3177 n 3 and nist rm 8610 n 6 were used to estimate the analytical uncertainties table s3 summarizes δ202hg δ199hg δ200hg and δ201hg values of nist srm 3177 nist rm 8610 tort 3 and bcr 482 measured in this study and those reported by other laboratories according to the isotopic analysis precision of the mc icp ms the standard deviation sd for δ202hg δ199hg δ200hg and δ201hg were 0 10 0 04 0 04 and 0 04 respectively 2 5 hg isotope binary mixing model a binary mixing model was used to evaluate the quantitative contribution of mehg bioaccumulation from various environmental end member sources using the following equations 2 δ 200 h g f i s h δ 200 h g f 1 f 1 δ 200 h g f 2 f 2 3 f 1 f 2 1 where f1 and f2 represent the expected contribution of mehg derived from each source based on the observed δ200hg in marine fish the environmental end member sources depend on where the fish were collected from as described in the discussion section the sd values of the calculated contributions were estimated using a monte carlo error propagation approach n 10 000 using the python 3 9 software yang et al 2021 2 6 data analysis correlations between measured variables were characterized using linear regression analysis and the statistical significance of the correlation was evaluated using spss 19 0 and origin 2021 statistical software for windows in addition the york regression was used for δ199hg δ201hg slopes in this work york et al 2004 the thg concentration mehg concentration δ13c δ15n and hg isotope values of all samples were compared using a non parameter test mann whitney test at the 5 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 thg and mehg concentrations and hg isotope composition in seawater fig 2 a shows the thg and mehg concentrations in the seawater samples further information on the thg and mehg concentrations and mehg thg ratios for each seawater samples is given in table s4 overall the mean concentrations 1sd of thg in seawater were 5 52 4 96 ng l 1 1 22 24 4 ng l 1 2 40 0 745 ng l 1 1 88 2 93 ng l 1 and 1 27 0 399 ng l 1 0 77 1 70 ng l 1 in the estuary mcs and pelagic zone respectively fig 2a the differences in thg concentrations in seawater from the evaluated marine compartments were statistically significant p 0 05 mehg in seawater showed comparable contents between the pelagic zone and mcs p 0 05 which were 0 130 0 0566 ng l 1 0 0900 0 170 ng l 1 and 0 104 0 0288 ng l 1 0 0700 0 140 ng l 1 respectively however estuarine seawater exhibited significantly higher p 0 05 mehg values with an average of 0 251 0 160 ng l 1 0 100 0 650 ng l 1 fig 2a the average mehg thg ratios of seawater were 6 57 4 16 6 07 4 24 and 8 80 2 99 in the estuary mcs and pelagic zone respectively table s4 which were similar to previous observations stating that the mehg thg ratio in seawater is generally lower than 10 fu et al 2010 lamborg et al 2008 wang et al 2020 the thg and mehg concentration in mcs and pelagic seawater of this study were similar to those reported in background coastal sea environments such as those in the northern scs thg 0 8 2 3 ng l 1 mehg 0 05 0 22 ng l 1 bohai sea and yellow sea thg 0 75 3 94 ng l 1 mehg 0 05 0 22 ng l 1 and in the coast of black sea thg 0 32 2 0 ng l 1 mehg 0 01 0 2 ng l 1 fu et al 2010 lamborg et al 2008 wang et al 2020 however the thg concentration in estuarine seawater were nearly 4 folds higher than that in pelagic and mcs seawater and 2 folds for mehg in the same environments fig 2a especially anomalous high concentrations of thg 10 ng l 1 were found in the sampling sites of pre s3 10 2 ng l 1 pre s6 24 4 ng l 1 pre s7 10 2 ng l 1 fig 2a table s4 which suggested the potentially anthropogenic hg input to estuarine seawater therefore hg isotope compositions were further analysed to compare the differences in hg sources for the seawater collected from the three marine compartments the mean values of δ202hg δ199hg δ200hg and δ201hg measured in the scs seawater are presented in table 1 and detailed information on the hg isotope compositions of each seawater sample is given in table s5 in general δ202hg in all of seawater samples showed negative values and varied widely range from 2 23 to 0 50 this result resembled previous observations conducted in chinese coastal seawater fig 3 a such as guangxi and fujian coastal mangrove from 1 39 to 0 94 n 14 yundang lagoon from 2 18 to 1 06 n 7 and bohai sea from 1 28 to 1 14 n 2 huang et al 2020 2021 meng et al 2020 besides such values were slightly higher than those in terrestrial runoff such as those in the northern sweden forest runoff from 2 29 to 1 76 n 7 and in the northern minnesota forest stream from 2 12 to 1 32 n 24 jiskra et al 2017 woerndle et al 2018 in contrast δ199hg from 0 01 to 0 21 δ200hg from 0 05 to 0 08 and δ201hg from 0 07 to 0 09 spanned a relatively narrow range table s5 seawater collected from the three marine compartments showed comparable values p 0 05 of δ199hg estuary 0 09 0 10 mcs 0 10 0 14 pelagic zone 0 04 0 03 δ200hg estuary 0 01 0 06 mcs 0 01 0 03 pelagic zone 0 01 0 05 and δ201hg estuary 0 03 0 07 mcs 0 03 0 04 pelagic zone 0 01 0 03 table 1 similar δ199hg δ200hg and δ201hg values in seawater from different compartments lead to complications in distinguishing hg sources fig 3a however significant differences in δ202hg values were found between estuarine and pelagic seawater δ202hg in seawater of the estuary from 2 23 to 1 30 1 63 0 42 was significantly lower p 0 05 than that in the pelagic zone from 0 65 to 0 50 0 58 0 08 whereas mcs seawater presented similar δ202hg values from 1 16 to 0 72 0 94 0 31 compared with those in estuarine and pelagic zone seawater p 0 05 table 1 in addition a significant negative correlation was found between the thg concentration and δ202hg in all seawater samples fig 3b suggesting distinct sources of hg in the three marine compartments δ202hg values of the pelagic seawater are in the range of mediterranean and north atlantic seawater from 1 18 to 0 10 n 16 jiskra et al 2021 in the pelagic ocean atmospheric deposition dry and wet deposition represented the predominant pathway of hg input into the seawater moreover it has been reported that gas elemental hg gem and precipitation samples contain δ202hg values proximate to 0 jiskra et al 2021 tsui et al 2020b the relatively high value of δ202hg in pelagic seawater observed in this study may be explained by atmospheric hg deposition however terrestrial hg forest litter organic soil and mineral soil tend to present negative δ202hg value tsui et al 2020b woerndle et al 2018 for instance organic soil located at the surface layer of soil generally exhibits a δ202hg value lower than 1 5 demers et al 2013 kwon et al 2020 smith et al 2008 studies conducted in freshwater environments have demonstrated that hg bound to organic matter represents a large fraction of hg in runoff jiskra et al 2017 watershed inputs can erode and transport terrestrial hg into estuarine area leading to relatively low δ202hg values in estuarine seawater furthermore seawater in pre s7 showed high concentration of thg 10 2 ng l 1 and the highest negative value of δ202hg 2 23 rapid economic development and population increases have aggravated human discharge of hg around the estuarine areas of the scs yang et al 2022 yu et al 2010 previous observations have demonstrated that industrial sources of hg often present δ202hg values between 1 and 0 balogh et al 2015 emslie et al 2015 which suggests that high hg concentration in pre s7 was unaffected by industrial hg pollution in contrast zhang et al 2020 reported that domestic wastewater has markedly negative δ202hg values 2 48 0 10 compared to other kinds of sewage and terrestrial water input in pre and which is consistent with δ202hg in pre s7 therefore the hg isotope results showed that in addition to watershed input domestic wastewater may also act as an important hg source in estuarine areas with rapid population growth we propose that different sources of hg can to a large extent cause the hg in the estuarine and pelagic zone to exhibit distinct δ202hg values δ202hg values of the mcs may be explained by the mixing of estuarine and pelagic hg 3 2 hg levels and c and n isotope properties in marine fish the thg concentrations in marine fish samples have been reported in our previous work yang et al 2022 and are presented in fig 2b although pelagic fish showed significantly lower tl compared to mcs and estuarine fish table s6 we found that fish collected from mcs exhibited the highest thg concentration 742 520 ng g 1 followed by those from the pelagic zone 451 378 ng g 1 and the lowest thg concentration was found in estuarine fish 143 127 ng g 1 fig 2b similarly large variations in mehg concentrations 11 3 2040 μg kg were found in all fish samples table s6 fish from the different compartments exhibited significantly different mehg contents p 0 05 with concentrations in mcs 131 1690 ng g 1 635 464 ng g 1 pelagic zone 31 5 2040 ng g 1 403 362 ng g 1 estuary 11 3 421 ng g 1 116 119 ng g 1 fig 2b the average mehg thg ratios of marine fish were 75 1 17 1 85 6 10 0 and 86 5 9 57 in the estuary mcs and pelagic zone respectively table s6 details of the thg and mehg concentrations and the mehg thg ratios in the marine fish samples are given in table s6 although high thg and mehg concentrations were found in estuarine seawater the hg concentration in fish from the estuarine region was relatively low fig 2b this low value may be explained by the increased demand for fish driven by rapid population growth in the pre region which has resulted in a series of ecological modification effects such as food chain length shortage and hg biomagnification suppression tsui et al 2022 the δ13ccorr and δ15n values for all fish samples are presented in fig s1 other details of the δ13ccorr δ15n and tl values for each marine fish sample are provided in table s6 δ13ccorr value in fish varied from 23 3 to 11 6 with significantly different values p 0 05 were observed in the fish of the three compartments i e pelagic zone from 18 7 to 11 6 15 3 1 30 mcs from 21 3 to 12 0 16 5 2 40 estuary from 23 3 to 15 6 19 5 2 07 fig s1a given the conservation of δ13c enrichment depletion 0 4 during trophic transfer δ13c measurement is a useful approach for identifying the dietary sources of aquatic species xu et al 2016 marine fish have been previously shown to possess higher δ13c values 21 3 to 14 4 than those of freshwater fish 29 4 to 24 5 asante et al 2008 2010 gu et al 2018 wang et al 2011 this could be explained by the different δ13c signals exhibited by the primary organic matter in marine 21 0 to 18 0 and terrestrial 27 0 to 25 0 ecosystems fry 1988 peterson and fry 1987 relatively negative δ13ccorr values in estuarine fish may indicate terrestrial dietary sources whereas significantly less negative δ13ccorr values in pelagic fish may suggest marine dietary sources δ13ccorr characteristics of the mcs are likely attributable to the mixing of estuarine and pelagic diets fig s1a δ15n values were reported in our previous studies yang et al 2022 δ15n values in fish of pelagic zone 7 01 9 55 8 47 0 562 were significantly lower p 0 01 than those in mcs 7 42 15 3 11 8 2 09 and in the estuary 9 10 16 6 12 8 1 57 whereas those of mcs and estuarine fish were comparable p 0 05 fig s1b both trophic transfer enrichment and the food web baseline values of δ15n can affect the δ15n ratios in marine fish perrot et al 2019 senn et al 2010 xu et al 2016 δ15n baseline in ecosystems can be represented by bulk δ15n in phytoplankton differences in δ15n values section 2 3 amongst estuarine mcs and pelagic phytoplankton suggested distinct n input amongst the three marine compartments the overall tl of the collected fish ranged from 1 87 to 4 28 and the values of tl in mcs tl 3 16 0 615 and estuary tl 3 17 0 469 fish were comparable p 0 05 and both were higher than those in pelagic fish tl 2 74 0 165 p 0 01 table s6 hg levels c and n isotopes showed distinct patterns in the marine fish collected from the three marine compartments δ13ccorr and δ15n in all samples showed a significantly negative linear regression fig s2 however no correlation was observed between δ13ccorr and δ15n at each site indicating that c and n isotopes could be used to differentiate amongst fish from diverse geographical regions in marine ecosystems furthermore although hg levels dietary sources and food web structures were different we found that tl and log mehg were positively correlated in all regions fig s3 suggesting that biomagnification plays an important role in determining mehg concentration in marine fish 3 3 hg isotope composition and underlying processes of mehg in marine fish the mean values of δ202hg δ199hg δ200hg and δ201hg measured in the fish of this study are shown in table 1 a comparison of δ202hg and δ199hg in the fish and seawater samples is shown in fig 4 a fish samples presented a wide range of δ202hg from 0 61 to 1 23 δ199hg from 0 14 to 2 35 and δ201hg from 0 06 to 1 87 whereas they showed a relatively narrow range of δ200hg from 0 07 to 0 18 table s5 δ202hg in fish of the estuary from 0 53 to 0 46 0 07 0 27 and mcs from 0 61 to 0 28 0 20 0 24 were comparable p 0 05 however significantly heavier p 0 01 δ202hg were found in pelagic fish from 0 01 to 1 23 0 53 0 32 table 1 table s5 the mean value of δ202hg in mcs and estuarine fish were both close to 0 which is similar to those of organisms collected in the pre area 0 14 0 20 n 18 and the east coast of china 0 07 0 50 n 27 yang et al 2021 yin et al 2016 however the δ202hg values in pelagic fish were proximate to that in the north pacific ocean npo 0 63 0 42 n 28 blum et al 2013 δ199hg values were similar for both pelagic 0 60 2 34 1 15 0 46 and mcs 0 45 2 35 1 10 0 54 fish p 0 05 which are significantly higher p 0 01 than that in estuarine fish 0 14 1 55 0 39 0 35 table 1 table s5 similarly the results of δ201hg closely corresponded with the δ199hg measurements which ranged from 0 06 to 1 35 0 41 0 30 0 26 to 1 87 0 83 0 46 and 0 55 to 1 83 0 94 0 37 for estuarine mcs and pelagic fish respectively table 1 table s5 finally δ200hg values showed comparable patterns p 0 05 in fish of mcs 0 07 0 16 0 05 0 06 and estuary 0 02 0 11 0 07 0 02 whereas fish of pelagic zone had significantly higher p 0 01 δ200hg values 0 02 0 18 0 10 0 04 compared with those in the estuary and mcs table 1 table s5 details of the hg isotope compositions of each fish sample are provided in table s5 odd mif occurs alongside with mehg photodegradation and hg ii photoreduction in aquatic ecosystems bergquist and blum 2007 given the absence of photochemical reactions during trophic transfer processes δ199hg and δ201hg values in organisms reflect the odd mif composition of mehg prior to its entering the food web tsui et al 2020a moreover the δ199hg δ201hg ratio is a diagnostic method to identify the two photochemical reaction types with an experimental value of 1 36 for mehg photodegradation and 1 0 for hg ii photoreduction blum et al 2014 δ199hg and δ201hg values in all fish samples were positively correlated with a slope of 1 18 0 01 york regression fig 4b which is consistent with previous work conducted in coastal areas e g pre area slope 1 26 and the east coast of china slope 1 22 yang et al 2021 yin et al 2016 this result suggested that the odd mif in fish of this work is produced by mehg photodegradation processes in contrast hg isotopes detected in seawater generally indicate the ihg behaviour because of the high percentage of ihg in seawater relatively higher δ202hg and δ199hg values in mehg compared with those in ihg were mainly attributed to the mehg photodegradation fig 4a in this study notably smaller δ199hg and δ201hg values were observed in the estuarine fish than those in the great lakes open ocean plateau lakes and most of coastal bays except the bohai bay conversely mcs and pelagic fish exhibited relatively higher odd mif which were only lower than those of the open ocean and great lakes fig s4 all fish considered in the present study had a habitat depth of 200 m which reduced the vertical hg isotope variation in the ocean blum et al 2013 therefore we propose that much less mehg photodegradation occurred in estuarine seawater than in the mcs and pelagic seawater the extent of mehg photodegradation is affected by light intensity and dissolved organic carbon doc levels bergquist and blum 2007 lepak et al 2018 earlier findings demonstrated that the doc concentration in the pre region and in the northern slope of scs were comparable approximately 1 33 mg l and 0 91 mg l respectively he et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 however the water turbidity of the pre seawater 4 5 ntu is significantly higher than that in the open ocean of the scs 1 ntu wang et al 2021 thus the low extent of mehg photodegradation in the estuarine region of the scs can be explained by the high turbidity of seawater which directly reduces the light intensity we quantified the percentage of mehg photodegradation based on δ199hg using a previously reported method bergquist and blum 2007 which was expected to help elucidate the differences in the potential photochemical processes of mehg in the estuary mcs and pelagic zones of the scs we estimated that 12 9 31 13 and 33 11 of mehg occurred photodegradation prior to entering the food web in the estuary mcs and pelagic zones of scs respectively except for external hg input relatively weak mehg photodegradation may act as another factor to explain high mehg concentration in seawater of the estuarine region 3 4 primary sources of mehg in marine fish it has been reported that most biogeochemical processes do not cause even mif except for the atmospheric photooxidation process which can lead to positive δ200hg in precipitation chen et al 2012 thus δ200hg can be used as a proxy to investigate mehg sources related to atmospheric deposition in the environment jiskra et al 2021 a comparison of δ200hg values of estuary mcs and pelagic fish from the scs this study bohai bay bhb meng et al 2020 npo blum et al 2013 the east pacific ocean madigan et al 2018 and the great lakes lepak et al 2018 is shown in fig 5 previous works have found that fish collected from open ocean generally show positive δ200hg he et al 2023 which is consistent with the data found in pelagic fish the pelagic region of the scs with a depth 1000 m is barely affected by any external hg sources such as watershed and sediment disturbances in addition the presence of coral reefs indicate that no frequent volcanic activity in the scs since the early pleistocene zhan et al 2006 which excludes geological hg input to the pelagic zone of the scs therefore the pelagic zone can be considered to have absorbed hg from the atmosphere atmospheric hg can enter marine ecosystems through wet and dry hg ii deposition as well as hg 0 dissolution blum et al 2013 kwon et al 2020 hg ii is associated with cloud droplets and is concentrated in precipitation causing rainfall samples to have a positive δ200hg recent models suggest that in ocean regions the combination of wet and dry hg ii deposition maintain the δ200hg values between 0 11 and 0 20 around the latitude of 15 n meanwhile hg 0 showed an average δ200hg value of 0 06 median interquartile range 0 08 to 0 02 demers et al 2015 fu et al 2018 jiskra et al 2021 significant differences in δ200hg values were observed between hg ii and hg 0 end members p 0 001 thus the isotopic mixing binary model explained in section 2 5 can quantify the atmospheric contribution of hg ii and hg 0 in fish in the pelagic zone the results showed that atmospheric hg ii contributes 74 11 1sd of mehg to pelagic fish recent studies proposed that hg methylation in seawater generally occurs in the water column at the oxygen minimum zone omz krabbenhoft and sunderland 2013 blum et al 2013 hg ii can be transported from the ocean surface to the omz by binding to sinking particles which are finally methylated to mehg lepak et al 2018 motta et al 2022 sun et al 2020 subsequently mehg migrates to the upper ocean through upwelling and is absorbed by various algae and bacteria which finally accumulate in marine fish blum et al 2013 considering the absence of even mif during hg methylation upwelling transportation and mehg biomagnification mehg formed in marine fish tends to retain the δ200hg characteristics of hg ii conversely hg 0 in seawater has not been found to be directly involved in the hg methylation processes blum et al 2013 as a result the water column exhibits high lability and susceptibility to the methylation of hg ii leading to increased bioaccumulation of mehg in marine fish from atmospheric hg ii sources in addition as the mcs region is far from mainland of china and is weakly affected by riverine input fig 1 we propose that sedimentary and atmospheric inputs are the two predominant sources of mehg accumulated in fish the atmospheric hg input is mainly related to precipitation which is linked to latitude chen et al 2012 jiskra et al 2021 thus the comparable latitudes of the mcs and pelagic zones of the scs should yield similar δ200hg values for local fish fig 1 because pelagic fish possessed significantly higher values of δ200hg than scs coastal sediment p 0 006 the significantly lower δ200hg values in mcs fish may be attributable to the contribution of sediment hg again using the hg isotope binary mixing model we estimated the contribution of sedimentary hg to mcs fish section 2 5 the two end members were atmospheric hg and sedimentary hg the δ200hg values for atmospheric hg were considered equal to those for pelagic fish mean 0 10 interquartile range 0 09 0 11 and the δ200hg values for sediment mean 0 01 interquartile range 0 00 0 02 were provided by yin et al 2015 the results showed that sediment contributed 62 19 of the bioaccumulated mehg in mcs fish which is an important observation for the development of marine hg food web models overall δ200hg values in marine fish can provide information on atmospheric hg deposition particularly for understanding the contribution of hg ii and hg 0 to mehg bioaccumulation however because of the small variation in δ200hg in the environment the δ200hg binary mixing model has limitations to some extent for instance distinguishing end member and calculating uncertainties need to be achieved carefully further studies are required to develop highly precise hg measurement methods to enhance the application of δ200hg finally mehg accumulated in estuarine fish may be obtained from riverine inputs anthropogenic emissions section 3 1 sediment release and atmospheric deposition which represent a complex ecosystem bosignore et al 2015 yin et al 2015 2016 riverine hg input can elevate δ200hg values in estuarine fish which is consistent with relatively higher δ200hg signatures determined in watershed rivers in the estuarine zones of scs in a previous work mean 0 08 interquartile range 0 04 0 09 zhang et al 2020 however in the application of the δ200hg mixing model separating several endmembers is difficult therefore we did not quantify the mehg sources in estuarine fish advanced approaches e g mehg specific isotope analysis need to be developed to quantify mehg sources in estuarine fish and to establish comprehensive profiles for hg biogeochemical cycling in the marine ecosystems 4 conclusion hg isotopes were used to identify the sources and processes of hg in food webs within three differing marine compartments e g estuary mcs and pelagic zone the estuarine seawater had significantly higher thg and mehg levels than the mcs and pelagic seawater compared with the pelagic zone estuarine seawater had a lower δ202hg value suggesting hg sources from watershed input and human sewage discharge the combination of cn isotopes can contributed to distinguishing the dietary sources and trophic levels of fish from the differing marine compartments δ202hg δ199hg and δ201hg revealed the underlying processes of mehg accumulation in fish collected from the estuary mcs and pelagic zone estuarine regions occurred notably low mehg degradation due to its high water turbidity in addition δ200hg value was used to quantify hg sources in marine fish distinct δ200hg values in pelagic and coastal fish provide an overall profile of atmospheric hg deposition and helped us to understand contribution of hg ii and hg 0 moreover the δ200hg values presented information on the sedimentary hg burden to mehg bioaccumulation our observations support the idea that the analysis of hg isotopes in seawater and fish provide comprehensive on the behaviour of hg in marine ecosystems however quantifying hg sources in estuarine fish remains challenging optimization of isotope mixing model parameters and mehg specific isotope analysis are

14691,current research focuses on efficient single stage nitrogen removal from organic matter wastewater using the partial nitritation anammox pna process in this study we constructed a single stage partial nitritation anammox and denitrification spnad system using a dissolved oxygen differentiated airlift internal circulation reactor the system was operated continuously for 364 days at 250 mg l nh4 n during the operation the cod nh4 n ratio c n was increased from 0 5 to 4 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 and the aeration rate ar gradually increased the results showed that the spnad system maintained efficient and stable operation at c n 1 2 and ar 1 4 1 6 l min with an average total nitrogen removal efficiency of 87 2 the removal pathways of pollutants in the system and the interactions between microbes were revealed by analyzing the changes in sludge characteristics and microbial community structure at different phases as the influent c n increased the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and candidatus brocadia decreased and that of denitrifying bacteria such as denitratisoma increased to 44 the nitrogen removal pathway of the system gradually changed from autotrophic nitrogen removal to nitrification denitrification at the optimum c n the spnad system synergistically removed nitrogen through pna and nitrification denitrification overall the unique reactor configuration facilitated the formation of dissolved oxygen compartments providing a suitable environment for different microbes an appropriate organic matter concentration maintained the dynamic stability of microbial growth

eutrophication of water bodies and the traditional nitrogen removal methods are not conducive to the sustainable development of resources and the environment qu et al 2019 the partial nitritation anammox pna process offers the advantages of resource conservation aeration reduction and low sludge production this process has recently received considerable attention and is considered a key technology for achieving energy and carbon reduction in wastewater plants rong et al 2022 in particular the single stage pna process combines partial nitritation and anammox in one space and has a smaller footprint and lower operating costs chen et al 2021b therefore the single stage pna process is gradually becoming the mainstream in research and applications however the pna process theoretically removes only 89 of the influent nh4 n and produces 11 of the no3 n resulting in an effluent that does not meet the increasingly stringent discharge standards zhou et al 2022 meanwhile the single stage pna process is sensitive to operating conditions and prone to destabilization and deterioration this makes enhancing the nitrogen removal performance of the single stage process and maintaining its stable operation a major focus of current research wang et al 2022a the single stage pna process is often used to treat high nh4 n wastewater such as industrial wastewater landfill leachates and sludge digester effluents chen et al 2021a the organic matter in real wastewater has a complex effect on the single stage pna process to the best of our knowledge higher concentrations of organic matter inhibit the pna process the total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre of the pna reactor employed by qian et al 2023 decreased from 81 8 to 13 6 after raising the c n from 0 25 to 1 however the low concentration of organic matter in the wastewater also promotes denitrification to remove no3 n produced by the pna process thereby improving the nitrogen removal performance chen et al 2023 miao et al 2018 increased the tnre of the pna reactor from 30 8 to 77 3 after increasing the c n of the influent within a certain range as such many researchers have chosen a single stage partial nitritation anammox and denitrification spnad process that combines multiple nitrogen removal pathways to reduce the cost of removing organic matter and enhance nitrogen removal performance sanjaya et al 2022 zhou et al 2018 to control the efficient nitrogen removal in the spnad process the influence of different work factors needs to be clarified of which organic matter stress is critical nowadays defining the optimum concentration of organic matter for the spnad process has become a major challenge for its application meanwhile the nitrogen removal mechanism in spnad systems under different influent organic matter concentrations requires further study the key to achieving stable operations of single stage pna systems is maintaining an efficient synergy between ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria anaob in spnad systems containing organic matter aerobic heterotrophic bacteria hb responsible for cod oxidation and denitrifying bacteria dnb complicate microbial interactions qian et al 2023 previous studies explored the interactions of functional microbes in a single stage pna system and investigated the effects of dissolved oxygen do and aeration rate ar on microbial interactions al hazmi et al 2021 and le et al 2023 enhanced the suppression of nob by optimizing the intermittent aeration strategy chen et al 2021c effectively controlled the microbial community structure at do of 0 05 0 15 mg l by regulating ar and successfully obtained 70 of tnre wang et al 2021 improved the performance of the pna process to over 80 by changing the reactor configuration to affect do distribution and enhance microbial synergy however for the spnad system complex interactions and regulation methods between microbes have not been fully explored therefore the effects of different working conditions and reactor configurations on the performance and microbes of the spnad system need to be further investigated in this study a spnad system based on a dissolved oxygen differentiated airlift internal circulation dodaic reactor was operated continuously for 364 days the effect of different cod nh4 n ratios c n on nitrogen and cod removal performance under a high nh4 n 250 mg l influent was investigated analyzing the changes in sludge characteristics and microbial community structures revealed the nh4 n and cod removal pathways and the interactions between microbes utilizing the innovative configuration of the dodaic reactor to enhance single stage nitrogen removal the effects of it on performance and microbial synergy were investigated and the operating conditions that enhance the performance of the spnad system were elucidated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and synthetic wastewater this study used a 2 4 l dodaic reactor to construct a spnad system schematic in supplementary material the dodaic consists of polyethylene with an internally set guide tube dividing the reactor into an inner and outer layer for the formation of do partitions wang et al 2021 an aeration pump was used to provide continuous aeration and airlift circulation and a flowmeter was set up to regulate the ar a water bath maintained the temperature of the reactor at 35 c the synthetic wastewater was continuously sent to the bottom of the reactor using a peristaltic pump nh4hco3 and c6h12o6 were nitrogen and carbon sources in the synthetic wastewater in addition nahco3 was used to maintain the ph of the influent at 7 8 8 2 the composition of synthetic wastewater also included 0 04 g l mgcl2 6h2o 0 04 g l kh2po4 0 036 g l cacl2 and 1 ml l trace element solution refer to the literature for the composition of the trace element solution yang et al 2022 seed sludge was obtained from a stable single stage pna system wang et al 2022c 2 2 operational conditions the spnad system was operated continuously for 364 days and the influent nh4 n concentration was maintained at 250 mg l the experiment was divided into six phases depending on the concentration of organic matter in the influent operating conditions in table 1 in phase i days 1 16 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor was 4 h organic matter was not added to the influent and the ar was 1 4 1 6 l min the cod concentrations in phases ii to vi were 125 250 500 750 and 1000 mg l respectively and c n increased from 0 5 to 4 during operation the hrt was stable at 6 h and the ar was adjusted according to performance 2 3 analytic methods and calculation nh4 n no2 n no3 n and cod in the influent and effluent were measured using standard methods apha 2005 the ph was measured using a ph meter and the temperature and do of the inner and outer layers of the reactor were measured using a portable do meter sludge samples were

correlation coefficients were calculated using spss software spss inc usa to investigate the relationships between the key phyla and genera 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations in overall performance variations in the long term performance of the spnad system are shown in fig 1 phase i was the initial stage after inoculation with the pna sludge the are and tnre of the system were 85 97 5 68 and 74 85 5 68 respectively the npr was maintained at approximately 11 close to the theoretical npr of the pna process chen et al 2019 indicating that a well performing and stable pna process developed in the reactor in phase ii the influent cod concentration was 125 mg l the hrt was increased to 6 h and the ar was reduced to 1 l min to prevent the system from collapsing after adding organic matter the effect of organic matter on the ammonia oxidation and anammox reactions resulted in a significant reduction in nitrogen removal performance in the early stages of this phase wang et al 2020b on day 65 the are and tnre levels were reduced to 40 56 and 38 71 respectively after 29 days of continuous operation the tnre of the system gradually recovered to 70 89 4 18 and further increased with increasing ar this result was probably due to the gradual domestication of aob and anaob in addition during this phase the cre of the system was maintained at 80 27 17 04 and the npr was reduced to approximately 9 this indicates that denitrification occurred when the influent c n was low however only a small amount of organic matter was used for denitrification and the depletion of cod probably came from the growth of hb the system was still dominated by autotrophic nitrogen removal on day 132 the c n of the influent water was increased to 1 and the experiment entered phase iii the nitrogen and organic matter removal improved and stabilized at high levels with tnre and cre of 87 21 4 23 and 94 78 3 17 respectively the no3 n in the effluent of this phase was reduced and the npr of the system was reduced to 3 32 1 14 in phase iv with c n 2 the spnad system maintained an efficient and stable operation for 36 days are 83 19 7 60 tnre 82 00 7 45 and cre 95 05 1 65 and the no3 n in the effluent was almost 0 mg l this excellent performance indicates that increasing cod concentrations within a certain range can lead to increased denitrification in the system thereby enhancing nitrogen removal performance moreover there was a significant difference in the do concentrations between the inner and outer layers of the dodaic reactor and the inner layer has a higher do concentration of 0 1 0 5 mg l than the outer layer this provides suitable conditions for different reactions and guarantees the stable operation of the system chen et al 2022 after increasing the influent cod concentration in phase v c n 3 the nitrogen removal performance gradually decreased the ar was gradually increased to 2 4 to improve the are but the performance could not be increased the are and tnre were only 65 96 13 40 and 65 19 12 82 respectively in addition the cre was consistently maintained above 90 despite its low nitrogen removal performance suggesting that excessive organic matter concentrations caused hb proliferation hb competes with aob and anaob for ecological niches and substrates inhibiting ammonia oxidation and anammox reactions yang et al 2022 therefore denitrification gradually dominated at this stage the ar in phase vi c n 4 remained at 1 6 2 4 l min the cre was 93 48 4 29 the npr was always 0 the tnre decreased to approximately 30 and the spnad system almost deteriorated the reason for these results may be that the main nitrogen removal pathway in this phase of the system changed to a nitrification denitrification process however denitrification was inhibited by high ar and do and the nitrogen removal performance could not be improved at this time most of the cod was removed by hb oxidation guo et al 2020 overall c n and ar are key factors affecting the nitrogen removal effectiveness of spnad systems this variation probably affected the growth of microbes and the nitrogen removal pathway of the system therefore to clarify ways to enhance the performance of single stage nitrogen removal systems the pattern of c n and ar effects on the system must be further explored 3 2 effects of organic matter concentration and aeration rate this study compared the effects of different c n ratios and ar on the performance of the spnad system as shown in fig 2 at the stage of c n 0 5 1 the ar was increased from 1 0 to 1 4 l min and the nitrogen removal performance and cod removal performance of the reactor increased and became stable however some of the nh4 n was still converted to no3 n and remained in the effluent when the influent c n was increased to 2 and the ar was raised from 1 4 to 1 6 l min the tnre and nrr of the system remained high and the system maintained a stable operation over a long period the tnre and are at this stage were almost identical and the cre was stable at approximately 95 as c n and ar continued to increase the high organic matter concentrations and ar caused a significant reduction in nitrogen removal performance and the spnad system gradually deteriorated the initial enhancement analyzed through performance changes was due to adding organic matter which promoted denitrification within the system in addition the increased ar provided more substrate for anammox and denitrification when c n and ar were increased all no3 n produced by anammox was removed by denitrification sufficient ar was available to oxidize nh4 n to no3 n thereby providing a substrate for denitrification the main nitrogen removal pathway in the reactor was simultaneous pna and denitrification in contrast an excessively high c n can cause the ammonia oxidation and anammox reactions to losing out during the competition an excessive ar can also inhibit denitrification leading to the collapse of the spnad system molinuevo et al 2009 in summary elevated c n probably promoted the growth of hb and intensified denitrification thereby altering the nitrogen removal pathway of the spnad system and affecting the nitrogen removal performance changes in ar affected the production of reaction substrates and the growth environment of microbes further affecting the stability of the system therefore the c n and ar of the spnad system need to be maintained within the optimum range to achieve synergy between pna and denitrification and further efficient and stable removal performance as shown in fig 3 the optimum c n for the spnad system in this study was 1 2 the reactor had the best performance at c n 1 denitrification was enhanced when c n 2 and the reactor could best maintain long term efficient and stable operation the optimum ar was 1 4 1 6 l min which provided the sufficient substrate for anammox and denitrification while avoiding the inhibition of the nitrogen removal process due to excessive ar it is also evident from the figure that the change in c n had a greater impact on tnre than ar probably owing to the significant influence of the organic matter concentration on denitrification and anammox meanwhile the dodaic reactor used in this study also created do partitioning which maintained the do in the outer layer of the reactor at a low level weakening the effect of increased ar on anaerobic microbes wang et al 2021 therefore controlling the c n to influence the nitrogen removal pathway is key to achieving efficient single stage nitrogen removal in this system the mechanism of nitrogen removal at different c n ratios was further clarified by analyzing the sludge characteristics and microorganisms 3 3 characterizations and specific activity of sludge 3 3 1 sludge concentration and settleability the variations in sludge concentrations and settleability in the spnad system are shown in fig 4 a throughout the experiment the mlss and mlvss in the reactor increased then decreased and then increased from day 16 to 128 the sludge concentration in the reactor increased significantly mlss from 4971 420 mg l to 8700 453 mg l and mlvss from 3544 201 mg l to 6825 247 mg l indicating that adding organic matter to the system provided a substrate for hb proliferation in addition because denitrification was weak at this stage most of the cod was used for the growth of hb leading to a rapid increase in biomass the increase in hb also led to a change in the ecological niches of aob and anaob zhang and okabe 2020 with the pna granular sludge disintegrating into the suspended sludge as a result the sludge became difficult to settle and the sv increased from 37 8 to 98 from day 128 to 179 mlss and mlvss increased again in addition denitrification increased at this stage with less cod available for hb growth resulting in a slower increase rate of the sludge concentration on day 285 mlss and mlvss were reduced to 2838 78 mg l and 2058 125 mg l respectively the main reason for the reduced biomass was the large flushing of poorly settled suspended sludge due to the increased ar in phase v and the inactivation of aob and anaob caused by increased organic matter miao et al 2018 mlss and mlvss increased again on day 364 when aerobic hb proliferated overall appropriate organic matter concentrations promoted the proliferation of dnb in the system thus enhancing its tnre and cre while excessive ar and cod flushed and inactivated the microbes in the reactor deteriorating reactor performance 3 3 2 extracellular polymeric substances and specific activity the concentration and distribution characteristics of the proteins and polysaccharides in the eps were measured to determine the status of the sludge and microbes in the system wang et al 2020a the eps measurements in this study are shown in fig 4b and 4c from day 16 to 179 the level of eps decreased substantially with the pn ps value decreasing from 15 1 to 3 6 as shown in the figure the change in eps was mainly caused by a decrease in the protein concentration in the tightly bound eps tb eps the protein in tb eps plays an important role in sludge granulation it can be determined that the increased concentration of organic matter in the influent at this stage promoted the proliferation of hb resulting in the inhibition of anaob growth and gradual disintegration of the pna granular sludge from day 179 to 364 eps levels increased again probably due to the gradual formation of heterotrophic granular sludge in the system the increase in c n and ar made it necessary for hb to secrete more pn and ps to defend itself against changes in the external environment shi et al 2017 the variation in the specific activity of functional microbes is shown in fig 4d at the phase of c n 0 saoa and sana were 1 29 and 0 93 g n g vss day respectively and snoa and sdna were very low this result indicates that this stage was dominated by autotrophic nitrogen removal whereas nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and dnb were effectively suppressed as the c n of the system gradually increased to 2 saoa and sana decreased to 0 27 and 0 26 g n g vss day respectively and snoa and sdna increased to 0 22 and 0 06 g n g vss day respectively the change in activity at this stage confirmed that the addition of organic matter promoted competition between hb and autotrophic nitrogen removing microbes leading to a decrease in saoa and sana although the specific activity of functional microorganisms was low at this stage the high biomass allowed the nitrogen removal performance of the process to be maintained at a high level wang et al 2022c in addition the increase in snoa and sdna also indicated the addition of a nitrification denitrification pathway within the system the sana at this stage was significantly higher than the sdna indicating that anammox still dominated nitrogen removal within the reactor gradually changed to synergistic nitrogen removal by pna and denitrification improving nitrogen removal performance and stability from day 179 to 364 as c n and ar continued to rise snoa and sdna increased substantially and saoa and sana decreased to 0 20 and 0 07 g n g vss day respectively this result indicates that the system changed to a nitrification denitrification based approach to perform nitrogen removal according to the analysis of the sludge characteristics and specific activity the nitrogen removal pathway constantly changed as c n increased optimal c n and ar ensured that biomass was at its highest level and maintained a balance of functional microbial activity at this time various microbes functioned together in the system using pna and denitrification for synergistic nitrogen removal the do partitioning of the dodaic reactor promoted the co existence of various reactions providing a suitable environment for microbes and enhancing the synergy between microbes for nitrogen removal these factors maintained the efficient and stable nitrogen removal performance of the spnad system 3 4 microbial diversity and community structure 3 4 1 alpha diversity analysis table 2 shows the number of operational taxonomic units otus and the shannon ace chao1 and coverage indices of the microbial samples in different phases as shown in the table the coverage index for all microbial samples was greater than 99 8 indicating that the samples were representative of the true microbial profile of the system the species richness and diversity decreased when organic matter was added to the system c n increased from day 128 to 179 but species richness and diversity changes were not significant from day 179 to 285 excessive cod concentrations and sludge loss resulted in a continued reduction in microbial diversity the deterioration of the system led to a complex microbial structure by day 364 kang et al 2019 the results showed that organic matter strongly influenced species richness and diversity in the spnad system however during the c n 1 2 phase organic matter and its elevated concentrations favored the growth and synergy of microbes in the spnad system maintaining microbial diversity and stable system performance 3 4 2 variation in microbial community structure the changes in the relative abundance of microbes at the phylum level are shown in fig 5 a indicating that the microbial phylum in the spnad system was dominated by chloroflexi bacteroidetes proteobacteria and planctomycetota chloroflexi mainly serves as a skeleton in the aggregation of microbes and bacteroidetes can be involved in the breakdown of organic matter and pn cho et al 2010 planctomycetes contained almost all the anaob from day 16 to 179 the relative abundance of planctomycetota decreased from 4 8 to 0 8 indicating that adding organic matter inhibited anaob as with the specific activity results although the relative abundance of planctomycetota was low the high biomass and specific activity at this time did not affect the autotrophic nitrogen removal performance in the system zhou et al 2022 the composition of proteobacteria including aob dnb and aerobic hb was more complex the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased from 29 0 to 57 5 after adding organic matter probably owing to the rapid multiplication of dnb and aerobic hb the specific reason for this needs to be analyzed by the change in relative abundance at the genus level fig 5b illustrates the changes in the relative abundance of microbes at the major genus level following the addition of organic matter the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia dominant anaob genus decreased from 4 7 to 1 2 however its relative abundance remained stable from day 128 to 179 suggesting that when anaob adapts to an environment containing organic matter organic matter does not reinforce the competition between hb and anaob and instead promotes the mutualistic interaction of various microbes thereby enhancing performance by day 285 the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia was approximately 0 as previously mentioned there was little anammox in the reactor at this stage and the nitrogen removal process of the system was converted to nitrification denitrification the relative abundance of nitrosomonas the main aob varied in much the same way as candidatus brocadia the reduction in the abundance of nitrosomonas to low levels was also the main reason for limiting nitrification denitrification in phase vi denitratisoma shinella hyphomicrobium and comamonadaceae are classified as dnb in proteobacteria zheng et al 2022 while olb13 is a genus of dnb in chloroflexi zhang et al 2021 from day 16 to 128 the sum of the relative abundance of these dnb increased from 12 to 35 and then to 44 on day 179 on day 285 its abundance decreased to 14 again suggesting that the operating conditions at c n 1 2 were more favorable for the growth of dnb in the spnad system the variation in dnb abundance also shows that although the sdna of the sludge was higher on day 128 than on day 179 there was more biomass in the system on day 179 and the relative abundance of dnb was higher this results in stronger denitrification at c n 2 rhizobiaceae is an aerobic hb belonging to the phylum proteobacteria chen et al 2016 on day 128 the relative abundance of rhizobiaceae increased to 15 4 as phase ii of denitrification was weak and most of the organic matter was used to provide a carbon source for the growth of dnb and aerobic hb from phase iii to phase iv most of the organic matter became the substrate for denitrification the substrate available to rhizobiaceae decreased and its abundance decreased to 5 1 by contrast the influent c n and ar increased after day 179 and rhizobiaceae 53 9 multiplied rapidly and became the dominant microbes in the system the increase in rhizobiaceae also competed for the ecological niches and substrates of nitrogen removal microbes leading to a deterioration in nitrogen removal performance in addition pearson s correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationships between the main microbial phyla and genera fig 5c and 5d as shown in the figure planctomycetota and proteobacteria were negatively correlated r 0 98 p 0 05 suggesting a competitive relationship wang et al 2022b by contrast nitrosomonas was highly positively correlated with candidatus brocadia r 0 99 p 0 05 this result also demonstrated that hb in proteobacteria competed with aob and anaob for substrates and ecological niches thereby affecting the performance of the spnad system therefore it is necessary to achieve multiple pathways of synergistic nitrogen removal in the spnad system and maintain a dynamic balance between microbial growth and interaction the effects of c n ar and do on the relative abundance and interactions of microbes are also summarized refer to supplementary material the results indicate that elevated organic matter concentrations caused dramatic changes in the microbial community structure of the system which affected the nitrogen removal pathways the nitrogen removal pathway changed from autotrophic nitrogen removal based on aob and anaob to nitrification denitrification based on hb during c n 1 2 the spnad system utilized aob dnb and anaob for synergistic nitrogen removal further enhancing nitrogen removal performance the proliferation of aerobic hb and dnb also guaranteed the cod removal performance of the system the relative abundance and interactions of the microbes in the system could be maintained at an optimum level an appropriate ar maintained the stability of the system the do partitioning formed within the dodaic reactor also promoted the co existence of various microbes and enhanced their synergy al hazmi et al 2021 3 5 process mechanism of nitrogen removal this study analyzed the process mechanism of the spnad system in treating wastewater with different c n ratios fig 6 in phase i the system was free of organic matter aob and anaob form granular sludge in the reactor for autotrophic nitrogen removal using the pna process with the addition of organic matter c n 0 5 dnb and aerobic hb proliferated and the biomass in the reactor increased substantially because the concentration of organic matter provided at this time was low only a small amount of organic matter was available as a substrate for denitrification environmental impacts on aob and anaob and competition from hb collectively reduced the nitrogen removal performance of the system with pna granular sludge cleaving into suspended sludge adams et al 2022 however aob and anaob gradually domesticated as the experiment progressed and adapted to an environment containing organic matter when the influent c n was 1 2 sufficient organic matter caused denitrification in the system to increase gradually and all no3 n produced in the pna process was removed by denitrification the nitrogen removal pathway of the system changed to synergistic pna and nitrification denitrification a suitable ar for this phase not only provided the sufficient substrate for the pna process but also the oxidation of nh4 n to no3 n providing substrate for denitrification meanwhile the limited organic matter at this stage fails to allow dnb to have high specific activity and also restricts the growth of aerobic hb this results in limited competition from hb and the relative abundance and specific activity of aob and anaob can remain stable thus achieving the balance of nitrogen removal pathways in the spnad system al hazmi et al 2022 li et al 2020 in phases v and vi the continued increase in organic matter concentrations led to a renewed proliferation of aerobic hb competing for aob substrates and anaob ecological niches resulting in a complete change in the nitrogen removal pathway of the system to nitrification denitrification in addition the ar was too large at this time denitrification was inhibited and the nitrogen removal performance could not be improved overall increasing organic matter concentration changed the microbial community structure and nitrogen removal pathways within the spnad system and the level of ar affected the reaction rate and system stability of these organic matter concentration was the most critical factor in determining efficient single stage nitrogen removal this study found optimal operating conditions c n 1 2 and ar 1 4 1 6 l min for the spnad system and defined the pathways for removing pollutants from the system during this period the spnad system used both pna and nitrification denitrification processes for nitrogen removal and achieved cod removal via denitrification and oxidation by hb the appropriate amount of organic matter was more conducive to nitrogen removal performance resulting in a favorable synergy between aob anaob nob and dnb in the reactor achieving a dynamic stabilization of microbial growth and interactions in addition the do partitioning formed within the dodaic reactor provided a suitable environment for different functional microbes enhancing the synergy of the functional microbes and further enhancing system performance chen et al 2022 the performance of this system was compared with that of similar systems table 3 the airlift reactor employed by guo et al 2020 showed an nre and cre of 80 9 and 94 6 respectively at c n 0 8 which is lower than the performance of the dodaic reactor under similar conditions and the performance of this reactor started to deteriorate at c n of 1 6 it was a sequential batch reactor at c n 1 1 5 with an nre of approximately 86 0 but a cre below 77 0 well below the cre of this study ding et al 2018 wang et al 2022d treated synthetic wastewater with c n 0 43 with a peak nre capable of reaching 95 1 but could not maintain long term stable operation the performance and stability of the dodaic reactor were higher than that in previous studies at influent c n 1 2 this study clarified the effect of different c n on the performance nitrogen removal pathways and microbial interactions of the spnad system meanwhile the advantages of the dodaic reactor were exploited to enhance single stage nitrogen removal faced with actual municipal wastewater the spnad system combining multiple nitrogen removal pathways probably results in more economical treatment and more efficient and stable performance the intensification of the do gradient formed in the dodaic reactor on the growth and synergy of different functional microbes also provides a valuable solution for the treatment of municipal wastewater until then it is necessary to explore the feasibility of the system for treating low temperature and low nh4 n wastewater 4 conclusions a spnad system based on a dodaic reactor was operated continuously for 364 days with 250 mg l influent nh4 n during the operation c n increased from 0 5 to 4 and the ar gradually increased the nitrogen removal pathway of the system changed from autotrophic nitrogen removal to nitrification denitrification the results showed that the spnad system had the best performance at c n 1 2 and ar 1 4 1 6 l min the tnre and cre of the reactor increased to 87 21 4 23 and 94 78 3 17 respectively and were maintained for 36 days for efficient and stable operation at this time the relative abundance of dnb such as denitratisoma increased to 44 the nitrogen removal pathway of the system was pna and nitrification denitrification synergy and denitrification and hb oxidation were used to achieve efficient cod removal the continued elevation of c n resulted in a proliferation of rhizobiaceae competing for ecological niches and substrates of nitrogen removal microbes causing deterioration in performance this study utilized the do partitioning of the dodaic reactor and appropriate organic matter concentration to achieve efficient synergy of functional microbes maintaining the dynamic balance of

14691,current research focuses on efficient single stage nitrogen removal from organic matter wastewater using the partial nitritation anammox pna process in this study we constructed a single stage partial nitritation anammox and denitrification spnad system using a dissolved oxygen differentiated airlift internal circulation reactor the system was operated continuously for 364 days at 250 mg l nh4 n during the operation the cod nh4 n ratio c n was increased from 0 5 to 4 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 and the aeration rate ar gradually increased the results showed that the spnad system maintained efficient and stable operation at c n 1 2 and ar 1 4 1 6 l min with an average total nitrogen removal efficiency of 87 2 the removal pathways of pollutants in the system and the interactions between microbes were revealed by analyzing the changes in sludge characteristics and microbial community structure at different phases as the influent c n increased the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and candidatus brocadia decreased and that of denitrifying bacteria such as denitratisoma increased to 44 the nitrogen removal pathway of the system gradually changed from autotrophic nitrogen removal to nitrification denitrification at the optimum c n the spnad system synergistically removed nitrogen through pna and nitrification denitrification overall the unique reactor configuration facilitated the formation of dissolved oxygen compartments providing a suitable environment for different microbes an appropriate organic matter concentration maintained the dynamic stability of microbial growth

eutrophication of water bodies and the traditional nitrogen removal methods are not conducive to the sustainable development of resources and the environment qu et al 2019 the partial nitritation anammox pna process offers the advantages of resource conservation aeration reduction and low sludge production this process has recently received considerable attention and is considered a key technology for achieving energy and carbon reduction in wastewater plants rong et al 2022 in particular the single stage pna process combines partial nitritation and anammox in one space and has a smaller footprint and lower operating costs chen et al 2021b therefore the single stage pna process is gradually becoming the mainstream in research and applications however the pna process theoretically removes only 89 of the influent nh4 n and produces 11 of the no3 n resulting in an effluent that does not meet the increasingly stringent discharge standards zhou et al 2022 meanwhile the single stage pna process is sensitive to operating conditions and prone to destabilization and deterioration this makes enhancing the nitrogen removal performance of the single stage process and maintaining its stable operation a major focus of current research wang et al 2022a the single stage pna process is often used to treat high nh4 n wastewater such as industrial wastewater landfill leachates and sludge digester effluents chen et al 2021a the organic matter in real wastewater has a complex effect on the single stage pna process to the best of our knowledge higher concentrations of organic matter inhibit the pna process the total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre of the pna reactor employed by qian et al 2023 decreased from 81 8 to 13 6 after raising the c n from 0 25 to 1 however the low concentration of organic matter in the wastewater also promotes denitrification to remove no3 n produced by the pna process thereby improving the nitrogen removal performance chen et al 2023 miao et al 2018 increased the tnre of the pna reactor from 30 8 to 77 3 after increasing the c n of the influent within a certain range as such many researchers have chosen a single stage partial nitritation anammox and denitrification spnad process that combines multiple nitrogen removal pathways to reduce the cost of removing organic matter and enhance nitrogen removal performance sanjaya et al 2022 zhou et al 2018 to control the efficient nitrogen removal in the spnad process the influence of different work factors needs to be clarified of which organic matter stress is critical nowadays defining the optimum concentration of organic matter for the spnad process has become a major challenge for its application meanwhile the nitrogen removal mechanism in spnad systems under different influent organic matter concentrations requires further study the key to achieving stable operations of single stage pna systems is maintaining an efficient synergy between ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria anaob in spnad systems containing organic matter aerobic heterotrophic bacteria hb responsible for cod oxidation and denitrifying bacteria dnb complicate microbial interactions qian et al 2023 previous studies explored the interactions of functional microbes in a single stage pna system and investigated the effects of dissolved oxygen do and aeration rate ar on microbial interactions al hazmi et al 2021 and le et al 2023 enhanced the suppression of nob by optimizing the intermittent aeration strategy chen et al 2021c effectively controlled the microbial community structure at do of 0 05 0 15 mg l by regulating ar and successfully obtained 70 of tnre wang et al 2021 improved the performance of the pna process to over 80 by changing the reactor configuration to affect do distribution and enhance microbial synergy however for the spnad system complex interactions and regulation methods between microbes have not been fully explored therefore the effects of different working conditions and reactor configurations on the performance and microbes of the spnad system need to be further investigated in this study a spnad system based on a dissolved oxygen differentiated airlift internal circulation dodaic reactor was operated continuously for 364 days the effect of different cod nh4 n ratios c n on nitrogen and cod removal performance under a high nh4 n 250 mg l influent was investigated analyzing the changes in sludge characteristics and microbial community structures revealed the nh4 n and cod removal pathways and the interactions between microbes utilizing the innovative configuration of the dodaic reactor to enhance single stage nitrogen removal the effects of it on performance and microbial synergy were investigated and the operating conditions that enhance the performance of the spnad system were elucidated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and synthetic wastewater this study used a 2 4 l dodaic reactor to construct a spnad system schematic in supplementary material the dodaic consists of polyethylene with an internally set guide tube dividing the reactor into an inner and outer layer for the formation of do partitions wang et al 2021 an aeration pump was used to provide continuous aeration and airlift circulation and a flowmeter was set up to regulate the ar a water bath maintained the temperature of the reactor at 35 c the synthetic wastewater was continuously sent to the bottom of the reactor using a peristaltic pump nh4hco3 and c6h12o6 were nitrogen and carbon sources in the synthetic wastewater in addition nahco3 was used to maintain the ph of the influent at 7 8 8 2 the composition of synthetic wastewater also included 0 04 g l mgcl2 6h2o 0 04 g l kh2po4 0 036 g l cacl2 and 1 ml l trace element solution refer to the literature for the composition of the trace element solution yang et al 2022 seed sludge was obtained from a stable single stage pna system wang et al 2022c 2 2 operational conditions the spnad system was operated continuously for 364 days and the influent nh4 n concentration was maintained at 250 mg l the experiment was divided into six phases depending on the concentration of organic matter in the influent operating conditions in table 1 in phase i days 1 16 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor was 4 h organic matter was not added to the influent and the ar was 1 4 1 6 l min the cod concentrations in phases ii to vi were 125 250 500 750 and 1000 mg l respectively and c n increased from 0 5 to 4 during operation the hrt was stable at 6 h and the ar was adjusted according to performance 2 3 analytic methods and calculation nh4 n no2 n no3 n and cod in the influent and effluent were measured using standard methods apha 2005 the ph was measured using a ph meter and the temperature and do of the inner and outer layers of the reactor were measured using a portable do meter sludge samples were collected on days 16 128 179 285 and 364 to determine the mlss mlvss and sv extracellular polymeric substances eps of the sludge samples were extracted and analyzed for polysaccharide ps and protein pn concentrations li and yang 2007 specific activity tests were conducted using sludge samples and the specific activities of aob saoa anaob sana nitrite oxidizing bacteria snoa and db sdna were measured according to the literature chen et al 2021c the ammonium removal efficiency are tnre cod removal efficiency cre nitrate production ratio npr and nitrogen removal rate nrr kg n m3 day were calculated li et al 2019 2 4 microbial analysis sludge samples collected on days 16 128 179 285 and 364 were subjected to high throughput sequencing dna was extracted and concentrations were determined as described in the literature liu et al 2022 yang et al 2022 the universal bacterial primers 338f and 806r were selected to amplify the v3 to v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene pearson s rank correlation coefficients were calculated using spss software spss inc usa to investigate the relationships between the key phyla and genera 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations in overall performance variations in the long term performance of the spnad system are shown in fig 1 phase i was the initial stage after inoculation with the pna sludge the are and tnre of the system were 85 97 5 68 and 74 85 5 68 respectively the npr was maintained at approximately 11 close to the theoretical npr of the pna process chen et al 2019 indicating that a well performing and stable pna process developed in the reactor in phase ii the influent cod concentration was 125 mg l the hrt was increased to 6 h and the ar was reduced to 1 l min to prevent the system from collapsing after adding organic matter the effect of organic matter on the ammonia oxidation and anammox reactions resulted in a significant reduction in nitrogen removal performance in the early stages of this phase wang et al 2020b on day 65 the are and tnre levels were reduced to 40 56 and 38 71 respectively after 29 days of continuous operation the tnre of the system gradually recovered to 70 89 4 18 and further increased with increasing ar this result was probably due to the gradual domestication of aob and anaob in addition during this phase the cre of the system was maintained at 80 27 17 04 and the npr was reduced to approximately 9 this indicates that denitrification occurred when the influent c n was low however only a small amount of organic matter was used for denitrification and the depletion of cod probably came from the growth of hb the system was still dominated by autotrophic nitrogen removal on day 132 the c n of the influent water was increased to 1 and the experiment entered phase iii the nitrogen and organic matter removal improved and stabilized at high levels with tnre and cre of 87 21 4 23 and 94 78 3 17 respectively the no3 n in the effluent of this phase was reduced and the npr of the system was reduced to 3 32 1 14 in phase iv with c n 2 the spnad system maintained an efficient and stable operation for 36 days are 83 19 7 60 tnre 82 00 7 45 and cre 95 05 1 65 and the no3 n in the effluent was almost 0 mg l this excellent performance indicates that increasing cod concentrations within a certain range can lead to increased denitrification in the system thereby enhancing nitrogen removal performance moreover there was a significant difference in the do concentrations between the inner and outer layers of the dodaic reactor and the inner layer has a higher do concentration of 0 1 0 5 mg l than the outer layer this provides suitable conditions for different reactions and guarantees the stable operation of the system chen et al 2022 after increasing the influent cod concentration in phase v c n 3 the nitrogen removal performance gradually decreased the ar was gradually increased to 2 4 to improve the are but the performance could not be increased the are and tnre were only 65 96 13 40 and 65 19 12 82 respectively in addition the cre was consistently maintained above 90 despite its low nitrogen removal performance suggesting that excessive organic matter concentrations caused hb proliferation hb competes with aob and anaob for ecological niches and substrates inhibiting ammonia oxidation and anammox reactions yang et al 2022 therefore denitrification gradually dominated at this stage the ar in phase vi c n 4 remained at 1 6 2 4 l min the cre was 93 48 4 29 the npr was always 0 the tnre decreased to approximately 30 and the spnad system almost deteriorated the reason for these results may be that the main nitrogen removal pathway in this phase of the system changed to a nitrification denitrification process however denitrification was inhibited by high ar and do and the nitrogen removal performance could not be improved at this time most of the cod was removed by hb oxidation guo et al 2020 overall c n and ar are key factors affecting the nitrogen removal effectiveness of spnad systems this variation probably affected the growth of microbes and the nitrogen removal pathway of the system therefore to clarify ways to enhance the performance of single stage nitrogen removal systems the pattern of c n and ar effects on the system must be further explored 3 2 effects of organic matter concentration and aeration rate this study compared the effects of different c n ratios and ar on the performance of the spnad system as shown in fig 2 at the stage of c n 0 5 1 the ar was increased from 1 0 to 1 4 l min and the nitrogen removal performance and cod removal performance of the reactor increased and became stable however some of the nh4 n was still converted to no3 n and remained in the effluent when the influent c n was increased to 2 and the ar was raised from 1 4 to 1 6 l min the tnre and nrr of the system remained high and the system maintained a stable operation over a long period the tnre and are at this stage were almost identical and the cre was stable at approximately 95 as c n and ar continued to increase the high organic matter concentrations and ar caused a significant reduction in nitrogen removal performance and the spnad system gradually deteriorated the initial enhancement analyzed through performance changes was due to adding organic matter which promoted denitrification within the system in addition the increased ar provided more substrate for anammox and denitrification when c n and ar were increased all no3 n produced by anammox was removed by denitrification sufficient ar was available to oxidize nh4 n to no3 n thereby providing a substrate for denitrification the main nitrogen removal pathway in the reactor was simultaneous pna and denitrification in contrast an excessively high c n can cause the ammonia oxidation and anammox reactions to losing out during the competition an excessive ar can also inhibit denitrification leading to the collapse of the spnad system molinuevo et al 2009 in summary elevated c n probably promoted the growth of hb and intensified denitrification thereby altering the nitrogen removal pathway of the spnad system and affecting the nitrogen removal performance changes in ar affected the production of reaction substrates and the growth environment of microbes further affecting the stability of the system therefore the c n and ar of the spnad system need to be maintained within the optimum range to achieve synergy between pna and denitrification and further efficient and stable removal performance as shown in fig 3 the optimum c n for the spnad system in this study was 1 2 the reactor had the best performance at c n 1 denitrification was enhanced when c n 2 and the reactor could best maintain long term efficient and stable operation the optimum ar was 1 4 1 6 l min which provided the sufficient substrate for anammox and denitrification while avoiding the inhibition of the nitrogen removal process due to excessive ar it is also evident from the figure that the change in c n had a greater impact on tnre than ar probably owing to the significant influence of the organic matter concentration on denitrification and anammox meanwhile the dodaic reactor used in this study also created do partitioning which maintained the do in the outer layer of the reactor at a low level weakening the effect of increased ar on anaerobic microbes wang et al 2021 therefore controlling the c n to influence the nitrogen removal pathway is key to achieving efficient single stage nitrogen removal in this system the mechanism of nitrogen removal at different c n ratios was further clarified by analyzing the sludge characteristics and microorganisms 3 3 characterizations and specific activity of sludge 3 3 1 sludge concentration and settleability the variations in sludge concentrations and settleability in the spnad system are shown in fig 4 a throughout the experiment the mlss and mlvss in the reactor increased then decreased and then increased from day 16 to 128 the sludge concentration in the reactor increased significantly mlss from 4971 420 mg l to 8700 453 mg l and mlvss from 3544 201 mg l to 6825 247 mg l indicating that adding organic matter to the system provided a substrate for hb proliferation in addition because denitrification was weak at this stage most of the cod was used for the growth of hb leading to a rapid increase in biomass the increase in hb also led to a change in the ecological niches of aob and anaob zhang and okabe 2020 with the pna granular sludge disintegrating into the suspended sludge as a result the sludge became difficult to settle and the sv increased from 37 8 to 98 from day 128 to 179 mlss and mlvss increased again in addition denitrification increased at this stage with less cod available for hb growth resulting in a slower increase rate of the sludge concentration on day 285 mlss and mlvss were reduced to 2838 78 mg l and 2058 125 mg l respectively the main reason for the reduced biomass was the large flushing of poorly settled suspended sludge due to the increased ar in phase v and the inactivation of aob and anaob caused by increased organic matter miao et al 2018 mlss and mlvss increased again on day 364 when aerobic hb proliferated overall appropriate organic matter concentrations promoted the proliferation of dnb in the system thus enhancing its tnre and cre while excessive ar and cod flushed and inactivated the microbes in the reactor deteriorating reactor performance 3 3 2 extracellular polymeric substances and specific activity the concentration and distribution characteristics of the proteins and polysaccharides in the eps were measured to determine the status of the sludge and microbes in the system wang et al 2020a the eps measurements in this study are shown in fig 4b and 4c from day 16 to 179 the level of eps decreased substantially with the pn ps value decreasing from 15 1 to 3 6 as shown in the figure the change in eps was mainly caused by a decrease in the protein concentration in the tightly bound eps tb eps the protein in tb eps plays an important role in sludge granulation it can be determined that the increased concentration of organic matter in the influent at this stage promoted the proliferation of hb resulting in the inhibition of anaob growth and gradual disintegration of the pna granular sludge from day 179 to 364 eps levels increased again probably due to the gradual formation of heterotrophic granular sludge in the system the increase in c n and ar made it necessary for hb to secrete more pn and ps to defend itself against changes in the external environment shi et al 2017 the variation in the specific activity of functional microbes is shown in fig 4d at the phase of c n 0 saoa and sana were 1 29 and 0 93 g n g vss day respectively and snoa and sdna were very low this result indicates that this stage was dominated by autotrophic nitrogen removal whereas nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and dnb were effectively suppressed as the c n of the system gradually increased to 2 saoa and sana decreased to 0 27 and 0 26 g n g vss day respectively and snoa and sdna increased to 0 22 and 0 06 g n g vss day respectively the change in activity at this stage confirmed that the addition of organic matter promoted competition between hb and autotrophic nitrogen removing microbes leading to a decrease in saoa and sana although the specific activity of functional microorganisms was low at this stage the high biomass allowed the nitrogen removal performance of the process to be maintained at a high level wang et al 2022c in addition the increase in snoa and sdna also indicated the addition of a nitrification denitrification pathway within the system the sana at this stage was significantly higher than the sdna indicating that anammox still dominated nitrogen removal within the reactor gradually changed to synergistic nitrogen removal by pna and denitrification improving nitrogen removal performance and stability from day 179 to 364 as c n and ar continued to rise snoa and sdna increased substantially and saoa and sana decreased to 0 20 and 0 07 g n g vss day respectively this result indicates that the system changed to a nitrification denitrification based approach to perform nitrogen removal according to the analysis of the sludge characteristics and specific activity the nitrogen removal pathway constantly changed as c n increased optimal c n and ar ensured that biomass was at its highest level and maintained a balance of functional microbial activity at this time various microbes functioned together in the system using pna and denitrification for synergistic nitrogen removal the do partitioning of the dodaic reactor promoted the co existence of various reactions providing a suitable environment for microbes and enhancing the synergy between microbes for nitrogen removal these factors maintained the efficient and stable nitrogen removal performance of the spnad system 3 4 microbial diversity and community structure 3 4 1 alpha diversity analysis table 2 shows the number of operational taxonomic units otus and the shannon ace chao1 and coverage indices of the microbial samples in different phases as shown in the table the coverage index for all microbial samples was greater than 99 8 indicating that the samples were representative of the true microbial profile of the system the species richness and diversity decreased when organic matter was added to the system c n increased from day 128 to 179 but species richness and diversity changes were not significant from day 179 to 285 excessive cod concentrations and sludge loss resulted in a continued reduction in microbial diversity the deterioration of the system led to a complex microbial structure by day 364 kang et al 2019 the results showed that organic matter strongly influenced species richness and diversity in the spnad system however during the c n 1 2 phase organic matter and its elevated concentrations favored the growth and synergy of microbes in the spnad system maintaining microbial diversity and stable system performance 3 4 2 variation in microbial community structure the changes in the relative abundance of microbes at the phylum level are shown in fig 5 a indicating that the microbial phylum in the spnad system was dominated by chloroflexi bacteroidetes proteobacteria and planctomycetota chloroflexi mainly serves as a skeleton in the aggregation of microbes and bacteroidetes can be involved in the breakdown of organic matter and pn cho et al 2010 planctomycetes contained almost all the anaob from day 16 to 179 the relative abundance of planctomycetota decreased from 4 8 to 0 8 indicating that adding organic matter inhibited anaob as with the specific activity results although the relative abundance of planctomycetota was low the high biomass and specific activity at this time did not affect the autotrophic nitrogen removal performance in the system zhou et al 2022 the composition of proteobacteria including aob dnb and aerobic hb was more complex the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased from 29 0 to 57 5 after adding organic matter probably owing to the rapid multiplication of dnb and aerobic hb the specific reason for this needs to be analyzed by the change in relative abundance at the genus level fig 5b illustrates the changes in the relative abundance of microbes at the major genus level following the addition of organic matter the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia dominant anaob genus decreased from 4 7 to 1 2 however its relative abundance remained stable from day 128 to 179 suggesting that when anaob adapts to an environment containing organic matter organic matter does not reinforce the competition between hb and anaob and instead promotes the mutualistic interaction of various microbes thereby enhancing performance by day 285 the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia was approximately 0 as previously mentioned there was little anammox in the reactor at this stage and the nitrogen removal process of the system was converted to nitrification denitrification the relative abundance of nitrosomonas the main aob varied in much the same way as candidatus brocadia the reduction in the abundance of nitrosomonas to low levels was also the main reason for limiting nitrification denitrification in phase vi denitratisoma shinella hyphomicrobium and comamonadaceae are classified as dnb in proteobacteria zheng et al 2022 while olb13 is a genus of dnb in chloroflexi zhang et al 2021 from day 16 to 128 the sum of the relative abundance of these dnb increased from 12 to 35 and then to 44 on day 179 on day 285 its abundance decreased to 14 again suggesting that the operating conditions at c n 1 2 were more favorable for the growth of dnb in the spnad system the variation in dnb abundance also shows that although the sdna of the sludge was higher on day 128 than on day 179 there was more biomass in the system on day 179 and the relative abundance of dnb was higher this results in stronger denitrification at c n 2 rhizobiaceae is an aerobic hb belonging to the phylum proteobacteria chen et al 2016 on day 128 the relative abundance of rhizobiaceae increased to 15 4 as phase ii of denitrification was weak and most of the organic matter was used to provide a carbon source for the growth of dnb and aerobic hb from phase iii to phase iv most of the organic matter became the substrate for denitrification the substrate available to rhizobiaceae decreased and its abundance decreased to 5 1 by contrast the influent c n and ar increased after day 179 and rhizobiaceae 53 9 multiplied rapidly and became the dominant microbes in the system the increase in rhizobiaceae also competed for the ecological niches and substrates of nitrogen removal microbes leading to a deterioration in nitrogen removal performance in addition pearson s correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationships between the main microbial phyla and genera fig 5c and 5d as shown in the figure planctomycetota and proteobacteria were negatively correlated r 0 98 p 0 05 suggesting a competitive relationship wang et al 2022b by contrast nitrosomonas was highly positively correlated with candidatus brocadia r 0 99 p 0 05 this result also demonstrated that hb in proteobacteria competed with aob and anaob for substrates and ecological niches thereby affecting the performance of the spnad system therefore it is necessary to achieve multiple pathways of synergistic nitrogen removal in the spnad system and maintain a dynamic balance between microbial growth and interaction the effects of c n ar and do on the relative abundance and interactions of microbes are also summarized refer to supplementary material the results indicate that elevated organic matter concentrations caused dramatic changes in the microbial community structure of the system which affected the nitrogen removal pathways the nitrogen removal pathway changed from autotrophic nitrogen removal based on aob and anaob to nitrification denitrification based on hb during c n 1 2 the spnad system utilized aob dnb and anaob for synergistic nitrogen removal further enhancing nitrogen removal performance the proliferation of aerobic hb and dnb also guaranteed the cod removal performance of the system the relative abundance and interactions of the microbes in the system could be maintained at an optimum level an appropriate ar maintained the stability of the system the do partitioning formed within the dodaic reactor also promoted the co existence of various microbes and enhanced their synergy al hazmi et al 2021 3 5 process mechanism of nitrogen removal this study analyzed the process mechanism of the spnad system in treating wastewater with different c n ratios fig 6 in phase i the system was free of organic matter aob and anaob form granular sludge in the reactor for autotrophic nitrogen removal using the pna process with the addition of organic matter c n 0 5 dnb and aerobic hb proliferated and the biomass in the reactor increased substantially because the concentration of organic matter provided at this time was low only a small amount of organic matter was available as a substrate for denitrification environmental impacts on aob and anaob and competition from hb collectively reduced the nitrogen removal performance of the system with pna granular sludge cleaving into suspended sludge adams et al 2022 however aob and anaob gradually domesticated as the experiment progressed and adapted to an environment containing organic matter when the influent c n was 1 2 sufficient organic matter caused denitrification in the system to increase gradually and all no3 n produced in the pna process was removed by denitrification the nitrogen removal pathway of the system changed to synergistic pna and nitrification denitrification a suitable ar for this phase not only provided the sufficient substrate for the pna process but also the oxidation of nh4 n to no3 n providing substrate for denitrification meanwhile the limited organic matter at this stage fails to allow dnb to have high specific activity and also restricts the growth of aerobic hb this results in limited competition from hb and the relative abundance and specific activity of aob and anaob can remain stable thus achieving the balance of nitrogen removal pathways in the spnad system al hazmi et al 2022 li et al 2020 in phases v and vi the continued increase in organic matter concentrations led to a renewed proliferation of aerobic hb competing for aob substrates and anaob ecological niches resulting in a complete change in the nitrogen removal pathway of the system to nitrification denitrification in addition the ar was too large at this time denitrification was inhibited and the nitrogen removal performance could not be improved overall increasing organic matter concentration changed the microbial community structure and nitrogen removal pathways within the spnad system and the level of ar affected the reaction rate and system stability of these organic matter concentration was the most critical factor in determining efficient single stage nitrogen removal this study found optimal operating conditions c n 1 2 and ar 1 4 1 6 l min for the spnad system and defined the pathways for removing pollutants from the system during this period the spnad system used both pna and nitrification denitrification processes for nitrogen removal and achieved cod removal via denitrification and oxidation by hb the appropriate amount of organic matter was more conducive to nitrogen removal performance resulting in a favorable synergy between aob anaob nob and dnb in the reactor achieving a dynamic stabilization of microbial growth and interactions in addition the do partitioning formed within the dodaic reactor provided a suitable environment for different functional microbes enhancing the synergy of the functional microbes and further enhancing system performance chen et al 2022 the performance of this system was compared with that of similar systems table 3 the airlift reactor employed by guo et al 2020 showed an nre and cre of 80 9 and 94 6 respectively at c n 0 8 which is lower than the performance of the dodaic reactor under similar conditions and the performance of this reactor started to deteriorate at c n of 1 6 it was a sequential batch reactor at c n 1 1 5 with an nre of approximately 86 0 but a cre below 77 0 well below the cre of this study ding et al 2018 wang et al 2022d treated synthetic wastewater with c n 0 43 with a peak nre capable of reaching 95 1 but could not maintain long term stable operation the performance and stability of the dodaic reactor were higher than that in previous studies at influent c n 1 2 this study clarified the effect of different c n on the performance nitrogen removal pathways and microbial interactions of the spnad system meanwhile the advantages of the dodaic reactor were exploited to enhance single stage nitrogen removal faced with actual municipal wastewater the spnad system combining multiple nitrogen removal pathways probably results in more economical treatment and more efficient and stable performance the intensification of the do gradient formed in the dodaic reactor on the growth and synergy of different functional microbes also provides a valuable solution for the treatment of municipal wastewater until then it is necessary to explore the feasibility of the system for treating low temperature and low nh4 n wastewater 4 conclusions a spnad system based on a dodaic reactor was operated continuously for 364 days with 250 mg l influent nh4 n during the operation c n increased from 0 5 to 4 and the ar gradually increased the nitrogen removal pathway of the system changed from autotrophic nitrogen removal to nitrification denitrification the results showed that the spnad system had the best performance at c n 1 2 and ar 1 4 1 6 l min the tnre and cre of the reactor increased to 87 21 4 23 and 94 78 3 17 respectively and were maintained for 36 days for efficient and stable operation at this time the relative abundance of dnb such as denitratisoma increased to 44 the nitrogen removal pathway of the system was pna and nitrification denitrification synergy and denitrification and hb oxidation were used to achieve efficient cod removal the continued elevation of c n resulted in a proliferation of rhizobiaceae competing for ecological niches and substrates of nitrogen removal microbes causing deterioration in performance this study utilized the do partitioning of the dodaic reactor and appropriate organic matter concentration to achieve efficient synergy of functional microbes maintaining the dynamic balance of

14692,heterogeneous fenton reaction has a great application potential in water purification but efficient catalysts are still lacking iron phosphide fep has a higher activity than the conventional fe based catalysts for fenton reactions but its ability as a fenton catalyst to directly activate h2o2 remains unreported herein we demonstrate that the fabricated fep has a lower electron transfer resistance than the typical conventional fe based catalysts i e fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh and thus could active h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals more efficiently in the heterogeneous fenton reactions for sodium benzoate degradation the fep catalyst presents a superior activity with a reaction rate constant more than 20 times those of the other catalysts i e fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh moreover it also exhibits a great catalytic activity in the treatment of real water samples and has a good stability in the cycling tests furthermore the fep could be loaded onto a centimeter sized porous carbon support and the prepared macro sized catalyst exhibits an excellent water treatment performance and can be well recycled this work reveals a great potential of fep as a catalyst for heterogeneous fenton reactions and may inspire further development and practical application of highly efficient catalysts for water purification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iron phosphide water treatment heterogeneous fenton reactions catalyst electron transfer ability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in advanced oxidation processes strong oxidizing radicals can be generated for efficient degradation of pollutants among the various advanced oxidation technologies such as photochemical oxidation catalytic wet oxidation ozone oxidation and electrochemical oxidation the fenton reaction has attracted wide interests due to its good application prospect babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 bello et al 2019 liu et al 2022 pliego et al 2015 shi et al 2022 xiao et al 2023 zhang et al 2019 brillas and garcia segura 2020 chen et al 2023 jain et al 2018 mirzaei et al 2017 in classical fenton reaction h2o2 is activated by ferrous ion fe2 which is hard to recycle and can bring harmful iron sludge after the reaction differing from the homogeneous ions solid catalysts can be readily recycled and reused and thus the heterogeneous fenton reaction based on solid catalyst has a better application potential in water purification he et al 2016 navalon et al 2010 zhu et al 2019 transition metal based materials are the most widely studied solid catalysts in heterogeneous fenton reaction fu et al 2022 kumar et al 2020 thomas et al 2020 among the various transition metals iron has the most abundant geological reserves and is benign to the environment therefore iron based materials are drawing increasing interests in the heterogeneous fenton reaction studies and various iron based catalysts have been developed lai et al 2021 wang and tang 2021a 2021b however most of the currently used iron based catalysts still suffer from a low activity or poor stability lai et al 2021 in the activation of h2o2 most of iron based catalysts cannot achieve an efficient fe ii fe iii redox cycle and thus exhibit a low catalytic activity this might be attributed to the inefficient electron transfer between the catalysts and the reactants i e h2o2 and the pollutants lai et al 2021 wang et al 2020 meanwhile the typical iron based catalysts e g zero valent iron iron oxide iron sulfide and iron oxychloride are often not acid resistant and thus have a poor stability under typical acidic conditions in fenton reactions lai et al 2021 rahim pouran et al 2014 wang and tang 2021a therefore good electron transfer ability and acid resistance are essential to the application of iron based catalysts in fenton reactions iron phosphide fep have a high electron transfer ability because the alloying of iron and phosphorus can form a metallic state and also have great acid resistance and stability bailey and duncan 1967 grosvenor et al 2005 xu et al 2020 these advantages of fep promise an efficient redox cycle in catalytic reactions and decent catalytic performance under harsh conditions for example fep has shown an excellent catalytic activity and stability for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction under acidic neutral and alkaline conditions xu et al 2020 liang et al 2014 du et al 2022 therefore we hypothesize that fep might be an appealing material that can overcome the low activity and poor stability of the traditional iron based catalysts for heterogeneous fenton reaction in a previous study fep was used as a co catalyst to promote the redox cycle of homogenous fe2 fe3 and accelerate the activation of h2o2 ma et al 2019 implying a potential of applying fep in fenton reactions however no information about the application of fep as a catalyst to directly activate h2o2 is available and the catalytic pollutant degradation performance and mechanism of fep in heterogeneous fenton reactions need to be explored in this work we applied fep as a new catalyst to activate h2o2 to degrade organic pollutants in water the superior catalytic activity of fep was demonstrated by comparing it with the typical conventional fe based catalysts like fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh then its applicability for various pollutants and water samples was examined and its cycling performance was evaluated then the reactive oxygen species in the reactions were identified and electrochemical tests were conducted to explore the catalytic mechanism of fep for pollutant degradation finally the fep was immobilized into macro sized porous carbon support to prepare centimeter sized catalyst pellets which could be readily recycled and exhibited a potential for practical water purification applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of fep and centimeter sized porous carbon supported fep iron phosphide was synthesized using a modified method from the literature zheng et al 2022 in a typical synthesis commercial α ferric oxide of 0 3 g shanghai aladdin co china was placed in a small porcelain boat

as the target pollutants in heterogeneous fenton reactions fep fe2o3 shanghai aladdin co china fe3o4 shanghai macklin biochemical co china and feooh were used as the catalysts for activation of h2o2 to degrade organic pollutants the feooh was prepared as described in supporting information note s1 the typical catalytic degradation experiment was conducted with 0 2 g l 1 catalyst 10 mg l 1 pollutant and 3 mm h2o2 the catalyst was first added to the pollutant solution and then the reaction started after h2o2 was added to the solution at given time intervals 0 5 ml of the reaction

concentrations the used powder catalyst was separated by a 0 2 μm filter membrane washed with water and then re dispersed into the solution for the next cycle in all the degradation experiments the ph value of the pollutant solution was adjusted to 3 0 with dilute sulfuric acid before the reaction unless otherwise stated all the degradation experiments were conducted in the solution prepared with

electrochemical workstation chi 760e chenhua co china with a three electrode system in which a glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode an ag agcl electrode as the reference electrode and a pt sheet as the counter electrode the catalyst 5 mg was dispersed in 1 ml of ethanol containing 10 μl of sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene based fluoropolymer copolymer nafion 5 wt sigma aldrich inc usa by ultrasound then 5 μl of the catalyst ink was dipped on the glassy carbon electrode each time for the electrochemical test the aqueous solution of sodium sulfate 0 1 m at ph 3 0 was used as the electrolyte the electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained in the frequency range of 1 to 105 hz in the constant potential tests the potential of the working electrode was set at 0 v vs ag

physicochemical properties of fep iron phosphide catalyst was prepared through the phosphorization of iron oxide in nitrogen with sodium hypophosphite as the phosphorus source the xrd pattern fig 1 a reveals that the catalyst with fep phase was successfully prepared the xrd peaks around 32 7 37 1 46 9 48 3 56 1 and 59 6 were consistent with the 011 111 220 211 031 and 002 crystal planes of the fep phase respectively the elemental distribution of the material was observed by sem energy dispersive spectroscopy and the results fig 1b d show uniform distribution of fe and p in the catalyst the xps results reveal the surface states of fe and p in fep fig s1 the high resolution fe 2p spectrum exhibited a peak at 707 ev close to metallic fe at 706 8 ev peaks at 711 4 and 724 5 ev attributed to fe2 and peaks at 714 5 and 727 5 ev attributed to fe3 gao et al 2022 wang et al 2019a yan et al 2022b the p 2p spectrum exhibited peaks at 129 2 ev and 130 2 ev attributed to fep as well as a peak at 133 5 ev attributed to oxidized p wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2021 these results indicate the coexistence of metallic fep and oxidized fe on the fep surface which could be attributed to its typical and inevitable surface oxidation after exposure to air as revealed by previous works deng et al 2022 han et al 2016 ji et al 2020 wang et al 2017 yan et al 2016 2015 zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2019b previous dft calculations reveal a non zero density of state of fep at the fermi level indicating that fep is a metallic conductor chernyavskii et al 2020 with the metallic property fep exhibits a better conductivity and reducibility than semiconductor materials such as fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh and is thus advantageous for the catalytic activation of h2o2 furthermore we investigated the coordination state of fe in fep using epr and observed two peaks with g values around 1 9 and 4 3 fig s2 the former peak corresponds to fe at octahedral sites and the latter corresponds to defect sites of fe caused by p vacancies yang et al 2020 the presence of p vacancies in fep enhances its conductivity and exposes more fe sites thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of fep yan et al 2022a the morphologies and compositions of the catalyst were observed by sem and tem the sem image fig 1e shows that the catalyst was composed of rod like nanoparticles that coalesced with each other the tem image illustrates the pores of several tens of nanometers in size inside the particles fig 1f which were further evidenced by the nitrogen adsorption and desorption tests fig s3 and table s1 the lattice fringes in the high resolution tem image fig 1g with the spacing of 0 27 nm and 0 24 nm were consistent with the parameters of the 011 and 111 crystal planes of fep respectively ali et al 2020 jiang et al 2014 tan et al 2019 yan et al 2015 yang et al 2017 further verifying the fep phase of the catalyst 3 2 catalytic pollutant degradation performance of fep the performance of fep for catalytic activation of h2o2 to degrade various pollutants was evaluated sodium benzoate was first selected as the target pollutant for tests and the concentrations of catalyst and oxidant were optimized we conducted the catalytic tests at different initial phs the results show a significant decrease in the catalytic performance of fep when the ph exceeded 3 therefore fep catalyst is suitable for use at lower phs such as ph 3 0 fig s4 when the catalyst dosage reached 0 2 g l 1 and the initial h2o2 concentration reached 3 mm further increasing the concentrations of both did not increase the pollutant removal efficiency fig s5 therefore these concentrations were chosen for the subsequent tests control experiments were conducted to explore the catalytic properties of fep the results fig 2 a show that the sodium benzoate could be hardly removed by adsorption on fep alone or oxidation by h2o2 alone while effective removal of the sodium benzoate was achieved via the catalytic activation of h2o2 by fep after the reaction 1 00 mg l 1 fe and 0 78 mg l 1 p were detected in the solution which was much less effective than the fep for catalytic degradation of the sodium benzoate fig s6 indicating that the heterogeneous catalytic effect of fep was the main contributor to the pollutant removal additionally we investigated the impact of the surface oxide layer on the catalytic reaction we immersed the fep catalyst in 1 m hydrochloric acid for 4 h to remove the surface oxide layer subsequently the acid washed fep was thoroughly rinsed with water and used immediately for the catalytic degradation experiments the result fig s7 shows that the activity of the acid washed fep was higher than that of the original fep indicating that the surface oxide layer could inhibit the activity of fep however the acid washed fep catalyst released more fe and p ions after the reaction table s2 suggesting a positive role of the surface oxide layer in improving the stability of fep conventional iron based catalysts i e fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh figs s8 s11 were further prepared to compared their catalytic activities with that of fep the results fig 2b show that the sodium benzoate degradation of fep was much higher than those of the other catalysts in the reaction catalyzed by fep the pollutant was almost completely removed in 60 min while less than 40 of the sodium benzoate was degraded at the same time in the reaction of the other three catalysts the sodium benzoate degradation rate constant k was calculated using a pseudo first order kinetics model as shown in fig s12 the value of k for the fep catalyzed reaction 0 0451 min 1 was much higher than those of the other three catalysts 0 0005 min 1 0 002 min 1 and 0 0008 min 1 for fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh respectively after normalizing k against the surface area table s1 the value ks for fep 6 73 10 3 min 1 m 2 g was still more than 20 times those of the other catalysts fig s12 inset these results demonstrate the superiority of fep to the conventional iron based catalysts in heterogeneous fenton reactions the fep catalyst also exhibited a great catalytic activity for degrading other typical pollutants such as phenol bisphenol a and p nitrophenol fig 2c furthermore it maintained an excellent catalytic performance in different practical water samples such as the secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant tap water and lake water the properties of the water samples are shown in table s3 the activities of fep in the actual water samples were similar to that in the deionized water fig 2d demonstrating the great applicability of fep additionally we investigated the effects of typical ions i e no3 cl h2po4 and organic matter i e humic acids that might interfere with the reaction the results fig s13 show that h2po4 significantly inhibited the catalytic performance of fep this could be attributed to the strong coordination ability of h2po4 which masked the fe sites on the surface of fep hindering its catalytic activity huang et al 2017 the presence of no3 cl and humic acid had a weaker suppression effect but their consumption of the free radicals can also lead to a decrease in the pollutant degradation efficiency lado ribeiro et al 2019 the fact that the inhibitory effects in practical water samples fig 2d were lower than those in fig s13 might be because the concentrations of interfering substances in these samples were lower than those we tested in fig s13 after evaluating the catalytic activity we further tested the cycling performance of fep the catalyst was filtered and washed after use and then dispersed into the new solution for the next cycle the activity of the catalyst was well maintained in the five cycles fig 3 a the xrd and tem results fig 3b c show that the crystal structure of fep and its porous morphology were well maintained after five cycles these results show the robustness of the fep catalyst and its potential for application 3 3 catalytic mechanism of fep in heterogeneous fenton reactions to examine whether fep could activate h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals for the pollutant degradation epr tests were conducted using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide as the spin trapping agent for hydroxyl radicals fig 4 a shows that a set of equally spaced ca 15 g peaks with intensity ratio close to 1 2 2 1 were detected in the fep catalyzed reaction which reveals that hydroxyl radicals were generated in the reaction system the epr signals of hydroxyl radicals were also detected in the reaction systems catalyzed by feooh fe3o4 and fe2o3 with the substantially decreased signal intensity in turn the highest intensity of the radical signals generated by fep was consistent with its highest catalytic activity among the four materials additionally we conducted the epr tests using tmp and dmpo as the spin trapping agents for 1o2 and o2 respectively however no signals of the two species were detected in the fep catalyzed reaction figs s14 and s15 indicating that 1o2 and o2 were not generated in this reaction to further identify the contribution of hydroxyl radicals to the pollutant degradation quenching experiments were conducted with tert butanol as a quenching agent for the hydroxyl radicals the tert butanol almost completely inhibited the sodium benzoate degradation fig 4b verifying the dominant role of hydroxyl radicals these results show that fep catalyst could activate h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals efficiently and the hydroxyl radicals made a main contribution to the pollutant degradation in the catalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals through h2o2 activation the efficiency of electron transfer between the catalyst and h2o2 is essential moura et al 2005 qin et al 2017 to understand the electron transfer properties of fep in the catalytic process the electrochemical impedance spectra of fep and other iron based catalysts were tested fep presented a lower electron transfer resistance than feooh fe3o4 and fe2o3 fig 4c which was beneficial for accelerating the activation of h2o2 for pollutant degradation to verify the electron transfer between fep and h2o2 current time tests were conducted in a sodium sulfate electrolyte by loading fep onto a glassy carbon electrode and the effects of dosing h2o2 and sodium benzoate pollutant on the electrode current were tested dosing h2o2 into the electrolyte caused a step change in the electrode current and the change amplitude of the glassy carbon electrode gce loaded with fep fep gce was much smaller than that of the blank gce fig 4d dosing sodium benzoate into the electrolyte resulted in a slight change in the current these results indicate the significant electron transfer between h2o2 and fep which was much more efficient than that between sodium benzoate and fep the effects of dosing h2o2 and the pollutant on the open circuit potential of the electrode were further examined as shown in fig 4e the potential of the fep gce electrode increased substantially after adding h2o2 to the electrolyte while dosing sodium benzoate caused little change of the potential this result coincided with the formation of oxidative radicals via the redox reaction between fep and h2o2 meanwhile fep caused a higher increase 0 1 v in 1 min in potential than those less than 0 06 v in 1 min of the other catalysts i e fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh fig s16 implying the more effective production of oxidative radicals on fep these results indicate that efficient electron transfer between fep and h2o2 could be achieved to produce strongly oxidizing radicals fig 4f and the pollutant degradation should be attributed mainly to the radicals as the direct redox reaction between the pollutant and fep was not significant fig 4d e 3 4 centimeter sized pc supported fep for water treatment since the above powder fep catalyst was not readily separated and recycled after use and thus not suitable for practical application we prepared a macro sized carbon supported fep catalyst as illustrated in fig 5 a first porous polyacrylonitrile pan powders figs 5a i and s17 were prepared through the polymerization reaction of acrylonitrile then the powders were molded into pellets with a diameter of 1 3 cm and a thickness of 2 mm fig 5a ii the tem and sem images fig s18 show that the pellets were composed of flower like porous nanospheres with uniform size of 750 nm the pan pellets were pre oxidized to stabilize their porous morphology fig s19 and then pyrolyzed into pc pellets with a diameter of 0 9 cm figs 5a iii and s20 finally fep was loaded onto the carbon pellets to obtain the macro sized composite catalyst fep pc fig 5a iv and 5b the porous structure of the nanospheres inside the initial pan pellets was well maintained in the final fep pc figs 5c d and s21 the high angle annular dark field image also verifies the porous structure of the nanospheres fig 5e and the energy dispersion spectroscopy reveals the uniform distribution of c n o fe and p in the porous nanospheres fig 5f j the xrd pattern fig 5k further shows the fep phase in the composite pellets fep pc and the two broad peaks at around 23º and 44º illustrate the amorphous structure of the carbon support pawlyta et al 2015 these results indicate the successful preparation of the macro sized carbon supported fep pellet catalyst 3 5 pollutant degradation performance of fep pc the catalytic performance of the fep pc for activating h2o2 to degrade p nitrophenol was evaluated as shown in fig 6 a h2o2 alone could hardly remove the p nitrophenol while the fep pc could remove about 80 of p nitrophenol by adsorption at 60 min when h2o2 was activated by the fep pc the reaction rate was substantially accelerated and the removal exceeded 90 in 30 min compared with the fep pc the catalytic performance of pc was much weaker the removal efficiency of p nitrophenol within 60 min using pc as a catalyst was even lower than the adsorptive removal by the fep pc these results show the good performance of the fep pc for p nitrophenol removal through the combination of adsorption and catalysis since the pollutants could also be partially removed in the pc adsorption and catalytic systems fig 6a the pc can serve as a promoter besides as the support of fep for pollutant adsorption and catalytic removal in the reaction of fep pc system after the reaction the fe leaching from fep pc was 3 80 mg l 1 higher than that of the bare fep catalyst 1 00 mg l 1 this might be due to the lower oxidation degree in the fep surface of the fep pc catalyst fig s22 as mentioned above section 3 2 the protective effect of the surface oxide layer on fep could inhibit the fe leaching in the reaction therefore the fep in pc with less surface oxide layer and also lower fe content would have a more severe erosion by the same concentration of h2o2 i e 3 mm in the presence of tert butanol with a molar concentration of 20 times that of h2o2 the p nitrophenol removal by the fep pc was substantially inhibited fig s23 suggesting the important role of hydroxyl radicals the epr tests verify the presence of hydroxyl radicals in the fep pc catalyzed reaction system while no significant signal was detected in the pc catalyzed reaction system fig 6b these results demonstrate that the fep pc could activate h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals which made an important contribution to the p nitrophenol degradation in addition the fep pc catalyst could be well recycled and maintained 80 of initial performance after five time use fig 6c 4 conclusions in summary this work demonstrates that fep is a superior catalyst in heterogeneous fenton reactions for water purification compared with the conventional fe based catalysts such as fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh fep has a lower electron transfer resistance and higher ability to activate h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals thus exhibiting a superior catalytic activity for the degradation of various organic pollutants meanwhile fep shows an excellent catalytic activity in real water samples and good stability in recycling furthermore the macro sized catalyst pellets prepared by loading fep onto a centimeter sized porous carbon support exhibit a great catalytic performance and can be well recycled this work not only reveals a great potential of fep for heterogeneous fenton reactions but also provides an approach to prepare macro sized catalysts for practical applications these results may inspire future design preparation and applications of highly efficient catalysts for water

14692,heterogeneous fenton reaction has a great application potential in water purification but efficient catalysts are still lacking iron phosphide fep has a higher activity than the conventional fe based catalysts for fenton reactions but its ability as a fenton catalyst to directly activate h2o2 remains unreported herein we demonstrate that the fabricated fep has a lower electron transfer resistance than the typical conventional fe based catalysts i e fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh and thus could active h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals more efficiently in the heterogeneous fenton reactions for sodium benzoate degradation the fep catalyst presents a superior activity with a reaction rate constant more than 20 times those of the other catalysts i e fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh moreover it also exhibits a great catalytic activity in the treatment of real water samples and has a good stability in the cycling tests furthermore the fep could be loaded onto a centimeter sized porous carbon support and the prepared macro sized catalyst exhibits an excellent water treatment performance and can be well recycled this work reveals a great potential of fep as a catalyst for heterogeneous

oxidizing radicals can be generated for efficient degradation of pollutants among the various advanced oxidation technologies such as photochemical oxidation catalytic wet oxidation ozone oxidation and electrochemical oxidation the fenton reaction has attracted wide interests due to its good application prospect babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 bello et al 2019 liu et al 2022 pliego et al 2015 shi et al 2022 xiao et al 2023 zhang et al 2019 brillas and garcia segura 2020 chen et al 2023 jain et al 2018 mirzaei et al 2017 in classical fenton reaction h2o2 is activated by ferrous ion fe2 which is hard to recycle and can bring harmful iron sludge after the reaction differing from the homogeneous ions solid catalysts can be readily recycled and reused and thus the heterogeneous fenton reaction based on solid catalyst has a better application potential in water purification he et al 2016 navalon et al 2010 zhu et al 2019 transition metal based materials are the most widely studied solid catalysts in heterogeneous fenton reaction fu et al 2022 kumar et al 2020 thomas et al 2020 among the various transition metals iron has the most abundant geological reserves and is benign to the environment therefore iron based materials are drawing increasing interests in the heterogeneous fenton reaction studies and various iron based catalysts have been developed lai et al 2021 wang and tang 2021a 2021b however most of the currently used iron based catalysts still suffer from a low activity or poor stability lai et al 2021 in the activation of h2o2 most of iron based catalysts cannot achieve an efficient fe ii fe iii redox cycle and thus exhibit a low catalytic activity this might be attributed to the inefficient electron transfer between the catalysts and the reactants i e h2o2 and the pollutants lai et al 2021 wang et al 2020 meanwhile the typical iron based catalysts e g zero valent iron iron oxide iron sulfide and iron oxychloride are often not acid resistant and thus have a poor stability under typical acidic conditions in fenton reactions lai et al 2021 rahim pouran et al 2014 wang and tang 2021a therefore good electron transfer ability and acid resistance are essential to the application of iron based catalysts in fenton reactions iron phosphide fep have a high electron transfer ability because the alloying of iron and phosphorus can form a metallic state and also have great acid resistance and stability bailey and duncan 1967 grosvenor et al 2005 xu et al 2020 these advantages of fep promise an efficient redox cycle in catalytic reactions and decent catalytic performance under harsh conditions for example fep has shown an excellent catalytic activity and stability for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction under acidic neutral and alkaline conditions xu et al 2020 liang et al 2014 du et al 2022 therefore we hypothesize that fep might be an appealing material that can overcome the low activity and poor stability of the traditional iron based catalysts for heterogeneous fenton reaction in a previous study fep was used as a co catalyst to promote the redox cycle of homogenous fe2 fe3 and accelerate the activation of h2o2 ma et al 2019 implying a potential of applying fep in fenton reactions however no information about the application of fep as a catalyst to directly activate h2o2 is available and the catalytic pollutant degradation performance and mechanism of fep in heterogeneous fenton reactions need to be explored in this work we applied fep as a new catalyst to activate h2o2 to degrade organic pollutants in water the superior catalytic activity of fep was demonstrated by comparing it with the typical conventional fe based catalysts like fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh then its applicability for various pollutants and water samples was examined and its cycling performance was evaluated then the reactive oxygen species in the reactions were identified and electrochemical tests were conducted to explore the catalytic mechanism of fep for pollutant degradation finally the fep was immobilized into macro sized porous carbon support to prepare centimeter sized catalyst pellets which could be readily recycled and exhibited a potential for practical water purification applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of fep and centimeter sized porous carbon supported fep iron phosphide

electrochemical workstation chi 760e chenhua co china with a three electrode system in which a glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode an ag agcl electrode as the reference electrode and a pt sheet as the counter electrode the catalyst 5 mg was dispersed in 1 ml of ethanol containing 10 μl of sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene based fluoropolymer copolymer nafion 5 wt sigma aldrich

physicochemical properties of fep iron phosphide catalyst was prepared through the phosphorization of iron oxide in nitrogen with sodium hypophosphite as the phosphorus source the xrd pattern fig 1 a reveals that the catalyst with fep phase was successfully prepared the xrd peaks around 32 7 37 1 46 9 48 3 56 1 and 59 6 were consistent with the 011 111 220 211 031 and 002 crystal planes of the fep phase respectively the elemental distribution of the material was observed by sem energy dispersive spectroscopy and the results fig 1b d show uniform distribution of fe and p in the catalyst the xps results reveal the surface states of fe and p in fep fig s1 the high resolution fe 2p spectrum exhibited a peak at 707 ev close to metallic fe at 706 8 ev peaks at 711 4 and 724 5 ev attributed to fe2 and peaks at 714 5 and 727 5 ev attributed to fe3 gao et al 2022 wang et al 2019a yan et al 2022b the p 2p spectrum exhibited peaks at 129 2 ev and 130 2 ev attributed to fep as well as a peak at 133 5 ev attributed to oxidized p wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2021 these results indicate the coexistence of metallic fep and oxidized fe on the fep surface which could be attributed to its typical and inevitable surface oxidation after exposure to air as revealed by previous works deng et al 2022 han et al 2016 ji et al 2020 wang et al 2017 yan et al 2016 2015 zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2019b previous dft calculations reveal a non zero density of state of fep at the fermi level indicating that fep is a metallic conductor chernyavskii et al 2020 with the metallic property fep exhibits a better conductivity and reducibility than semiconductor materials such as fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh and is thus advantageous for the catalytic activation of h2o2 furthermore we investigated the coordination state of fe in fep using epr and observed two peaks with g values around 1 9 and 4 3 fig s2 the former peak corresponds to fe at octahedral sites and the latter corresponds to defect sites of fe caused by p vacancies yang et al 2020 the presence of p vacancies in fep enhances its conductivity and exposes more fe sites thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of fep yan et al 2022a the morphologies and compositions of the catalyst were observed by sem and tem the sem image fig 1e shows that the catalyst was composed of rod like nanoparticles that coalesced with each other the tem image illustrates the pores of several tens of nanometers in size inside the particles fig 1f which were further evidenced by the nitrogen adsorption and desorption tests fig s3 and table s1 the lattice fringes in the high resolution tem image fig 1g with the spacing of 0 27 nm and 0 24 nm were consistent with the parameters of the 011 and 111 crystal planes of fep respectively ali et al 2020 jiang et al 2014 tan et al 2019 yan et al 2015 yang et al 2017 further verifying the fep phase of the catalyst 3 2 catalytic pollutant degradation performance of fep the performance of fep for catalytic activation of h2o2 to degrade various pollutants was evaluated sodium benzoate was first selected as the target pollutant for tests and the concentrations of catalyst and oxidant were optimized we conducted the catalytic tests at different initial phs the results show a significant decrease in the catalytic performance of fep when the ph exceeded 3 therefore fep catalyst is suitable for use at lower phs such as ph 3 0 fig s4 when the catalyst dosage reached 0 2 g l 1 and the initial h2o2 concentration reached 3 mm further increasing the concentrations of both did not increase the pollutant removal efficiency fig s5 therefore these concentrations were chosen for the subsequent tests control experiments were conducted to explore the catalytic properties of fep the results fig 2 a show that the sodium benzoate could be hardly removed by adsorption on fep alone or oxidation by h2o2 alone while effective removal of the sodium benzoate was achieved via the catalytic activation of h2o2 by fep after the reaction 1 00 mg l 1 fe and 0 78 mg l 1 p were detected in the solution which was much less effective than the fep for catalytic degradation of the sodium benzoate fig s6 indicating that the heterogeneous catalytic effect of fep was the main contributor to the pollutant removal additionally we investigated the impact of the surface oxide layer on the catalytic reaction we immersed the fep catalyst in 1 m hydrochloric acid for 4 h to remove the surface oxide layer subsequently the acid washed fep was thoroughly rinsed with water and used immediately for the catalytic degradation experiments the result fig s7 shows that the activity of the acid washed fep was higher than that of the original fep indicating that the surface oxide layer could inhibit the activity of fep however the acid washed fep catalyst released more fe and p ions after the reaction table s2 suggesting a positive role of the surface oxide layer in improving the stability of fep conventional iron based catalysts i e fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh figs s8 s11 were further prepared to compared their catalytic activities with that of fep the results fig 2b show that the sodium benzoate degradation of fep was much higher than those of the other catalysts in the reaction catalyzed by fep the pollutant was almost completely removed in 60 min while less than 40 of the sodium benzoate was degraded at the same time in the reaction of the other three catalysts the sodium benzoate degradation rate constant k was calculated using a pseudo first order kinetics model as shown in fig s12 the value of k for the fep catalyzed reaction 0 0451 min 1 was much higher than those of the other three catalysts 0 0005 min 1 0 002 min 1 and 0 0008 min 1 for fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh respectively after normalizing k against the surface area table s1 the value ks for fep 6 73 10 3 min 1 m 2 g was still more than 20 times those of the other catalysts fig s12 inset these results demonstrate the superiority of fep to the conventional iron based catalysts in heterogeneous fenton reactions the fep catalyst also exhibited a great catalytic activity for degrading other typical pollutants such as phenol bisphenol a and p nitrophenol fig 2c furthermore it maintained an excellent catalytic performance in different practical water samples such as the secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant tap water and lake water the properties of the water samples are shown in table s3 the activities of fep in the actual water samples were similar to that in the deionized water fig 2d demonstrating the great applicability of fep additionally we investigated the effects of typical ions i e no3 cl h2po4 and organic matter i e humic acids that might interfere with the reaction the results fig s13 show that h2po4 significantly inhibited the catalytic performance of fep this could be attributed to the strong coordination ability of h2po4 which masked the fe sites on the surface of fep hindering its catalytic activity huang et al 2017 the presence of no3 cl and humic acid had a weaker suppression effect but their consumption of the free radicals can also lead to a decrease in the pollutant degradation efficiency lado ribeiro et al 2019 the fact that the inhibitory effects in practical water samples fig 2d were lower than those in fig s13 might be because the concentrations of interfering substances in these samples were lower than those we tested in fig s13 after evaluating the catalytic activity we further tested the cycling performance of fep the catalyst was filtered and washed after use and then dispersed into the new solution for the next cycle the activity of the catalyst was well maintained in the five cycles fig 3 a the xrd and tem results fig 3b c show that the crystal structure of fep and its porous morphology were well maintained after five cycles these results show the robustness of the fep catalyst and its potential for application 3 3 catalytic mechanism of fep in heterogeneous fenton reactions to examine whether fep could activate h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals for the pollutant degradation epr tests were conducted using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide as the spin trapping agent for hydroxyl radicals fig 4 a shows that a set of equally spaced ca 15 g peaks with intensity ratio close to 1 2 2 1 were detected in the fep catalyzed reaction which reveals that hydroxyl radicals were generated in the reaction system the epr signals of hydroxyl radicals were also detected in the reaction systems catalyzed by feooh fe3o4 and fe2o3 with the substantially decreased signal intensity in turn the highest intensity of the radical signals generated by fep was consistent with its highest catalytic activity among the four materials additionally we conducted the epr tests using tmp and dmpo as the spin trapping agents for 1o2 and o2 respectively however no signals of the two species were detected in the fep catalyzed reaction figs s14 and s15 indicating that 1o2 and o2 were not generated in this reaction to further identify the contribution of hydroxyl radicals to the pollutant degradation quenching experiments were conducted with tert butanol as a quenching agent for the hydroxyl radicals the tert butanol almost completely inhibited the sodium benzoate degradation fig 4b verifying the dominant role of hydroxyl radicals these results show that fep catalyst could activate h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals efficiently and the hydroxyl radicals made a main contribution to the pollutant degradation in the catalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals through h2o2 activation the efficiency of electron transfer between the catalyst and h2o2 is essential moura et al 2005 qin et al 2017 to understand the electron transfer properties of fep in the catalytic process the electrochemical impedance spectra of fep and other iron based catalysts were tested fep presented a lower electron transfer resistance than feooh fe3o4 and fe2o3 fig 4c which was beneficial for accelerating the activation of h2o2 for pollutant degradation to verify the electron transfer between fep and h2o2 current time tests were conducted in a sodium sulfate electrolyte by loading fep onto a glassy carbon electrode and the effects of dosing h2o2 and sodium benzoate pollutant on the electrode current were tested dosing h2o2 into the electrolyte caused a step change in the electrode current and the change amplitude of the glassy carbon electrode gce loaded with fep fep gce was much smaller than that of the blank gce fig 4d dosing sodium benzoate into the electrolyte resulted in a slight change in the current these results indicate the significant electron transfer between h2o2 and fep which was much more efficient than that between sodium benzoate and fep the effects of dosing h2o2 and the pollutant on the open circuit potential of the electrode were further examined as shown in fig 4e the potential of the fep gce electrode increased substantially after adding h2o2 to the electrolyte while dosing sodium benzoate caused little change of the potential this result coincided with the formation of oxidative radicals via the redox reaction between fep and h2o2 meanwhile fep caused a higher increase 0 1 v in 1 min in potential than those less than 0 06 v in 1 min of the other catalysts i e fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh fig s16 implying the more effective production of oxidative radicals on fep these results indicate that efficient electron transfer between fep and h2o2 could be achieved to produce strongly oxidizing radicals fig 4f and the pollutant degradation should be attributed mainly to the radicals as the direct redox reaction between the pollutant and fep was not significant fig 4d e 3 4 centimeter sized pc supported fep for water treatment since the above powder fep catalyst was not readily separated and recycled after use and thus not suitable for practical application we prepared a macro sized carbon supported fep catalyst as illustrated in fig 5 a first porous polyacrylonitrile pan powders figs 5a i and s17 were prepared through the polymerization reaction of acrylonitrile then the powders were molded into pellets with a diameter of 1 3 cm and a thickness of 2 mm fig 5a ii the tem and sem images fig s18 show that the pellets were composed of flower like porous nanospheres with uniform size of 750 nm the pan pellets were pre oxidized to stabilize their porous morphology fig s19 and then pyrolyzed into pc pellets with a diameter of 0 9 cm figs 5a iii and s20 finally fep was loaded onto the carbon pellets to obtain the macro sized composite catalyst fep pc fig 5a iv and 5b the porous structure of the nanospheres inside the initial pan pellets was well maintained in the final fep pc figs 5c d and s21 the high angle annular dark field image also verifies the porous structure of the nanospheres fig 5e and the energy dispersion spectroscopy reveals the uniform distribution of c n o fe and p in the porous nanospheres fig 5f j the xrd pattern fig 5k further shows the fep phase in the composite pellets fep pc and the two broad peaks at around 23º and 44º illustrate the amorphous structure of the carbon support pawlyta et al 2015 these results indicate the successful preparation of the macro sized carbon supported fep pellet catalyst 3 5 pollutant degradation performance of fep pc the catalytic performance of the fep pc for activating h2o2 to degrade p nitrophenol was evaluated as shown in fig 6 a h2o2 alone could hardly remove the p nitrophenol while the fep pc could remove about 80 of p nitrophenol by adsorption at 60 min when h2o2 was activated by the fep pc the reaction rate was substantially accelerated and the removal exceeded 90 in 30 min compared with the fep pc the catalytic performance of pc was much weaker the removal efficiency of p nitrophenol within 60 min using pc as a catalyst was even lower than the adsorptive removal by the fep pc these results show the good performance of the fep pc for p nitrophenol removal through the combination of adsorption and catalysis since the pollutants could also be partially removed in the pc adsorption and catalytic systems fig 6a the pc can serve as a promoter besides as the support of fep for pollutant adsorption and catalytic removal in the reaction of fep pc system after the reaction the fe leaching from fep pc was 3 80 mg l 1 higher than that of the bare fep catalyst 1 00 mg l 1 this might be due to the lower oxidation degree in the fep surface of the fep pc catalyst fig s22 as mentioned above section 3 2 the protective effect of the surface oxide layer on fep could inhibit the fe leaching in the reaction therefore the fep in pc with less surface oxide layer and also lower fe content would have a more severe erosion by the same concentration of h2o2 i e 3 mm in the presence of tert butanol with a molar concentration of 20 times that of h2o2 the p nitrophenol removal by the fep pc was substantially inhibited fig s23 suggesting the important role of hydroxyl radicals the epr tests verify the presence of hydroxyl radicals in the fep pc catalyzed reaction system while no significant signal was detected in the pc catalyzed reaction system fig 6b these results demonstrate that the fep pc could activate h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals which made an important contribution to the p nitrophenol degradation in addition the fep pc catalyst could be well recycled and maintained 80 of initial performance after five time use fig 6c 4 conclusions in summary this work demonstrates that fep is a superior catalyst in heterogeneous fenton reactions for water purification compared with the conventional fe based catalysts such as fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh fep has a lower electron transfer resistance and higher ability to activate h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals thus exhibiting a superior catalytic activity for the degradation of various organic pollutants meanwhile fep shows an excellent catalytic activity in real water samples and good stability in recycling furthermore the macro sized catalyst pellets prepared by loading fep onto a centimeter sized porous carbon support exhibit a great catalytic performance and can be well recycled this work not only reveals a great potential of fep for heterogeneous fenton reactions but also provides an approach to prepare macro sized catalysts for practical applications these results may inspire future design preparation and applications of highly efficient catalysts for water

14693,nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been extensively used for environmental remediation and wastewater treatment however the biological effects of nzvi remain unclear which is no doubt a result of the complexity of iron species and the dynamic succession of microbial community during nzvi aging here the aging effects of nzvi on methanogenesis in anaerobic digestion ad were consecutively investigated with an emphasis on deciphering the causal relationships between nzvi aging process and its biological effects the addition of nzvi in ad led to ferroptosis like death with hallmarks of iron dependent lipid peroxidation and glutathione gsh depletion which inhibited ch4 production during the first 12 days of exposure with prolonged exposure time a gradual recovery 12 21 days and even better performance 21 27 days in ad were observed the recovery performance of ad was mainly attributed to nzvi enhanced membrane rigidity via forming siderite and vivianite on the outer surface of cells protecting anaerobes against nzvi induced toxicity at the end of 27 days exposure the significantly increased amount of conductive magnetite simulated direct interspecies electron transfer among syntrophic partners improving ch4 production metagenomic analysis further revealed that microbial cells gradually adapted to the aging of nzvi by upregulating functional genes related to chemotaxis flagella conductive pili and riboflavin biosynthesis in which electron transfer networks likely thrived and the cooperative behaviors between consortium members were promoted these results unveiled the significance of nzvi aging on its biological effects toward multiple microbial communities and provided fundamental insights into the long term fates and risks of nzvi for in situ applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoscale zero valent iron aging products methanogenesis ferroptosis like death electron transfer networks dynamic responses data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to its intrinsic high reactivity large surface areas and environmental friendliness nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been intensively used for in situ environmental remediation over the past decades xu et al 2020a 2020b phenrat et al 2009 on the other hand as a kind of nanoparticle nzvi has attracted much attention in terms of nanotoxicology and indeed the adverse effects of nzvi on aquatic organisms microorganisms and mammalian cells have been widely documented chen et al 2012 kotchaplai et al 2017 disruption of cell membrane structures dna damage and apoptosis related to the production of reactive oxygen species ros are potential toxicity mechanisms of nzvi in a broad range of microbes lee et al 2008 yang et al 2013 however the majority of current studies have focused on the short term effects of nzvi on pure cultures in long term application nzvi certainly oxidizes over time i e ages which would likely change its bioavailability and toxicity phenrat et al 2009 chen et al 2012 several in vitro studies have shown that the bactericidal effect of pristine nzvi is greater than that of aged nzvi or nanoscale iron oxides lee et al 2008 auffan et al 2008 moreover some bacteria preferentially thrive by utilizing semi conductive iron minerals for respiration in natural environments kato et al 2010 2012 thus the biological effects of nzvi either toxic or beneficial to microbial communities are supposedly associated with its aging process unfortunately to date the causal mechanisms linking the long term transformation of nzvi with its biological effects are not yet defined anaerobic digestion ad is considered to be the most widely used and cost effective technology for high strength wastewater treatment and renewable energy recovery li et al 2019 recently nzvi was reported to be a promising candidate for elevating methane production in ad improving the hydrolysis acidification steps and or promoting the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm process feng et al 2014 he et al 2017 nevertheless the inhibition of methanogenesis was also observed due to the destroyed cell integrity and the rapid h2 accumulation caused by nzvi dissolution yang et al 2013 such contradictory effects of nzvi in ad may derive from the complex interactions between nzvi and microbial aggregates which would not only alter nzvi reactivity but also affect the physiological status of cells auffan et al 2008 jin et al 2015 for example the interactions of nzvi with extracellular polymeric substances epss could reduce its inhibition of the ad process by avoiding the fast accumulation of h2 and restricting damage to cell integrity he et al 2020 moreover a rebound in cell number was observed after prolonged exposure to nzvi which is attributed to the decreased membrane fluidizing effect of fatty acids that hindering the interactions between cells and nzvi kotchaplai et al 2017 however previous studies mainly focused on the responsive mechanism of microbial cells at the single or sequential nzvi exposure endpoints and neglected the dynamic transformation processes of nzvi during long term incubation unlike most aging studies of nzvi undertaken in pure water or simplified simulation conditions pullin et al 2017 sarathy et al 2008 limited research in terms of the transformation of nzvi has been conducted in ad where more complex microbial communities are involved which are closely correlated with the performance of methanogenesis four stages namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis are predominantly involved in canonical ad in which syntrophic acetogenesis often governs the overall rate of anaerobic digestion process due to the slow and indirect way of interspecies electron transfer iet via h2 acetate huang et al 2016 rotaru et al 2014 in contrast as a faster and more specific electron transfer pathway direct iet diet in which species exchange electrons through electrical connections including conductive pili cytochromes cyt and iron minerals was demonstrated to be an alternative to iet in anaerobic methane producing communities lovley 2017 shi et al 2016 in comparison to iet diet can provide more energy benefits for syntrophic partners and accelerate reaction rate finally enhancing methane production lovley 2017 the transformation of nzvi might boost methane production since some aging products especially the magnetite were conductive and probably participated in diet kato et al 2010 suanon et al 2016 li et al 2015 in addition supplementation with nzvi or nanoscale iron oxides could biochemically improve the electron transfer by mediating electron transfer chain activity and the biosynthesis of fluvic acid in epss he et al 2020 you et al 2021 consequently the transformation of nzvi may thrive in electron transfer networks which affected the cooperative behaviors between consortium members and further facilitated methanogenesis kato et al 2012 you et al 2021 however there is still a lack of detailed studies demonstrating diet in syntrophic communities during the aging of nzvi in ad in this study we aimed to investigate the dynamic relationships between transformation processes and biological effects of nzvi in ad with an emphasize on the potential diet stimulation mechanism for methanogenesis during nzvi aging to achieve this goal the performance of ads was consecutively estimated during long term exposure to nzvi simultaneously the aging products of nzvi as well as their interactions with anaerobes at different operation stages were characterized through multiple spectrum analysis and electron microscopy images the dynamics of functional gene regulation microbial metabolism and electron transfer potential were further quantified to explore the adaptative strategy of anaerobes in response to nzvi aging 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic reactor operation and nzvi exposure experiments anaerobic sequencing batch reactors ansbrs with a working volume of 4 l fig s1a were constructed to culture anaerobic sludge taken from the ad of jiangxinzhou municipal wastewater treatment plant nanjing china the accumulation and cultivation processes were performed with the injection of synthetic wastewater sw and 17 19 g volatile solids vs l into ansbrs a sw with glucose nh4cl and kh2po4 as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources was employed and the specific components of sw are provided in table s1 details about the ansbr operation are described in test s1 in supporting information si when the chemical oxygen demand cod removal and ch4 production reached steady state nzvi exposure experiments were conducted by inoculating the seed sludge from ansbrs three groups namely r1 r3 were set up in 250 ml serum bottles equipped with rubber stoppers fig s1b and each group was run in triplicate fig s1c first 116 ml of seed sludge was added to r1 mono microbes bio system and r2 bio nzvi system followed by injection of 84 ml sw resulting in a final vs of 10 g l then 1 g of commercially purchased nzvi powder details in test s2 was added to r2 with a ratio of iron vs g g of 0 50 which was suggested to be optimized value for pollutant removal coupled with methane production huang et al 2016 suanon et al 2016 pan et al 2019 the culturing medium in r1 and r2 was freshly prepared and renewed every three days to supply nutrient he et al 2017 given that almost all of the added nzvi was adsorbed onto sludge nzvi was not further added after the initial injection he et al 2017 in addition to serve as the control of mono nzvi only 1 g nzvi and 200 ml sw were added to r3 mono nzvi system which was operated under the same protocols as r2 the r1 r3 reactors were pre aerated with high purity ar capped with rubber stoppers and immediately sealed with aluminum caps after that all the reactors were placed in a water bath oscillator for 27 days 200 rpm 35 1 c during the long term exposure period the biogas water sludge and iron related samples were carefully collected at different time intervals table s2 using gas tight collection bags and airtight syringes in an ar atmosphere it s noted that the collected sludge was washed with ar prepared phosphate buffer solution containing 0 9 nacl to remove the loosely adsorbed substance prior to measurement finally the collected iron related samples were dried under nitrogen frozen in liquid n2 and immediately transferred to the instruments for further characterization 2 2 characterization and analysis of nzvi and iron speciation after aging for 0 9 18 and 27 days the precipitates in r2 and r3 were subjected to iron oxides identification by combining powder x ray diffraction xrd smartlab 9 kw 10 80 2 min and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo escalab 250xi according to previous studies you et al 2021 kumar et al 2014 in particular the samples for xrd measurements were premixed with glycerol and then mounted on a silica plate covered with kapton film to reduce the effects of oxygen kumar et al 2014 bae and hanna 2015 the room temperature magnetic properties of nzvi at different aging times were measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm mpms xl 7 under a he atmosphere to quantitatively describe the transformation of nzvi fe speciation in r2 was further measured by x ray absorption spectroscopy xas in the 1w1b beamline of the beijing synchrotron radiation facility bsrf beijing china the details for x ray absorption near edge structure xanes measurement have been previously reported and are also described in test s3 li et al 2018 a range of iron reference compounds including iron fe0 siderite feco3 goethite α feooh vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o magnetite fe3o4 hematite α fe2o3 maghemite γ fe2o3 and wustite feo were selected to represent the possible aging products of nzvi based on the results of xrd and xps figs s4 s7 and related studies li et al 2018 he et al 2016 wu et al 2015 all collected spectra were normalized and background corrected with the standard features fe xanes 20 to 50 e ev spectra were further analyzed by linear combination fit lcf using athena software for each sample the fitting of reference compounds with the lowest residual parameter was chosen as the most likely set of components li et al 2018 2 3 dna extraction microbial community and metagenomic sequencing to evaluate the dynamic succession of microbes in response to nzvi the sludge samples in r2 were collected for metagenomic sequencing at days 0 9 18 and 27 dna was extracted from collected samples using the fastdna soil kit mp biomedicals ca usa the primers 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 were applied to amplify the hypervariable v4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16s rdna gene and sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq platform illumina usa zhang et al 2020 in addition an aliquot of prepared dna samples was sent to wekemo tech co ltd shenzhen china for library preparation and shotgun metagenomics sequencing the concentration purity and integrity of dna were determined using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer and gel electrophoresis a total of 1 μg dna per sample was used as input material for the library construction details of the library construction as well as the subsequent sequencing and genome assembly of dna samples are available in test s4 2 4 other analytical methods and statistical analysis the amounts of ch4 and h2 in the biogas were determined daily by gas chromatography gc shimadzu equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd following previously described procedure yang et al 2013 at intervals of 3 days aliquots 60 ml of liquid supernatant were taken from r1 and r2 for measurements of the cod volatile fatty acids vfas and dissolved iron according to standard methods at the end of 27 days operation the residual fe content of iron related precipitates in r1 and r2 was determined using acid digestion followed by h2 quantification liu and lowry 2006 after exposure to nzvi for 0 9 18 and 27 days the surface topography and key element distribution of sludge samples in r2 were observed through scanning electron microscopy sem su8010 equipped with electron dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds bruker nano germany the section morphology and viability of microbes were imaged using transmission electron microscopy tem h 7650 and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm olympus fv1200 the electrochemical redox and resistance behavior of sludge samples was obtained using cyclic voltammetry cv with a chi760e workstation chenhua instrument china the cell membrane fluidity state of anaerobes was assessed using 1 6 diphenyl 1 3 5 hexatriene kotchaplai et al 2017 changes in membrane integrity following nzvi treatment were detected using a lactate dehydrogenase ldh assay kit jiancheng bioengineering co ltd according to the protocol specified by manufacturer the levels of glutathione were assayed with reduced glutathione gsh and oxidized glutathione gssg assay kits beyotime biotechnology in addition the epss in r2 were extracted as previously described and the fluorescence compositions were further analyzed through a three dimensional excitation emission 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 fl hitachi japan coupled with the fluorescence region integration fri technique you et al 2017 detailed information about above measurements is provided in tests s5 s9 all samples were analyzed at least in triplicate and the data are normally represented as mean standard deviation statistical analysis was tested by performing one way analysis of variance anova followed by a least significant difference post hoc test spss v 22 0 with p 0 05 defined as significant you et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 chronic effects of nzvi on the performance of ad cod removal and ch4 production are two decisive indicators that reflect the biological effects of nzvi on ad fig 1 a showed that the cod removal efficiency in r1 fluctuated between 65 61 and 80 56 with an average value of 74 63 during the whole exposure period after the addition of nzvi and 12 days of operation the average cod removal efficiency decreased to 50 98 indicating overall deterioration in the effluent performance in r2 after that a gradual recovery to 80 63 at day 27 was observed in r2 these results might be attributed to the alleviatory inhibition of nzvi after aging and the adaptive responses of microbes in ad chen et al 2012 kotchaplai et al 2017 the ch4 yield in fig 1b showed a trend similar to that of cod removal after exposure to nzvi indicating that glucose was mainly degraded into ch4 by syntrophic communities of anaerobic bacteria and archaea with the addition of nzvi the ch4 yield was inhibited during the first 12 days which was consistent with yang et al 2013 nevertheless as exposure time further increased the ch4 yield in r2 increased to 123 24 of that in r1 after operation for 27 days the dual effects of nzvi on methanogenesis were time dependent and three stages including inhibition 0 12 days recovery 12 21 days and promotion 21 27 days were defined here the composition of vfas provides information on the hydrolytic acidogenic effluent to determine its suitability for methanogenesis feng et al 2014 in comparison to that of bio system the addition of nzvi increased the total amount of vfas in effluent during the first 12 days of operation whereas the accumulated vfas dropped from 1162 to 561 mg l after exposure for 27 days fig 1c although the total vfas content showed no significant difference between r1 and r2 at the end of 27 days the proportion of acetate was significantly enhanced with the addition of nzvi fig 1c this suggested that chronic exposure to nzvi could optimize the compositions of vfas and create a suitable substrate environment for methanogenic processes feng et al 2014 to track the metabolic processes of glucose in ad a mass balance based on cod was further calculated and shown in fig s2 in bio system 17 77 of glucose was degraded into vfas and 64 97 was eventually converted into ch4 with the average production of 156 91 ml g cod during the 27 days of operation fig 1b in bio nzvi system the vfas accumulated and accounted for 43 30 after 12 days of operation while the ch4 production was significantly decreased to 128 67 ml g cod however with prolonged exposure time to 27 days the accumulated vfas recovered to 16 79 and 77 00 of glucose was efficiently converted into ch4 with the production of 185 94 ml g cod these results further confirmed the dual effects of nzvi on methanogenesis with respect to the accumulation of vfas and inhibition of ch4 in the initial exposure period whereas a recovery and even promotion of ch4 production after the long term operation the extra release of h2 caused by nzvi oxidation fe 2h2o h2 fe2 2oh could stimulate the hm process whereas a rapid h2 shock led to inhibition of methanogenesis yang et al 2013 he et al 2017 as shown in fig 1d a sharp accumulation of h2 that virtually resulted from the dissolution of nzvi in sw was observed in the first 3 days of operation which might create a h2 shock and further lead to a temporary inhibition of methane yield huang et al 2016 with prolonged exposure time the h2 released by nzvi gradually slowed down due to the limitation of its intrinsic reaction kinetics xu et al 2020a 2020b however the h2 production in bio nzvi system was much lower than that in mono nzvi system and almost no h2 was detected after operation for 21 days the decreased h2 production in bio nzvi system may be explained through one and or a combination of the following processes he et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 i the interactions between anaerobes and nzvi could protect nzvi from excessive corrosion reducing the release of h2 from nzvi oxidation ii since a long period of nzvi oxidation producing h2 generally occurred in the presence of microbes a shift toward the hm pathway stimulated h2 consumption and synergistically contributed to the enhancement of ch4 yield fig 1b after operation for 21 days the concentration of dissolved iron in the effluent was further determined as shown in fig s3a to verify the oxidation reaction of nzvi in ad the amount of dissolved iron in mono nzvi system showed trends similar to those of h2 production fig 1d and only ca 5 20 of nzvi was dissolved as iron cations because of surface deactivation bae and hanna 2015 in comparison a significantly lower concentration of dissolved iron in bio nzvi system was observed in the first 6 days of operation owing to the strong adsorbability of sludge he et al 2017 lee et al 2008 reported that the bactericidal effect of nzvi was mainly caused by dissolved iron as a result the dissolved iron adsorbed by sludge might be toxic to microbes and inhibit methanogenesis fig 1b after exposure for 9 days the absorption of dissolved iron in sludge may have reached equilibrium and a comparable amount of dissolved iron was obtained in mono nzvi and bio nzvi systems in contrast to the lower h2 production the dissolved iron concentration in bio nzvi system was higher than that in mono nzvi system after operation for 15 days given the reduced oxidation rate of nzvi in the presence of anaerobes zhang et al 2018 the increased iron cations were likely attributed to the active redox of iron corrosion products releasing dissolved iron under the action of either microbial cell surface oxidoreductase or cell released redox metabolites wang and waite 2010 weber et al 2006 indeed a strikingly increased solubility of iron through the formation of iron soluble microbial product smp complexes secreted by anaerobes was previously confirmed by wang et al 2020 accordingly the decreased fluorescence intensity in the smp region obtained from epss analysis table s3 indicated the formation of iron smp complexes after exposure to nzvi the regulatory roles of anaerobes in nzvi transformation might alter its bioavailability and toxicity which is further investigated in the following section 3 2 transformation of nzvi in the presence and absence of anaerobes to identify the possible transformation process of nzvi in bio nzvi and mono nzvi systems the crystalline species and valance states of nzvi aging products were characterized according to the xrd patterns fe0 was the main crystalline species of nzvi without any treatment fig s4a confirming the high quality of nzvi used here as nzvi aged in sw fig s4b the peak intensity of iron dramatically decreased along with increases in the intensities of siderite and vivianite which were probably formed via the complexation of iron with nahco3 buffer and k2hpo4 in sw the formation of siderite and vivianite in iron conditioned sludge reactors was generally in accord with the deductions of other investigators wu et al 2015 wilfert et al 2016 furthermore after aging for 27 days a stronger intensity of fe0 in bio nzvi system was obtained in comparison to mono nzvi system fig s4c whereas the aging products of nzvi during incubation with anaerobes became more complex with the formation of additional lipscombite feal po4 o and magnetite the higher amount of residual fe0 in bio nzvi system fig s3b was further confirmed by indirectly measuring the h2 evolution during the acidification of iron related precipitates liu and lowry 2006 in addition the remaining iron species in the presence of microbes were considered to most likely be present as magnetite and green rust as previously reported by jin et al 2015 the fe 2p o 1 s and c 1 s xps patterns in fig s5 s7 combined with the corresponding semiqualitative parameters in table s4 s5 further verified the xrd results these analyses suggested that a reduced oxidation of nzvi but a more active transformation of aging products occurred under the action of anaerobes corresponding to the variations of h2 release fig 1d and iron dissolution fig s3 since the transformation of nzvi was accompanied by the exchange of electrons the active redox of electron shuttles produced from nzvi aging products might accelerate electron transfer between syntrophic communities and facilitate the recovery of ch4 yield lovley 2017 given the limitations of xrd and xps in exactly identifying iron oxides and oxy hydroxides auffan et al 2008 kumar et al 2014 fe k edge xanes spectroscopy combined with lcf analyses were further performed to quantitatively examine fe speciation in bio nzvi system as a function of exposure time fig 2 and table s6 initially iron was absolutely dominant with a relative percentage of 90 9 fig 2a consistent with the xrd and xps results after incubation for 9 days fig 2b the relative percentage of iron decreased to 57 0 along with oxidation to siderite 19 5 and goethite 17 0 with a prolonged exposure time for 18 days fig 2c siderite and vivianite became the main products and each accounted for a relative percentage above 30 0 simultaneously considering the recovery performance of the ad during this period the formation of siderite and vivianite might be an important contributor to the toxicity reduction of nzvi through their deposition on the surface of anaerobes that blocked nzvi from entering into cell membrane kotchaplai et al 2017 auffan et al 2008 this inference is further demonstrated by electron microscopy images in the next section figs 3 and s11 nevertheless after operation for 27 days fig 2d the amounts of siderite and vivianite decreased substantially while the relative percentage of magnetite significantly increased to 25 1 indicating the transformation of siderite and vivianite to magnetite the room temperature magnetic hysteresis loops of nzvi aging products further confirmed the formation of magnetite in bio nzvi system at the end of 27 days of operation fig s8 previous studies have found that microbes could use conductive magnetite as conduits of electrons through supplementation with different standard products of iron oxide resulting in efficient diet and increased rates of methane production kato et al 2010 lovley 2017 li et al 2015 thus it is reasonable to suggest that the formation of magnetite might be an imported key aging product of nzvi that contributing to the promotion of diet for syntrophic methane production and the improvement in the performance of ad after 27 days of incubation as recently reported yin et al 2018 the x ray and magnetic evidence indicated that nzvi was likely to transform via the fe0 feco3 fe po4 fe3o4 route during 27 days of incubation in ad and the different aging products of nzvi at different exposure stages might be relevant to the time dependent performance of ad more direct evidence linking the transformation process of nzvi and its biological effects would be further provided by investigating the interplay between anaerobes and nzvi aging products using high resolution microscopy 3 3 interactions between the aging products of nzvi and anaerobes at different exposure stages regardless of the negative or positive roles of nzvi establishing the dynamic interactions with anaerobes were essential to reveal underlying mechanisms of biological effects during nzvi aging tem images of anaerobes treated with nzvi at different exposure stages are illustrated in fig 3 compared to the mono microbes fig 3a a1 the 9 day treated anaerobes showed a large number of dark substances located inside cell wall and within cytoplasm fig 3b b1 because of the high electron density of iron the dark substances were identified as iron related products kotchaplai et al 2017 auffan et al 2008 which was also demonstrated by the eds results fig 3b2 and table s7 moreover the disruption of cell membranes fig 3b1 as well as the deformation of rod shaped anaerobes fig s9b b1 were observed probably resulting from the cellular internalization of nzvi lee et al 2008 also reported that nzvi could damage the cell membrane and enter the cytoplasm due to the reductive decomposition of functional groups in protein and lipopolysaccharides of the outer membranes accordingly during the first 9 days of exposure the negative effects of nzvi on the cell membrane resulted in anaerobe deactivation fig s10 and methanogenic inhibition fig 1 b in contrast to the cellular internalization of nzvi abundant nzvi and iron oxides clustered and covered the outer surface of cell membrane after 18 days of exposure fig 3cc2 combined with the identified aging products in fig 2c these iron oxides were preliminarily considered as vivianite and siderite which was in line with the element composition in table s7 furthermore after exposure for 18 days the distribution of fe p c and o on the surface of anaerobes fig s11c1 showed a uniform mapping pattern confirming that the generated vivianite and siderite were mainly located outside of the cell membrane since the loosely precipitated siderite and vivianite were washed away in preparing sem samples those tightly attached to microbial cells likely increased the rigidity of the cell membrane which was also demonstrated by the increased fluorescent anisotropy of sludge after exposure to nzvi for 18 days fig s12 kotchaplai et al 2017 proposed that cells increased their tolerance to nzvi exposure by increasing membrane rigidity to reduce their interactions with nanoparticles thus the attached vivianite and siderite probably led to increased membrane rigidity against nzvi induced membrane damage contributing to the rebound growth of anaerobes fig s10 and the recovery performance of the ad fig 1 as the exposure time increased to 27 days the viability of cells in ad began approaching the unexposed level at day 0 fig s10 and intact structured cells surrounded by abundant eps were intuitively observed fig s9d d1 moreover in some parts in fig 3d d1 referring to the red dotted circles dark conduits which mainly consisted of magnetite as confirmed by spectroscopic fig 2d and fig s4c magnetic fig s8 and microscopic fig 3d d2 and table s7 evidence directly connected with microbial cells notably the distribution of fe was solely in line with that of o after exposure for 27 days fig s11d1 which was probably attributed to the generation of magnetite at the surface of cells electrical connections via conductive magnetite promoted long distance electron transfer between microbial cells resulting in efficient diet and cooperative catabolism and further facilitating better bioenergy performance i e ch4 kato et al 2012 lovley 2017 as a consequence the extracellular connection by conductive magnetite participated in diet probably contributing to the enhanced ch4 production however whether methanogens are capable of using extracellularly derived electrons for ch4 production needs to be further validated by metagenomics analysis 3 4 regulation mechanism of anaerobes in response to the aging of nzvi it is well known that almost all the life activities of microorganisms including cell death and adaptation to environmental stress are fundamentally regulated by functional genes duan et al 2021 to further unravel the reasons for the distinct biological effects of nzvi aging the functional genes involved in iron related cell processes were determined based on metagenomics analysis 3 4 1 ferroptosis like death induced by nzvi after short term exposure it is evident that after 9 days of exposure nzvi could enter the cytoplasm fig 3b and severely inhibited microbial viability fig s10 generally the production of intracellular ros by fenton or haber weiss reactions is accepted as the primary toxicity mechanism of nzvi to a broad range of microbes he et al 2017 seo et al 2014 indeed the genes encoding superoxide dismutase sod2 fe mn family were significantly decreased after exposure to nzvi for 9 days fig s13 indicating the increased production of intracellular ros the results of ldh release assay fig s14a further confirmed the disruption of bacterial membrane integrity that probably resulted from lipid peroxidation via nzvi induced ros ma et al 2022 which is consistent with the tem images in fig 3b the key hallmark of iron dependent lipid peroxidation in bacteria is the same as that of ferroptosis which is a novel form of programmed cell death in mammalian cells ma et al 2022 doll and conrad 2017 recently emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis like death is appreciated as likely one of the most widespread and ancient forms of death in diverse species in particular for ros regulated antibacterial mechanism of metal nanomaterials shen et al 2020 conrad et al 2018 thus we hypothesized ferroptosis like death fig 4 a was responsible for the decreased viability of anaerobes after short term exposure to nzvi in addition to iron enrichment ros production and membrane damage the gsh that participated in the antioxidant pathway is vital to scavenge lipid peroxidation and the ratio between gsh and gssg is a promising predictor of ferroptosis like bacterial death ma et al 2022 shen et al 2020 as expected the gsh gssg ratio fig s14b was markedly decreased after exposure to nzvi for 9 days indicating that gsh was depleted and the balance of glutathione was disrupted furthermore the gene gclc involved in conversion of cysteine to gsh was significantly downregulated fig 4a and b contributing to gsh depletion moreover the genes speg and ascl encoding for the biosynthesis of phospholipid hydroperoxides ploohs were markedly upregulated after exposure for 9 days the accumulated ploohs that could not be reduced via the gsh directed cells to undergo ferroptosis like death ma et al 2022 shen et al 2020 conrad et al 2018 additionally a generally accepted iron induced fenton reaction was accelerated as a result of the enhancement of intracellular labile fe2 pool mediated by steap3 and hmox1 doll and conrad 2017 in summary the above results clearly proved that after 9 days of incubation nzvi induced bacterial death in ad with ferroptosis like hallmarks including iron enrichment lipid peroxidation membrane damage and gsh depletion ma et al 2022 shen et al 2020 to further confirm this ferrostatin 1 fer 1 a typical ferroptosis inhibitor miotto et al 2020 was added together with nzvi into ad for 9 days incubation the clsm images fig s15 visually showed attenuated bacterial death caused by nzvi in the presence of fer 1compared with the only nzvi exposure owing to the anti ferroptotic activity of fer 1 shen et al 2020 miotto et al 2020 therefore it was concluded that ferroptosis like death was responsible for nzvi induced toxicity after short term exposure for 9 days which inevitably inhibited the microbial activity of methanogenesis 3 4 2 detoxification mechanism and adaptative strategy of anaerobes with prolonged aging time although nzvi enhanced membrane rigidity was proven to alleviate the toxicity of nzvi fig 3 and fig s10 the entry of a small amount of nzvi or free iron into the membrane might cause fatal injuries seo et al 2014 lee et al 2008 since the translocation of iron across the outer membrane is crucial to control intercellular iron uptake köster 2001 the genes encoding the transmembrane protein of mineral ions metallic cations and iron siderophores were assessed as shown in fig 4c it is noteworthy that all the identified genes involved in iron related transporters were dramatically downregulated with prolongation of exposure time tending to avoid damage from cellular free iron in addition the genes encoding phosphate transporters pstabcs were significantly upregulated which facilitated the uptake of po4 3 and further eliminated the intracellular free iron by chelation the reaction of iron with po4 3 is actually a common and important approach for p removal in ads he et al 2017 wilfert et al 2016 wang et al 2020 on the other hand the removal of iron by po4 3 especially those intracellular free iron might be a detoxification strategy for anaerobes in response to nzvi exposure which required more explorations in addition to iron related metabolism microbial chemotaxis the most active pathway with a relative abundance higher than 1 90 during the whole exposure stage was strongly affected by nzvi fig s16 chemotaxis is known as the biasing of movement toward environments that contain lower concentrations of toxic chemicals or higher concentrations of beneficial chemicals wadhams and armitage 2004 therefore it was not surprising to observe that the relative abundance of genes for both chemotaxis and flagellar assembly were decreased to avoid nzvi induced toxicity during the first 9days of exposure while they were significantly increased to cooperatively metabolize with the aging products of nzvi after 27 days of exposure fig 4d moreover the enhanced mobility increased the probability of anaerobes positioning themselves within the optimal portion to make use of conductive magnetite lin et al 2017 which further promoted diet for methanogenesis by regulating the expression of the above functional genes anaerobes adapted to nzvi exposure and gradually survived in iron rich but low toxicity environments with nzvi aging in ad 3 5 dynamic responses of syntrophic metabolism and electron transfer potential mediated by the aging products of nzvi the metabolism of glucose in ad generally undergoes acidification and methanation steps which are primarily driven by the syntrophic communities of acidogens and methanogens zhang et al 2020 both bacterial and archaeal phyla in bio nzvi system were detected during chronic exposure period fig 5 a microbial communities of sludge were dominated by bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria chloroflexi euryarchaeota and actinobacteria which are usually regarded as the core microbiota during hydrolysis acidification and methanation in ad duan et al 2021 except for actinobacteria the relative abundances of other dominant phyla slightly decreased after exposure to nzvi for 9 days moreover the numbers of effective sequences significantly dropped from 56 684 to 39 803 after 9 days of operation indicating that nzvi treatment mainly inhibited the total microbial populations as the exposure time increased to 27 days the relative abundance of bacteroidetes and firmicutes which are capable of converting organic matter to acetate co2 h2 as intermediates zhang et al 2020 increased from 18 91 and 17 12 to 24 65 and 24 33 respectively moreover the abundance of euryarchaeota a well known phylum for methanogens also increased from 6 75 to 13 06 the increased percentages of bacteroidetes firmicutes and euryarchaeota were beneficial for the conversion of glucose to ch4 after long term incubation with nzvi furthermore various anaerobes correlated with acidification and methanization were detected at genus level as illustrated in fig 5b as expected all the methanogenic archaea i e methanosaeta methanothrix methanobacterium methanobrevibacter methanosarcina methanomethylovorans and methanospirillum were suppressed after the first 9 days of exposure whereas their abundances gradually increased with prolonged exposure time to 27 days meanwhile most of the acidogenic bacteria e g longilinea clostridium levilinea proteiniphilum syntrophobacter and geobacter showed a similar tendency to methanogens zhang et al 2020 duan et al 2021 in particular the enriched geobacter which has been widely reported to participate in diet based metabolism during anaerobic methanogenesis was likely to stimulate methane production via conductive magnetite rotaru et al 2014 lovley 2017 shi et al 2016 thus long term incubation with nzvi showed time dependent effects on the abundances of key acidogens and methanogens which were relevant to the performance of ad to further shed light on the mechanisms involved in the impacts of nzvi aging on methanogenesis metagenomics analysis focusing on the specific functional genes involved in acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea was conducted as shown in fig 5c almost all the functional genes involved in glycolysis step 1 and pyruvate metabolism steps 2 5 were downregulated after exposure to nzvi for 9 days whereas high expression of those genes was observed as the exposure time increased to 27 days this suggested that nzvi had varying effects on the acidification process in ad as it aged resulting in the dynamic changes in cod removal fig 1a moreover the acetate transporter genes atoe and smct step 6 which are involved in transporting acetate produced from the acidogenic pathway to the outside of cell membrane duan et al 2021 changed consistently with those genes in acidification furthermore the activity of electron transport system ets step 7 reflected by the abundance of genes in nadh dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase cyt bc1 cyt c oxidase and atp synthase fig s17 showed a trend similar to that of the acidification steps 1 5 in response to nzvi aging these results indicated that the intracellular electrons and atp derived from glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism in acidogenic bacteria could be transferred to the cell membrane via membrane bound ets you et al 2021 based on the functional gene profiles in steps 1 7 the generation of acetate from glucose metabolism and the membrane bound ets were inhibited and thereafter promoted during 27 days of exposure which would potentially affect the cooperative metabolism with methanogenic archaea for methanogenesis in response to nzvi aging the pathways of aceticlastic methanogenesis am and hm which are accepted as two dominant pathways for ch4 production in ad were profiled according to a gene set constructed by methanogenic archaea fig 5d as a solute the produced acetate should be transported across the cell membrane of methanogenic archaea for aceticlastic reactions rotaru et al 2014 as expected the genes encoding for transmembrane transport of acetate step 10 including tc sss ntaa and ntab were suppressed after 9 days of exposure and then upregulated with the aging of nzvi consistent with the dynamic yield of acetate produced from acidogenic bacteria in this regard it was not surprising that methanogenic archaea genes corresponding to acetate kinase ack acetyl coa synthetase acs phosphate acetyltransferase pta and acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase cdhde involved in converting acetate to methyl h4mpt steps 11 12 were also time dependently expressed after chronic exposure to nzvi in addition a complete pathway for co2 reduction steps 16 20 was achieved and the abundances of genes related to formyl methanofuran dehydrogenase fwdabcdef formyl methanofuran h4mpt formyltransferase ftr methenyl h4mpt cyclohydrolase mch methylene h4mpt dehydrogenase mtdb 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase mer and the coenzyme f420 dependent dehydrogenase frhbg during long term incubation with nzvi were 0 45 0 90 times lower 9 days and 1 04 1 85 times higher 27 days than those in control 0 day duan et al 2021 notably the average abundances of genes involved in co2 reduction were much lower than those involved in the aceticlastic reaction indicating the dominant role of am in bio nzvi system for the common pathway steps 13 15 in both am and hm the gene abundance of tetrahydromethanopterin h4mpt s methyltransferase mtrah methyl com reductase mcra and k00400 com s s cob heterodisulfide reductase hdra2b2c2e and f420 nonreducing hydrogenase mvhade was depressed by nzvi after exposure for 9 days while significantly increased expression of these genes was observed with prolonged exposure time combining results of the methanogenic archaea gene set steps 10 20 it is clear that nzvi inhibited the am and hm pathways for methanogenesis after 9 days of operation as a result of ferroptosis like death resulting in poor ch4 yield while with the aging of nzvi for 27 days the enrichment of methanogenesis related functional genes especially in the hm pathway promoted ch4 production fig 1b nevertheless the upregulation of functional genes in the hm pathway certainly demands many electrons to complete co2 reduction which is the most direct route for electron consumption in a methanogenic environment rotaru et al 2014 furthermore the 27 day coculture with nzvi promoted acidification and ets activity leading to the release of abundant electrons fig 5c therefore both the electron donating and accepting processes were enhanced after exposure to nzvi for 27 days according to the methanogenic gene set however how to channel these electrons from acidogenic bacteria into methanogenic archaea that stimulate co2 reduction needs to be further explored 3 6 direct electron transfer networks for methanogenesis after long term exposure to nzvi the genes encoding type iv pili were upregulated after exposure to nzvi for 27 days fig s18c in particular the pila gene which generally codes for the structural protein of electrically conductive pili step 9 was highly enriched fig 5c rotaru et al 2014 previous studies have documented that methanogenic archaea can make direct electrical connections with geobacter species accepting electrons for co2 reduction via conductive pili rotaru et al 2014 summers et al 2010 thus the upregulation of the pila gene along with the enhanced electron donating and electron consuming species probably contributed to the diet enhanced co2 reduction of ch4 production furthermore as demonstrated above the extracellular connection by conductive magnetite was an alternative route to accelerate electron transfer step 8 in addition to conductive pili and magnetite mediated diet ubiquinone and riboflavin in epss play key roles in extracellular electron shuttling in most biogeochemical redox processes which is also favorable for electron long distance transfer he et al 2020 wang et al 2020 fig s19a showed that the abundance of genes encoding ubiquinone biosynthesis ubiacdefghix and coq7 was downregulated with the addition of nzvi conversely the genes for riboflavin biosynthesis were upregulated but the genes involved in riboflavin consumption decreased fig s19b leading to elevated riboflavin production in epss after exposure to nzvi for 27 days as revealed by the 3d eem results fig s20 and table s8 marsili et al 2008 demonstrated that riboflavin could transfer electrons from the cell surface to external acceptors by serving as a soluble redox shuttle accordingly the enhanced riboflavin in the epss was also likely to facilitate electron transfer between different species given that the reduced oxidation of nzvi fig s4 and fig s5 decreased the release of h2 the direct exchange of electrons mediated by conductive magnetite and pili as well as the riboflavin in the epss alleviated the need for interspecies h2 transfer this phenomenon could also explain the effective syntrophy between acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea which promoted the conversion of glucose to ch4 fig 5 although three diet pathways were demonstrated above microbes should preferentially use magnetite as conduits of electrons because the conductivities of metallic minerals are in general much higher than those of organic materials kato et al 2012 lovley 2017 indeed the anaerobic sludge after incubation with nzvi for 27 days exhibited excellent ohmic conductance with a sharp peak current of 21 08 μa cm 2 at the midpoint potential of 633 mv vs ag agcl fig s21 confirming efficient diet with the aging of nzvi the specific midpoint potential of 633 mv was probably attributed to the magnetite mediated diet in ad due to the typical voltammogram shape for microbes as well as a lower potential value than those of the conductive biological materials and abiotic iron minerals 580 mv 59 mv according to previous studies you et al 2021 weber et al 2006 wang et al 2020 fricke et al 2008 okamoto et al 2013 therefore the magnetite enhanced diet was proven to be dominant in the extracellular electron transfer contributing to the effective electron exchange between consortium members and promoting ch4 production fig 5 3 7 environmental implication the intrinsic high reactivity and large surface areas of nzvi have attracted extensive attention in terms of its application in groundwater remediation and wastewater treatment although the aging of nzvi reduces the reactivity for contaminant removal or the capacity for electrons donation it also appears to decrease the toxicity of nzvi phenrat et al 2009 here we established dynamic relationships between the aging processes and biological effects of nzvi in ad specifically a high toxicity of nzvi in ad occurred after exposure for 9 days since a large amount of reductive nzvi adsorbed by sludge led to lipid peroxidation of membrane and caused ferroptosis like death which inevitably reduced the performance of ad with prolonged exposure time to 18 days nzvi increasingly aged and formed siderite and vivianite covering the outer surface of microbial cells and fortifying the membrane rigidity which counteracted the toxicity of nzvi as the exposure time further increased to 27 days the magnetite acting as electron conduits connected the acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea promoting ch4 production these results suggested that prolonged exposure should be fully taken into account to accurately evaluate the performance of ad when operating with nzvi due to the adaptative strategy of anaerobes and diet simulation for methanogenesis with the aging of nzvi taking into consideration that ad is one of the few proven renewable energy biotechnologies with thousands of full scale plants worldwide li et al 2019 the coupling of anaerobes with nzvi aging products could have a broad impact for global bioenergy strategies however the overall impact should be assessed based on the application of these particles since the diverse and complex compositions e g so4 2 no3 in actual ad would affect the reactivity and fate of nzvi liu et al 2015 xu et al 2019 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the effects of nzvi on methanogenesis were time dependent which was attributed to the transformation of nzvi as well as the specific regulation of microbes in response to nzvi aging when operating ad with nzvi the nzvi induced ferroptosis like death to anaerobes could inhibit the methane production at initial exposure period whereas a recovery and promotion of methane production were achieved with the aging of nzvi as a result of the reinforced membrane rigidity and magnetite enhanced direct electron transfer networks meanwhile the microbial cells gradually adapted to the aging of nzvi by upregulating functional genes further facilitating cooperative behaviors for methanogenesis these findings indicated the remarkable potential for improving ad performance with the application of nzvi in the long run however the short term shock induced by nzvi toxicity remains of great concern besides the years long responses as well as the coupling mechanism of anaerobes with nzvi aging products in ad treating more complex wastes still need to be studied with the approach described here declaration of competing

14693,nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been extensively used for environmental remediation and wastewater treatment however the biological effects of nzvi remain unclear which is no doubt a result of the complexity of iron species and the dynamic succession of microbial community during nzvi aging here the aging effects of nzvi on methanogenesis in anaerobic digestion ad were consecutively investigated with an emphasis on deciphering the causal relationships between nzvi aging process and its biological effects the addition of nzvi in ad led to ferroptosis like death with hallmarks of iron dependent lipid peroxidation and glutathione gsh depletion which inhibited ch4 production during the first 12 days of exposure with prolonged exposure time a gradual recovery 12 21 days and even better performance 21 27 days in ad were observed the recovery performance of ad was mainly attributed to nzvi enhanced membrane rigidity via forming siderite and vivianite on the outer surface of cells protecting anaerobes against nzvi induced toxicity at the end of 27 days exposure the significantly increased amount of conductive magnetite simulated direct interspecies electron transfer among syntrophic partners improving ch4 production metagenomic analysis further revealed that microbial cells gradually adapted to the aging of nzvi by upregulating functional genes related to chemotaxis flagella conductive pili and riboflavin biosynthesis in which electron transfer networks likely thrived and the cooperative behaviors between consortium members were promoted these results unveiled the significance of nzvi aging on its biological effects toward multiple microbial communities and provided fundamental insights into the long term fates and risks of nzvi for in situ applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoscale zero valent iron aging products methanogenesis ferroptosis like death electron transfer networks dynamic responses data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to its intrinsic high reactivity large surface areas and environmental friendliness nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been intensively used for in situ environmental remediation over the past decades xu et al 2020a 2020b phenrat et al 2009 on the other hand as a kind of nanoparticle nzvi has attracted much attention in terms of nanotoxicology and indeed the adverse effects of nzvi on aquatic organisms microorganisms and mammalian cells have been widely documented chen et al 2012 kotchaplai et al 2017 disruption of cell membrane structures dna damage and apoptosis related to the production of reactive oxygen species ros are potential toxicity mechanisms of nzvi in a broad range of microbes lee et al 2008 yang et al 2013 however the majority of current studies have focused on the short term effects of nzvi on pure cultures in long term application nzvi certainly oxidizes over time i e ages which would likely change its bioavailability and toxicity phenrat et al 2009 chen et al 2012 several in vitro studies have shown that the bactericidal effect of pristine nzvi is greater than that of aged nzvi or nanoscale iron oxides lee et al 2008 auffan et al 2008 moreover some bacteria preferentially thrive by utilizing semi conductive iron minerals for respiration in natural environments kato et al 2010 2012 thus the biological effects of nzvi either toxic or beneficial to microbial communities are supposedly associated with its aging process unfortunately to date the causal mechanisms linking the long term transformation of nzvi with its biological effects are not yet defined anaerobic digestion ad is considered to be the most widely used and cost effective technology for high strength wastewater treatment and renewable energy recovery li et al 2019 recently nzvi was reported to be a promising candidate for elevating methane production in ad improving the hydrolysis acidification steps and or promoting the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm process feng et al 2014 he et al 2017 nevertheless the inhibition of methanogenesis was also observed due to the destroyed cell integrity and the rapid h2 accumulation caused by nzvi dissolution yang et al 2013 such contradictory effects of nzvi in ad may derive from the complex interactions between nzvi and microbial aggregates which would not only alter nzvi reactivity but also affect the physiological status of cells auffan et al 2008 jin et al 2015 for example the interactions of nzvi with extracellular polymeric substances epss could reduce its inhibition of the ad process by avoiding the fast accumulation of h2 and restricting damage to cell integrity he et al 2020 moreover a rebound in cell number was observed after prolonged exposure to nzvi which is attributed to the decreased membrane fluidizing effect of fatty acids that hindering the interactions between cells and nzvi kotchaplai et al 2017 however previous studies mainly focused on the responsive mechanism of microbial cells at the single or sequential nzvi exposure endpoints and neglected the dynamic transformation processes of nzvi during long term incubation unlike most aging studies of nzvi undertaken in pure water or simplified simulation conditions pullin et al 2017 sarathy et al 2008 limited research in terms of the transformation of nzvi has been conducted in ad where more complex microbial communities are involved which are closely correlated with the performance of methanogenesis four stages namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis are predominantly involved in canonical ad in which syntrophic acetogenesis often governs the overall rate of anaerobic digestion process due to the slow and indirect way of interspecies electron transfer iet via h2 acetate huang et al 2016 rotaru et al 2014 in contrast as a faster and more specific electron transfer pathway direct iet diet in which species exchange electrons through electrical connections including conductive pili cytochromes cyt and iron minerals was demonstrated to be an alternative to iet in anaerobic methane producing communities lovley 2017 shi et al 2016 in comparison to iet diet can provide more energy benefits for syntrophic partners and accelerate reaction rate finally enhancing methane production lovley 2017 the transformation of nzvi might boost methane production since some aging products especially the magnetite were conductive and probably participated in diet kato et al 2010 suanon et al 2016 li et al 2015 in addition supplementation with nzvi or nanoscale iron oxides could biochemically improve the electron transfer by mediating electron transfer chain activity and the biosynthesis of fluvic acid in epss he et al 2020 you et al 2021 consequently the transformation of nzvi may thrive in electron transfer networks which affected the cooperative behaviors between consortium members and further facilitated methanogenesis kato et al 2012 you et al 2021 however there is still a lack of detailed studies demonstrating diet in syntrophic communities during the aging of nzvi in ad in this study we aimed to investigate the dynamic relationships between transformation processes and biological effects of nzvi in ad with an emphasize on the potential diet stimulation mechanism for methanogenesis during nzvi aging to achieve this goal the performance of ads was consecutively estimated during long term exposure to nzvi simultaneously the aging products of nzvi as well as their interactions with anaerobes at different operation stages were characterized through multiple spectrum analysis and electron microscopy images the dynamics of functional gene regulation microbial metabolism and electron transfer potential were further quantified to explore the adaptative strategy of anaerobes in response to nzvi aging 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic reactor operation and nzvi exposure experiments anaerobic sequencing batch reactors ansbrs with a working volume of 4 l fig s1a were constructed to culture anaerobic sludge taken from the ad of jiangxinzhou municipal wastewater treatment plant nanjing china the accumulation and cultivation processes were performed with the injection of synthetic wastewater sw and 17 19 g volatile solids vs l into ansbrs a sw with glucose nh4cl and kh2po4 as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources was employed and the specific components of sw are provided in table s1 details about the ansbr operation are described in test s1 in supporting information si when the chemical oxygen demand cod removal and ch4 production reached steady state nzvi exposure experiments were conducted by inoculating the seed sludge from ansbrs three groups namely r1 r3 were set up in 250 ml serum bottles equipped with rubber stoppers fig s1b and each group was run in triplicate fig s1c first 116 ml of seed sludge was added to r1 mono microbes bio system and r2 bio nzvi system followed by injection of 84 ml sw resulting in a final vs of 10 g l then 1 g of commercially purchased nzvi powder details in test s2 was added to r2 with a ratio of iron vs g g of 0 50 which was suggested to be optimized value for pollutant removal coupled with methane production huang et al 2016 suanon et al 2016 pan et al 2019 the culturing medium in r1 and r2 was freshly prepared and renewed every three days to supply nutrient he et al 2017 given that almost all of the added nzvi was adsorbed onto sludge nzvi was not further added after the initial injection he et al 2017 in addition to serve as the control of mono nzvi only 1 g nzvi and 200 ml sw were added to r3 mono nzvi system which was operated under the same protocols as r2 the r1 r3 reactors were pre aerated with high purity ar capped with rubber stoppers and immediately sealed with aluminum caps after that all the reactors were placed in a water bath oscillator for 27 days 200 rpm 35 1 c during the long term exposure period the biogas water sludge and iron related samples were carefully collected at different time intervals table s2 using gas tight collection bags and airtight syringes in an ar atmosphere it s noted that the collected sludge was washed with ar prepared phosphate buffer solution containing 0 9 nacl to remove the loosely adsorbed substance prior to measurement finally the collected iron related samples were dried under nitrogen frozen in liquid n2 and immediately transferred to the instruments for further characterization 2 2 characterization and analysis of nzvi and iron speciation

mounted on a silica plate covered with kapton film to reduce the effects of oxygen kumar et al 2014 bae and hanna 2015 the room temperature magnetic properties of nzvi at different aging times were measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm mpms xl 7 under a he atmosphere to quantitatively describe the transformation of nzvi fe speciation in r2 was further measured by x ray absorption

fe2o3 maghemite γ fe2o3 and wustite feo were selected to represent the possible aging products of nzvi based on the results of xrd and xps figs s4 s7 and related studies li et al 2018 he et al 2016 wu

software for each sample the fitting of reference compounds with the lowest residual parameter was chosen as the most likely set of components li et al 2018 2 3 dna extraction microbial community and metagenomic sequencing to evaluate the dynamic succession of microbes in response to nzvi the sludge samples in r2 were collected for metagenomic sequencing at days 0 9 18 and 27 dna was extracted from collected samples using the fastdna soil kit mp biomedicals ca usa the primers 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 were applied to amplify the hypervariable v4

a thermal conductivity detector tcd following previously described procedure yang et al 2013 at intervals of 3 days aliquots 60 ml of liquid supernatant were taken from r1 and r2 for measurements of the cod volatile fatty acids vfas and dissolved iron according to standard methods at the end of 27 days operation the residual fe content of iron related precipitates in r1 and r2 was determined using acid digestion followed by h2 quantification liu and lowry 2006 after exposure to nzvi for 0 9 18 and 27 days the surface topography and key element distribution of sludge samples in r2 were observed through scanning electron microscopy sem su8010 equipped with electron dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds bruker nano germany the section morphology and viability of microbes were imaged using transmission electron microscopy tem h 7650 and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm olympus fv1200 the electrochemical redox and resistance behavior of sludge samples was obtained using cyclic voltammetry cv with a chi760e workstation chenhua instrument china the cell membrane fluidity state of anaerobes was assessed using 1 6 diphenyl 1 3 5 hexatriene kotchaplai et al 2017 changes in membrane integrity following nzvi treatment were detected using a lactate dehydrogenase ldh assay kit jiancheng bioengineering co ltd according to the protocol specified by manufacturer the levels of glutathione were assayed with reduced glutathione gsh and oxidized glutathione gssg assay kits beyotime biotechnology in addition the epss in r2 were extracted as previously described and the fluorescence compositions were further analyzed through a three dimensional excitation emission 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 fl hitachi japan coupled with the fluorescence region integration fri technique you et al 2017 detailed information about above measurements is provided in tests s5 s9 all samples were analyzed at least in triplicate and the data are normally represented as mean standard deviation statistical analysis was tested by performing one way analysis of variance anova followed by a least significant difference post hoc test spss v 22 0 with p 0 05 defined as significant you et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 chronic effects of nzvi on the performance of ad cod removal and ch4 production are two decisive indicators that reflect the biological effects of nzvi on ad fig 1 a showed that the cod removal efficiency in r1 fluctuated between 65 61 and 80 56 with an average value of 74 63 during the whole exposure period after the addition of nzvi and 12 days of operation the average cod removal efficiency decreased to 50 98 indicating overall deterioration in the effluent performance in r2 after that a gradual recovery to 80 63 at day 27 was observed in r2 these results might be attributed to the alleviatory inhibition of nzvi after aging and the adaptive responses of microbes in ad chen et al 2012 kotchaplai et al 2017 the ch4 yield in fig 1b showed a trend similar to that of cod removal after exposure to nzvi indicating that glucose was mainly degraded into ch4 by syntrophic communities of anaerobic bacteria and archaea with the addition of nzvi the ch4 yield was inhibited during the first 12 days which was consistent with yang et al 2013 nevertheless as exposure time further increased the ch4 yield in r2 increased to 123 24 of that in r1 after operation for 27 days the dual effects of nzvi on methanogenesis were time dependent and three stages including inhibition 0 12 days recovery 12 21 days and promotion 21 27 days were defined here the composition of vfas provides information on the hydrolytic acidogenic effluent to determine its suitability for methanogenesis feng et al 2014 in comparison to that of bio system the addition of nzvi increased the total amount of vfas in effluent during the first 12 days of operation whereas the accumulated vfas dropped from 1162 to 561 mg l after exposure for 27 days fig 1c although the total vfas content showed no significant difference between r1 and r2 at the end of 27 days the proportion of acetate was significantly enhanced with the addition of nzvi fig 1c this suggested that chronic exposure to nzvi could optimize the compositions of vfas and create a suitable substrate environment for methanogenic processes feng et al 2014 to track the metabolic processes of glucose in ad a mass balance based on cod was further calculated and shown in fig s2 in bio system 17 77 of glucose was degraded into vfas and 64 97 was eventually converted into ch4 with the average production of 156 91 ml g cod during the 27 days of operation fig 1b in bio nzvi system the vfas accumulated and accounted for 43 30 after 12 days of operation while the ch4 production was significantly decreased to 128 67 ml g cod however with prolonged exposure time to 27 days the accumulated vfas recovered to 16 79 and 77 00 of glucose was efficiently converted into ch4 with the production of 185 94 ml g cod these results further confirmed the dual effects of nzvi on methanogenesis with respect to the accumulation of vfas and inhibition of ch4 in the initial exposure period whereas a recovery and even promotion of ch4 production after the long term operation the extra release of h2 caused by nzvi oxidation fe 2h2o h2 fe2 2oh could stimulate the hm process whereas a rapid h2 shock led to inhibition of methanogenesis yang et al 2013 he et al 2017 as shown in fig 1d a sharp accumulation of h2 that virtually resulted from the dissolution of nzvi in sw was observed in the first 3 days of operation which might create a h2 shock and further lead to a temporary inhibition of methane yield huang et al 2016 with prolonged exposure time the h2 released by nzvi gradually slowed down due to the limitation of its intrinsic reaction kinetics xu et al 2020a 2020b however the h2 production in bio nzvi system was much lower than that in mono nzvi system and almost no h2 was detected after operation for 21 days the decreased h2 production in bio nzvi system may be explained through one and or a combination of the following processes he et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 i the interactions between anaerobes and nzvi could protect nzvi from excessive corrosion reducing the release of h2 from nzvi oxidation ii since a long period of nzvi oxidation producing h2 generally occurred in the presence of microbes a shift toward the hm pathway stimulated h2 consumption and synergistically contributed to the enhancement of ch4 yield fig 1b after operation for 21 days the concentration of dissolved iron in the effluent was further determined as shown in fig s3a to verify the oxidation reaction of nzvi in ad the amount of dissolved iron in mono nzvi system showed trends similar to those of h2 production fig 1d and only ca 5 20 of nzvi was dissolved as iron cations because of surface deactivation bae and hanna 2015 in comparison a significantly lower concentration of dissolved iron in bio nzvi system was observed in the first 6 days of operation owing to the strong adsorbability of sludge he et al 2017 lee et al 2008 reported that the bactericidal effect of nzvi was mainly caused by dissolved iron as a result the dissolved iron adsorbed by sludge might be toxic to microbes and inhibit methanogenesis fig 1b after exposure for 9 days the absorption of dissolved iron in sludge may have reached equilibrium and a comparable amount of dissolved iron was obtained in mono nzvi and bio nzvi systems in contrast to the lower h2 production the dissolved iron concentration in bio nzvi system was higher than that in mono nzvi system after operation for 15 days given the reduced oxidation rate of nzvi in the presence of anaerobes zhang et al 2018 the increased iron cations were likely attributed to the active redox of iron corrosion products releasing dissolved iron under the action of either microbial cell surface oxidoreductase or cell released redox metabolites wang and waite 2010 weber et al 2006 indeed a strikingly increased solubility of iron through the formation of iron soluble microbial product smp complexes secreted by anaerobes was previously confirmed by wang et al 2020 accordingly the decreased fluorescence intensity in the smp region obtained from epss analysis table s3 indicated the formation of iron smp complexes after exposure to nzvi the regulatory roles of anaerobes in nzvi transformation might alter its bioavailability and toxicity which is further investigated in the following section 3 2 transformation of nzvi in the presence and absence of anaerobes to identify the possible transformation process of nzvi in bio nzvi and mono nzvi systems the crystalline species and valance states of nzvi aging products were characterized according to the xrd patterns fe0 was the main crystalline species of nzvi without any treatment fig s4a confirming the high quality of nzvi used here as nzvi aged in sw fig s4b the peak intensity of iron dramatically decreased along with increases in the intensities of siderite and vivianite which were probably formed via the complexation of iron with nahco3 buffer and k2hpo4 in sw the formation of siderite and vivianite in iron conditioned sludge reactors was generally in accord with the deductions of other investigators wu et al 2015 wilfert et al 2016 furthermore after aging for 27 days a stronger intensity of fe0 in bio nzvi system was obtained in comparison to mono nzvi system fig s4c whereas the aging products of nzvi during incubation with anaerobes became more complex with the formation of additional lipscombite feal po4 o and magnetite the higher amount of residual fe0 in bio nzvi system fig s3b was further confirmed by indirectly measuring the h2 evolution during the acidification of iron related precipitates liu and lowry 2006 in addition the remaining iron species in the presence of microbes were considered to most likely be present as magnetite and green rust as previously reported by jin et al 2015 the fe 2p o 1 s and c 1 s xps patterns in fig s5 s7 combined with the corresponding semiqualitative parameters in table s4 s5 further verified the xrd results these analyses suggested that a reduced oxidation of nzvi but a more active transformation of aging products occurred under the action of anaerobes corresponding to the variations of h2 release fig 1d and iron dissolution fig s3 since the transformation of nzvi was accompanied by the exchange of electrons the active redox of electron shuttles produced from nzvi aging products might accelerate electron transfer between syntrophic communities and facilitate the recovery of ch4 yield lovley 2017 given the limitations of xrd and xps in exactly identifying iron oxides and oxy hydroxides auffan et al 2008 kumar et al 2014 fe k edge xanes spectroscopy combined with lcf analyses were further performed to quantitatively examine fe speciation in bio nzvi system as a function of exposure time fig 2 and table s6 initially iron was absolutely dominant with a relative percentage of 90 9 fig 2a consistent with the xrd and xps results after incubation for 9 days fig 2b the relative percentage of iron decreased to 57 0 along with oxidation to siderite 19 5 and goethite 17 0 with a prolonged exposure time for 18 days fig 2c siderite and vivianite became the main products and each accounted for a relative percentage above 30 0 simultaneously considering the recovery performance of the ad during this period the formation of siderite and vivianite might be an important contributor to the toxicity reduction of nzvi through their deposition on the surface of anaerobes that blocked nzvi from entering into cell membrane kotchaplai et al 2017 auffan et al 2008 this inference is further demonstrated by electron microscopy images in the next section figs 3 and s11 nevertheless after operation for 27 days fig 2d the amounts of siderite and vivianite decreased substantially while the relative percentage of magnetite significantly increased to 25 1 indicating the transformation of siderite and vivianite to magnetite the room temperature magnetic hysteresis loops of nzvi aging products further confirmed the formation of magnetite in bio nzvi system at the end of 27 days of operation fig s8 previous studies have found that microbes could use conductive magnetite as conduits of electrons through supplementation with different standard products of iron oxide resulting in efficient diet and increased rates of methane production kato et al 2010 lovley 2017 li et al 2015 thus it is reasonable to suggest that the formation of magnetite might be an imported key aging product of nzvi that contributing to the promotion of diet for syntrophic methane production and the improvement in the performance of ad after 27 days of incubation as recently reported yin et al 2018 the x ray and magnetic evidence indicated that nzvi was likely to transform via the fe0 feco3 fe po4 fe3o4 route during 27 days of incubation in ad and the different aging products of nzvi at different exposure stages might be relevant to the time dependent performance of ad more direct evidence linking the transformation process of nzvi and its biological effects would be further provided by investigating the interplay between anaerobes and nzvi aging products using high resolution microscopy 3 3 interactions between the aging products of nzvi and anaerobes at different exposure stages regardless of the negative or positive roles of nzvi establishing the dynamic interactions with anaerobes were essential to reveal underlying mechanisms of biological effects during nzvi aging tem images of anaerobes treated with nzvi at different exposure stages are illustrated in fig 3 compared to the mono microbes fig 3a a1 the 9 day treated anaerobes showed a large number of dark substances located inside cell wall and within cytoplasm fig 3b b1 because of the high electron density of iron the dark substances were identified as iron related products kotchaplai et al 2017 auffan et al 2008 which was also demonstrated by the eds results fig 3b2 and table s7 moreover the disruption of cell membranes fig 3b1 as well as the deformation of rod shaped anaerobes fig s9b b1 were observed probably resulting from the cellular internalization of nzvi lee et al 2008 also reported that nzvi could damage the cell membrane and enter the cytoplasm due to the reductive decomposition of functional groups in protein and lipopolysaccharides of the outer membranes accordingly during the first 9 days of exposure the negative effects of nzvi on the cell membrane resulted in anaerobe deactivation fig s10 and methanogenic inhibition fig 1 b in contrast to the cellular internalization of nzvi abundant nzvi and iron oxides clustered and covered the outer surface of cell membrane after 18 days of exposure fig 3cc2 combined with the identified aging products in fig 2c these iron oxides were preliminarily considered as vivianite and siderite which was in line with the element composition in table s7 furthermore after exposure for 18 days the distribution of fe p c and o on the surface of anaerobes fig s11c1 showed a uniform mapping pattern confirming that the generated vivianite and siderite were mainly located outside of the cell membrane since the loosely precipitated siderite and vivianite were washed away in preparing sem samples those tightly attached to microbial cells likely increased the rigidity of the cell membrane which was also demonstrated by the increased fluorescent anisotropy of sludge after exposure to nzvi for 18 days fig s12 kotchaplai et al 2017 proposed that cells increased their tolerance to nzvi exposure by increasing membrane rigidity to reduce their interactions with nanoparticles thus the attached vivianite and siderite probably led to increased membrane rigidity against nzvi induced membrane damage contributing to the rebound growth of anaerobes fig s10 and the recovery performance of the ad fig 1 as the exposure time increased to 27 days the viability of cells in ad began approaching the unexposed level at day 0 fig s10 and intact structured cells surrounded by abundant eps were intuitively observed fig s9d d1 moreover in some parts in fig 3d d1 referring to the red dotted circles dark conduits which mainly consisted of magnetite as confirmed by spectroscopic fig 2d and fig s4c magnetic fig s8 and microscopic fig 3d d2 and table s7 evidence directly connected with microbial cells notably the distribution of fe was solely in line with that of o after exposure for 27 days fig s11d1 which was probably attributed to the generation of magnetite at the surface of cells electrical connections via conductive magnetite promoted long distance electron transfer between microbial cells resulting in efficient diet and cooperative catabolism and further facilitating better bioenergy performance i e ch4 kato et al 2012 lovley 2017 as a consequence the extracellular connection by conductive magnetite participated in diet probably contributing to the enhanced ch4 production however whether methanogens are capable of using extracellularly derived electrons for ch4 production needs to be further validated by metagenomics analysis 3 4 regulation mechanism of anaerobes in response to the aging of nzvi it is well known that almost all the life activities of microorganisms including cell death and adaptation to environmental stress are fundamentally regulated by functional genes duan et al 2021 to further unravel the reasons for the distinct biological effects of nzvi aging the functional genes involved in iron related cell processes were determined based on metagenomics analysis 3 4 1 ferroptosis like death induced by nzvi after short term exposure it is evident that after 9 days of exposure nzvi could enter the cytoplasm fig 3b and severely inhibited microbial viability fig s10 generally the production of intracellular ros by fenton or haber weiss reactions is accepted as the primary toxicity mechanism of nzvi to a broad range of microbes he et al 2017 seo et al 2014 indeed the genes encoding superoxide dismutase sod2 fe mn family were significantly decreased after exposure to nzvi for 9 days fig s13 indicating the increased production of intracellular ros the results of ldh release assay fig s14a further confirmed the disruption of bacterial membrane integrity that probably resulted from lipid peroxidation via nzvi induced ros ma et al 2022 which is consistent with the tem images in fig 3b the key hallmark of iron dependent lipid peroxidation in bacteria is the same as that of ferroptosis which is a novel form of programmed cell death in mammalian cells ma et al 2022 doll and conrad 2017 recently emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis like death is appreciated as likely one of the most widespread and ancient forms of death in diverse species in particular for ros regulated antibacterial mechanism of metal nanomaterials shen et al 2020 conrad et al 2018 thus we hypothesized ferroptosis like death fig 4 a was responsible for the decreased viability of anaerobes after short term exposure to nzvi in addition to iron enrichment ros production and membrane damage the gsh that participated in the antioxidant pathway is vital to scavenge lipid peroxidation and the ratio between gsh and gssg is a promising predictor of ferroptosis like bacterial death ma et al 2022 shen et al 2020 as expected the gsh gssg ratio fig s14b was markedly decreased after exposure to nzvi for 9 days indicating that gsh was depleted and the balance of glutathione was disrupted furthermore the gene gclc involved in conversion of cysteine to gsh was significantly downregulated fig 4a and b contributing to gsh depletion moreover the genes speg and ascl encoding for the biosynthesis of phospholipid hydroperoxides ploohs were markedly upregulated after exposure for 9 days the accumulated ploohs that could not be reduced via the gsh directed cells to undergo ferroptosis like death ma et al 2022 shen et al 2020 conrad et al 2018 additionally a generally accepted iron induced fenton reaction was accelerated as a result of the enhancement of intracellular labile fe2 pool mediated by steap3 and hmox1 doll and conrad 2017 in summary the above results clearly proved that after 9 days of incubation nzvi induced bacterial death in ad with ferroptosis like hallmarks including iron enrichment lipid peroxidation membrane damage and gsh depletion ma et al 2022 shen et al 2020 to further confirm this ferrostatin 1 fer 1 a typical ferroptosis inhibitor miotto et al 2020 was added together with nzvi into ad for 9 days incubation the clsm images fig s15 visually showed attenuated bacterial death caused by nzvi in the presence of fer 1compared with the only nzvi exposure owing to the anti ferroptotic activity of fer 1 shen et al 2020 miotto et al 2020 therefore it was concluded that ferroptosis like death was responsible for nzvi induced toxicity after short term exposure for 9 days which inevitably inhibited the microbial activity of methanogenesis 3 4 2 detoxification mechanism and adaptative strategy of anaerobes with prolonged aging time although nzvi enhanced membrane rigidity was proven to alleviate the toxicity of nzvi fig 3 and fig s10 the entry of a small amount of nzvi or free iron into the membrane might cause fatal injuries seo et al 2014 lee et al 2008 since the translocation of iron across the outer membrane is crucial to control intercellular iron uptake köster 2001 the genes encoding the transmembrane protein of mineral ions metallic cations and iron siderophores were assessed as shown in fig 4c it is noteworthy that all the identified genes involved in iron related transporters were dramatically downregulated with prolongation of exposure time tending to avoid damage from cellular free iron in addition the genes encoding phosphate transporters pstabcs were significantly upregulated which facilitated the uptake of po4 3 and further eliminated the intracellular free iron by chelation the reaction of iron with po4 3 is actually a common and important approach for p removal in ads he et al 2017 wilfert et al 2016 wang et al 2020 on the other hand the removal of iron by po4 3 especially those intracellular free iron might be a detoxification strategy for anaerobes in response to nzvi exposure which required more explorations in addition to iron related metabolism microbial chemotaxis the most active pathway with a relative abundance higher than 1 90 during the whole exposure stage was strongly affected by nzvi fig s16 chemotaxis is known as the biasing of movement toward environments that contain lower concentrations of toxic chemicals or higher concentrations of beneficial chemicals wadhams and armitage 2004 therefore it was not surprising to observe that the relative abundance of genes for both chemotaxis and flagellar assembly were decreased to avoid nzvi induced toxicity during the first 9days of exposure while they were significantly increased to cooperatively metabolize with the aging products of nzvi after 27 days of exposure fig 4d moreover the enhanced mobility increased the probability of anaerobes positioning themselves within the optimal portion to make use of conductive magnetite lin et al 2017 which further promoted diet for methanogenesis by regulating the expression of the above functional genes anaerobes adapted to nzvi exposure and gradually survived in iron rich but low toxicity environments with nzvi aging in ad 3 5 dynamic responses of syntrophic metabolism and electron transfer potential mediated by the aging products of nzvi the metabolism of glucose in ad generally undergoes acidification and methanation steps which are primarily driven by the syntrophic communities of acidogens and methanogens zhang et al 2020 both bacterial and archaeal phyla in bio nzvi system were detected during chronic exposure period fig 5 a microbial communities of sludge were dominated by bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria chloroflexi euryarchaeota and actinobacteria which are usually regarded as the core microbiota during hydrolysis acidification and methanation in ad duan et al 2021 except for actinobacteria the relative abundances of other dominant phyla slightly decreased after exposure to nzvi for 9 days moreover the numbers of effective sequences significantly dropped from 56 684 to 39 803 after 9 days of operation indicating that nzvi treatment mainly inhibited the total microbial populations as the exposure time increased to 27 days the relative abundance of bacteroidetes and firmicutes which are capable of converting organic matter to acetate co2 h2 as intermediates zhang et al 2020 increased from 18 91 and 17 12 to 24 65 and 24 33 respectively moreover the abundance of euryarchaeota a well known phylum for methanogens also increased from 6 75 to 13 06 the increased percentages of bacteroidetes firmicutes and euryarchaeota were beneficial for the conversion of glucose to ch4 after long term incubation with nzvi furthermore various anaerobes correlated with acidification and methanization were detected at genus level as illustrated in fig 5b as expected all the methanogenic archaea i e methanosaeta methanothrix methanobacterium methanobrevibacter methanosarcina methanomethylovorans and methanospirillum were suppressed after the first 9 days of exposure whereas their abundances gradually increased with prolonged exposure time to 27 days meanwhile most of the acidogenic bacteria e g longilinea clostridium levilinea proteiniphilum syntrophobacter and geobacter showed a similar tendency to methanogens zhang et al 2020 duan et al 2021 in particular the enriched geobacter which has been widely reported to participate in diet based metabolism during anaerobic methanogenesis was likely to stimulate methane production via conductive magnetite rotaru et al 2014 lovley 2017 shi et al 2016 thus long term incubation with nzvi showed time dependent effects on the abundances of key acidogens and methanogens which were relevant to the performance of ad to further shed light on the mechanisms involved in the impacts of nzvi aging on methanogenesis metagenomics analysis focusing on the specific functional genes involved in acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea was conducted as shown in fig 5c almost all the functional genes involved in glycolysis step 1 and pyruvate metabolism steps 2 5 were downregulated after exposure to nzvi for 9 days whereas high expression of those genes was observed as the exposure time increased to 27 days this suggested that nzvi had varying effects on the acidification process in ad as it aged resulting in the dynamic changes in cod removal fig 1a moreover the acetate transporter genes atoe and smct step 6 which are involved in transporting acetate produced from the acidogenic pathway to the outside of cell membrane duan et al 2021 changed consistently with those genes in acidification furthermore the activity of electron transport system ets step 7 reflected by the abundance of genes in nadh dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase cyt bc1 cyt c oxidase and atp synthase fig s17 showed a trend similar to that of the acidification steps 1 5 in response to nzvi aging these results indicated that the intracellular electrons and atp derived from glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism in acidogenic bacteria could be transferred to the cell membrane via membrane bound ets you et al 2021 based on the functional gene profiles in steps 1 7 the generation of acetate from glucose metabolism and the membrane bound ets were inhibited and thereafter promoted during 27 days of exposure which would potentially affect the cooperative metabolism with methanogenic archaea for methanogenesis in response to nzvi aging the pathways of aceticlastic methanogenesis am and hm which are accepted as two dominant pathways for ch4 production in ad were profiled according to a gene set constructed by methanogenic archaea fig 5d as a solute the produced acetate should be transported across the cell membrane of methanogenic archaea for aceticlastic reactions rotaru et al 2014 as expected the genes encoding for transmembrane transport of acetate step 10 including tc sss ntaa and ntab were suppressed after 9 days of exposure and then upregulated with the aging of nzvi consistent with the dynamic yield of acetate produced from acidogenic bacteria in this regard it was not surprising that methanogenic archaea genes corresponding to acetate kinase ack acetyl coa synthetase acs phosphate acetyltransferase pta and acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase cdhde involved in converting acetate to methyl h4mpt steps 11 12 were also time dependently expressed after chronic exposure to nzvi in addition a complete pathway for co2 reduction steps 16 20 was achieved and the abundances of genes related to formyl methanofuran dehydrogenase fwdabcdef formyl methanofuran h4mpt formyltransferase ftr methenyl h4mpt cyclohydrolase mch methylene h4mpt dehydrogenase mtdb 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase mer and the coenzyme f420 dependent dehydrogenase frhbg during long term incubation with nzvi were 0 45 0 90 times lower 9 days and 1 04 1 85 times higher 27 days than those in control 0 day duan et al 2021 notably the average abundances of genes involved in co2 reduction were much lower than those involved in the aceticlastic reaction indicating the dominant role of am in bio nzvi system for the common pathway steps 13 15 in both am and hm the gene abundance of tetrahydromethanopterin h4mpt s methyltransferase mtrah methyl com reductase mcra and k00400 com s s cob heterodisulfide reductase hdra2b2c2e and f420 nonreducing hydrogenase mvhade was depressed by nzvi after exposure for 9 days while significantly increased expression of these genes was observed with prolonged exposure time combining results of the methanogenic archaea gene set steps 10 20 it is clear that nzvi inhibited the am and hm pathways for methanogenesis after 9 days of operation as a result of ferroptosis like death resulting in poor ch4 yield while with the aging of nzvi for 27 days the enrichment of methanogenesis related functional genes especially in the hm pathway promoted ch4 production fig 1b nevertheless the upregulation of functional genes in the hm pathway certainly demands many electrons to complete co2 reduction which is the most direct route for electron consumption in a methanogenic environment rotaru et al 2014 furthermore the 27 day coculture with nzvi promoted acidification and ets activity leading to the release of abundant electrons fig 5c therefore both the electron donating and accepting processes were enhanced after exposure to nzvi for 27 days according to the methanogenic gene set however how to channel these electrons from acidogenic bacteria into methanogenic archaea that stimulate co2 reduction needs to be further explored 3 6 direct electron transfer networks for methanogenesis after long term exposure to nzvi the genes encoding type iv pili were upregulated after exposure to nzvi for 27 days fig s18c in particular the pila gene which generally codes for the structural protein of electrically conductive pili step 9 was highly enriched fig 5c rotaru et al 2014 previous studies have documented that methanogenic archaea can make direct electrical connections with geobacter species accepting electrons for co2 reduction via conductive pili rotaru et al 2014 summers et al 2010 thus the upregulation of the pila gene along with the enhanced electron donating and electron consuming species probably contributed to the diet enhanced co2 reduction of ch4 production furthermore as demonstrated above the extracellular connection by conductive magnetite was an alternative route to accelerate electron transfer step 8 in addition to conductive pili and magnetite mediated diet ubiquinone and riboflavin in epss play key roles in extracellular electron shuttling in most biogeochemical redox processes which is also favorable for electron long distance transfer he et al 2020 wang et al 2020 fig s19a showed that the abundance of genes encoding ubiquinone biosynthesis ubiacdefghix and coq7 was downregulated with the addition of nzvi conversely the genes for riboflavin biosynthesis were upregulated but the genes involved in riboflavin consumption decreased fig s19b leading to elevated riboflavin production in epss after exposure to nzvi for 27 days as revealed by the 3d eem results fig s20 and table s8 marsili et al 2008 demonstrated that riboflavin could transfer electrons from the cell surface to external acceptors by serving as a soluble redox shuttle accordingly the enhanced riboflavin in the epss was also likely to facilitate electron transfer between different species given that the reduced oxidation of nzvi fig s4 and fig s5 decreased the release of h2 the direct exchange of electrons mediated by conductive magnetite and pili as well as the riboflavin in the epss alleviated the need for interspecies h2 transfer this phenomenon could also explain the effective syntrophy between acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea which promoted the conversion of glucose to ch4 fig 5 although three diet pathways were demonstrated above microbes should preferentially use magnetite as conduits of electrons because the conductivities of metallic minerals are in general much higher than those of organic materials kato et al 2012 lovley 2017 indeed the anaerobic sludge after incubation with nzvi for 27 days exhibited excellent ohmic conductance with a sharp peak current of 21 08 μa cm 2 at the midpoint potential of 633 mv vs ag agcl fig s21 confirming efficient diet with the aging of nzvi the specific midpoint potential of 633 mv was probably attributed to the magnetite mediated diet in ad due to the typical voltammogram shape for microbes as well as a lower potential value than those of the conductive biological materials and abiotic iron minerals 580 mv 59 mv according to previous studies you et al 2021 weber et al 2006 wang et al 2020 fricke et al 2008 okamoto et al 2013 therefore the magnetite enhanced diet was proven to be dominant in the extracellular electron transfer contributing to the effective electron exchange between consortium members and promoting ch4 production fig 5 3 7 environmental implication the intrinsic high reactivity and large surface areas of nzvi have attracted extensive attention in terms of its application in groundwater remediation and wastewater treatment although the aging of nzvi reduces the reactivity for contaminant removal or the capacity for electrons donation it also appears to decrease the toxicity of nzvi phenrat et al 2009 here we established dynamic relationships between the aging processes and biological effects of nzvi in ad specifically a high toxicity of nzvi in ad occurred after exposure for 9 days since a large amount of reductive nzvi adsorbed by sludge led to lipid peroxidation of membrane and caused ferroptosis like death which inevitably reduced the performance of ad with prolonged exposure time to 18 days nzvi increasingly aged and formed siderite and vivianite covering the outer surface of microbial cells and fortifying the membrane rigidity which counteracted the toxicity of nzvi as the exposure time further increased to 27 days the magnetite acting as electron conduits connected the acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea promoting ch4 production these results suggested that prolonged exposure should be fully taken into account to accurately evaluate the performance of ad when operating with nzvi due to the adaptative strategy of anaerobes and diet simulation for methanogenesis with the aging of nzvi taking into consideration that ad is one of the few proven renewable energy biotechnologies with thousands of full scale plants worldwide li et al 2019 the coupling of anaerobes with nzvi aging products could have a broad impact for global bioenergy strategies however the overall impact should be assessed based on the application of these particles since the diverse and complex compositions e g so4 2 no3 in actual ad would affect the reactivity and fate of nzvi liu et al 2015 xu et al 2019 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the effects of nzvi on methanogenesis were time dependent which was attributed to the transformation of nzvi as well as the specific regulation of microbes in response to nzvi aging when operating ad with nzvi the nzvi induced ferroptosis like death to anaerobes could inhibit the methane production at initial exposure period whereas a recovery and promotion of methane production were achieved with the aging of nzvi as a result of the reinforced membrane rigidity and magnetite enhanced direct electron transfer networks meanwhile the microbial cells gradually adapted to the aging of nzvi by upregulating functional genes further facilitating cooperative behaviors for methanogenesis these findings indicated the remarkable potential for improving ad performance with the application of nzvi in the long run however the short term shock induced by nzvi toxicity remains of great concern besides the years long responses as well as the coupling mechanism of anaerobes with nzvi aging products in ad treating more complex wastes still need to be studied with the approach described here declaration of competing

14694,periodate based pi io 4 oxidation processes for pollutant elimination have gained increased attention in recent years this study shows that nitrilotriacetic acid nta can assist trace mn ii in activating pi for fast and long lasting degradation of carbamazepine cbz 100 degradation in 2 min pi can oxidize mn ii to permanganate mno 4 mn vii in the presence of nta which indicates the important role of transient manganese oxo species 18o isotope labeling experiments using methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a probe further confirmed the formation of manganese oxo species the chemical stoichiometric relationship pi consumption pmso2 generation and theoretical calculation suggested that mn iv oxo nta species were the main reactive species the nta chelated manganese facilitated direct oxygen transfer from pi to mn ii nta and prevented hydrolysis and agglomeration of transient manganese oxo species pi was transformed completely to stable and nontoxic iodate but not lower valent toxic iodine species i e hoi i2 and i the degradation pathways and mechanisms of cbz were investigated using mass spectrometry and density functional theory dft calculation this study provided a steady and highly efficient choice for the quick degradation of organic micropollutants and broadened the perspective on the evolution mechanism of manganese intermediates in the mn ii nta pi system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords periodate mn ii nta complex mn iv oxo mno4 two electron oxygen atom transfer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops based on oh have been well known and studied wang and xu 2012 with the advancement of technical methods and depth of research the aops with radicals e g oh so 4 cl and br domingues et al 2022 lee et al 2020 and high valent transition metal oxo e g fe iv mn v and co iv gao et al 2019 kim et al 2019 as primary active species have gradually attracted widespread focus and reports over the past decades various oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 peroxyacetic acid paa peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds have been broadly investigated to generate these highly oxidizing active species compared with these oxidants periodate pi io 4 based oxidation is a great potential aop in the oxidation removal of organic micropollutants and pi based oxidation technology has latterly acquired growing attention in terms of efficient oxidation degradation of organic contaminants li et al 2023 zhang et al 2023 solid pi with relatively steady chemical properties makes it easy to transport and use in recent years for example pi based aops have been studied or applied for water and wastewater treatment applications with a focus on bio resistant organic pollutants sukhatskiy et al 2023 moreover pi based aops far exceed the persulfate based aops in removing organic matter zong et al 2021 even though the oxidation processes dominated by pi are slower than the processes involving free radicals the pi can selectively oxidize some specific functional groups such as oh cho and c c under specific conditions sukhatskiy et al 2023 as with other oxidants commonly used in water treatment the reaction kinetics of pi alone with a majority of organic contaminants is sluggish due to its mild redox potential e 0 io 4 io 3 1 60 v and stable tetrahedral spatial structure are similar to permanganate nevertheless the efficiency of activated pi for pollutant degradation has significantly improved uv radiation zhang et al 2021 sunlight liu et al 2022 ultrasound lee et al 2016 activated carbon he et al 2022 transition metal du et al 2019 and h2o2 chadi et al 2019 have been proven effective in activating pi among all of the activation methods the transition metal is regarded as one of the most promising activation approaches owing to its low energy input and great performance for instance zong et al 2021 recently presented that pi could be easily activated by fe ii at ph 3 and generated fe iv which significantly enhanced the decay ratios of the eight selected organics despite all this the activation methods related to transition metal for pi still need to be explored manganese mn as one of the most abundant transition metals in nature is widely found in geological processes affected groundwater mn ii has been verified as an efficacious activator for activating persulfate ps to eliminate organic matter gao et al 2021 more recently du et al 2019 and yu et al 2022 reported aops based on mn ii activated pi for the removal of organic contaminants where the elimination of organics was attributed to the appearance of reactive oxygen species ros or mn v species the high valent metal oxo possesses better anti interference ability toward coexisting substances in water than free radicals and could selectively oxidize organic contaminants liu et al 2021 the formation of metal oxo could be proved via the two electron oxygen atom transfer with sulfoxide wang et al 2018 in general transient high valent metal oxo in aops is unstable and susceptible to spontaneous decomposition or disproportionation in water solution while ligands can stabilize metal oxo by complexation thus facilitating the degradation of pollutants jiang et al 2010 enhanced degradation of pollutants involving high valent metal oxo as main oxidants by the addition of ligands has been extensively confirmed rastogi et al 2009 hu et al 2022 jiang et al 2009 what is noteworthy is that the reaction of mn ii and pi to produce purple red permanganate mno 4 mn vii has long been accepted for quantitative spectrophotometry analysis of mn ii content shokrollahi and shokrollahi 2014 liu et al 2001 the transformation of mn ii into mn vii is bound to be accompanied by a variation of valence whereas it is unclear how mn ii is inchmeal converted into mn vii by pi and how ligands here influence this mechanism besides soluble mn oxo in situ formed in the mn ii activated pi process has rarely been considered while it may lead to overestimating the effect of ros radicals and or mn iii due to the limitations of the analytical method and technology meanwhile the role of mn iv oxo in the removal of organic pollutants and the generation of mn vii in the presence of ligands remains unknown and needs to be investigated further therefore for these scientific issues the objectives of this study are to 1 determine the optimum ligand for enhancing mn ii activated pi system and assess the degradation efficiency of the selected typical organic contaminants in the pi mn ii ligand system 2 identify the dominant reactive species and generation mechanism 3 investigate the formation properties of permanganate in pi mn ii ligand system and give a definite insight into reaction process 4 reveal the possible degradation pathway of the target organic pollutant and the transformation of iodine species in the pi mn ii ligand system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all of the chemicals and reagents are obtained in text s1 supporting information 2 2 experimental procedures chemical reactions were triggered by adding pi into the solution containing the targeted organic contaminant mn ii and different ligands with the ph buffered solution the effect of increasing ionic strength of corresponding buffer salt used at ph 5 7 and 9 on the degradation of cbz was shown in fig s1 for the experimental procedures and the details see text s2 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of organic contaminants and pi were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the formations of i2 and i 3 were identified by the starch colorimetric method sun et al 2020 16o 18o isotope labeled pmso2 was ascertained through gas chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry gc ms ms the electron spin resonance spectrometer esr was employed to capture the reactive free radicals and electrochemical tests were carried out in an electrochemical workstation equipped with a three electrode electrochemical cell system the detailed analytical methods are available in text s3 and table s1 2 4 density functional theory and toxicity assessment the theoretical calculations based on the density functional theory dft were enforced by employing the gaussian 03 package and multiwfn 3 8 dev lu and chen 2012 the toxicity assessment of the identified cbz degradation products and cbz molecular was assessed by utilizing the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t detailed theoretical calculations and toxicity assessments are provided in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of nta cooperated mn ii activated pi for organics degradation the impact of complex ligands such as ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta pyrophosphoric acid ppp and nitrilotriacetic acid nta on the effectiveness of the pi mn ii system for cbz oxidation was explored fig 1 a the removal of cbz in the pi mn ii system at ph 7 was substantially accelerated by the addition of edta and nta while the inclusion of ppp had a very limited impact among these complexing ligands mn ii nta mediated degradation of cbz by activated pi showed the highest oxidation capability and the removal ratio of cbz was approximately 100 in a wide ph range of 3 to 9 as can be seen from fig 1b and text s5 hardly any removal of cbz was observed in the pi mn ii nta pi nta and mn ii nta system while a 98 removal ratio of cbz in the pi mn ii nta system within 8 min revealed the strong synergistic effect of the three species fig s2 showed the existing form of mn ii was significantly changed with the addition of ligand nta and ph and the complex primarily exists in the form of mniinta in aqueous solutions at ph 7 in addition fig 1c presented the strengthening effect of nta gradually stagnated as the molar ratio of nta to mn ii increased to 10 1 because no more mn ii was present in a previous study the rapid degradation of p nitrophenol in pms mn ii nta was attributed to the oxidation of mn v species gao et al 2021 for further comparisons the removal efficiencies of cbz were investigated in the pi mn ii nta ps mn ii nta and h2o2 mn ii nta systems surprisingly the pi mn ii nta system exceeded these three aop to varying degrees at the same condition fig 1d incidentally it was determined that the poor activation capability of pds and h2o2 by mn ii was the cause for the hardly observed removal of cbz in the pds mn ii nta and h2o2 mn ii nta systems the two stage slow first then fast process for the degradation of cbz in the pms mn ii nta system which was linked to the formation of mn iii species was different from the degradation of cbz in the pi mn ii nta system this discrepancy may be caused by the mechanism distinction between the two systems furthermore the removal ratio of the representative organic pollutants including bisphenol a bpa triclosan tcs benzoic acid ba p nitrophenol p np sulfamethoxazole smx atrazine atz and nitrobenzene nb in the pi mn ii nta system were conducted fig 1e except for p np and nb other selected organics were notably removed in the pi mn ii nta system in 5 min at ph 5 and 7 the degradation ratio of bpa and tcs was nearly 100 at ph 5 and 7 in the pi mn ii nta system bpa and tcs are typical electron rich phenolic organics due to they contain the electron donating group oh and thus it is speculated that the primary active species generated in the pi mn ii nta system is electrophilic the abatement of pollutants smx and atz is slightly less than bpa and tcs but still considerable this is because the two organic compounds involve both electron donating groups nh2 or nhr and electron withdrawing group nr2 which leads to a decrease in the electron density of molecules and makes them less vulnerable to attack the moderate removal ratio of ba at ph 7 and 9 was attributed to the weak reactivity of active species toward the cooh group of ba molecule with a minor electron withdrawing ability while the dissatisfied degradation of p np and nb might be ascribed to the resistance of no2 electron withdrawing group to reactive species generated in the pi mn ii nta system in brief the above results showed that the pi mn ii nta system was greatly effective in the degradation of electron rich organic contaminants 3 2 the reaction mechanism of mn ii nta to pi 3 2 1 the evidence of mn iv oxo generation in the pi mn ii nta system recognition and identification of the primary active species are of great sense to have an insight into the mechanism of the pi mn ii nta system esr was first employed to explore the active species generated in the pi mn ii nta system as depicted in fig 2 a the characteristic signal of 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl dmpox with an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 appeared in the pi mn ii and pi mn ii nta system in which the product dmpox is usually blamed on the direct oxidation of dmpo caused by abundant active species rather than free radicals wang et al 2015 floyd and soong 1977 this indicates that it is not a free radical mediated degradation of organics which means the mn nta complex activation pi follows a nonradical pathway recently growing evidence has shown that metal oxo instead of free radicals are primary active species in transition metal activated aops to explore the formation of high valent manganese oxo species in the pi mn ii nta system pmso was used as its probe that could provide indirect evidence from fig s3 compared to pi alone the addition of mn ii accelerated the transformation of pmso to pmso2 and the corresponding yield η of pmso2 was maintained at 100 furthermore the loss of pmso was hastened with the addition of 100 μm nta fig s4 which was similar to the removal of cbz meanwhile the rate of pmso consumption declines with the increase of alkalinity while η is still maintained at approximately 100 faster generation of pmso2 in the pi mn ii nta system compared to the pi and pi mn ii system indirectly indicated the involvement of high valent manganese oxo species while more valid and explicit evidence is yet essential amongst the most distinctive characteristics of reactive metal oxo species is its oxygen atom exchange oae with h2o accordingly the pmso served as the probe compound to appraise the production of 18o isotope contained pms16o18o which was crucial to prove the existence of high valent manganese oxo species in fig 2b two signal peaks with an identical retention time were observed for m z 156 0 and m z 158 0 in sim mode in which the prominent peak of m z 158 0 demonstrated the formation of the pms16o18o in h2 18o in addition signals of m z 141 0 and m z 143 0 signified separately the characteristic fragments of pms16o16o and pms16o18o and m z 141 0 was a signature signal of benzene fig 2c by comparing the production of pms16o16o and pms16o18o in h2 16o fig s5 corporately confirmed that 18o in h2 18o was successfully combined into the pmso2 during the process of pmso oxidation in the pi mn ii nta system similarly a faint pms16o18o signal peak that appeared in the pms mn ii nta system demonstrated the important role of the mn v species fig s6a gao et al 2021 while the inconspicuous performance of pmso consumed and pmso2 produced in the pds mn ii nta system was accredited as that the mn ii nta is difficult to activate pds fig s6b in fig 2b the proportion of single labeled pmso2 pms16o18o out of the total produced pmso2 was calculated to be 91 4 while this proportion was only 37 05 in the fe iv dominated pi fe ii system which might be put down to the exchange rate between the h2o bonded with fe iv and free h2o was much less than that with manganese helm and merbach 1999 in addition the oxygen atom exchange between pi and h2o was almost undetectable in a previous study zong et al 2021 hence the prosperous appearance of pms16o18o in the pi mn ii nta system mightily certified the generation of high valent manganese oxo species despite the weak reactivity of high valent metal oxo species its transient concentration could be greatly high and thus result in an appreciable capture rate for radical scavengers pestovsky and bakac 2004 as shown in fig s7 the addition of oh scavenger tba resulted in the reduction of pmso loss and pmso2 production but η was still maintained at 100 which indicated high valent manganese oxo could slowly oxidize tba to a certain extent in a recent report yu et al 2022 pointed out that mn v was the primary reactive species in the pi mn ii nta system however there exists a contradiction between their experimental results and the proposed reaction mechanism in this literature that a 1 1 molar ratio of pi consumed and pmso2 generated was attained experimentally while the chemical stoichiometric ratio was described as 2 1 based on their proposed mechanism demonstrating the elaborated mechanism was illogical in previous studies the first step in the generation process of mn vii was widely believed to be the direct oxidation of mn ii to mn iv by pi via a one step two electron oxygen atom transfer gongoryn et al 1992 strickland and spicer 1949 besides the mn iv as reactive species were also detected in the pi mn ii system strickland and spicer 1949 zong et al 2023 this means that the possible primary active species was mn iv oxo not mno2 rather than mn v oxo in the pi mn ii nta system fig s8 to verify the generation of mn iv oxo the stoichiometry of pi consumption and pmso2 formation was employed as strong evidence as given in fig 2d the stoichiometric ratio of pmso2 production to pi consumption was acquired as 0 995 1 which was approximately half of the 2 1 stoichiometric ratio of pmso2 to kmno4 the oxidation of pmso to pmso2 by kmno4 has been confirmed as a two step two oxygen atom transfer reaction eq 1 and eq 2 jiang et al 2009 1 m n vii o 4 pmso m n v o 3 pms o 2 2 m n v o 3 pmso m n iii o 2 pms o 2 3 io 4 mnnt a m n iv o nta io 3 4 mnivo nta pmso mnnta pmso2 the approximate molar ratio of 1 1 suggests that the reaction of mn iv oxo to pmso was conducted via one oxygen atom transfer step and mn iv oxo was reduced back to mn ii in the presence of nta eq 3 and eq 4 as known that mn ii is a hexa coordinated octahedral structure in water and the ligand nta could provide four coordination atoms including three hydroxyl oxygen atoms in the carboxyl groups and a nitrogen atom and the ligand nta would take the shape of 1 1 complexes with mn ii bucheli witschel and egli 2001 as indicated in fig s9 the remaining two sites of mn ii are occupied by oxygen atoms in water resulting in a hexa coordinated octahedral structure of mnii h2o 2nta complex the rapid exchange rate of the bonded h2o in mn h2o 6 2 with free h2o could be imputed to the weak mn ii h2o coordination bond it is conceivable that the weakly bonded h2o in the 1 1 mn ii nta complex mnii h2o 2nta could also speed up the exchange rate which is advantageous for the ligand exchange between the coordinated h2o molecules in mnii h2o 2nta and pi therefore as shown in fig s10 the formation mechanism of mn iv oxo was proposed as follows the h2o molecule of mn ii nta complex was first departed which was accompanied by the formation of transition intermediate via the addition of pi to mn ii nta complex subsequently the i o bond right next to the mn o bond of the intermediate was immediately broken and then produced the mn o double bond and achieved the oxygen atom transfer process from pi to mn ii nta 3 2 2 the generation mechanism of permanganate in the pi mn ii nta system as mentioned above the studies on the oxidation of mn ii to mn vii by pi have been reported and can be abbreviated as eq 5 vlessidis and evmiridis 2009 willard and greathouse 1917 it has been widely applied in quantitative analysis for spectrophotometric determination of mn ii based on the pi and the method can indirectly quantify the concentration of mn ii by monitoring the absorbance of mn vii at 525 nm 5 5 io 4 2 m n 2 3 h 2 o 2 m n vii o 4 5 io 3 6 h the extant assay methods for mn ii based upon the pi however typically require harsh experimental conditions and heating is generally required to accelerate the color development in addition the in situ generated mno2 would also impede the formation of mn vii strickland and spicer 1949 however the change course of the manganese valence is less clearly studied and these scientific issues need to be further explored one of the distinctive characteristics of mn vii is that it presents a maximum absorption wavelength at 525 nm as observed in fig 3 a the mn iii produced 270 nm in the pms mn ii nta system rapidly accumulated to a maximum within 5 min which was in good agreement with the fast removal of cbz in the beginning 5 min as measured gao et al 2021 as revealed in fig 3b the feature symbol of mn vii generated in the pi mn ii nta system was obtained and the drawing of partial enlargement further made clear the change in the absence of organic while fig 3c showed the impeded generation of mn vii in the presence of organic see the inset in fig 3c that is nta drives mn iv oxo to be oxidized by pi to form mn vii in the absence of organic pollutants whereas in the presence of organic pollutants mn vii formation is dependent on the type and concentration of organic pollutants furthermore pmso electron rich and nitrobenzene nb electron deficient were used as the model of organic pollutants to explore the dependence degree of mn vii formation on the organics as shown in fig s11 increasing the pmso and nb dosage inhibited the formation of mn vii in the pi mn ii nta system but the degree of inhibition was varied the reason for this suppression phenomenon was that the organic pollutants consumed the intermediate active species mn iv resulting in a decrease in raw materials for the formation of mn vii in other words the process of mn iv oxidizing organics consumes mn iv and nta drives mn iv to form mn vii are carried out simultaneously furthermore chronoamperometry was applied to probe possible electron transfer during the reactant activation and pollutant degradation as exhibited at the top of fig 3d adding pi induced a faint current signal suggesting an electron transfer between pi and mn ii nta incidentally a transient sharp current generated after reactants addition could be ascribed to the charging current caused by the concentration polarization between reactants in bulk solution and the electrode surface kong et al 2022 besides the subsequent introduction of organic pmso reset the current to 0 a which indicated organic pollutant degradation was not achieved through direct electron transfer while the previously added pi aroused weak current may be rooted in electrons of mn vi disproportionation fig 3d top confirmed electrons of mn vi disproportionation could bring current signal mn vi e mn vii mn vi e mn v furthermore fig 3d bottom revealed the two electron oxygen atom transfer course kmno4 as a typical oxygen atom donor might not be involved with the current generation and the electron transfer pathway was further excluded by the pre addition of pmso in the pi mn ii nta system the negligible current caused by introducing pmso indicated that pmso consumed the active mn iv in situ generated in the pi mn ii nta system which leads to preventing the disproportionation of mn vi and the disappearance of current fig 3d bottom accordingly the mn ii nta possibly directly was oxidized by pi to generate mnivo h2o nta through the oxygen atom transfer process and the mn iv in situ produced would oxidize the organic contaminants and or continued to be oxidized to mn vii by pi concomitant with the spontaneous disproportionation of mn vi scheme 1 to better verify speculation the theoretical calculation was introduced to analyze the valence change of manganese based on localized orbital bonding analysis loba thom et al 2009 the oxidation state os is more straightforward to analyze and evaluate the charge transfer process of atoms as shown in theoretical calculation results in fig 3e and tables s2 s9 the observed os of mn element in mnii h2o 2nta was 2 and the os of mn element in mnivo h2o nta was calculated to be 4 after one step two electron oxygen atom transfer which was consistent with the previous reasoning then continuous oxygen atoms transfer caused the decomplexation of the mn element from the mn nta complex and the os of the mn element thereafter was determined to be 6 which seems to accord with the inner sphere mechanism weinstock et al 2018 furthermore the disproportionation of mn vi made its os turn to 5 and 7 respectively of which mn v was further transformed into 7 os during this course the calculated os of the mn element varies from 2 in the initial mnii h2o 2nta to 7 in the final mno 4 to better understand the formation of mn vii factors such as the pi dosage the ratio of nta to mn ii and temperature were studied to interpret the influencing mechanism fig s12 indicated the time courses of mn vii generation in the ph range of 3 0 9 0 interestingly mn vii showed a brief peak and disappeared completely over the next 4 min in ph 3 probably owing to the comproportionation between the reactant mn ii and mn vii which could be accredited to the strong oxidation ability of mn vii under high acidity condition and the higher potential barrier for pi to further translate mn iv to mn vii both the amount of production and reaction rate of mn vii raised with an augment of alkalinity implying the adverse reaction of comproportionation was insignificant and the mn iv in situ formed was more easily oxidized to mn vii at weak alkaline condition at a fixed initial mn ii dosage extra mn vii was produced followed by enlarging the dosage of pi fig s13a and ligand nta fig s13b from fig s14 the formation of more mn vii with the increase of nta dosage again verified the important role of the mn iv oxo intermediate it was noteworthy that the increase in temperature changed the reaction rate and aggrandized the yield of mn vii which was due to more activated molecules involved in the process as the temperature grew fig s15 and in fig s16 the apparent activation energy e a for the generation of mn vii was calculated as 59 88 kj mol the details were shown in text s6 and table s10 in the case of excessive nta and pi the quantitative determination of mn ii based on the nta enhanced pi system was demonstrated to be feasible and uncomplicated within a certain range of mn ii content fig s17 furthermore the possible mechanism of the pi mn ii nta system for contaminants degradation and the formation of mn vii could be generally described as follows one of the oxygen atoms in pi was donated to mnii h2o 2nta by a one step two electron oxygen transfer process and generated the mnivo h2o nta denoted as mn iv in presence of nta eq 6 benefiting from the stabilizing effect of ligand nta on mn iv most in situ formed mn iv with mighty oxidation ability can proceed organics oxidation in the water eq 7 which was consistent with the stoichiometry of pmso2 to pi gained from the experiment while a fraction of mn iv could be further oxidized to mn vi by pi via a two electron oxygen atom process eqs 8 and 9 fig s18 shows the evidence of the formation of mn vi species mn vi mno 4 2 was measured by a stop flow injection photometer at 610 nm ɛ610 1500 cm 1 m 1 as can be seen the absorbance at 610 nm in the pi mn ii nta system increased to a maximum value at about 20 s before dropping off indicating mn vi species is generated and transformed rapidly the subsequent decrease of absorbance at 610 nm confirmed the disproportionation of mn vi and led to the accumulation of mn vii in addition the engendered mn vi self disproportionated immediately into mn v and mn vii eq 10 the mn v was converted to mn vii by pi through a one step oxygen atom transfer reaction eq 11 the overall chemical reaction equation for the formation of mn vii was shown in eq 5 the spontaneous disproportionation of mn vi results in its unlikely contribution to the degradation of the organic for the possible reaction mechanism of the pi mn ii nta system the rational speculation and integration of the reaction processes were presented

complexing agent nta as a ligand for preserving the in situ generated mn iv intermediates avoiding the waste includes possible disproportionation self decomposition and conversion of soluble nta complexed mn iv to mno2 wang et al 2012 3 3 the kinetics of cbz degradation and effect of common background substances in water 3 3 1 the kinetics of cbz degradation to obtain more contaminants removal information the degradation kinetics of cbz were examined in the pi mn ii nta system even if the dosage of pi was only 20 μm the cbz was removed instantly and achieved almost the same degradation consequence as 100 μm fig s19 in fig 4 a the two stage pseudo first order kinetics model was used to describe the degradation process of cbz detailed parameters see in table s11 which was consistent with the degradation of pollutants previously reported by rao et al 2014 and wu et al 2021 as revealed in fig 4b the rough two stage second order kinetics constants of cbz degradation were calculated to be 1 06 104 m 1 s 1 and 8 3 102 m 1 s 1 respectively text s7 which the value in the rapid stage was close to the second order rate constant 1 5 104 m 1 s 1 of feo2 and phenol measured by martire et al 2002 besides fig 4c indicated that the effect of dissolved oxygen do on cbz removal was negligible moreover as shown in fig 4d the presence of ha can faintly inhibit cbz removal in the pi mn ii nta system this phenomenon might be associated with the fact that the electron donor in the ha strongly competed with cbz for mn iv thereby restraining the transfer of electrons from cbz to mn iv while the promotion effect of ha as the ligand on cbz removal is minor thus was covered or ignored 3 3 2 the effect of background substances in water on cbz removal furthermore the effect of common inorganic cations and anions in nature water matrixes on cbz removal was analyzed from fig s20 na and k had no prominent influence on the removal of cbz even at 5 mm while mg2 and ca2 markedly diminished the removal efficiency of cbz the reason is that the stability constants log k f of mn ii with nta are log k f 7 46 while the log k f of na and k with nta are all less than 3 but log k f of mg2 and ca2 with nta is as high as the value of 5 47 and 6 39 respectively bucheli witschel and egli 2001 however the marginal variation in complexation ability toward nta could be compensated by increasing concentration for mg2 and ca2 higher mg2 and ca2 concentrations allowed them to compete for nta and cause mn iv not to be effectively utilized what was unusual was that ca2 at the concentration of 5 mm abnormally promoted the degradation of cbz which may be blamed on the adsorption removal of cbz by precipitation of nanoparticles formed between high density ca2 with the phosphate buffer fig s21 besides from fig s22 the negligible influence of cl and so 4 2 and no 3 on cbz removal means that mn iv was not sensitive to cl so 4 2 and no 3 the faintly negative performance of hco 3 on cbz removal was likely because of its coordination with mn iv oxo and the complex was not as stable as the nta coordinated complex which curtailed the role of mn iv the above results revealed that mn iv oxo with promising aqueous background substrate tolerance is superior to radical oxidation indicating the satisfactory feasibility of mn iv oxo in practical application since actual water bodies contain numerous unknown components testing the pi mn ii nta system on the removal performance of cbz in real water samples is particularly important and necessary herein groundwater secondary effluent of the wastewater treatment plant and river water were selected as real water sources and the detailed parameters of real water bodies were provided in table s12 from fig s23 the removal ratio of cbz in groundwater secondary effluent and river water decreased by 23 3 54 8 and 27 1 respectively the dissolved organic carbon doc of 10 μm cbz is 1 8 mg l which is lower than the actual water bodies while the active species produced in the pi mn ii nta system were inevitably consumed by organic pollutants of the actual background matrix which might be the main cause for the decrease in cbz removal in the actual water samples cbz obtained the maximum degradation ratio in groundwater samples because the water sample is relatively clean and contains fewer organics moreover most of the easily degradable organics in the secondary effluent after biological treatment are degraded by microorganisms and the rest are mostly refractory organic pollutants the organic pollutants of secondary effluent competed with the target pollutant cbz for active species in the pi mn ii nta system resulting in a significant decline in cbz degradation interestingly the removal ratio of cbz in river water samples with organic matter of high content decreased by only 27 1 the possible reason is that the organics in the river water are mainly macromolecular humus and the humus itself is a ligand with strong coordination ability while in situ generated mn iv would be further coordinated by humus which leads to a slight decrease in degradation of cbz in the river water sample the above results indicate that the pi mn ii nta system has a certain resistance ability to the background substances in the actual water body 3 4 dft calculations and cbz degradation pathway a total of 12 degradation products of cbz were detected by hplc ms ms in the pi mn ii nta system see table s13 for all information on the products for details and the ms ms2 are available in figs s24 s37 for the theoretical calculations of dft the homo highest occupied molecular orbital of a molecular is often more willing to be attacked by electrophiles making electrophilic reactions more likely to happen pearson 1986 the homo of cbz molecule is principally located on both sides of c c where can be easily attacked by an electrophilic reagent fig 5 a the active sites with high fukui index f values are most likely to be attacked by electrophilic species as calculated in fig 5b the green highlighted atoms of cbz are of relatively higher f values the site of the olefin double bond has the highest f value indicating that the site can be easily attacked by electrophilic species according to degradation product identification the fukui index and existing related reports possible transformation pathways of cbz in the pi mn ii nta system were proposed in fig 5c it was found the double bonds of cbz olefin in the central heterocyclic ring were converted into alcohols ketones and carboxyl groups while the two external aromatic rings were maintained intact in all products as clarified in fig 5c the reaction was initiated by the electrophilic attack at the olefinic double bond by mn iv oxo it was speculated that the intermediates were formed from the direct addition of mn iv oxo to the cbz molecule because the high valent metal oxo species are typical oxidants for the addition reaction of olefin hu et al 2009 zhai et al 2018 the possible initial steps of these three attack modes were as follows a cycloaddition of the oxidant mn iv oxo with the olefinic bond to form the cyclic metal adduct b one of the bonds in the olefin cleaved and produced a cyclic metal compound with the oxygen atom in mn iv oxo and or c the carbon corresponding to the cleavage of olefinic bond reacted with the oxygen atom in two mn iv oxo to generate an opened chain metal compound respectively subsequently the unstable intermediates would commence split resulting in the two electron oxygen being successfully transferred to the cbz molecule and accomplished by the departure of mn ii in this process on this basis a series of reactions such as dehydrogenation oxygen transfer rearrangement dehydration decarboxylation and deamination obtained 12 intermediates and final products li et al 2021 wu et al 2020 since mn iv can only mediate partial degradation of cbz to organic byproducts instead of mineralization to inorganic products thus further studies will be needed to evaluate the toxicity of cbz after degradation 3 5 transformation of iodine species and toxicity evaluation of degradation products 3 5 1 the transformation of iodine species it is of great significance to comprehensively evaluate the production of other undesired iodine species in the pi mn ii nta system and overall toxicity concerning iodine species transformation of pi the formation of i2 and i 3 were excluded at first by employing the color producing reaction between iodine and starch fig s38 hoi is considered to be a favorable oxidant for the formation of numerous iodinated byproducts the hoi could be indirectly identified by measuring iodine substituted phenols mackeown et al 2022 more than 50 of phenol was consumed fig s39 while all possible iodophenol including 2 ip 4 ip 2 4 dip and 2 4 6 tip were not detected in the pi mn ii nta system fig s40 which suggested the absence of hoi as illustrated in fig 6 a pi was mostly switched to io 3 at the end of the reaction even if the dosage of pi increased from 10 μm to 100 μm and i was not detected during the pi mn ii nta system besides as the inset shown in fig 6a the iodine species in the pi mn ii nta system had already stoichiometrically conserved indicating there was no other lower valence of iodine as shown in fig 6b the presence of extra iodine species was not observed except for the residual pi and the formed io 3 indicating active iodine species e g hoi i2 and i could be ignored to effectively eliminated the formation of toxic iodinated by products the absence of lower valent iodine species in the pi mn ii nta system was due to the fast reduction of io 4 to form io 3 by mn ii through a one step two electron oxygen transfer process the generated io 3 is the most stable form of all iodine species and mn ii is incapable to further reduce io 3 which was consistent with many reported studies that io 3 is the only reduction product du et al 2019 2020 yu et al 2022 zong et al 2021 3 5 2 the toxicity evaluation of degradation products additionally the toxicity evaluation of cbz degradation products is an important aspect to evaluate the application feasibility of the pi mn ii nta system as shown in fig s41 and table s14 following the pi mn ii nta system the increase of lc50 and ld50 were acquired for the majority of identified degradation products showing the acute toxicity after cbz degradation declined considerably furthermore the unweighted average of developmental toxicity and mutagenicity of products was 0 701 and 0 58 which were similar to 0 76 and 0 58 of the parent compound showing inapparent toxicity of cbz degradation products also in fig s42 the inhibition performance of luminescence intensity demonstrated final sample toxicity of cbz treated with pi mn ii nta was slightly increased vs the original cbz l l0 0 86 0 80 but still at the same level besides applying and monitoring the growth course of e coli in the actual source of contaminated water is one of the most straightforward methods to evaluate the overall cytotoxicity and genotoxicity yang et al 2019 as shown in fig s43 the parent cbz has certain biological toxicity to e coli in water while in real water samples cbz and its degradation products treated by pi mn ii nta system promoted the growth of e coli indicating that the overall toxicity of this system decreased and improved biodegradability of cbz besides the growth of e coli in the secondary effluent groundwater and river water showed little difference suggesting that the degradation of cbz in the pi mn ii nta system was less affected by different types of actual water bodies overall the holistic toxicity after the degradation of cbz in the pi mn ii nta system is at a lower level than before the reaction which implied no special attention is needed for the degradation of cbz in the pi mn ii nta in terms of potentially toxic by product 4 conclusion and prospects this work reported a high efficiency organic contaminants degradation approach through the generation of mn iv oxo in the pi mn ii nta system compared with aops based on the same concentration of pms pds and h2o2 the pi mn ii nta system presented excellent selective oxidation ability for organic pollutants removal effective removal by the pi mn ii nta system was accomplished for the target pollutant cbz with an electron rich olefin under the disturbance of humic acid 0 5 mg l broad solution ph values 5 9 as well as various actual water body as exposed in this work it is important that the primary active species mn iv was directly formed via the one step oxygen atom transfer of pi to nta complexed mn ii but was not the electron transfer pathway involved io 3 which was also of advantage to further comprehend the mechanism of other aops based on metal activated in addition the formation mechanism of mn vii in the absence of the extra oxygen atom receptor was revealed as the persistent two electron oxygen atom transfer process from pi to mn ii in the existence of ligand nta although the reactivity of mn iv oxo to organic contaminants 104 m 1 s 1 is much lower than that of free radicals i e oh and so 4 and reactive oxygen species 109 m 1 s 1 the transient state concentration and a lifetime of mn iv could reach several orders of magnitude higher than those active species such as oh so 4 and so on which makes it possible to achieve considerable removal efficiency in organic contaminants degradation nevertheless considering the relatively high cost of pi compared with common oxidants like ps and h2o2 the process might not be proper for the practical large scale application while due to the rapid removal rate of organic matters the easy biodegradability of ligand nta the convenience and safety of reagents in the process of transportation storage and dosing as well as the environmentally friendly final products of pi making the pi mn ii nta system has a particular advantage in situ remediation of excessive organic micropollutants in groundwater with high mn ii content caused by geological action

14694,periodate based pi io 4 oxidation processes for pollutant elimination have gained increased attention in recent years this study shows that nitrilotriacetic acid nta can assist trace mn ii in activating pi for fast and long lasting degradation of carbamazepine cbz 100 degradation in 2 min pi can oxidize mn ii to permanganate mno 4 mn vii in the presence of nta which indicates the important role of transient manganese oxo species 18o isotope labeling experiments using methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a probe further confirmed the formation of manganese oxo species the chemical stoichiometric relationship pi consumption pmso2 generation and theoretical calculation suggested that mn iv oxo nta species were the main reactive species the nta chelated manganese facilitated direct oxygen transfer from pi to mn ii nta and prevented hydrolysis and agglomeration of transient manganese oxo species pi was transformed completely to stable and nontoxic iodate but not lower valent toxic iodine species i e hoi i2 and i the degradation pathways and mechanisms of cbz were investigated using mass spectrometry and density functional theory dft calculation this study provided a steady and highly efficient choice for the quick degradation of organic micropollutants and broadened the perspective on the evolution mechanism of manganese intermediates in the mn ii nta pi system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords periodate mn ii nta complex mn iv oxo mno4 two electron oxygen atom transfer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops based on oh have been well known and studied wang and xu 2012 with the advancement of technical methods and depth of research the aops with radicals e g oh so 4 cl and br domingues et al 2022 lee et al 2020 and high valent transition metal oxo e g fe iv mn v and co iv gao et al 2019 kim et al 2019 as primary active species have gradually attracted widespread focus and reports over the past decades various oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 peroxyacetic acid paa peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds have been broadly investigated to generate these highly oxidizing active species compared with these oxidants periodate pi io 4 based oxidation is a great potential aop in the oxidation removal of organic micropollutants and pi based oxidation technology has latterly acquired growing attention in terms of efficient oxidation degradation of organic contaminants li et al 2023 zhang et al 2023 solid pi with relatively steady chemical properties makes it easy to transport and use in recent years for example pi based aops have been studied or applied for water and wastewater treatment applications with a focus on bio resistant organic pollutants sukhatskiy et al 2023 moreover pi based aops far exceed the persulfate based aops in removing organic matter zong et al 2021 even though the oxidation processes dominated by pi are slower than the processes involving free radicals the pi can selectively oxidize some specific functional groups such as oh cho and c c under specific conditions sukhatskiy et al 2023 as with other oxidants commonly used in water treatment the reaction kinetics of pi alone with a majority of organic contaminants is sluggish due to its mild redox potential e 0 io 4 io 3 1 60 v and stable tetrahedral spatial structure are similar to permanganate nevertheless the efficiency of activated pi for pollutant degradation has significantly improved uv radiation zhang et al 2021 sunlight liu et al 2022 ultrasound lee et al 2016 activated carbon he et al 2022 transition metal du et al 2019 and h2o2 chadi et al 2019 have been proven effective in activating pi among all of the activation methods the transition metal is regarded as one of the most promising activation approaches owing to its low energy input and great performance for instance zong et al 2021 recently presented that pi could be easily activated by fe ii at ph 3 and generated fe iv which significantly enhanced the decay ratios of the eight selected organics despite all this the activation methods related to transition metal for pi still need to be explored manganese mn as one of the most abundant transition metals in nature is widely found in geological processes affected groundwater mn ii has been verified as an efficacious activator for activating persulfate ps to eliminate organic matter gao et al 2021 more recently du et al 2019 and yu et al 2022 reported aops based on mn ii activated pi for the removal of organic contaminants where the elimination of organics was attributed to the appearance of reactive oxygen species ros or mn v species the high valent metal oxo possesses better anti interference ability toward coexisting substances in water than free radicals and could selectively oxidize organic contaminants liu et al 2021 the formation of metal oxo could be proved via the two electron oxygen atom transfer with sulfoxide wang et al 2018 in general transient high valent metal oxo in aops is unstable and susceptible to spontaneous decomposition or disproportionation in water solution while ligands can stabilize metal oxo by complexation thus facilitating the degradation of pollutants jiang et al 2010 enhanced degradation of pollutants involving high valent metal oxo as main oxidants by the addition of ligands has been extensively confirmed rastogi et al 2009 hu et al 2022 jiang et al 2009 what is noteworthy is that the reaction of mn ii and pi to produce purple red permanganate mno 4 mn vii has long been accepted for quantitative spectrophotometry analysis of mn ii content shokrollahi and shokrollahi 2014 liu et al 2001 the transformation of mn ii into mn vii is bound to be accompanied by a variation of valence whereas it is unclear how mn ii is inchmeal converted into mn vii by pi and how ligands here influence this mechanism besides soluble mn oxo in situ formed in the mn ii activated pi process has rarely been considered while it may lead to overestimating the effect of ros radicals and or mn iii due to the limitations of the analytical method and technology meanwhile the role of mn iv oxo in the removal of organic pollutants and the generation of mn vii in the presence of ligands remains unknown and needs to be investigated further therefore for these scientific issues the objectives of this study are to 1 determine the optimum ligand for enhancing mn ii activated pi system and assess the degradation efficiency of the selected typical organic contaminants in the pi mn ii ligand system 2 identify the dominant reactive species and generation mechanism 3 investigate the formation properties of permanganate in pi mn ii ligand system and give a definite insight into reaction process 4 reveal the possible degradation pathway of the target organic pollutant and the transformation of iodine species in the pi mn ii ligand system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all of the chemicals and reagents are obtained in text s1 supporting information 2 2 experimental procedures chemical reactions were triggered by adding pi into the solution containing the targeted organic contaminant mn ii and different ligands with the ph buffered solution the effect of increasing ionic strength of corresponding buffer salt used at ph 5 7 and 9 on the degradation of cbz was shown in fig s1 for the experimental procedures and the details see text s2 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of organic contaminants and pi were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the formations of i2 and i 3 were identified by the starch colorimetric method sun et al 2020 16o 18o isotope labeled pmso2 was ascertained through gas chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry gc ms ms the electron spin resonance spectrometer esr was employed to capture the reactive free radicals and electrochemical tests were carried out in an electrochemical workstation equipped with a three electrode electrochemical cell system the detailed analytical methods are available in text s3 and table s1 2 4 density functional theory and toxicity assessment the theoretical calculations based on the density functional theory dft were enforced by employing the gaussian 03 package and multiwfn 3 8 dev lu and chen 2012 the toxicity assessment of the identified cbz degradation products and cbz molecular was assessed by utilizing the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t detailed theoretical calculations and toxicity assessments are provided in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of nta cooperated mn ii activated pi for organics degradation the impact of complex ligands such as ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta pyrophosphoric acid ppp and nitrilotriacetic acid nta on the effectiveness of the pi mn ii system for cbz oxidation was explored fig 1 a the removal of cbz in the pi mn ii system at ph 7 was substantially accelerated by the addition of edta and nta while the inclusion of ppp had a very limited impact among these complexing ligands mn ii nta mediated degradation of cbz by activated pi showed the highest oxidation capability and the removal ratio of cbz was approximately 100 in a wide ph range of 3 to 9 as can be seen from fig 1b and text s5 hardly any removal of cbz was observed in the pi mn ii nta pi nta and mn ii nta system while a 98 removal ratio of cbz in the pi mn ii nta system within 8 min revealed the strong synergistic effect of the three species fig s2 showed the existing form of mn ii was significantly changed with the addition of ligand nta and ph and the complex primarily exists in the form of mniinta in aqueous solutions at ph 7 in addition fig 1c presented the strengthening effect of nta gradually stagnated as the molar ratio of nta to mn ii increased to 10 1 because no more mn ii was present in a previous study the rapid degradation of p nitrophenol in pms mn ii nta was attributed to the oxidation of mn v species gao et al 2021 for further comparisons the removal efficiencies of cbz were investigated in the pi mn ii nta ps mn ii nta and h2o2 mn ii nta systems surprisingly the pi mn ii nta system exceeded these three aop to varying degrees at the same condition fig 1d incidentally it was determined that the poor activation capability of pds and h2o2 by mn ii was the cause for the hardly observed removal of cbz in the pds mn ii nta and h2o2 mn ii nta systems the two stage slow first then fast process for the degradation of cbz in the pms mn ii nta system which was linked to the formation of mn iii species was different from the degradation of cbz in the pi mn ii nta system this discrepancy may be caused by the mechanism distinction between the two systems furthermore the removal ratio of the representative organic pollutants including bisphenol a bpa triclosan tcs benzoic acid ba p nitrophenol p np sulfamethoxazole smx atrazine atz and nitrobenzene nb in the pi mn ii nta system were conducted fig 1e except for p np and nb other selected organics were notably removed in the pi mn ii nta system in 5 min at ph 5 and 7 the degradation ratio of bpa and tcs was nearly 100 at ph 5 and 7 in the pi mn ii nta system bpa and tcs are typical electron rich phenolic organics due to they contain the electron donating group oh and thus it is speculated that the primary active species generated in the pi mn ii nta system is electrophilic the abatement of pollutants smx and atz is slightly less than bpa and tcs but still considerable this is because the two organic compounds involve both electron donating groups nh2 or nhr and electron withdrawing group nr2 which leads to a decrease in the electron density of molecules and makes them less vulnerable to attack the moderate removal ratio of ba at ph 7 and 9 was attributed to the weak reactivity of active species toward the cooh group of ba molecule with a minor electron withdrawing ability while the dissatisfied degradation of p np and nb might be ascribed to the resistance of no2 electron withdrawing group to reactive species generated in the pi mn ii nta system in brief the above results showed that the pi mn ii nta system was greatly effective in the degradation of electron rich organic contaminants 3 2 the reaction mechanism of mn ii nta to pi 3 2 1 the evidence of mn iv oxo generation in the pi mn ii nta system recognition and identification of the primary active species are of great sense to have an insight into the mechanism of the pi mn ii nta system esr was first employed to explore the active species generated in the pi mn ii nta system as depicted in fig 2 a the characteristic signal of 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl dmpox with an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 appeared in the pi mn ii and pi mn ii nta system in which the product dmpox is usually blamed on the direct oxidation of dmpo caused by abundant active species rather than free radicals wang et al 2015 floyd and soong 1977 this indicates that it is not a free radical mediated degradation of organics which means the mn nta complex activation pi follows a nonradical pathway recently growing evidence has shown that metal oxo instead of free radicals are primary active species in transition metal activated aops to explore the formation of high valent manganese oxo species in the pi mn ii nta system pmso was used as its probe that could provide indirect evidence from fig s3 compared to pi alone the addition of mn ii accelerated the transformation of pmso to pmso2 and the corresponding yield η of pmso2 was maintained at 100 furthermore the loss of pmso was hastened with the addition of 100 μm nta fig s4 which was similar to the removal of cbz meanwhile the rate of pmso consumption declines with the increase of alkalinity while η is still maintained at approximately 100 faster generation of pmso2 in the pi mn ii nta system compared to the pi and pi mn ii system indirectly indicated the involvement of high valent manganese oxo species while more valid and explicit evidence is yet essential amongst the most distinctive characteristics of reactive metal oxo species is its oxygen atom exchange oae with h2o accordingly the pmso served as the probe compound to appraise the production of 18o isotope contained pms16o18o which was crucial to prove the existence of high valent manganese oxo species in fig 2b two signal peaks with an identical retention time were observed for m z 156 0 and m z 158 0 in sim mode in which the prominent peak of m z 158 0 demonstrated the formation of the pms16o18o in h2 18o in addition signals of m z 141 0 and m z 143 0 signified separately the characteristic fragments of pms16o16o and pms16o18o and m z 141 0 was a signature signal of benzene fig 2c by comparing the production of pms16o16o and pms16o18o in h2 16o fig s5 corporately confirmed that 18o in h2 18o was successfully combined into the pmso2 during the process of pmso oxidation in the pi mn ii nta system similarly a faint pms16o18o signal peak that appeared in the pms mn ii nta system demonstrated the important role of the mn v species fig s6a gao et al 2021 while the inconspicuous performance of pmso consumed and pmso2 produced in the pds mn ii nta system was accredited as that the mn ii nta is difficult to activate pds fig s6b in fig 2b the proportion of single labeled pmso2 pms16o18o out of the total produced pmso2 was calculated to be 91 4 while this proportion was only 37 05 in the fe iv dominated pi fe ii system which might be put down to the exchange rate between the h2o bonded with fe iv and free h2o was much less than that with manganese helm and merbach 1999 in addition the oxygen atom exchange between pi and h2o was almost undetectable in a previous study zong et al 2021 hence the prosperous appearance of pms16o18o in the pi mn ii nta system mightily certified the generation of high valent manganese oxo species despite the weak reactivity of high valent metal oxo species its transient concentration could be greatly high and thus result in an appreciable capture rate for radical scavengers pestovsky and bakac 2004 as shown in fig s7 the addition of oh scavenger tba resulted in the reduction of pmso loss and pmso2 production but η was still maintained at 100 which indicated high valent manganese oxo could slowly oxidize tba to a certain extent in a recent report yu et al 2022 pointed out that mn v was the primary reactive species in the pi mn ii nta system however there exists a contradiction between their experimental results and the proposed reaction mechanism in this literature that a 1 1 molar ratio of pi consumed and pmso2 generated was attained experimentally while the chemical stoichiometric ratio was described as 2 1 based on their proposed mechanism demonstrating the elaborated mechanism was illogical in previous studies the first step in the generation process of mn vii was widely believed to be the direct oxidation of mn ii to mn iv by pi via a one step two electron oxygen atom transfer gongoryn et al 1992 strickland and spicer 1949 besides the mn iv as reactive species were also detected in the pi mn ii system strickland and spicer 1949 zong et al 2023 this means that the possible primary active species was mn iv oxo not mno2 rather than mn v oxo in the pi mn ii nta system fig s8 to verify the generation of mn iv oxo the stoichiometry of pi consumption and pmso2 formation was employed as strong evidence as given in fig 2d the stoichiometric ratio of pmso2 production to pi consumption was acquired as 0 995 1 which was approximately half of the 2 1 stoichiometric ratio of pmso2 to kmno4 the oxidation of pmso to pmso2 by kmno4 has been confirmed as a two step two oxygen atom transfer reaction eq 1 and eq 2 jiang et al 2009 1 m n vii o 4 pmso m n v o 3 pms o 2 2 m n v o 3 pmso m n iii o 2 pms o 2 3 io 4 mnnt a m n iv o nta io 3 4 mnivo nta pmso mnnta pmso2 the approximate molar ratio of 1 1 suggests that the reaction of mn iv oxo to pmso was conducted via one oxygen atom transfer step and mn iv oxo was reduced back to mn ii in the presence of nta eq 3 and eq 4 as known that mn ii is a hexa coordinated octahedral structure in water and the ligand nta could provide four coordination atoms including three hydroxyl oxygen atoms in the carboxyl groups and a nitrogen atom and the ligand nta would take the shape of 1 1 complexes with mn ii bucheli witschel and egli 2001 as indicated in fig s9 the remaining two sites of mn ii are occupied by oxygen atoms in water resulting in a hexa coordinated octahedral structure of mnii h2o 2nta complex the rapid exchange rate of the bonded h2o in mn h2o 6 2 with free h2o could be imputed to the weak mn ii h2o coordination bond it is conceivable that the weakly bonded h2o in the 1 1 mn ii nta complex mnii h2o 2nta could also speed up the exchange rate which is advantageous for the ligand exchange between the coordinated h2o molecules in mnii h2o 2nta and pi therefore as shown in fig s10 the formation mechanism of mn iv oxo was proposed as follows the h2o molecule of mn ii nta complex was first departed which was accompanied by the formation of transition intermediate via the addition of pi to mn ii nta complex subsequently the i o bond right next to the mn o bond of the intermediate was immediately broken and then produced the mn o double bond and achieved the oxygen atom transfer process from pi to mn ii nta 3 2 2 the generation mechanism of permanganate in the pi mn ii nta system as mentioned above the studies on the oxidation of mn ii to mn vii by pi have been reported and can be abbreviated as eq 5 vlessidis and evmiridis 2009 willard and greathouse 1917 it has been widely applied in quantitative analysis for spectrophotometric determination of mn ii based on the pi and the method can indirectly quantify the concentration of mn ii by monitoring the absorbance of mn vii at 525 nm 5 5 io 4 2 m n 2 3 h 2 o 2 m n vii o 4 5 io 3 6 h the extant assay methods for mn ii based upon the pi however typically require harsh experimental conditions and heating is generally required to accelerate the color development in addition the in situ generated mno2 would also impede the formation of mn vii strickland and spicer 1949 however the change course of the manganese valence is less clearly studied and these scientific issues need to be further explored one of the distinctive characteristics of mn vii is that it presents a maximum absorption wavelength at 525 nm as observed in fig 3 a the mn iii produced 270 nm in the pms mn ii nta system rapidly accumulated to a maximum within 5 min which was in good agreement with the fast removal of cbz in the beginning 5 min as measured gao et al 2021 as revealed in fig 3b the feature symbol of mn vii generated in the pi mn ii nta system was obtained and the drawing of partial enlargement further made clear the change in the absence of organic while fig 3c showed the impeded generation of mn vii in the presence of organic see the inset in fig 3c that is nta drives mn iv oxo to be oxidized by pi to form mn vii in the absence of organic pollutants whereas in the presence of organic pollutants mn vii formation is dependent on the type and concentration of organic pollutants furthermore pmso electron rich and nitrobenzene nb electron deficient were used as the model of organic pollutants to explore the dependence degree of mn vii formation on the organics as shown in fig s11 increasing the pmso and nb dosage inhibited the formation of mn vii in the pi mn ii nta system but the degree of inhibition was varied the reason for this suppression phenomenon was that the organic pollutants consumed the intermediate active species mn iv resulting in a decrease in raw materials for the formation of mn vii in other words the process of mn iv oxidizing organics consumes mn iv and nta drives mn iv to form mn vii are carried out simultaneously furthermore chronoamperometry was applied to probe possible electron transfer during the reactant activation and pollutant degradation as exhibited at the top of fig 3d adding pi induced a faint current signal suggesting an electron transfer between pi and mn ii nta incidentally a transient sharp current generated after reactants addition could be ascribed to the charging current caused by the concentration polarization between reactants in bulk solution and the electrode surface kong et al 2022 besides the subsequent introduction of organic pmso reset the current to 0 a which indicated organic pollutant degradation was not achieved through direct electron transfer while the previously added pi aroused weak current may be rooted in electrons of mn vi disproportionation fig 3d top confirmed electrons of mn vi disproportionation could bring current signal mn vi e mn vii mn vi e mn v furthermore fig 3d bottom revealed the two electron oxygen atom transfer course kmno4 as a typical oxygen atom donor might not be involved with the current generation and the electron transfer pathway was further excluded by the pre addition of pmso in the pi mn ii nta system the negligible current caused by introducing pmso indicated that pmso consumed the active mn iv in situ generated in the pi mn ii nta system which leads to preventing the disproportionation of mn vi and the disappearance of current fig 3d bottom accordingly the mn ii nta possibly directly was oxidized by pi to generate mnivo h2o nta through the oxygen atom transfer process and the mn iv in situ produced would oxidize the organic contaminants and or continued to be oxidized to mn vii by pi concomitant with the spontaneous disproportionation of mn vi scheme 1 to better verify speculation the theoretical calculation was introduced to analyze the valence change of manganese based on localized orbital bonding analysis loba thom et al 2009 the oxidation state os is more straightforward to analyze and evaluate the charge transfer process of atoms as shown in theoretical calculation results in fig 3e and tables s2 s9 the observed os of mn element in mnii h2o 2nta was 2 and the os of mn element in mnivo h2o nta was calculated to be 4 after one step two electron oxygen atom transfer which was consistent with the previous reasoning then continuous oxygen atoms transfer caused the decomplexation of the mn element from the mn nta complex and the os of the mn element thereafter was determined to be 6 which seems to accord with the inner sphere mechanism weinstock et al 2018 furthermore the disproportionation of mn vi made its os turn to 5 and 7 respectively of which mn v was further transformed into 7 os during this course the calculated os of the mn element varies from 2 in the initial mnii h2o 2nta to 7 in the final mno 4 to better understand the formation of mn vii factors such as the pi dosage the ratio of nta to mn ii and temperature were studied to interpret the influencing mechanism fig s12 indicated the time courses of mn vii generation in the ph range of 3 0 9 0 interestingly mn vii showed a brief peak and disappeared completely over the next 4 min in ph 3 probably owing to the comproportionation between the reactant mn ii and mn vii which could be accredited to the strong oxidation ability of mn vii under high acidity condition and the higher potential barrier for pi to further translate mn iv to mn vii both the amount of production and reaction rate of mn vii raised with an augment of alkalinity implying the adverse reaction of comproportionation was insignificant and the mn iv in situ formed was more easily oxidized to mn vii at weak alkaline condition at a fixed initial mn ii dosage extra mn vii was produced followed by enlarging the dosage of pi fig s13a and ligand nta fig s13b from fig s14 the formation of more mn vii with the increase of nta dosage again verified the important role of the mn iv oxo intermediate it was noteworthy that the increase in temperature changed the reaction rate and aggrandized the yield of mn vii which was due to more activated molecules involved in the process as the temperature grew fig s15 and in fig s16 the apparent activation energy e a for the generation of mn vii was calculated as 59 88 kj mol the details were shown in text s6 and table s10 in the case of excessive nta and pi the quantitative determination of mn ii based on the nta enhanced pi system was demonstrated to be feasible and uncomplicated within a certain range of mn ii content fig s17 furthermore the possible mechanism of the pi mn ii nta system for contaminants degradation and the formation of mn vii could be generally described as follows one of the oxygen atoms in pi was donated to mnii h2o 2nta by a one step two electron oxygen transfer process and generated the mnivo h2o nta denoted as mn iv in presence of nta eq 6 benefiting from the stabilizing effect of ligand nta on mn iv most in situ formed mn iv with mighty oxidation ability can proceed organics oxidation in the water eq 7 which was consistent with the stoichiometry of pmso2 to pi gained from the experiment while a fraction of mn iv could be further oxidized to mn vi by pi via a two electron oxygen atom process eqs 8 and 9 fig s18 shows the evidence of the formation of mn vi species mn vi mno 4 2 was measured by a stop flow injection photometer at 610 nm ɛ610 1500 cm 1 m 1 as can be seen the absorbance at 610 nm in the pi mn ii nta system increased to a maximum value at about 20 s before dropping off indicating mn vi species is generated and transformed rapidly the subsequent decrease of absorbance at 610 nm confirmed the disproportionation of mn vi and led to the accumulation of mn vii in addition the engendered mn vi self disproportionated immediately into mn v and mn vii eq 10 the mn v was converted to mn vii by pi through a one step oxygen atom transfer reaction eq 11 the overall chemical reaction equation for the formation of mn vii was shown in eq 5 the spontaneous disproportionation of mn vi results in its unlikely contribution to the degradation of the organic for the possible reaction mechanism of the pi mn ii nta system the rational speculation and integration of the reaction processes were presented in eq 5 11 scheme 1 showed the proposed possible generation process of mn vii in the pi mn ii nta system 6 io 4 m n 2 m n iv o 2 io 3 7 mnivo2 organic contaminants mn2 products 8 io 4 m n iv o 2 m n

complexed mn iv to mno2 wang et al 2012 3 3 the kinetics of cbz degradation and effect of common background substances in water 3 3 1 the kinetics of cbz degradation to obtain more contaminants removal information the degradation kinetics of cbz were examined in the pi mn ii nta system even if the dosage of pi was only 20 μm the cbz was removed instantly and achieved almost the same degradation consequence as 100 μm fig s19 in fig 4 a the two stage pseudo first order kinetics model was used to describe the degradation process of cbz detailed parameters see in table s11 which was consistent with the degradation of pollutants previously reported by rao et al 2014 and wu et al 2021 as revealed in fig 4b the rough two stage second order kinetics constants of cbz degradation were calculated to be 1 06 104 m 1 s 1 and 8 3 102 m 1 s 1 respectively text s7 which the value in the rapid stage was close to the second order rate constant 1 5 104 m 1 s 1 of feo2 and phenol measured by martire et al 2002 besides fig 4c indicated that the effect of dissolved oxygen do on cbz removal was negligible moreover as shown in fig 4d the presence of ha can faintly inhibit cbz removal in the pi mn ii nta system this phenomenon might be associated with the fact that the electron donor in the ha strongly competed with cbz for mn iv thereby restraining the transfer of electrons from cbz to mn iv while the promotion effect of ha as the ligand on cbz removal is minor thus was covered or ignored 3 3 2 the effect of background substances in water on cbz removal furthermore the effect of common inorganic cations and anions in nature water matrixes on cbz removal was analyzed from fig s20 na and k had no prominent influence on the removal of cbz even at 5 mm while mg2 and ca2 markedly diminished the removal efficiency of cbz the reason is that the stability constants log k f of mn ii with nta are log k f 7 46 while the log k f of na and k with nta are all less than 3 but log k f of mg2 and ca2 with nta is as high as the value of 5 47 and 6 39 respectively bucheli witschel and egli 2001 however the marginal variation in complexation ability toward nta could be compensated by increasing concentration for mg2 and ca2 higher mg2 and ca2 concentrations allowed them to compete for nta and cause mn iv not to be effectively utilized what was unusual was that ca2 at the concentration of 5 mm abnormally promoted the degradation of cbz which may be blamed on the adsorption removal of cbz by precipitation of nanoparticles formed between high density ca2 with the phosphate buffer fig s21 besides from fig s22 the negligible influence of cl and so 4 2 and no 3 on cbz removal means that mn iv was not sensitive to cl so 4 2 and no 3 the faintly negative performance of hco 3 on cbz removal was likely because of its coordination with mn iv oxo and the complex was not as stable as the nta coordinated complex which curtailed the role of mn iv the above results revealed that mn iv oxo with promising aqueous background substrate tolerance is superior to radical oxidation indicating the satisfactory feasibility of mn iv oxo in practical application since actual water bodies contain numerous unknown components testing the pi mn ii nta system on the removal performance of cbz in real water samples is particularly important and necessary herein groundwater secondary effluent of the wastewater treatment plant and river water were selected as real water sources and the detailed parameters of real water bodies were provided in table s12 from fig s23 the removal ratio of cbz in groundwater secondary effluent and river water decreased by 23 3 54 8 and 27 1 respectively the dissolved organic carbon doc of 10 μm cbz is 1 8 mg l which is lower than the actual water bodies while the active species produced in the pi mn ii nta system were inevitably consumed by organic pollutants of the actual background matrix which might be the main cause for the decrease in cbz removal in the actual water samples cbz obtained the maximum degradation ratio in groundwater samples because the water sample is relatively clean and contains fewer organics moreover most of the easily degradable organics in the secondary effluent after biological treatment are degraded by microorganisms and the rest are mostly refractory organic pollutants the organic pollutants of secondary effluent competed with the target pollutant cbz for active species in the pi mn ii nta system resulting in a significant decline in cbz degradation interestingly the removal ratio of cbz in river water samples with organic matter of high content decreased by only 27 1 the possible reason is that the organics in the river water are mainly macromolecular humus and the humus itself is a ligand with strong coordination ability while in situ generated mn iv would be further coordinated by humus which leads to a slight decrease in degradation of cbz in the river water sample the above results indicate that the pi mn ii nta system has a certain resistance ability to the background substances in the actual water body 3 4 dft calculations and cbz degradation pathway a total of 12 degradation products of cbz were detected by hplc ms ms in the pi mn ii nta system see table s13 for all information on the products for details and the ms ms2 are available in figs s24 s37 for the theoretical calculations of dft the homo highest occupied molecular orbital of a molecular is often more willing to be attacked by electrophiles making electrophilic reactions more likely to happen pearson 1986 the homo of cbz molecule is principally located on both sides of c c where can be easily attacked by an electrophilic reagent fig 5 a the active sites with high fukui index f values are most likely to be attacked by electrophilic species as calculated in fig 5b the green highlighted atoms of cbz are of relatively higher f values the site of the olefin double bond has the highest f value indicating that the site can be easily attacked by electrophilic species according to degradation product identification the fukui index and existing related reports possible transformation pathways of cbz in the pi mn ii nta system were proposed in fig 5c it was found the double bonds of cbz olefin in the central heterocyclic ring were converted into alcohols ketones and carboxyl groups while the two external aromatic rings were maintained intact in all products as clarified in fig 5c the reaction was initiated by the electrophilic attack at the olefinic double bond by mn iv oxo it was speculated that the intermediates were formed from the direct addition of mn iv oxo to the cbz molecule because the high valent metal oxo species are typical oxidants for the addition reaction of olefin hu et al 2009 zhai et al 2018 the possible initial steps of these three attack modes were as follows a cycloaddition of the oxidant mn iv oxo with the olefinic bond to form the cyclic metal adduct b one of the bonds in the olefin cleaved and produced a cyclic metal compound with the oxygen atom in mn iv oxo and or c the carbon corresponding to the cleavage of olefinic bond reacted with the oxygen atom in two mn iv oxo to generate an opened chain metal compound respectively subsequently the unstable intermediates would commence split resulting in the two electron oxygen being successfully transferred to the cbz molecule and accomplished by the departure of mn ii in this process on this basis a series of reactions such as dehydrogenation oxygen transfer rearrangement dehydration decarboxylation and deamination obtained 12 intermediates and final products li et al 2021 wu et al 2020 since mn iv can only mediate partial degradation of cbz to organic byproducts instead of mineralization to inorganic products thus further studies will be needed to evaluate the toxicity of cbz after degradation 3 5 transformation of iodine species and toxicity evaluation of degradation products 3 5 1 the transformation of iodine species it is of great significance to comprehensively evaluate the production of other undesired iodine species in the pi mn ii nta system and overall toxicity concerning iodine species transformation of pi the formation of i2 and i 3 were excluded at first by employing the color producing reaction between iodine and starch fig s38 hoi is considered to be a favorable oxidant for the formation of numerous iodinated byproducts the hoi could be indirectly identified by measuring iodine substituted phenols mackeown et al 2022 more than 50 of phenol was consumed fig s39 while all possible iodophenol including 2 ip 4 ip 2 4 dip and 2 4 6 tip were not detected in the pi mn ii nta system fig s40 which suggested the absence of hoi as illustrated in fig 6 a pi was mostly switched to io 3 at the end of the reaction even if the dosage of pi increased from 10 μm to 100 μm and i was not detected during the pi mn ii nta system besides as the inset shown in fig 6a the iodine species in the pi mn ii nta system had already stoichiometrically conserved indicating there was no other lower valence of iodine as shown in fig 6b the presence of extra iodine species was not observed except for the residual pi and the formed io 3 indicating active iodine species e g hoi i2 and i could be ignored to effectively eliminated the formation of toxic iodinated by products the absence of lower valent iodine species in the pi mn ii nta system was due to the fast reduction of io 4 to form io 3 by mn ii through a one step two electron oxygen transfer process the generated io 3 is the most stable form of all iodine species and mn ii is incapable to further reduce io 3 which was consistent with many reported studies that io 3 is the only reduction product du et al 2019 2020 yu et al 2022 zong et al 2021 3 5 2 the toxicity evaluation of degradation products additionally the toxicity evaluation of cbz degradation products is an important aspect to evaluate the application feasibility of the pi mn ii nta system as shown in fig s41 and table s14 following the pi mn ii nta system the increase of lc50 and ld50 were acquired for the majority of identified degradation products showing the acute toxicity after cbz degradation declined considerably furthermore the unweighted average of developmental toxicity and mutagenicity of products was 0 701 and 0 58 which were similar to 0 76 and 0 58 of the parent compound showing inapparent toxicity of cbz degradation products also in fig s42 the inhibition performance of luminescence intensity demonstrated final sample toxicity of cbz treated with pi mn ii nta was slightly increased vs the original cbz l l0 0 86 0 80 but still at the same level besides applying and monitoring the growth course of e coli in the actual source of contaminated water is one of the most straightforward methods to evaluate the overall cytotoxicity and genotoxicity yang et al 2019 as shown in fig s43 the parent cbz has certain biological toxicity to e coli in water while in real water samples cbz and its degradation products treated by pi mn ii nta system promoted the growth of e coli indicating that the overall toxicity of this system decreased and improved biodegradability of cbz besides the growth of e coli in the secondary effluent groundwater and river water showed little difference suggesting that the degradation of cbz in the pi mn ii nta system was less affected by different types of actual water bodies overall the holistic toxicity after the degradation of cbz in the pi mn ii nta system is at a lower level than before the reaction which implied no special attention is needed for the degradation of cbz in the pi mn ii nta in terms of potentially toxic by product 4 conclusion and prospects this work reported a high efficiency organic contaminants degradation approach through the generation of mn iv oxo in the pi mn ii nta system compared with aops based on the same concentration of pms pds and h2o2 the pi mn ii nta system presented excellent selective oxidation ability for organic pollutants removal effective removal by the pi mn ii nta system was accomplished for the target pollutant cbz with an electron rich olefin under the disturbance of humic acid 0 5 mg l broad solution ph values 5 9 as well as various actual water body as exposed in this work it is important that the primary active species mn iv was directly formed via the one step oxygen atom transfer of pi to nta complexed mn ii but was not the electron transfer pathway involved io 3 which was also of advantage to further comprehend the mechanism of other aops based on metal activated in addition the formation mechanism of mn vii in the absence of the extra oxygen atom receptor was revealed as the persistent two electron oxygen atom transfer process from pi to mn ii in the existence of ligand nta although the reactivity of mn iv oxo to organic contaminants 104 m 1 s 1 is much lower than that of free radicals i e oh and so 4 and reactive oxygen species 109 m 1 s 1 the transient state concentration and a lifetime of mn iv could reach several orders of magnitude higher than those active species such as oh so 4 and so on which makes it possible to achieve considerable removal efficiency in organic contaminants degradation nevertheless considering the relatively high cost of pi compared with common oxidants like ps and h2o2 the process might not be proper for the practical large scale application while due to the rapid removal rate of organic matters the easy biodegradability of ligand nta the convenience and safety of reagents in the process of transportation storage and dosing as well as the environmentally friendly final products of pi making the pi mn ii nta system has a particular advantage in situ remediation of excessive organic micropollutants in groundwater with high mn ii content caused by geological action
