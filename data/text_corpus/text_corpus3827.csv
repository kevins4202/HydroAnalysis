19135,microbial community dynamics were characterized following combined oxidation and biodegradation treatment trains for mixtures of 1 4 dioxane and chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs in laboratory microcosms bioremediation is generally inhibited by co contaminate cvocs with only a few specific bacterial taxa reported to metabolize or cometabolize 1 4 dioxane being unaffected chemical oxidation by hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as a non selective treatment demonstrated 50 80 1 4 dioxane removal regardless of the initial cvoc concentrations post oxidation bioaugmentation with 1 4 dioxane metabolizer pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 removed the remaining 1 4 dioxane the intrinsic microbial population biodiversity richness and biomarker gene abundances decreased immediately after the brief oxidation phase but recovery of cultivable microbiomes and a more diverse community were observed during the subsequent 9 week biodegradation phase results generated from the illumina miseq sequencing and bioinformatics analyses established that generally oxidative stress tolerant genus ralstonia was abundant after the oxidation step and cupriavidus pseudolabrys afipia and sphingomonas were identified as dominant genera after aerobic incubation multidimensional analysis elucidated the separation of microbial populations as a function of time under all conditions suggesting that temporal succession is a determining factor that is independent of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs mixtures network analysis highlighted the potential interspecies competition or commensalism and dynamics of microbiomes during the biodegradation phase in line with the shifts of predominant genera and various developing directions during different steps of the treatment train collectively this study demonstrated that chemical oxidation followed by bioaugmentation is effective for treating 1 4 dioxane even in the presence of high levels of cvoc mixtures and residual peroxide a disinfectant and enhanced our understanding of microbial ecological impacts of the treatment train these results will be valuable for predicting treatment synergies that lead to cost savings and improved remedial outcomes in short term active remediation as well as long term changes to the environmental microbial communities graphical abstract image 1 keywords coupled treatment bioremediation microbial ecology k r scheme microbial networks 1 introduction biodegradation research has historically focused on exploring the fate of contaminants in biological transformation pathways under natural or engineered processes suthersan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 understanding the dynamics of environmental microbiomes enables better monitoring of the environmental media undergoing remediation processes microbiomes can serve as leading indicators of these biodegradation processes since changes of the microbial functions as well as structures influence the rate of the contaminant distribution in the environment leigh et al 2015 there are several reports of biological treatment of 1 4 dioxane deng et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 aoyagi et al 2018 inoue et al 2018 myers et al 2018 which is a high priority pollutant that is listed on the us environmental protection agency 2016 amendments to the toxic substances control act usepa 2016 moreover through its use as a solvent and solvent stabilizer 1 4 dioxane contamination in groundwater and soil is often coupled with chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs such as 1 1 1 trichloroethane tca and trichloroethylene tce mohr et al 2010 anderson et al 2012 adamson et al 2014 as well as their biological or abiotic degradation products including cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce 1 1 dichloroethene 1 1 dce and vinyl chloride brown et al 2009 thus the complexity of co contaminant mixtures as well as the general recalcitrance of 1 4 dioxane results in uncertain outcomes for biodegradation due to the sensitivity of subsurface microbiomes to metals and solvent mixtures under environmental conditions griffiths and philippot 2013 pornwongthong et al 2014 adamson et al 2015 previous studies have also indicated that chlorinated organic solvents in particular can adversely affect microorganisms e g reduction of membrane permeability inhibition of growth rate and damage to nucleic acids segura et al 2012 and negatively impact their ecological functions such as their participation in pollutant biodegradation mahendra et al 2013 adamson et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 advanced oxidation processes aops are alternatives to biological strategies for contaminant removal that are capable of producing hydroxyl sulfate radicals to decompose organic pollutants efficiently within short exposure periods merayo et al 2014 importantly aops may provide oxygen and decrease the concentrations of co contaminants eberle et al 2016 both of which benefit aerobic microorganisms jasmann et al 2017 thus field application of an aop in situ chemical oxidation isco offers the benefits of an in situ remediation approach with the potential to overcome certain limitations of bioremediation to date coupling chemical oxidation and bioremediation has produced successful results indicating improved remediation efficiencies for in situ remediation of soil contaminated with diesel kim and lee 2012 sutton et al 2014 as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs medina et al 2018 however few studies have examined the behavior of systems that combine the technologies for treating emerging contaminants such as 1 4 dioxane and cvoc mixtures there are several factors that influence the performance of a combined oxidation biodegradation treatment train including the soil type sutton et al 2014 decreases in the persistence of oxidants and the generated radical species in the presence of oxidizable materials deng et al 2015 thus it is also critical to monitor the efficiency of combined technologies when treating different levels of contaminant mixtures including 1 4 dioxane and cvocs given the potential effects of oxidants on the critical functions of indigenous microbes the responses of soil microbiomes to environmental changes as well as the resistance and resilience of soil microorganisms monitoring of microbial community structures and functions during active remediation efforts as well as after the environment transitions to passive attenuation processes need to be investigated recently microbial community analysis mca based on the application of high throughput sequencing technologies has been used as a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative tool to measure the diversity of environmental microbiomes and facilitate the exploration of phenomena that govern microbial community structure in activated sludge miao et al 2017 aoyagi et al 2018 soil chao et al 2016 and groundwater kao et al 2016 miao et al 2018 in addition mca based patterns and processes can be interpreted by niche based and or stochastic neutral theories dumbrell et al 2010 and used to assess the post oxidation microbial environments and provide a basis for further regulation and optimization of natural and enhanced bioremediation this study focused on examining a combination of oxidation biodegradation technologies used to degrade 1 4 dioxane and cvocs at various concentrations in bench scale microcosms the objective was to identify the relationships among the microbial community contaminant removal and process specific features as a result of combining chemical oxidation and biodegradation to achieve this goal we investigated the influence of key variables initial contaminant concentrations and operational duration and biological factors microbial interactions and co occurring co excluding patterns that shape overall microbial community assembly and functions these findings would expand our understanding beyond the general implication that contaminants and treatment processes change the aggregate microbial community to identifying specific individual taxa as well as the entire dynamic tendency that will be valuable in assessing the post treatment ecological risk and regulating the long term remediation efforts 2 materials and methods 2 1 site characterization and contaminants material for lab scale testing was collected from a site located in the southern united states where groundwater and soil are impacted by previous military and industrial activities including vapor degreasing the contaminants of concern cocs include 1 4 dioxane and multiple cvocs key site characteristics are summarized in table s1 and are described in detail in strategic environmental research and development program serdp project report er 2307 adamson et al 2017 2 2 microcosm constructions and conditions the bench scale microcosm study was conducted in 250 ml glass bottles with screw cap mininert valves containing 50 ml groundwater and 10 g soil that collected from the site two levels of contaminants 500 and 5000 μg l were spiked individually and in mixtures to mimic natural conditions table 1 these two levels were selected because they represent a low to moderate concentration and a high concentration respectively using typical contaminated groundwater plume concentration ranges for 1 4 dioxane and cvocs described in adamson et al 2015 this resulted in four sets of microcosms including high 1 4 dioxane high cvocs h dx h cv high 1 4 dioxane low cvocs h dx l cv low 1 4 dioxane low cvocs l dx l cv and low 1 4 dioxane only l dx a bioaugmentation set bioaug was also prepared as a positive biodegradation control by adding 1 4 dioxane metabolizing and mineralizing bacterial strain pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 cb1190 mahendra and alvarez cohen 2005 2006 mahendra et al 2007 and incubated with high 1 4 dioxane and low cvocs initial concentrations a heat sterilized control set was also prepared to correct for abiotic loss corrections 2 3 combined treatment trains and amendment formulations hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was selected as the oxidant and the optimal dose for unamended groundwater and soil mixture slurry was 0 96 mm dose tests prior to microcosms are summarized in table s2 the microcosms were first established with different concentrations of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs then h2o2 was added and oxidation process conducted with continuous 100 rpm agitation at room temperature with ph at 4 5 100 mg feso4 7h2o and 10 sulfuric acid simulating the fenton type reaction the oxidation process lasted for 12 h based on the dose test to achieve expected partial 1 4 dioxane removals 50 then was quenched with naoh and the remaining 1 4 dioxane in the microcosms was incubated for following 9 week biodegradation process 30 c 150 rpm shaking cb1190 was added before and after oxidation process and 5000 μg l 1 4 dioxane was added in microcosms whenever 1 4 dioxane dropped below detection limit during the incubation period to maintain bacterial viability and test the reproducibility in cb1190 augmented bottles 2 4 sample collection and analytical methods four time points were selected during the combined treatment train for dna extraction 300 μl slurry including before oxidation ob1 and after oxidation ob2 day 0 middle of biodegradation ob3 day 17 where 1 4 dioxane was first depleted and second batch of cb1190 was added and the end of biodegradation ob4 day 63 1 4 dioxane 200 μl aliquots was measured every week as described previously zhang et al 2016 by using gc ms 1 1000 μg l and gc fid 1 100 mg l details in methods s1

statistical analyses the generated sequences of 16s rrna genes were grouped and preprocessed in mothur software v 1 40 0 schloss et al 2009 and quality controlled the assembled paired end reads with criteria i an average quality cutoff at q30 ii ambiguous bases at 0 chao et al 2016 iii minimum length at 400 bp the chimeras were detected and identified by using chimera vsearch and assembled reads that aligned and classified to chloroplasts mitochondria or eukaryota based on silva database were discarded by using remove lineage finally the number of remaining quality controlled reads in each sample were normalized to 30 000 and all datasets were submitted to metagemonics rapid annotation using subsystem technology mg rast server with accession numbers 4774619 3 the normalized sequences were further clustered into different operational taxonomic units otus with command cluster split at 0 03 cutoff 97 similarity producing a total of 3412 otus after removing singletons an otu with one read and the taxonomy of each otu was blast against silva database by using classify otu the α diversity indices shannon chao1 ace etc were calculated by the summary single and the relative abundance of taxa was calculated in each sample unifrac distances metrics weighted and unweighted calculated by unifrac weighted was used to indicate pairwise similarities among samples and triplicates of each sample were shown by using principal coordinates analysis pcoa the cluster analysis ca was also based on average relative abundance of 97 similarity otus 0 97 otus and data were clustered using the clara algorithm kaufman and rousseeuw 2009 this method was based on partitioning around medoids pam which refers to an object within a cluster minimizing the sum of dissimilarities among all cluster observations and can show distinct discontinuities among samples network analysis based on correlations which was previously applied to study microbial co occurrence co exclusion species species associations ssa patterns chao et al 2016 ju et al 2017 was calculated using an average relative abundance of 97 similarity otus 0 97 otus the algorithm was based on the non parametric spearman s rank correlation with strict coefficients at 0 6 and significant cutoff p value at 0 01 barberan et al 2012 random incidence r and observed incidence o of taxa co occurrence were statistically checked on order level based on previous methods ju and zhang 2015 the o was defined as ratio of the number of observed edges e0 between two orders to total number of edges e and the r was conducted by following formula r 2 n 1 n 2 n n 1 where n1 and n2 represented order1 s and order2 s otus number in the network and n is total nodes in the network the ratio of o to r o r was used as criteria of nonrandom ssa between two different orders ju et al 2017 2 8 data visualization all visualizations were made by using r v 3 4 0 with packages phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 for pcoa complexheatmap gu et al 2016 for heatmap organization factoextra and cluster miao et al 2017 for cluster analysis ca hmisc miao et al 2017 for correlation analysis the circular networks were visualized by gephi v 0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 microcosm performance and biomarker detection h2o2 was an effective oxidant for the 12 h oxidation period under each condition and high 1 4 dioxane reductions between 80 and 82 were achieved except for the h dx h cv condition where only 50 of the 1 4 dioxane was removed fig 1 in the h dx h cv condition 9 45 of the initial tca remained after oxidation while cvocs were completely removed after 12 h oxidation in all other conditions the biodegradation phase following the aop phase lasted for another 9 weeks and 1 4 dioxane was stable in each non bioaugmented microcosm without apparent indigenous 1 4 dioxane removals under bioaugmentation 1 4 dioxane was spiked to 919 μg l at day 17 ob3 after the initial dose of 1 4 dioxane had been depleted and cb1190 1 10 v v was added at same time 1 4 dioxane was monitored to below detection continuously at days 30 49 and 63 ob4 respectively and 1 4 dioxane had to be spiked again at days 30 5049 μg l and 49 3517 μg l respectively fig 1 no significant 1 4 dioxane removals were observed during the treatment train under each condition in the heat sterilized abiotic control microcosms table s4 the biomarker genes dxmb and aldh were only observed in the bioaugmentation microcosms and were consistent with spiked cb1190 at each feeding time point in addition both dxmb and aldh were inhibited by three to four orders of magnitude directly after the oxidation phase but increased during the post aop biodegradation phase and reached to 3 75 106 copies ml and 2 22 106 copies ml respectively fig s1 3 2 associations among microcosm performances and microbial α diversity both spearman s rank and pearson s linear correlations showed no significant connections among biodiversity richness and 1 4 dioxane concentrations table s5 however the shannon index indicated that biodiversity under all conditions was reduced significantly p value 0 05 during the oxidation phase except for the h dx h cv condition fig 2 table s6 afterwards during the first stage of the biodegradation phase from ob2 day 0 to ob3 day 17 the biodiversity was relatively stable under h dx h cv h dx l cv and l dx l cv but increased significantly under l dx and bioaug conditions rapid and significant increases of biodiversity were observed after 9 week incubation of biodegradation from ob3 to ob4 day 63 under all conditions the richness metrics represented by the chao1 index and observed species 0 97 otu depict the change of species along with treatment trains both of which kept decreasing from ob1 to ob3 under all conditions with cvocs under low 1 4 dioxane only condition the richness of microbial community started to recover from ob2 to ob3 which occurred earlier than in microcosms with cvocs fig 2 table s6 3 3 taxonomic profiles shift in treatment trains the taxonomic classification showed that the most abundant phyla before oxidation were proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes cyanobacteria and bacteroidetes fig s2 the relative abundance of proteobacteria class gammaproteobacteria was reduced during the oxidation phase under all conditions except h dx h cv where proteobacteria class betaproteobacteria increased by 10 with decreasing actinobacteria under bioaug h dx h cv and h dx l cv conditions proteobacteria decreased at ob3 but increased with low 1 4 dioxane only spikes when comparing conditions with the same initial 1 4 dioxane concentration the presence of lower levels of cvocs induced a rebound of proteobacteria class alphaproteobacteria at ob4 which was in contrast to the trend observed at higher cvoc levels phylum actinobacteria was observed to increase during the biodegradation phase under bioaug and h dx h cv conditions but was found to decrease under l dx condition phylum firmicutes carrying the class bacilli showed opposite trends to proteobacteria along with treatment trains under each condition and only accumulated under h dx h cv condition at ob4 phylum cyanobacteria carrying the class gloeobacteria accumulated after oxidation at ob2 and only continuously increased under h dx h cv conditions while phylum bacteroidetes carrying the classes sphingobacteriia and cytophagia was abundant after biodegradation at ob4 at genus and species 0 97 otus levels fig 2 some originally highly abundant genera were inhibited by the oxidant exposure and continued to decrease for the duration of the incubation including pseudomonas massilla aquabacterium variovorax and an unclassified genus in pseudomonadaceae genus pseudomonas was the dominant microorganism at the beginning but inhibited by the chemical oxidation phase and kept decreasing during the biodegradation phase interestingly two main otus in pseudomonas showed opposite responses to oxidation pseudomonas cerasi 58 otu1 was reduced while pseudomonas azotoformans nbrc 12693 otu6 increased but both otus decreased at ob3 and ob4 genus ralstonia was the only abundant genus demonstrating oxidative tolerance and increased in abundance after oxidation under all conditions while decreasing relatively during the post aop phase other genera demonstrating oxidative tolerance were only observed under specific conditions such as pelomonas under bioaug h dx h cv and l dx l cv janthinobacterium under bioaug and l dx l cv streptococcus under bioaug and h dx l cv gloeobacter under bioaug h dx h cv and l dx l cv etc notably genus mycobacterium which was dominant under l dx condition at ob2 showed early inhibition under h dx h cv condition but grew abundant again during the biodegradation phase for the h dx h cv condition moreover during the initial stage of biodegradation from ob2 to ob3 various genera recovered in distinct ways from prior exposure to oxidant radicals along with the post aop burst of biodiversity more genera thrived and interacted during the 9 week incubation showing different responses to operational conditions and abundant cupriavidus pseudolabrys sphingomonas continued to accumulate through ob4 under all conditions pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 was spiked at ob1 but was expected to be inhibited after oxidation during the biodegradation phase cb1190 was a weakly competitive member of the overall microbial population reaching to 23 67 at ob4 even after second spike at ob3 day 17 to reach 32 80 3 4 microbial population dynamics linked to treatment trains the microbial community shifted rapidly along with time during the whole treatment train incubation results indicate that time was a better variable for explaining the dynamics of the microbial community fig 3 b and d color coded than the presence and or concentration of co contaminants fig s3 pcoa biplots based on unifrac distances described that both microbial membership unweighted and abundance weighted developed along with treatment trains under different conditions furthermore the oxidation phase clearly influenced the microbial community both in terms of membership and abundance the bacterial membership unweighted fig 3c and d seemed to separate more apparently than bacterial abundance weighted fig 3a and b during the biodegradation phase and this was consistent with the venn diagram showing that more species were identified at ob4 fig s4 when taking the conditions into consideration the community in h dx h cv condition triangles in fig 3a and c changed more slowly than in other conditions while the community in the l dx condition cross in fig 3a and c evolved relatively faster compared to other conditions moreover the members at ob3 tended to merge with ob2 fig 3d while the abundances were in relative proximity to ob4 fig 3c indicating the unstable impacts under different conditions interestingly microbiomes at ob4 showed more clear boundaries among conditions and the linear connections based pearson correlation showed that samples at ob4 only had solid connections within same conditions purple in fig 4 a additionally the impact from oxidation reduced the connections among samples under different conditions when comparing between ob1 green in fig 4a and ob2 thinner edge of blue in fig 4a while the signs of recovery could be found at ob3 orange in fig 4a since more connections were re built the cluster analyses based on unsupervised classification ungrouped depicted the relative distance of each sample and microbial community structure showed deviations under different conditions at ob4 with relatively further shifts than the rest of the samples fig 4b in clustered samples collected at ob1 ob2 and ob3 samples belonging to ob2 and ob3 were closely related regardless of the conditions fig s5 3 5 co occurrence and co exclusion patterns in the combined treatment trains in networks constructed based on the otus that totaled over 1 in all samples only the strong coefficients 0 6 or 0 6 and significant p 0 01 correlations were presented which generally indicated the role of cooperative and competitive relations in guiding community dynamics the output positive network contained 711 pairs of spearman correlations between 168 otus fig 5 while the negative had 69 strong pairs between 51 otus fig s6 the otus in the positive network co occurrence were mainly distributed into 12 phyla which was consistent with the trend of taxonomic classification that proteobacteria 54 17 actinobacteria 13 10 firmicutes 14 29 cyanobacteria 2 98 and bacteroidetes 8 33 were the top five most abundant phyla among them proteobacteria had 220 connections and 142 of 220 were intra phylum within phylum pairs and this ratio were 22 of 83 and 11 of 76 for firmicutes and actinobacteria respectively fig 5a when compared against the network grouped by phyla fig 5a most niches were occupied by multiple interacted phyla except for module iii where mostly matched a whole part of proteobacteria for example phyla proteobacteria and cyanobacteria otu13 25 69 88 and 95 yellow in fig 5a shared in same niche module v and module ii contained proteobacteria firmicutes otu32 48 50 58 70 green in fig 5a and actinobacteria otu9 28 37 87 153 orange in fig 5a moreover the co exclusion pattern showed unmodularized distribution of phyla demonstrating the inter or intra phylum competitions within community otu60 comamonadaceae unclassified 72 ramlibacter 73 hydrogenophaga and 138 comamonadaceae unclassified belonging to proteobacteria showed competitions with proteobacteria otu23 pelomonas respectively occupying the module ii in negative networks blue in fig s6b moreover otu6 pseudomonas and 19 janthinobacterium in proteobacteria had more dense negative connections large nodes in fig s6a with inter or intra phylum otus in module iii purple in fig s6b detailed network and statistical analyses were applied to the microbial community under bioaug condition to explore the connections of bioaugmented cb1190 with other otus coupled with incidence analysis to reveal the observed random connections the output network was constructed with 405 pairs of strong connections among 81 otus in which 356 pairs were positive and 49 pairs were negative fig s8a the spiked cb1190 removed 1 4 dioxane efficiently and showed negative correlations with species belonged to gloeobacter ralstonia mycobacterium janthinobacterium etc fig s7 moreover the cb1190 strongly connected with a few co occurring genera i e cupriavidus that were observed to share in the same module indicating their close interactions fig s8b this was also confirmed by incidence analysis between otus from different orders cb1190 s higher rank taxon pseudonocardiales tended to co occur with rhizobiales o r 4 33 bacillales o r 4 00 and sphingobacteriales o r 3 00 table s7 4 discussion bioremediation is generally inhibited by co contaminated cvocs with only a few specific bacterial taxa reported to metabolize or cometabolize 1 4 dioxane being unaffected in this study chemical oxidation as a non selective treatment demonstrated 50 80 1 4 dioxane removal regardless of the initial cvocs stress post oxidation bioaugmentation with 1 4 dioxane degrader pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 cb1190 removed the remaining 1 4 dioxane tce and dce were rapidly removed during the 12 h oxidation phase while 1 4 dioxane was depleted by 70 80 this is consistent with oxidation studies that 1 4 dioxane was more difficult to degrade than chlorinated solvents eberle et al 2016 but hydroxyl radicals generated during h2o2 decomposition could destroy the structure of 1 4 dioxane ikehata et al 2016 h2o2 alone has been reported to be not as effective compared with o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 technologies ikehata et al 2016 andaluri and suri 2017 but a dose of 0 96 mm successfully achieved the treatment goal for the biodegradation phase that followed oxidation 1 1 1 tca was only detected post oxidation under the h dx h cv condition this condition also exhibited lower 1 4 dioxane removals indicating lower susceptibility of tca to chemical oxidation eberle et al 2016 and its negative impact on 1 4 dioxane degradations during the following 9 week biodegradation phase the treatment objective of nearly complete 1 4 dioxane removal was accomplished only under the bioaugmentation condition bioaug while no statistically significant 1 4 dioxane degradation was observed for the remaining non bioaugmented conditions the systems that were bioaugmented with cb1190 degraded 1 4 dioxane completely which is supported by the detection of dioxane monooxygenase dxmo encoding gene dxmb and aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh encoding gene aldh gedalanga et al 2014 this is consistent with the findings of kim and lee 2012 that biodegradation as a second step will achieve higher efficiency due to the addition of microorganisms expressing the appropriate biodegradative enzymes which is in line with the objective of bioaugmentation unfortunately both dxmb and aldh were not detected in the native samples during the incubation process indicating a general lack of 1 4 dioxane degraders in the indigenous microbiomes in site materials both biomarker genes were detected in recent work that tracked a cvoc free 1 4 dioxane plume with reasonable accuracy and strongly suggested that the presence of these biomarkers was associated with 1 4 dioxane and that microorganisms containing these biomarkers were degrading 1 4 dioxane gedalanga et al 2016 the incomplete removals under non bioaugmented conditions can likely be attributed to insufficient time to grow a sufficient population in part because the initial abundance of metabolizing or cometabolizing 1 4 dioxane degraders was low in addition the oxidation process may have released dissolved organic carbon doc that was preferentially biodegraded by microorganisms over 1 4 dioxane this process has been reported in oil contaminated soil sutton et al 2014 moreover the oxidation process appears to have inhibited intrinsic microorganisms which potentially biodegrade 1 4 dioxane due to microbial mortality and inactivation in the presence of hydroxyl radicals silva castro et al 2013 and has been similarly reported for a diesel contaminated site chen et al 2016 1 4 dioxane oxidation by products including formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde were reported to have geno and cyto toxicity li et al 2018b that can also impact native bacteria as well as affect public and ecological health by reducing the oxidant dose and thus reducing the expense and potential inhibitory effects associated with an oxidation only treatment approach the results of this study demonstrated that an oxidation bioaugmentation strategy is able to completely remove 1 4 dioxane while reducing the economic and environmental concerns the biodiversity and richness generally decreased immediately after oxidation under each condition and this pattern is consistent with previous studies that report dramatic declines in species richness and diversity after aops silva castro et al 2013 medina et al 2018 however the h dx h cv condition showed no significant change which could be related to the higher residual levels of 1 4 dioxane and tca indicating weaker oxidative effects on the microbial community in the presence of background 1 4 dioxane and tca the continuously decreasing biodiversity and richness were detected under h dx h cv h dx l cv and l dx l cv conditions and medina et al 2018 also found the similar post oxidation diversity and richness decreases along with the changes of predominant microbes while microorganisms under l dx condition showed rapid recovery from ob2 to ob3 this comparison demonstrated that the initial cvocs had negative impacts on the recovery of the microbial community even after the oxidation phase potentially due to the accumulation of epoxide intermediates or byproducts of oxidized cvocs li and zhu 2016 moreover the spiked cb1190 improved the richness and diversity even under bioaug condition showing the potential co occurrence of species in the microcosms a notable recovery of richness and diversity under all conditions was observed in the 9 week incubation and this could be attributed to the adaption of functional microorganisms to the highly bioavailable oxidative products silva castro et al 2013 and diverse communities tended to stabilize and contributed to ecosystem functions and service bell et al 2005 this general decreasing increasing biodiversity trend is consistent with previous studies with different oxidation reactions such as fenton laurent et al 2012 permanganate luhrs et al 2006 and persulfate richardson et al 2010 where microbial populations and diversity were reduced after oxidation but recovered during post treatment periods additionally the oxidation phase might also induce mutations in microorganisms which could be transferred by horizontal gene transfer hgt and increase the community s overall tolerance to chemical oxidation wilson and metcalf 2005 for the dynamics of taxonomic classification taxa responded differently with various initial 1 4 dioxane and cvocs members of proteobacteria especially the class betaproteobacteria were found to increase only under h dx h cv condition in line with the resistance to chlorinated compounds kao et al 2016 however both beta and gamma proteobacteria fluctuated during the post aop process while only alphaproteobacteria showed the same increasing trend after oxidation under all conditions and dominated at ob4 indicating higher competitive capability the remaining tca after oxidation under h dx h cv induced slower recoveries of firmicutes and actinobacteria compared with other conditions and inhibited bacteroidetes which thrived at ob4 under other conditions indicating weak competition and sensitivity to chlorinated compounds lin et al 2016 furthermore cyanobacteria showed general tolerance to oxidative stress with increasing abundance because they are equipped with glutaredoxin enzymes ferredoxin enzymes and fur like regulators cassier chauvat and chauvat 2015 interestingly firmicutes and actinobacteria demonstrated oxidative tolerance with backgrounds of high 1 4 dioxane and low cvocs respectively bioaugmented cb1190 belonging to actinobacter had simplified the composition and driven the change of phyla more specific to the genera level some originally highly abundant genera including pseudomonas massilla aquabacterium and variovorax were inhibited by the oxidation phase and decreased further in biodegradation phase indicating that those genera in the microbial community were unable to overcome oxidative stress medina et al 2018 however the dominant pseudomonas were composed of two main otus that showed opposite trends and pseudomonas azotoformans strain nbrc 12693 thrived after oxidation which has been reported to have oxidative tolerance while both pseudomonas strains were inhibited during the biodegradation phase indicating the co exclusion with other microorganisms many more genera were found to resist oxidation i e ralstonia gloeobacter pelomonas and streptococcus etc among them ralstonia was reported as a plant pathogen and carries oxidative stress response regulator oxyr which was essential for the hydrogen peroxide stress response flores cruz and allen 2011 in addition ralstonia was also enriched in the dioxane degrading consortia he et al 2017 which may also have been selected because of the remaining 1 4 dioxane however the substance and species information was uncertain in microcosms and the cvocs and chemical oxidation process might have impacts on monooxygenase expression thus the presence of ralstonia does not necessarily indicate removal of 1 4 dioxane in this study gloeobacter belonging to cyanobacteria was reported to be able to persist in clo2 conditions walden et al 2015 and was confirmed to have tolerance to oxidation in this study moreover along with the surge of biodiversity more genera were classified during the 9 week incubation represented by afipia pseudolabrys sphingomonas and cupriavidus etc he et al 2017 reported afipia and cupriavidus were enriched together from uncontaminated soil by using 1 4 dioxane indicating the selection and stimulation of these microorganisms during our study by the remaining 1 4 dioxane in the microcosms as well as their abilities to outcompete other microbes for resources despite afipia sp d1 demonstrated ability to degrade 1 4 dioxane as the sole carbon and energy source sei et al 2013 the species identification in afipia was uncertain and accumulated genus afipia in this study might need an extended incubation period besides pseudolabrys sphingomonas and cupriavidus were ubiquitous in hydrocarbon rich soil and identified as hydrocarbon degraders aislabie et al 2006 yang et al 2014 medina et al 2018 these thriving genera imply that the remaining 1 4 dioxane and oxidized doc provided rich carbon sources for competing microorganisms these types of detailed taxonomic information can help further evaluation of remediation work and serve as a foundation for future ecosystem research the whole dynamic change and succession of microbial community during the combined treatment trains under each condition could also be explained by using analogous r k strategy medina et al 2018 which described the relatively fast unstable competitive r strategist and slow stable equal k strategist growth conditions of microorganisms cycon et al 2013 in this study dominant microbes after oxidation at ob2 had higher resistance capability and less competition identifying the k strategists under each condition afterwards the community transferred from k to r strategy because of the initial adaption and competition during the early part of the biodegradation process samples from ob2 to ob3 were weak thinner edges or disordered connected e g ob2 ll connected ob3 hh ob2 l connected ob3 aug and this indicated an unstable or erroneous development of microbial community more importantly with the different levels of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs their degradation intermediates with various concentrations and compositions would also induce the versatile r strategists under different conditions explaining the uneven distribution of microbial community and rebound of biodiversity at ob3 this was also defined as intermediate disturbance hypothesis idh that intermediate levels of disturbance under different conditions would create patches at different levels of succession promoting coexistence of microbes and competitors at the specific regime roxburgh et al 2004 at the end of treatment train more thriving genera species increased and outcompeted weak ones after 9 weeks and tended to be equitable with the indicator of higher richness and biodiversity showing the signs of k strategy cycon et al 2013 moreover samples within each condition at ob4 had stronger connections that were shown on thinner edges fig 4a and connected with same condition samples at ob3 e g ob3 l and ob4 l but fewer connections with other samples indicating the relatively stable status of microbial community at ob4 based on the dynamic successions pcoa showed that the microbiomes under all conditions followed temporal succession and shared relatively similar developments of compositions and diversities along with operations the membership of community unweighted unifrac at different time points grouped separately and was evident with the biodiversity indicating the deviation of microbiomes were more dependent on treatment progress however when the abundances of the community were taken into account more overlaps were observed among groups explicating that the successions were intercepted slightly by the different conditions within the timelines thus the populations followed the treatment trains changes that were relatively independent of the contaminant concentrations this chronological change was defined as a deterministic process and vanwonterghem et al 2014 similarly suggested that deterministic processes drove the community assembly with highly synchronized population dynamics in three individual cellulose degrading bioreactors moreover ju et al 2017 also described that the operating time rather than physicochemical conditions e g vfas and nh4 n and operational parameters i e srt and olr directed the community variations and shifting trends however the level of contaminants could also play minor roles in determining and differentiating the detailed microbial progress just within the deterministic process interestingly based on the weighted unifrac pcoa samples at ob4 seemed to group along with the different conditions thus cluster analysis grouping samples based on the relative dissimilarity showed that the microbial community developed in different ways at the end of biodegradation as compared with other time points this confirms that the richness and biodiversity thrived and blossomed and also illustrates the impacts of conditions on the evolution of microbiomes in addition community at ob2 and ob3 tended to cluster together indicating the transferred period of the system partly in line with the above k r transition and the competition during the transition was also reflected in the network that otus belonged to the same taxa were forcedly adaptive to different niches and the turnover of otus among different niches implicating the competition in guiding the structures ju et al 2017 moreover co exclusion was found even within same phylum reflecting competition among these microorganisms for limited resources of essential growth factors nielsen et al 2012 the inter species co occurrences could be due to the enzymatic associations within distinctive pathway modules which has been revealed in carbohydrate metabolisms in wastewater treatment plants xia et al 2015 besides inter taxa connections in the same niche were promoted with co existences and interactions ju and zhang 2015 suggested that inter taxa co occurrences among taxonomically distanced bacteria in activated sludge could be explained as species interactions i e commensalism or mutualism phyla cyanobacteria and proteobacteria contained genes for sulfur compounds oxidation that were found to co occur in oxygenated environments wasmund et al 2017 similar to oxidation condition in this study co occurring multispecies were studied to make efficient use of limited resources through metabolite exchange due to temporal variation in nutritional availability then provided a survival or thrived environments and enabled coexistence in diverse niches zelezniak et al 2015 thus various competitions and metabolically complementary developments of microorganisms emerged during biodegradation phase li et al 2018a under the bioaug condition the inoculated cb1190 removed 1 4 dioxane efficiently and showed negative correlations with species belonging to gloeobacter ralstonia mycobacterium janthinobacterium and variovorax etc and the network analysis showed that cb1190 only had strongly positive connections with a few co occurring taxonomically distanced genera i e cupriavidus at the same modularity demonstrating that cb1190 and its distinct microorganisms were closely bound ecologically based on network analysis in previous study li et al 2018a coupled with the decreasing relative abundance the survival and growth of cb1190 were compressed by other self adaptive bacteria even with additional cb1190 amendments and this was partially agreeable with the inter genera competition theory and the highlights of niche differences which was reported in soil environment barberan et al 2012 more importantly in this study the strong inter order co occurrence correlations implicated and projected the survival of pure and mixed bacterial cultures applied for bioaugmentation into specific environmental biogeochemical conditions 5 conclusions chemical oxidation followed by bioaugmentation completely degraded 1 4 dioxane even in the presence of cvoc mixtures confirming the effectiveness of treatment trains shifts in microbial community structures were in the course of treatment process and influenced by contaminant concentrations at individual time points and accompanied by r k strategy transitions various microbial groups recovered after exposure to peroxide a microbicide and evolved during the biodegradation with deterministic factors including competition interaction and niche differentiation biodiversity and richness were inhibited right after oxidation process but increased again during subsequent biodegradation process it is important to consider the impact of abiotic and biological remediation

19135,microbial community dynamics were characterized following combined oxidation and biodegradation treatment trains for mixtures of 1 4 dioxane and chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs in laboratory microcosms bioremediation is generally inhibited by co contaminate cvocs with only a few specific bacterial taxa reported to metabolize or cometabolize 1 4 dioxane being unaffected chemical oxidation by hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as a non selective treatment demonstrated 50 80 1 4 dioxane removal regardless of the initial cvoc concentrations post oxidation bioaugmentation with 1 4 dioxane metabolizer pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 removed the remaining 1 4 dioxane the intrinsic microbial population biodiversity richness and biomarker gene abundances decreased immediately after the brief oxidation phase but recovery of cultivable microbiomes and a more diverse community were observed during the subsequent 9 week biodegradation phase results generated from the illumina miseq sequencing and bioinformatics analyses established that generally oxidative stress tolerant genus ralstonia was abundant after the oxidation step and cupriavidus pseudolabrys afipia and sphingomonas were identified as dominant genera after aerobic incubation multidimensional analysis elucidated the separation of microbial populations as a function of time under all conditions suggesting that temporal succession is a determining factor that is independent of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs mixtures network analysis highlighted the potential interspecies competition or commensalism and dynamics of microbiomes during the biodegradation phase in line with the shifts of predominant genera and various developing directions during different steps of the treatment train collectively this study demonstrated that chemical oxidation followed by bioaugmentation is effective for treating 1 4 dioxane even in the presence of high levels of cvoc mixtures and residual peroxide a disinfectant and enhanced our understanding of microbial ecological impacts of the treatment train these results will be valuable for predicting treatment synergies that lead to cost savings and improved remedial outcomes in short term active remediation as well as long term changes to the environmental microbial communities graphical abstract image 1 keywords coupled treatment bioremediation microbial ecology k r scheme microbial networks 1 introduction biodegradation research has historically focused on exploring the fate of contaminants in biological transformation pathways under natural or engineered processes suthersan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 understanding the dynamics of environmental microbiomes enables better monitoring of the environmental media undergoing remediation processes microbiomes can serve as leading indicators of these biodegradation processes since changes of the microbial functions as well as structures influence the rate of the contaminant distribution in the environment leigh et al 2015 there are several reports of biological treatment of 1 4 dioxane deng et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 aoyagi et al 2018 inoue et al 2018 myers et al 2018 which is a high priority pollutant that is listed on the us environmental protection agency 2016 amendments to the toxic substances control act usepa 2016 moreover through its use as a solvent and solvent stabilizer 1 4 dioxane contamination in groundwater and soil is often coupled with chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs such as 1 1 1 trichloroethane tca and trichloroethylene tce mohr et al 2010 anderson et al 2012 adamson et al 2014 as well as their biological or abiotic degradation products including cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce 1 1 dichloroethene 1 1 dce and vinyl chloride brown et al 2009 thus the complexity of co contaminant mixtures as well as the general recalcitrance of 1 4 dioxane results in uncertain outcomes for biodegradation due to the sensitivity of subsurface microbiomes to metals and solvent mixtures under environmental conditions griffiths and philippot 2013 pornwongthong et al 2014 adamson et al 2015 previous studies have also indicated that chlorinated organic solvents in particular can adversely affect microorganisms e g reduction of membrane permeability inhibition of growth rate and damage to nucleic acids segura et al 2012 and negatively impact their ecological functions such as their participation in pollutant biodegradation mahendra et al 2013 adamson et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 advanced oxidation processes aops are alternatives to biological strategies for contaminant removal that are capable of producing hydroxyl sulfate radicals to decompose organic pollutants efficiently within short exposure periods merayo et al 2014 importantly aops may provide oxygen and decrease the concentrations of co contaminants eberle et al 2016 both of which benefit aerobic microorganisms jasmann et al 2017 thus field application of an aop in situ chemical oxidation isco offers the benefits of an in situ remediation approach with the potential to overcome certain limitations of bioremediation to date coupling chemical oxidation and bioremediation has produced successful results indicating improved remediation efficiencies for in situ remediation of soil contaminated with diesel kim and lee 2012 sutton et al 2014 as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs medina et al 2018 however few studies have examined the behavior of systems that combine the technologies for treating emerging contaminants such as 1 4 dioxane and cvoc mixtures there are several factors that influence the performance of a combined oxidation biodegradation treatment train including the soil type sutton et al 2014 decreases in the persistence of oxidants and the generated radical species in the presence of oxidizable materials deng et al 2015 thus it is also critical to monitor the efficiency of combined technologies when treating different levels of contaminant mixtures including 1 4 dioxane and cvocs given the potential effects of oxidants on the critical functions of indigenous microbes the responses of soil microbiomes to environmental changes as well as the resistance and resilience of soil microorganisms monitoring of microbial community structures and functions during active remediation efforts as well as after the environment transitions to passive attenuation processes need to be investigated recently microbial community analysis mca based on the application of high throughput sequencing technologies has been used as a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative tool to measure the diversity of environmental microbiomes and facilitate the exploration of phenomena that govern microbial community structure in activated sludge miao et al 2017 aoyagi et al 2018 soil chao et al 2016 and groundwater kao et al 2016 miao et al 2018 in addition mca based patterns and processes can be interpreted by niche based and or stochastic neutral theories dumbrell et al 2010 and used to assess the post oxidation microbial environments and provide a basis for further regulation and optimization of natural and enhanced bioremediation this study focused on examining a combination of oxidation biodegradation technologies used to degrade 1 4 dioxane and cvocs at various concentrations in bench scale microcosms the objective was to identify the relationships among the microbial community contaminant removal and process specific features as a result of combining chemical oxidation and biodegradation to achieve this goal we investigated the influence of key variables initial contaminant concentrations and operational duration and biological factors microbial interactions and co occurring co excluding patterns that shape overall microbial community assembly and functions these findings would expand our understanding beyond the general implication that contaminants and treatment processes change the aggregate microbial community to identifying specific individual taxa as well as the entire dynamic tendency that will be valuable in assessing the post treatment ecological risk and regulating the long term remediation efforts 2 materials and methods 2 1 site characterization and contaminants material for lab scale testing was collected from a site located in the southern united states where groundwater and soil are impacted by previous military and industrial activities including vapor degreasing the contaminants of concern cocs include 1 4 dioxane and multiple cvocs key site characteristics are summarized in table s1 and are described in detail in strategic environmental research and development program serdp project report er 2307 adamson et al 2017 2 2 microcosm constructions and conditions the bench scale microcosm study was conducted in 250 ml glass bottles with screw cap mininert valves containing 50 ml groundwater and 10 g soil that collected from the site two levels of contaminants 500 and 5000 μg l were spiked individually and in mixtures to mimic natural conditions table 1 these two levels were selected because they represent a low to moderate concentration and a high concentration respectively using typical contaminated groundwater plume concentration ranges for 1 4 dioxane and cvocs described in adamson et al 2015 this resulted in four sets of microcosms including high 1 4 dioxane high cvocs h dx h cv high 1 4 dioxane low cvocs h dx l cv low 1 4 dioxane low cvocs l dx l cv and low 1 4 dioxane only l dx a bioaugmentation set bioaug was also prepared as a positive biodegradation control by adding 1 4 dioxane metabolizing and mineralizing bacterial strain pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 cb1190 mahendra and alvarez cohen 2005 2006 mahendra et al 2007 and incubated with high 1 4 dioxane and low cvocs initial concentrations a heat sterilized control set was also prepared to correct for abiotic loss corrections 2 3 combined treatment trains and amendment formulations hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was selected as the oxidant and the optimal dose for unamended groundwater and soil mixture slurry was 0 96 mm dose tests prior to microcosms are summarized in table s2 the microcosms were first established with different concentrations of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs then h2o2 was added and oxidation process conducted with continuous 100 rpm agitation at room temperature with ph at 4 5 100 mg feso4 7h2o and 10 sulfuric acid simulating the fenton type reaction the oxidation process lasted for 12 h based on the dose test to achieve expected partial 1 4 dioxane removals 50 then was quenched with naoh and the remaining 1 4 dioxane in the microcosms was incubated for following 9 week biodegradation process 30 c 150 rpm shaking cb1190 was added before and after oxidation process and 5000 μg l 1 4 dioxane was added in microcosms whenever 1 4 dioxane dropped below detection limit during the incubation period to maintain bacterial viability and test the reproducibility in cb1190 augmented bottles 2 4 sample collection and analytical methods four time points were selected during the combined treatment train for dna extraction 300 μl slurry including before oxidation ob1 and after oxidation ob2 day 0 middle of biodegradation ob3 day 17 where 1 4 dioxane was first depleted and second batch of cb1190 was added and the end of biodegradation ob4 day 63 1 4 dioxane 200 μl aliquots was measured every week as described previously zhang et al 2016 by using gc ms 1 1000 μg l and gc fid 1 100 mg l details in methods s1

statistical analyses the generated sequences of 16s rrna genes were grouped and preprocessed in mothur software v 1 40 0 schloss et al 2009 and quality controlled the assembled paired end reads with criteria i an average quality cutoff at q30 ii ambiguous bases at 0 chao et al 2016 iii minimum length at 400 bp the chimeras were detected and identified by using chimera vsearch and assembled reads that aligned and classified to chloroplasts mitochondria or eukaryota based on silva database were discarded by using remove lineage finally the number of remaining quality controlled reads in each sample were normalized to 30 000 and all datasets were submitted to metagemonics rapid annotation using subsystem technology mg rast server with accession numbers 4774619 3 the normalized sequences were further clustered into different operational taxonomic units otus with command cluster split at 0 03 cutoff 97 similarity producing a total of 3412 otus after removing singletons an otu with one

clara algorithm kaufman and rousseeuw 2009 this method was based on partitioning around medoids pam which refers to an object within a cluster minimizing the sum of dissimilarities among all cluster

correlation with strict coefficients at 0 6 and significant cutoff p value at 0 01 barberan et al 2012 random incidence r and observed incidence o of taxa co occurrence were statistically checked on

formula r 2 n 1 n 2 n n 1 where n1 and n2 represented order1 s and order2 s otus number in the network and n is total nodes in the network the ratio of o to r o r was used as criteria of nonrandom ssa between two different orders ju et al 2017 2 8 data visualization all visualizations were made by using r v 3 4 0 with packages phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 for pcoa complexheatmap gu et al 2016

al 2009 3 results 3 1 microcosm performance and biomarker detection h2o2 was an effective oxidant for the 12 h oxidation period under each condition and high 1 4 dioxane reductions between 80 and 82 were achieved except for the h dx h cv condition where only 50 of the 1 4 dioxane was removed fig 1 in the h dx h cv condition 9 45 of the initial tca remained after oxidation while cvocs were completely removed after 12 h oxidation in all other conditions the biodegradation phase following the aop phase lasted for another 9 weeks and 1 4 dioxane was stable in each non bioaugmented microcosm without apparent indigenous 1 4 dioxane removals under bioaugmentation 1 4 dioxane was spiked to 919 μg l at day 17 ob3 after the initial dose of 1 4 dioxane had been depleted and cb1190 1 10 v v was added at same time 1 4 dioxane was monitored to below detection continuously at days 30 49 and 63 ob4 respectively and 1 4 dioxane had to be spiked again at days 30 5049 μg l and 49 3517 μg l respectively fig 1 no significant 1 4 dioxane removals were observed during the treatment train under each condition in the heat sterilized abiotic control microcosms table s4 the biomarker genes dxmb and aldh were only observed in the bioaugmentation microcosms and were consistent with spiked cb1190 at each feeding time point in addition both dxmb and aldh were inhibited by three to four orders of magnitude directly after the oxidation phase but increased during the post aop biodegradation phase and reached to 3 75 106 copies ml and 2 22 106 copies ml respectively fig s1 3 2 associations among microcosm performances and microbial α diversity both spearman s rank and pearson s linear correlations showed no significant connections among biodiversity richness and 1 4 dioxane concentrations table s5 however the shannon index indicated that biodiversity under all conditions was reduced significantly p value 0 05 during the oxidation phase except for the h dx h cv condition fig 2 table s6 afterwards during the first stage of the biodegradation phase from ob2 day 0 to ob3 day 17 the biodiversity was relatively stable under h dx h cv h dx l cv and l dx l cv but increased significantly under l dx and bioaug conditions rapid and significant increases of biodiversity were observed after 9 week incubation of biodegradation from ob3 to ob4 day 63 under all conditions the richness metrics represented by the chao1 index and observed species 0 97 otu depict the change of species along with treatment trains both of which kept decreasing from ob1 to ob3 under all conditions with cvocs under low 1 4 dioxane only condition the richness of microbial community started to recover from ob2 to ob3 which occurred earlier than in microcosms with cvocs fig 2 table s6 3 3 taxonomic profiles shift in treatment trains the taxonomic classification showed that the most abundant phyla before oxidation were proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes cyanobacteria and bacteroidetes fig s2 the relative abundance of proteobacteria class gammaproteobacteria was reduced during the oxidation phase under all conditions except h dx h cv where proteobacteria class betaproteobacteria increased by 10 with decreasing actinobacteria under bioaug h dx h cv and h dx l cv conditions proteobacteria decreased at ob3 but increased with low 1 4 dioxane only spikes when comparing conditions with the same initial 1 4 dioxane concentration the presence of lower levels of cvocs induced a rebound of proteobacteria class alphaproteobacteria at ob4 which was in contrast to the trend observed at higher cvoc levels phylum actinobacteria was observed to increase during the biodegradation phase under bioaug and h dx h cv conditions but was found to decrease under l dx condition phylum firmicutes carrying the class bacilli showed opposite trends to proteobacteria along with treatment trains under each condition and only accumulated under h dx h cv condition at ob4 phylum cyanobacteria carrying the class gloeobacteria accumulated after oxidation at ob2 and only continuously increased under h dx h cv conditions while phylum bacteroidetes carrying the classes sphingobacteriia and cytophagia was abundant after biodegradation at ob4 at genus and species 0 97 otus levels fig 2 some originally highly abundant genera were inhibited by the oxidant exposure and continued to decrease for the duration of the incubation including pseudomonas massilla aquabacterium variovorax and an unclassified genus in pseudomonadaceae genus pseudomonas was the dominant microorganism at the beginning but inhibited by the chemical oxidation phase and kept decreasing during the biodegradation phase interestingly two main otus in pseudomonas showed opposite responses to oxidation pseudomonas cerasi 58 otu1 was reduced while pseudomonas azotoformans nbrc 12693 otu6 increased but both otus decreased at ob3 and ob4 genus ralstonia was the only abundant genus demonstrating oxidative tolerance and increased in abundance after oxidation under all conditions while decreasing relatively during the post aop phase other genera demonstrating oxidative tolerance were only observed under specific conditions such as pelomonas under bioaug h dx h cv and l dx l cv janthinobacterium under bioaug and l dx l cv streptococcus under bioaug and h dx l cv gloeobacter under bioaug h dx h cv and l dx l cv etc notably genus mycobacterium which was dominant under l dx condition at ob2 showed early inhibition under h dx h cv condition but grew abundant again during the biodegradation phase for the h dx h cv condition moreover during the initial stage of biodegradation from ob2 to ob3 various genera recovered in distinct ways from prior exposure to oxidant radicals along with the post aop burst of biodiversity more genera thrived and interacted during the 9 week incubation showing different responses to operational conditions and abundant cupriavidus pseudolabrys sphingomonas continued to accumulate through ob4 under all conditions pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 was spiked at ob1 but was expected to be inhibited after oxidation during the biodegradation phase cb1190 was a weakly competitive member of the overall microbial population reaching to 23 67 at ob4 even after second spike at ob3 day 17 to reach 32 80 3 4 microbial population dynamics linked to treatment trains the microbial community shifted rapidly along with time during the whole treatment train incubation results indicate that time was a better variable for explaining the dynamics of the microbial community fig 3 b and d color coded than the presence and or concentration of co contaminants fig s3 pcoa biplots based on unifrac distances described that both microbial membership unweighted and abundance weighted developed along with treatment trains under different conditions furthermore the oxidation phase clearly influenced the microbial community both in terms of membership and abundance the bacterial membership unweighted fig 3c and d seemed to separate more apparently than bacterial abundance weighted fig 3a and b during the biodegradation phase and this was consistent with the venn diagram showing that more species were identified at ob4 fig s4 when taking the conditions into consideration the community in h dx h cv condition triangles in fig 3a and c changed more slowly than in other conditions while the community in the l dx condition cross in fig 3a and c evolved relatively faster compared to other conditions moreover the members at ob3 tended to merge with ob2 fig 3d while the abundances were in relative proximity to ob4 fig 3c indicating the unstable impacts under different conditions interestingly microbiomes at ob4 showed more clear boundaries among conditions and the linear connections based pearson correlation showed that samples at ob4 only had solid connections within same conditions purple in fig 4 a additionally the impact from oxidation reduced the connections among samples under different conditions when comparing between ob1 green in fig 4a and ob2 thinner edge of blue in fig 4a while the signs of recovery could be found at ob3 orange in fig 4a since more connections were re built the cluster analyses based on unsupervised classification ungrouped depicted the relative distance of each sample and microbial community structure showed deviations under different conditions at ob4 with relatively further shifts than the rest of the samples fig 4b in clustered samples collected at ob1 ob2 and ob3 samples belonging to ob2 and ob3 were closely related regardless of the conditions fig s5 3 5 co occurrence and co exclusion patterns in the combined treatment trains in networks constructed based on the otus that totaled over 1 in all samples only the strong coefficients 0 6 or 0 6 and significant p 0 01 correlations were presented which generally indicated the role of cooperative and competitive relations in guiding community dynamics the output positive network contained 711 pairs of spearman correlations between 168 otus fig 5 while the negative had 69 strong pairs between 51 otus fig s6 the otus in the positive network co occurrence were mainly distributed into 12 phyla which was consistent with the trend of taxonomic classification that proteobacteria 54 17 actinobacteria 13 10 firmicutes 14 29 cyanobacteria 2 98 and bacteroidetes 8 33 were the top five most abundant phyla among them proteobacteria had 220 connections and 142 of 220 were intra phylum within phylum pairs and this ratio were 22 of 83 and 11 of 76 for firmicutes and actinobacteria respectively fig 5a when compared against the network grouped by phyla fig 5a most niches were occupied by multiple interacted phyla except for module iii where mostly matched a whole part of proteobacteria for example phyla proteobacteria and cyanobacteria otu13 25 69 88 and 95 yellow in fig 5a shared in same niche module v and module ii contained proteobacteria firmicutes otu32 48 50 58 70 green in fig 5a and actinobacteria otu9 28 37 87 153 orange in fig 5a moreover the co exclusion pattern showed unmodularized distribution of phyla demonstrating the inter or intra phylum competitions within community otu60 comamonadaceae unclassified 72 ramlibacter 73 hydrogenophaga and 138 comamonadaceae unclassified belonging to proteobacteria showed competitions with proteobacteria otu23 pelomonas respectively occupying the module ii in negative networks blue in fig s6b moreover otu6 pseudomonas and 19 janthinobacterium in proteobacteria had more dense negative connections large nodes in fig s6a with inter or intra phylum otus in module iii purple in fig s6b detailed network and statistical analyses were applied to the microbial community under bioaug condition to explore the connections of bioaugmented cb1190 with other otus coupled with incidence analysis to reveal the observed random connections the output network was constructed with 405 pairs of strong connections among 81 otus in which 356 pairs were positive and 49 pairs were negative fig s8a the spiked cb1190 removed 1 4 dioxane efficiently and showed negative correlations with species belonged to gloeobacter ralstonia mycobacterium janthinobacterium etc fig s7 moreover the cb1190 strongly connected with a few co occurring genera i e cupriavidus that were observed to share in the same module indicating their close interactions fig s8b this was also confirmed by incidence analysis between otus from different orders cb1190 s higher rank taxon pseudonocardiales tended to co occur with rhizobiales o r 4 33 bacillales o r 4 00 and sphingobacteriales o r 3 00 table s7 4 discussion bioremediation is generally inhibited by co contaminated cvocs with only a few specific bacterial taxa reported to metabolize or cometabolize 1 4 dioxane being unaffected in this study chemical oxidation as a non selective treatment demonstrated 50 80 1 4 dioxane removal regardless of the initial cvocs stress post oxidation bioaugmentation with 1 4 dioxane degrader pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 cb1190 removed the remaining 1 4 dioxane tce and dce were rapidly removed during the 12 h oxidation phase while 1 4 dioxane was depleted by 70 80 this is consistent with oxidation studies that 1 4 dioxane was more difficult to degrade than chlorinated solvents eberle et al 2016 but hydroxyl radicals generated during h2o2 decomposition could destroy the structure of 1 4 dioxane ikehata et al 2016 h2o2 alone has been reported to be not as effective compared with o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 technologies ikehata et al 2016 andaluri and suri 2017 but a dose of 0 96 mm successfully achieved the treatment goal for the biodegradation phase that followed oxidation 1 1 1 tca was only detected post oxidation under the h dx h cv condition this condition also exhibited lower 1 4 dioxane removals indicating lower susceptibility of tca to chemical oxidation eberle et al 2016 and its negative impact on 1 4 dioxane degradations during the following 9 week biodegradation phase the treatment objective of nearly complete 1 4 dioxane removal was accomplished only under the bioaugmentation condition bioaug while no statistically significant 1 4 dioxane degradation was observed for the remaining non bioaugmented conditions the systems that were bioaugmented with cb1190 degraded 1 4 dioxane completely which is supported by the detection of dioxane monooxygenase dxmo encoding gene dxmb and aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh encoding gene aldh gedalanga et al 2014 this is consistent with the findings of kim and lee 2012 that biodegradation as a second step will achieve higher efficiency due to the addition of microorganisms expressing the appropriate biodegradative enzymes which is in line with the objective of bioaugmentation unfortunately both dxmb and aldh were not detected in the native samples during the incubation process indicating a general lack of 1 4 dioxane degraders in the indigenous microbiomes in site materials both biomarker genes were detected in recent work that tracked a cvoc free 1 4 dioxane plume with reasonable accuracy and strongly suggested that the presence of these biomarkers was associated with 1 4 dioxane and that microorganisms containing these biomarkers were degrading 1 4 dioxane gedalanga et al 2016 the incomplete removals under non bioaugmented conditions can likely be attributed to insufficient time to grow a sufficient population in part because the initial abundance of metabolizing or cometabolizing 1 4 dioxane degraders was low in addition the oxidation process may have released dissolved organic carbon doc that was preferentially biodegraded by microorganisms over 1 4 dioxane this process has been reported in oil contaminated soil sutton et al 2014 moreover the oxidation process appears to have inhibited intrinsic microorganisms which potentially biodegrade 1 4 dioxane due to microbial mortality and inactivation in the presence of hydroxyl radicals silva castro et al 2013 and has been similarly reported for a diesel contaminated site chen et al 2016 1 4 dioxane oxidation by products including formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde were reported to have geno and cyto toxicity li et al 2018b that can also impact native bacteria as well as affect public and ecological health by reducing the oxidant dose and thus reducing the expense and potential inhibitory effects associated with an oxidation only treatment approach the results of this study demonstrated that an oxidation bioaugmentation strategy is able to completely remove 1 4 dioxane while reducing the economic and environmental concerns the biodiversity and richness generally decreased immediately after oxidation under each condition and this pattern is consistent with previous studies that report dramatic declines in species richness and diversity after aops silva castro et al 2013 medina et al 2018 however the h dx h cv condition showed no significant change which could be related to the higher residual levels of 1 4 dioxane and tca indicating weaker oxidative effects on the microbial community in the presence of background 1 4 dioxane and tca the continuously decreasing biodiversity and richness were detected under h dx h cv h dx l cv and l dx l cv conditions and medina et al 2018 also found the similar post oxidation diversity and richness decreases along with the changes of predominant microbes while microorganisms under l dx condition showed rapid recovery from ob2 to ob3 this comparison demonstrated that the initial cvocs had negative impacts on the recovery of the microbial community even after the oxidation phase potentially due to the accumulation of epoxide intermediates or byproducts of oxidized cvocs li and zhu 2016 moreover the spiked cb1190 improved the richness and diversity even under bioaug condition showing the potential co occurrence of species in the microcosms a notable recovery of richness and diversity under all conditions was observed in the 9 week incubation and this could be attributed to the adaption of functional microorganisms to the highly bioavailable oxidative products silva castro et al 2013 and diverse communities tended to stabilize and contributed to ecosystem functions and service bell et al 2005 this general decreasing increasing biodiversity trend is consistent with previous studies with different oxidation reactions such as fenton laurent et al 2012 permanganate luhrs et al 2006 and persulfate richardson et al 2010 where microbial populations and diversity were reduced after oxidation but recovered during post treatment periods additionally the oxidation phase might also induce mutations in microorganisms which could be transferred by horizontal gene transfer hgt and increase the community s overall tolerance to chemical oxidation wilson and metcalf 2005 for the dynamics of taxonomic classification taxa responded differently with various initial 1 4 dioxane and cvocs members of proteobacteria especially the class betaproteobacteria were found to increase only under h dx h cv condition in line with the resistance to chlorinated compounds kao et al 2016 however both beta and gamma proteobacteria fluctuated during the post aop process while only alphaproteobacteria showed the same increasing trend after oxidation under all conditions and dominated at ob4 indicating higher competitive capability the remaining tca after oxidation under h dx h cv induced slower recoveries of firmicutes and actinobacteria compared with other conditions and inhibited bacteroidetes which thrived at ob4 under other conditions indicating weak competition and sensitivity to chlorinated compounds lin et al 2016 furthermore cyanobacteria showed general tolerance to oxidative stress with increasing abundance because they are equipped with glutaredoxin enzymes ferredoxin enzymes and fur like regulators cassier chauvat and chauvat 2015 interestingly firmicutes and actinobacteria demonstrated oxidative tolerance with backgrounds of high 1 4 dioxane and low cvocs respectively bioaugmented cb1190 belonging to actinobacter had simplified the composition and driven the change of phyla more specific to the genera level some originally highly abundant genera including pseudomonas massilla aquabacterium and variovorax were inhibited by the oxidation phase and decreased further in biodegradation phase indicating that those genera in the microbial community were unable to overcome oxidative stress medina et al 2018 however the dominant pseudomonas were composed of two main otus that showed opposite trends and pseudomonas azotoformans strain nbrc 12693 thrived after oxidation which has been reported to have oxidative tolerance while both pseudomonas strains were inhibited during the biodegradation phase indicating the co exclusion with other microorganisms many more genera were found to resist oxidation i e ralstonia gloeobacter pelomonas and streptococcus etc among them ralstonia was reported as a plant pathogen and carries oxidative stress response regulator oxyr which was essential for the hydrogen peroxide stress response flores cruz and allen 2011 in addition ralstonia was also enriched in the dioxane degrading consortia he et al 2017 which may also have been selected because of the remaining 1 4 dioxane however the substance and species information was uncertain in microcosms and the cvocs and chemical oxidation process might have impacts on monooxygenase expression thus the presence of ralstonia does not necessarily indicate removal of 1 4 dioxane in this study gloeobacter belonging to cyanobacteria was reported to be able to persist in clo2 conditions walden et al 2015 and was confirmed to have tolerance to oxidation in this study moreover along with the surge of biodiversity more genera were classified during the 9 week incubation represented by afipia pseudolabrys sphingomonas and cupriavidus etc he et al 2017 reported afipia and cupriavidus were enriched together from uncontaminated soil by using 1 4 dioxane indicating the selection and stimulation of these microorganisms during our study by the remaining 1 4 dioxane in the microcosms as well as their abilities to outcompete other microbes for resources despite afipia sp d1 demonstrated ability to degrade 1 4 dioxane as the sole carbon and energy source sei et al 2013 the species identification in afipia was uncertain and accumulated genus afipia in this study might need an extended incubation period besides pseudolabrys sphingomonas and cupriavidus were ubiquitous in hydrocarbon rich soil and identified as hydrocarbon degraders aislabie et al 2006 yang et al 2014 medina et al 2018 these thriving genera imply that the remaining 1 4 dioxane and oxidized doc provided rich carbon sources for competing microorganisms these types of detailed taxonomic information can help further evaluation of remediation work and serve as a foundation for future ecosystem research the whole dynamic change and succession of microbial community during the combined treatment trains under each condition could also be explained by using analogous r k strategy medina et al 2018 which described the relatively fast unstable competitive r strategist and slow stable equal k strategist growth conditions of microorganisms cycon et al 2013 in this study dominant microbes after oxidation at ob2 had higher resistance capability and less competition identifying the k strategists under each condition afterwards the community transferred from k to r strategy because of the initial adaption and competition during the early part of the biodegradation process samples from ob2 to ob3 were weak thinner edges or disordered connected e g ob2 ll connected ob3 hh ob2 l connected ob3 aug and this indicated an unstable or erroneous development of microbial community more importantly with the different levels of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs their degradation intermediates with various concentrations and compositions would also induce the versatile r strategists under different conditions explaining the uneven distribution of microbial community and rebound of biodiversity at ob3 this was also defined as intermediate disturbance hypothesis idh that intermediate levels of disturbance under different conditions would create patches at different levels of succession promoting coexistence of microbes and competitors at the specific regime roxburgh et al 2004 at the end of treatment train more thriving genera species increased and outcompeted weak ones after 9 weeks and tended to be equitable with the indicator of higher richness and biodiversity showing the signs of k strategy cycon et al 2013 moreover samples within each condition at ob4 had stronger connections that were shown on thinner edges fig 4a and connected with same condition samples at ob3 e g ob3 l and ob4 l but fewer connections with other samples indicating the relatively stable status of microbial community at ob4 based on the dynamic successions pcoa showed that the microbiomes under all conditions followed temporal succession and shared relatively similar developments of compositions and diversities along with operations the membership of community unweighted unifrac at different time points grouped separately and was evident with the biodiversity indicating the deviation of microbiomes were more dependent on treatment progress however when the abundances of the community were taken into account more overlaps were observed among groups explicating that the successions were intercepted slightly by the different conditions within the timelines thus the populations followed the treatment trains changes that were relatively independent of the contaminant concentrations this chronological change was defined as a deterministic process and vanwonterghem et al 2014 similarly suggested that deterministic processes drove the community assembly with highly synchronized population dynamics in three individual cellulose degrading bioreactors moreover ju et al 2017 also described that the operating time rather than physicochemical conditions e g vfas and nh4 n and operational parameters i e srt and olr directed the community variations and shifting trends however the level of contaminants could also play minor roles in determining and differentiating the detailed microbial progress just within the deterministic process interestingly based on the weighted unifrac pcoa samples at ob4 seemed to group along with the different conditions thus cluster analysis grouping samples based on the relative dissimilarity showed that the microbial community developed in different ways at the end of biodegradation as compared with other time points this confirms that the richness and biodiversity thrived and blossomed and also illustrates the impacts of conditions on the evolution of microbiomes in addition community at ob2 and ob3 tended to cluster together indicating the transferred period of the system partly in line with the above k r transition and the competition during the transition was also reflected in the network that otus belonged to the same taxa were forcedly adaptive to different niches and the turnover of otus among different niches implicating the competition in guiding the structures ju et al 2017 moreover co exclusion was found even within same phylum reflecting competition among these microorganisms for limited resources of essential growth factors nielsen et al 2012 the inter species co occurrences could be due to the enzymatic associations within distinctive pathway modules which has been revealed in carbohydrate metabolisms in wastewater treatment plants xia et al 2015 besides inter taxa connections in the same niche were promoted with co existences and interactions ju and zhang 2015 suggested that inter taxa co occurrences among taxonomically distanced bacteria in activated sludge could be explained as species interactions i e commensalism or mutualism phyla cyanobacteria and proteobacteria contained genes for sulfur compounds oxidation that were found to co occur in oxygenated environments wasmund et al 2017 similar to oxidation condition in this study co occurring multispecies were studied to make efficient use of limited resources through metabolite exchange due to temporal variation in nutritional availability then provided a survival or thrived environments and enabled coexistence in diverse niches zelezniak et al 2015 thus various competitions and metabolically complementary developments of microorganisms emerged during biodegradation phase li et al 2018a under the bioaug condition the inoculated cb1190 removed 1 4 dioxane efficiently and showed negative correlations with species belonging to gloeobacter ralstonia mycobacterium janthinobacterium and variovorax etc and the network analysis showed that cb1190 only had strongly positive connections with a few co occurring taxonomically distanced genera i e cupriavidus at the same modularity demonstrating that cb1190 and its distinct microorganisms were closely bound ecologically based on network analysis in previous study li et al 2018a coupled with the decreasing relative abundance the survival and growth of cb1190 were compressed by other self adaptive bacteria even with additional cb1190 amendments and this was partially agreeable with the inter genera competition theory and the highlights of niche differences which was reported in soil environment barberan et al 2012 more importantly in this study the strong inter order co occurrence correlations implicated and projected the survival of pure and mixed bacterial cultures applied for bioaugmentation into specific environmental biogeochemical conditions 5 conclusions chemical oxidation followed by bioaugmentation completely degraded 1 4 dioxane even in the presence of cvoc mixtures confirming the effectiveness of treatment trains shifts in microbial community structures were in the course of treatment process and influenced by contaminant concentrations at individual time points and accompanied by r k strategy transitions various microbial groups recovered after exposure to peroxide a microbicide and evolved during the biodegradation with deterministic factors including competition interaction and niche differentiation biodiversity and richness were inhibited right after oxidation process but increased again during subsequent biodegradation process it is important to consider the impact of abiotic and biological remediation

19136,this study aimed to characterise the gas liquid flow and mixing behaviour in a gas mixed anaerobic digester by improving phase interaction modelling using computational fluid dynamics cfd a 2d axisymmetric model validated with experimental data was set up using an eulerian eulerian method uncertainty factors including bubble size phase interaction forces and liquid rheology were found to significantly influence the flow field a more reliable and complete validation was obtained by critical comparison and assessment of the referred experimental data compared to the models reported in other studies additionally justifiable corrections and predictions in detail were obtained mixing was evaluated by trajectory tracking of a large number of particles based on an euler lagrange method the mixing performance approximated to a laminar flow reactor lfr that distinctly deviated from expected continuous stirred tank reactor cstr design indicating limited enhancement from the applied gas sparging strategy in the studied digester the study shows the importance of a proper phase interaction description for a reliable hydrodynamic characterisation and mixing evaluation in gas mixed digesters validations bend to experimental data without a critical assessment may lead to an inaccurate model for further scaled up applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion cfd two phase flow hydrodynamics mixing 1 introduction stabilisation of biomass and its biochemical conversion into energy rich biogas are commonly performed in anaerobic digesters in which good mass transfer and heat transfer rely on a proper mixing in digesters designed as a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr mixing is commonly achieved by biogas recirculation lindmark et al 2014 however the mixing is often insufficient in full scale gas mixed digesters due to unaccounted scale up effects bello mendoza and sharratt 1998 capela et al 2009 terashima et al 2009 prevailing short circuiting or dead zones in practice result in treatment performances below the theoretical potential capela et al 2009 samstag et al 2016 in order to optimise mixing the flow behaviour and mixing performance should be well characterised and the actual contribution to mixing from the biogas recirculation should be evaluated any additional mixing brought forward by the produced biogas resulting from sludge digestion is not taken into account in the design process and the exact impact of evolving biogas has not yet been evaluated for research purposes it is very challenging to obtain a clear insight of the mixing behaviour in an opaque and gas tight system when using only experimental approaches a general mixing pattern can be determined using tracer tests capela et al 2009 smith et al 1993 terashima et al 2009 but local flow fields responsible for any poor mixing cannot be determined from the results of tracer residence time distribution rtd advanced non invasive techniques such as computer automated radioactive particle tracking carpt and computed tomography ct can provide detailed information of flow fields karim et al 2004 varma and al dahhan 2007 but are yet not applicable to full scale facilities computational fluid dynamics cfd has often been recognised as a promising approach to characterise and optimise hydrodynamics in biological processes wicklein et al 2016 wu 2013 however only few studies have focused on gas mixed anaerobic digesters coughtrie et al 2013 dapelo et al 2015 dapelo and bridgeman 2018 karim et al 2007 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 wu 2010a vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 developed a 3d model to simulate a digester based on a lab scale experimental study karim et al 2004 a good qualitative agreement to the experimental data was reported and specific configurational factors were investigated for reducing the poorly mixed space simulations with more configurational modification were carried out using the finite element method karim et al 2007 in addition some numerical influencing factors on hydrodynamics were considered including reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models for turbulence coughtrie et al 2013 wu 2010a and single multiphase approaches for gas liquid flow coughtrie et al 2013 dapelo et al 2015 dapelo and bridgeman 2018 in the gas mixed digesters sludge flow and mixing are mainly driven by energy from the gas sparging therefore a proper characterisation of the phase interaction between gas and liquid sludge is crucial however in the aforementioned studies the two phase flow modelling was still limited with considerable simplifications and uncertainties some studies eliminated the two phase interaction region and essentially simulated a single phase flow coughtrie et al 2013 karim et al 2007 although sludge rheology has been recognised as important for design and operation of sludge treatment processes eshtiaghi et al 2013 no rheological measurements of the used sludge were reported karim et al 2007 hence different types of liquids were used including newtonian coughtrie et al 2013 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 and non newtonian fluids karim et al 2007 wu 2010a to validate the same experimental data karim et al 2004 despite the different used rheology similar good agreements were reported moreover the model validations were incomplete involving only a part of the experimental results thus not convincing enough although a more detailed model validation was done by dapelo et al 2015 the studied reactor was essentially a bubble column with a bottom mounted nozzle dapelo et al 2015 dapelo and bridgeman 2018 different from the full scale digesters with vertical hanging gas lances therefore the aforementioned description of the two phase flow and limited model validation should be improved this study aimed at developing a reliable cfd model in a scaled down digester in order to further guide process assessment and optimisation in scaled up systems the focus was on modelling the gas sludge interaction process and detailed model validation and mixing evaluations were carried out 2 materials methods 2 1 computational domain and mesh a computational domain was created based on the gas lift digester studied by karim et al 2004 which was a 7 2 l cylindrical tank concentrically mounted with a gas injection pipe 0 5 cm inner diameter and a draft tube 4 4 cm inner diameter karim et al 2004 more detailed information is given in fig 1 a considering the geometry and layout a 2d axisymmetric domain was developed as shown in fig 1b a central axis is used a free surface for the liquid phase is defined at the top and the other boundaries are constructed according to the original design structured grids were used for meshing and finer grids were applied within the sensitive regions of phase interaction around the gas pipe and the draft tube fig 1b to check grid independency 5 characteristic grid sizes a through e from coarse to fine were created which are shown in table 1 2 2 governing equations and models considering the focus on bubbly flow and not on single bubble motion an eulerian eulerian model was utilised in which the gas phase is treated as a continuum similar to the liquid phase for the sake of simplicity solid particle motion interfacial mass transfer and heat transfer were neglected and a single bubble diameter set for the gas phase transient simulations were implemented hence the governing equations given below were solved for each phase 2 2 1 volume fraction equation the volume of each phase in a control cell is determined as 1 v i v α i d v 2 i 1 n α i 1 where v denotes the volume α the volume fraction n the number of phases and subscript i refers to the phase liquid or gas 2 2 2 mass conservation equation 3

drag force f d lift force f l and turbulent dispersion force f t are taken into account specific models were applied to close these phase interaction forces 2 2 4 models for phase interaction forces 1 drag force the drag force is represented by solving the interphase momentum exchange term from the gas phase g to the liquid phase l as expressed in eq 6 6 f d l ρ g f d 6 t g d g a i n v g v l where

primary phase and is expressed as 11 f l l c l ρ l α g v l v g v l where c l denotes the lift coefficient and is defined by the legendre magnaudet model legendre and magnaudet 1998 12 c l c l l o w r

liquid phase which is calculated by solving the k ε model 2 2 5 turbulence closure regarding the reported considerable turbulent kinetic energy karim et al 2004 turbulence needed to be modelled in this process turbulence originates from the large velocity differences induced by gas sparging which is strongly correlated to bubbly regions moreover modified rans models have been found to be appropriate for a low re non newtonian flow wu 2010b considering the localised bubbly and turbulent distribution the rng k ε mixture turbulence model was applied which is more suitable to nearly stratified and low re multiphase flows orszag et al 1993 16 t ρ m k ρ m v m k α k μ e f f k g k m ρ m ε 17 t ρ m ε ρ m v m ε α ε μ e f f ε c 1 ε ε k g k m ρ m c 2 ε ε 2 k where α k and α ε are the

due to the finer grids the first grid layer attaching wall boundaries could be in the viscous sub layer of turbulence y 5 hence an enhanced wall function was applied to correctly calculate the near wall region flow field covering both linear and logarithmic patterns 2 2 6 phases the detailed phase physical properties are shown in table 2 for the primary phase different fluids were used including newtonian water and non newtonian sludge 1 and 2 that were described by the power law 21 μ k γ n 1 where k denotes the flow consistency index γ the shear rate and n the flow behaviour power law index sludge 1 data were from literature achkari begdouri and goodrich 1992 sludge 2 was the waste activated sludge sampled from wastewater treatment plant de groote lucht the netherlands the rheology was measured according to our previous work wei et al 2018 and total solids ts were measured according to standard methods apha 2012 the secondary phase was set as spherical air bubbles with a diameter in the range of 1 10 mm 2 2 7 euler lagrange method an euler lagrange method was applied to track particle trajectories and evaluate the mixing spherical particles with the same settings to the experiment karim et al 2004 were used in a one way coupling simulation the turbulence dispersion by discrete random walk model virtual mass and pressure gradient effects on particles were considered

viscosity a larger number of particles 9063 were released and tracked at different gas flow rates 2 3 boundary conditions involved boundary conditions included axisymmetric centreline velocity inlet degassing top and wall the axisymmetric centreline was set for creating a 3d axisymmetric circumstance the velocity inlet was for gas injection the degassing top was for discharging the gas phase while retaining the liquid phase the wall condition including no slip for liquid and free slip for gas was set at the other boundaries 2 4 main simulation settings in the transient simulations time step setting obeyed the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition and the first order implicit scheme was used the phase coupled simple scheme was utilised for pressure velocity coupling high order schemes including second order upwind quick leonard and mokhtari 1990 and muscl van leer 1979 were set for improving simulation accuracy regarding the relatively complicated process modelled and performance achieved the simulations were done in a stringent way with satisfactory convergence 1 a desired criterion of 1 10 5 was used for residuals of most parameters while a more reasonable order of 10 4 was used for the continuity and gas velocity residuals because residual values of the aforementioned parameters were difficult to reach 1 10 5 even using a quite small time step of 1 10 6 s 1 10 4 s already fits the cfl condition 2 the gas mass flow rate and liquid flux were also monitored and achieved satisfactory balance imbalance 5 the simulations were implemented using the commercial package ansys fluent 16 2 mainly on a dell optiplex 7010 computer with intel core i5 3740 and 8 gb ram when running two parallel processors the computational time ranged between 1 and 10 days 3 results and discussion 3 1 grid independence test a grid independence test was performed first using the grid convergence index gci method celik et al 2008 roache 1994 the axial velocities at heights of 11 25 cm and 18 25 cm were used for the assessment mesh d and e were found to have quite similar profiles and values of the velocity and the gci results gcicd 3 3 3 5 gcide 0 7 1 1 were in an asymptotic range close to 1 1 02 0 02 indicating that the grid independence was achieved considering smaller number of grid cells and less computational consumption mesh d was selected as optimal for the following simulations the detailed results and interpretation can be found in the supplementary material fig s1 and table s1 3 2 impacts of uncertain parameters on flow field 3 2 1 bubble size as mentioned in the introduction some uncertainties needed to be investigated although no experimental data are available to support proper identification of a characteristic bubble size is important in the model calculations to achieve a clear estimation only the drag force was applied for phase interaction and two distinct fluids water newtonian and sludge 1 non newtonian achkari begdouri and goodrich 1992 were used according to the references lehr et al 2002 polli et al 2002 schäfer et al 2002 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 wu 2010a bubbles with diameters ranging from 1 mm to 10 mm can be expected fig 2 shows the liquid axial velocity profiles at 1 2 depth zooming in inside the draft tube although the peak became smaller similar velocity profiles of the water were obtained as the bubble size increased especially larger than 3 mm fig 2a however different profiles were obtained in sludge 1 as the bubble size increased a more substantial decrease was found in the peak value and the peak position also moved further from the centreline fig 2b similar tendencies were found at the other heights in both fluids data not shown the velocity independency on the bubbles over 3 mm agreed with a previous study using water as well vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 in which the corresponding bubble size was 2 mm and 10 mm was set in their simulations however the velocity was quite sensitive to the bubble size in sludge 1 hence the bubble size setting 1 mm in the study of wu 2010a using the same sludge data needs to be evaluated in experimental measurements the characteristic bubble sizes in free air water bubbly flow were reported from 1 to 5 mm lehr et al 2002 polli et al 2002 schäfer et al 2002 moreover the bubble size was found to increase with the liquid apparent viscosity schäfer et al 2002 therefore the bubble size settings in previously reported simulations were not suitable 10 mm vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 seemed too big for water and 1 mm wu 2010a too small for sludge considering the typical bubble sizes in reality and the apparent viscosity influence 5 mm was set in the following simulations 3 2 2 phase interaction forces presence of the pipe and the draft tube in the studied digester created more changes in the local liquid velocity than that in conventional bubble columns as mentioned in section 2 2 the bubbly process induces high velocity differences and fluctuations hence some potential influences related to velocity gradient and turbulence need to be considered compared to the previous studies coughtrie et al 2013 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 wu 2010a more phase interaction forces including lift force and turbulent dispersion force were involved in this study as shown in fig 3 a and b with the addition of the lift force and or the turbulent dispersion force both water and sludge 1 get a lower but wider velocity peak inside the draft tube and a stronger flow outside even though the liquid phase got low re 102 the discrepancy was also reflected in gas phase distribution results in which the gas phase was distributed over a much larger domain when applying all the forces fig 3c hence the results indicated important roles for the two forces leading to broaden the distribution of the gas phase and the liquid flow unlike buoyancy and the drag force causing vertical rising the lift force accounted for horizontal bubble motion as shown in fig 3 the sharp velocity gradient in the near pipe region r r 0 05 can result in a considerable bubble dispersion and turbulence which further induces more liquid flows however the more viscous sludge 1 weakened this effect leading to a smaller velocity change than that of the water furthermore a similar tendency was found by applying larger bubbles and only the drag force in sludge 1 fig 2b which might result from the shear rate dependent rheological behaviour hence for a non newtonian fluid the high velocity differences not only induced more phase interaction forces but also led to localised differences in the apparent viscosity making the two phase flow more complicated 3 2 3 liquid apparent viscosity sludge 2 measured in this study was also used to investigate the impact of apparent viscosity regarding the reported 4 5 karim et al 2004 sludge 1 and 2 had comparable ts concentrations but distinct rheological behaviour due to the sludge origin table 2 as shown in fig 4 the predicted velocity is quite different sludge 1 shows a more constrained flow than the water demonstrated by a narrowed velocity profile inside the draft tube and a smaller vortex outside with a separation point the liquid velocity is zero and changes direction closer to the centreline moreover an extremely constrained flow was found for the much more viscous sludge 2 without the induced vortex or flow the flow field change also indicated a trend to a highly concentrated and unrealistic gas phase distribution implying the limitation of the eulerian eulerian method for extremely viscous fluids these results were different from previously reported results in which it was described that a rheological change did not affect mixing behaviour significantly karim et al 2007 it should be noted that in the latter study two fluids were applied that had comparable apparent viscosities pseudoplastic 2 9 mpa s and dilatant 8 32 mpa s γ range 1 1000 s 1 this is not large enough to cover the rheological differences found in practice as illustrated in our study a change in sludge rheology could lead to a quite different flow pattern under the same gas sparging conditions it can be concluded that accurate characterisations of sludge rheology are crucial for proper flow prediction and mixing evaluation 3 3 validation and further prediction considering the aforementioned incomplete validation in the previous research coughtrie et al 2013 karim et al 2007 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 wu 2010a and the sensitive impacts on the flow field found in section 3 2 the validation of the proposed model was improved 3 3 1 velocity field compared to the experimental velocity field in the whole domain karim et al 2004 general flow patterns were in agreement including the vortex the major recirculation loop and the strong weak flow locations however consistent with section 3 2 discrepancies were considerable between the water and sludge 1 highly similar to the previous study using water as well vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 as shown in fig 5 the water has a big vortex covering over one half of the whole depth and the vortex centre is at 17 5 cm height lower than the top of the draft tube however the measured vortex was smaller covering one third of the whole depth and having a higher centre 19 25 cm height hence this considerable overestimation of the flow cannot be used to conclude a good agreement as reported vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 although predicting a slightly constrained flow field with a smaller vortex closer to the centreline sludge 1 showed a better approximation it indicated that the unreported apparent viscosity of the experimental sludge might have been between that of the water and sludge 1 even better resembling sludge 1 the axial velocity profiles of sludge 1 at three heights labelled in fig 5 are shown in fig 6 considering the uncertain settings discussed above the overall agreement was satisfactory for all gas flow rates the velocity outside the draft tube r r 0 22 only showed small differences with the almost fixed separation point 0 64 that was smaller than the measured 0 71 karim et al 2004 it confirmed the slightly constrained flow mentioned above and also indicated the difficulty to further enhance this part of the flow under the given gas sparging conditions however more discrepancies were found inside the draft tube which are further discussed in section 3 3 3 3 3 2 gas phase distribution besides velocity field gas holdup is another important indicator that has not been validated before most bubbles were observed to rise inside the draft tube and were mainly confined in the 1 8 mm radius central region karim et al 2004 while almost no gas was detected outside the draft tube karim et al 2007 as shown in fig 7 a the gas phase plume containing a cluster with high volume fractions 0 2 is consistent with the descriptions above and with other observations about separated rising bubbles without coalescence dapelo et al 2015 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 in fig 7b the predicted maximum gas volume fraction of 0 53 at 20 cm height is comparable to the experimental value of 0 48 karim et al 2004 which is much better than the value 0 02 reported previously vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 although a similar tendency with a small gas volume peak was predicted just above the draft tube r r 0 21 the simulation demonstrated a more confined and highly underestimated gas distribution in the other parts of the reactor to assess this large deviation the experimental data accuracy had to be evaluated the measured peak at 1 8 mm was positioned inside the pipe radius 3 2 mm the dash line in fig 7b which seems incorrect additionally a considerable portion of the gas holdup outside the draft tube was reported to result from data discontinuity karim et al 2004 hence the deviation could have also originated from inaccurate data collection a conserved gas flux calculation gas flux per cell gas volume fraction gas velocity was performed for the simulation data but couldn t be done for the experimental results due to lack of reported gas velocity data the aforementioned rare bubble occurrence outside the draft tube correlated to a quite small effective gas velocity in the studied period leading to a negligible effective contribution to the total gas flux hence the dominant part of this balanced gas flux was still from the central region where most bubbles occurred and where the predicted and experimental data were close to each other additionally the realistic random motion of a single bubble is essentially difficult to be represented by the applied eulerian eulerian method with a rans model also resulting in the constrained gas phase distribution therefore the large deviation in fig 7b did not mean a failure of the simulation contrarily the simulation results of the conserved gas phase had a peak in the key region and a bubbly pattern comparable to the experimental data still indicating a good agreement 3 3 3 critical validation and further prediction of the flow field considering that the sludge used in the experiment was expected to be a little less viscous than sludge 1 the velocity deviation inside the draft tube requires some further discussion to assess data reliability the flux balance of the liquid axial velocity was evaluated as shown in table 3 the simulation results were excellent with a mean imbalanced flux of 0 83 0 75 but the experimental data showed a large value of 11 3 9 4 the only measured dataset in fig 7b even got higher imbalanced flux values in parentheses in table 3 also implying that the measured gas holdup may not be accurate enough in addition the velocity data were not consistent in different studies although from the same measurements karim et al 2004 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 as shown in fig 6 the experimental velocity profiles in d showed more discrepancies with a c having peaks closer to the centreline and a different profile above the draft tube moreover fig 6a c shows considerable velocity values at the position of the draft tube at 11 25 cm height which does not obey the theoretical zero velocity assumption on the no slip walls the large standard deviation bars of the velocity at the same height in fig 6d demonstrated strong fluctuations therefore the accuracy and consistency of the experimental velocity data were not good enough which was affected by the strong flow fluctuation and limited resolution inside the draft tube only 4 data points unlike the previous research vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 wu 2010a the validation in this study was not assessed only by the degree of overlap to the experimental data even achieving a high agreement the obtained model may not be optimised if having no well balanced mass flux and some uncertain parameter settings hence adjusting the model to obtain a perfect fit to the experimental data could be risky for any further application of the developed model which must be carried out with care the aforementioned deviation may also be related to the nature of the eulerian eulerian method for the model in the bubble driven process the bubbles concentrated region represented by a high gas volume fraction can have a strong buoyancy effect the generated large velocity difference across the gas liquid interface can then induce strong shear and fluctuation of the liquid velocity hence the positions of the high gas phase fraction α g the high liquid velocity v l and the strong momentum transfer f pi l are correlated on one hand measurements with 4 points may be too limited to characterise the quite localised and unstable bubble induced flow inside the draft tube on the other hand the assumption of a fluid instead of separate bubbles for the gas phase makes the eulerian eulerian with rans model not specific enough to simulate a bubble induced non newtonian flow however the improved two phase simulation presented in this study not only achieved good agreement with the experimental data but also made reasonable corrections and further predictions of the hydrodynamics in detail hence the elaborated scaled down model could be considered for further scale up applications 3 4 mixing evaluation fig 8a shows the typical particle trajectories in the simulation and various paths are obtained in the particles labelled by different colours most formed big loops back into the draft tube which agreed with the experimental data karim et al 2004 shown in fig 8 c as shown in fig 8b the typical instantaneous particle distribution is not homogeneous but confined to form some major paths some regions including the big vortex bottom and corner of the digester showed almost no particles travelling mixing performance and rtd were mainly evaluated using particle recirculation time defined as the time for a particle to return at the released position totally 9063 particles were tracked while applying three gas flow rates and normalised particle number and time θ were applied which referred to the total particle number and theoretical mean recirculation time respectively the ideal models of cstr plug flow reactors pfr and laminar flow reactors lfr were also used for evaluation as shown in fig 9 a the major peaks are almost independent from the gas flow rates however one separated smaller peak over θ 1 was found at 28 32 and 56 64 l h while a much smoother trend was found at 84 96 l h the results of key indicators for rtd and mixing in table 4 showed similar short circuiting indexes θ10 and θp smaller than the ideal models 0 5 for lfr and 1 0 for pfr and a considerable increase in the mixing indexes θ90 θg mo th and σ2 when the gas flow rate increased this indicates the occurrence of short circuiting and dead zones part of which could be mitigated by increasing the gas flow rate as can be seen from the decrease in number of small peaks however the enhancement of mixing and dispersion was limited reflected by the limited change of the major particle recirculation time at increased gas flow rates the mixing behaviour was further characterised using cumulative distribution results combined with the ideal models as shown in fig 9b besides the steep increase in the beginning the curves of 28 32 and 56 64 l h are approaching to the ideal pfr curve after the ideal mean recirculation time θ 1 due to the considerable number of particles unable to recirculate table 4 8 7 and 5 3 respectively however the trapped particles in 84 96 l h were much fewer 0 7 and the curve approached the ideal lfr therefore in the given system the contribution from the gas sparging to mixing enhancement was more related to the convection when the sludge exhibited non newtonian and viscous behaviour the diffusion and dispersion from turbulence became weakened leading to a more plug flow pattern with constrained flow regions short circuiting which was demonstrated by the belt like distributions with condensed particles in fig 8b increasing the gas flow rate could mitigate the problem but could not change the intrinsic poor mixing regions and the enhancement was limited to an lfr pattern that is not designed hence to operate the digester in the desired cstr mode the limitations of the gas sparging strategy should be concerned and improvements for the commonly used gas lance layout are necessary for scaled up systems 4 conclusions bubble size phase interaction forces and liquid rheology significantly impacted the two phase flow hydrodynamics in the studied anaerobic digester predictions of the gas phase dispersion and liquid velocity relied on characterisation of the phase interaction forces which mainly depended on the applied gas sparging strategy accurate model development for scaled up applications requires a critical assessment of experimental data that are used for model validation evaluation of the mixing showed a performance that was approximated with a laminar flow reactor lfr distinctly deviating from the expected cstr design results indicated that the applied gas sparging strategy for mixing is not very effective for reaching a cstr flow regime the results underline the importance of a proper phase interaction description for achieving a reliable hydrodynamic characterisation and mixing evaluation in gas mixed digesters

19136,this study aimed to characterise the gas liquid flow and mixing behaviour in a gas mixed anaerobic digester by improving phase interaction modelling using computational fluid dynamics cfd a 2d axisymmetric model validated with experimental data was set up using an eulerian eulerian method uncertainty factors including bubble size phase interaction forces and liquid rheology were found to significantly influence the flow field a more reliable and complete validation was obtained by critical comparison and assessment of the referred experimental data compared to the models reported in other studies additionally justifiable corrections and predictions in detail were obtained mixing was evaluated by trajectory tracking of a large number of particles based on an euler lagrange method the mixing performance approximated to a laminar flow reactor lfr that distinctly deviated from expected continuous stirred tank reactor cstr design indicating limited enhancement from the applied gas sparging strategy in the studied digester the study shows the importance of a proper phase interaction description for a reliable hydrodynamic characterisation and mixing evaluation in gas mixed digesters validations bend to experimental data without a critical assessment may lead to an inaccurate model for further scaled up applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion cfd two phase flow hydrodynamics mixing 1 introduction stabilisation of biomass and its biochemical conversion into energy rich biogas are commonly performed in anaerobic digesters in which good mass transfer and heat transfer rely on a proper mixing in digesters designed as a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr mixing is commonly achieved by biogas recirculation lindmark et al 2014 however the mixing is often insufficient in full scale gas mixed digesters due to unaccounted scale up effects bello mendoza and sharratt 1998 capela et al 2009 terashima et al 2009 prevailing short circuiting or dead zones in practice result in treatment performances below the theoretical potential capela et al 2009 samstag et al 2016 in order to optimise mixing the flow behaviour and mixing performance should be well characterised and the actual contribution to mixing from the biogas recirculation should be evaluated any additional mixing brought forward by the produced biogas resulting from sludge digestion is not taken into account in the design process and the exact impact of evolving biogas has not yet been evaluated for research purposes it is very challenging to obtain a clear insight of the mixing behaviour in an opaque and gas tight system when using only experimental approaches a general mixing pattern can be determined using tracer tests capela et al 2009 smith et al 1993 terashima et al 2009 but local flow fields responsible for any poor mixing cannot be determined from the results of tracer residence time distribution rtd advanced non invasive techniques such as computer automated radioactive particle tracking carpt and computed tomography ct can provide detailed information of flow fields karim et al 2004 varma and al dahhan 2007 but are yet not applicable to full scale facilities computational fluid dynamics cfd has often been recognised as a promising approach to characterise and optimise hydrodynamics in biological processes wicklein et al 2016 wu 2013 however only few studies have focused on gas mixed anaerobic digesters coughtrie et al 2013 dapelo et al 2015 dapelo and bridgeman 2018 karim et al 2007 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 wu 2010a vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 developed a 3d model to simulate a digester based on a lab scale experimental study karim et al 2004 a good qualitative agreement to the experimental data was reported and specific configurational factors were investigated for reducing the poorly mixed space simulations with more configurational modification were carried out using the finite element method karim et al 2007 in addition some numerical influencing factors on hydrodynamics were considered including reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models for turbulence coughtrie et al 2013 wu 2010a and single multiphase approaches for gas liquid flow coughtrie et al 2013 dapelo et al 2015 dapelo and bridgeman 2018 in the gas mixed digesters sludge flow and mixing are mainly driven by energy from the gas sparging therefore a proper characterisation of the phase interaction between gas and liquid sludge is crucial however in the aforementioned studies the two phase flow modelling was still limited with considerable simplifications and uncertainties some studies eliminated the two phase interaction region and essentially simulated a single phase flow coughtrie et al 2013 karim et al 2007 although sludge rheology has been recognised as important for design and operation of sludge treatment processes eshtiaghi et al 2013 no rheological measurements of the used sludge were reported karim et al 2007 hence different types of liquids were used including newtonian coughtrie et al 2013 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 and non newtonian fluids karim et al 2007 wu 2010a to validate the same experimental data karim et al 2004 despite the different used rheology similar good agreements were reported moreover the model validations were incomplete involving only a part of the experimental results thus not convincing enough although a more detailed model validation was done by dapelo et al 2015 the studied reactor was essentially a bubble column with a bottom mounted nozzle dapelo et al 2015 dapelo and bridgeman 2018 different from the full scale digesters with vertical hanging gas lances therefore the aforementioned description of the two phase flow and limited model validation should be improved this study aimed at developing a reliable cfd model in a scaled down digester in order to further guide process assessment and optimisation in scaled up systems the focus was on modelling the gas sludge interaction process and detailed model validation and mixing evaluations were carried out 2 materials methods 2 1 computational domain and mesh a computational domain was created based on the gas lift digester studied by karim et al 2004 which was a 7 2 l cylindrical tank concentrically mounted with a gas injection pipe 0 5 cm inner diameter and a draft tube 4 4 cm inner diameter karim et al 2004 more detailed information is given in fig 1 a considering the geometry and layout a 2d axisymmetric domain was developed as shown in fig 1b a central axis is used a free surface for the liquid phase is defined at the top and the other boundaries are constructed according to the original design structured grids were used for meshing and finer grids were applied within the sensitive regions of phase interaction around the gas pipe and the draft tube fig 1b to check grid independency 5 characteristic grid sizes a through e from coarse to fine were created which are shown in table 1 2 2 governing equations and models considering the focus on bubbly flow and not on single bubble motion an eulerian eulerian model was utilised in which the gas phase is treated as a continuum similar to the liquid phase for the sake of simplicity solid particle motion interfacial mass transfer and heat transfer were neglected and a single bubble diameter set for the gas phase transient simulations were implemented hence the governing equations given below were solved for each phase 2 2 1 volume fraction equation the volume of each phase in a control cell is determined as 1 v i v α i d v 2 i 1 n α i 1 where v denotes the volume α the volume fraction n the number of phases and subscript i refers to the phase liquid or gas 2 2 2 mass conservation equation 3

this process turbulence originates from the large velocity differences induced by gas sparging which is strongly correlated to bubbly regions moreover modified rans models have been found to be appropriate for a low re non newtonian flow wu 2010b considering the localised bubbly and turbulent distribution the rng k ε mixture turbulence model was applied which is more suitable to nearly

due to the finer grids the first grid layer attaching wall boundaries could be in the viscous sub layer of turbulence y 5 hence an enhanced wall function was applied to correctly calculate the near wall region flow field covering both linear and logarithmic patterns 2 2 6 phases the detailed phase physical properties are shown in table 2 for the primary phase different fluids were used including

sludge 1 data were from literature achkari begdouri and goodrich 1992 sludge 2 was the waste activated sludge sampled from wastewater treatment plant de groote lucht the netherlands the rheology was measured according to our previous work wei et al 2018 and total solids ts were measured according to standard methods apha 2012 the secondary phase was set as spherical air bubbles with a diameter in

viscosity a larger number of particles 9063 were released and tracked at different gas flow rates 2 3 boundary conditions involved boundary conditions included axisymmetric centreline velocity inlet degassing top and wall the axisymmetric centreline was set for creating a 3d axisymmetric circumstance the velocity inlet was for gas injection the degassing top was for discharging the gas phase while retaining the liquid phase the wall condition including no slip for liquid and free slip for gas was set at the other boundaries 2 4 main simulation settings in the transient simulations time step setting obeyed the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition and the first order implicit scheme was used the phase coupled simple scheme was utilised for pressure velocity coupling high order schemes including second order upwind quick leonard and mokhtari 1990 and muscl van leer 1979 were set for improving simulation accuracy regarding the relatively complicated process modelled and performance achieved the simulations were done in a stringent way with satisfactory convergence 1 a desired criterion of 1 10 5 was used for residuals of most parameters while a more reasonable order of 10 4 was used for the continuity and gas velocity residuals because residual values of the aforementioned parameters were difficult to reach 1 10 5 even using a quite small time step of 1 10 6 s 1 10 4 s already fits the cfl condition 2 the gas mass flow rate and liquid flux were also monitored and achieved satisfactory balance imbalance 5 the simulations were implemented using the commercial package ansys fluent 16 2 mainly on a dell optiplex 7010 computer with intel core i5 3740 and 8 gb ram when running two parallel processors the computational time ranged between 1 and 10 days 3 results and discussion 3 1 grid independence test a grid independence test was performed first using the grid convergence index gci method celik et al 2008 roache 1994 the axial velocities at heights of 11 25 cm and 18 25 cm were used for the assessment mesh d and e were found to have quite similar profiles and values of the velocity and the gci results gcicd 3 3 3 5 gcide 0 7 1 1 were in an asymptotic range close to 1 1 02 0 02 indicating that the grid independence was achieved considering smaller number of grid cells and less computational consumption mesh d was selected as optimal for the following simulations the detailed results and interpretation can be found in the supplementary material fig s1 and table s1 3 2 impacts of uncertain parameters on flow field 3 2 1 bubble size as mentioned in the introduction some uncertainties needed to be investigated although no experimental data are available to support proper identification of a characteristic bubble size is important in the model calculations to achieve a clear estimation only the drag force was applied for phase interaction and two distinct fluids water newtonian and sludge 1 non newtonian achkari begdouri and goodrich 1992 were used according to the references lehr et al 2002 polli et al 2002 schäfer et al 2002 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 wu 2010a bubbles with diameters ranging from 1 mm to 10 mm can be expected fig 2 shows the liquid axial velocity profiles at 1 2 depth zooming in inside the draft tube although the peak became smaller similar velocity profiles of the water were obtained as the bubble size increased especially larger than 3 mm fig 2a however different profiles were obtained in sludge 1 as the bubble size increased a more substantial decrease was found in the peak value and the peak position also moved further from the centreline fig 2b similar tendencies were found at the other heights in both fluids data not shown the velocity independency on the bubbles over 3 mm agreed with a previous study using water as well vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 in which the corresponding bubble size was 2 mm and 10 mm was set in their simulations however the velocity was quite sensitive to the bubble size in sludge 1 hence the bubble size setting 1 mm in the study of wu 2010a using the same sludge data needs to be evaluated in experimental measurements the characteristic bubble sizes in free air water bubbly flow were reported from 1 to 5 mm lehr et al 2002 polli et al 2002 schäfer et al 2002 moreover the bubble size was found to increase with the liquid apparent viscosity schäfer et al 2002 therefore the bubble size settings in previously reported simulations were not suitable 10 mm vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 seemed too big for water and 1 mm wu 2010a too small for sludge considering the typical bubble sizes in reality and the apparent viscosity influence 5 mm was set in the following simulations 3 2 2 phase interaction forces presence of the pipe and the draft tube in the studied digester created more changes in the local liquid velocity than that in conventional bubble columns as mentioned in section 2 2 the bubbly process induces high velocity differences and fluctuations hence some potential influences related to velocity gradient and turbulence need to be considered compared to the previous studies coughtrie et al 2013 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 wu 2010a more phase interaction forces including lift force and turbulent dispersion force were involved in this study as shown in fig 3 a and b with the addition of the lift force and or the turbulent dispersion force both water and sludge 1 get a lower but wider velocity peak inside the draft tube and a stronger flow outside even though the liquid phase got low re 102 the discrepancy was also reflected in gas phase distribution results in which the gas phase was distributed over a much larger domain when applying all the forces fig 3c hence the results indicated important roles for the two forces leading to broaden the distribution of the gas phase and the liquid flow unlike buoyancy and the drag force causing vertical rising the lift force accounted for horizontal bubble motion as shown in fig 3 the sharp velocity gradient in the near pipe region r r 0 05 can result in a considerable bubble dispersion and turbulence which further induces more liquid flows however the more viscous sludge 1 weakened this effect leading to a smaller velocity change than that of the water furthermore a similar tendency was found by applying larger bubbles and only the drag force in sludge 1 fig 2b which might result from the shear rate dependent rheological behaviour hence for a non newtonian fluid the high velocity differences not only induced more phase interaction forces but also led to localised differences in the apparent viscosity making the two phase flow more complicated 3 2 3 liquid apparent viscosity sludge 2 measured in this study was also used to investigate the impact of apparent viscosity regarding the reported 4 5 karim et al 2004 sludge 1 and 2 had comparable ts concentrations but distinct rheological behaviour due to the sludge origin table 2 as shown in fig 4 the predicted velocity is quite different sludge 1 shows a more constrained flow than the water demonstrated by a narrowed velocity profile inside the draft tube and a smaller vortex outside with a separation point the liquid velocity is zero and changes direction closer to the centreline moreover an extremely constrained flow was found for the much more viscous sludge 2 without the induced vortex or flow the flow field change also indicated a trend to a highly concentrated and unrealistic gas phase distribution implying the limitation of the eulerian eulerian method for extremely viscous fluids these results were different from previously reported results in which it was described that a rheological change did not affect mixing behaviour significantly karim et al 2007 it should be noted that in the latter study two fluids were applied that had comparable apparent viscosities pseudoplastic 2 9 mpa s and dilatant 8 32 mpa s γ range 1 1000 s 1 this is not large enough to cover the rheological differences found in practice as illustrated in our study a change in sludge rheology could lead to a quite different flow pattern under the same gas sparging conditions it can be concluded that accurate characterisations of sludge rheology are crucial for proper flow prediction and mixing evaluation 3 3 validation and further prediction considering the aforementioned incomplete validation in the previous research coughtrie et al 2013 karim et al 2007 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 wu 2010a and the sensitive impacts on the flow field found in section 3 2 the validation of the proposed model was improved 3 3 1 velocity field compared to the experimental velocity field in the whole domain karim et al 2004 general flow patterns were in agreement including the vortex the major recirculation loop and the strong weak flow locations however consistent with section 3 2 discrepancies were considerable between the water and sludge 1 highly similar to the previous study using water as well vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 as shown in fig 5 the water has a big vortex covering over one half of the whole depth and the vortex centre is at 17 5 cm height lower than the top of the draft tube however the measured vortex was smaller covering one third of the whole depth and having a higher centre 19 25 cm height hence this considerable overestimation of the flow cannot be used to conclude a good agreement as reported vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 although predicting a slightly constrained flow field with a smaller vortex closer to the centreline sludge 1 showed a better approximation it indicated that the unreported apparent viscosity of the experimental sludge might have been between that of the water and sludge 1 even better resembling sludge 1 the axial velocity profiles of sludge 1 at three heights labelled in fig 5 are shown in fig 6 considering the uncertain settings discussed above the overall agreement was satisfactory for all gas flow rates the velocity outside the draft tube r r 0 22 only showed small differences with the almost fixed separation point 0 64 that was smaller than the measured 0 71 karim et al 2004 it confirmed the slightly constrained flow mentioned above and also indicated the difficulty to further enhance this part of the flow under the given gas sparging conditions however more discrepancies were found inside the draft tube which are further discussed in section 3 3 3 3 3 2 gas phase distribution besides velocity field gas holdup is another important indicator that has not been validated before most bubbles were observed to rise inside the draft tube and were mainly confined in the 1 8 mm radius central region karim et al 2004 while almost no gas was detected outside the draft tube karim et al 2007 as shown in fig 7 a the gas phase plume containing a cluster with high volume fractions 0 2 is consistent with the descriptions above and with other observations about separated rising bubbles without coalescence dapelo et al 2015 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 in fig 7b the predicted maximum gas volume fraction of 0 53 at 20 cm height is comparable to the experimental value of 0 48 karim et al 2004 which is much better than the value 0 02 reported previously vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 although a similar tendency with a small gas volume peak was predicted just above the draft tube r r 0 21 the simulation demonstrated a more confined and highly underestimated gas distribution in the other parts of the reactor to assess this large deviation the experimental data accuracy had to be evaluated the measured peak at 1 8 mm was positioned inside the pipe radius 3 2 mm the dash line in fig 7b which seems incorrect additionally a considerable portion of the gas holdup outside the draft tube was reported to result from data discontinuity karim et al 2004 hence the deviation could have also originated from inaccurate data collection a conserved gas flux calculation gas flux per cell gas volume fraction gas velocity was performed for the simulation data but couldn t be done for the experimental results due to lack of reported gas velocity data the aforementioned rare bubble occurrence outside the draft tube correlated to a quite small effective gas velocity in the studied period leading to a negligible effective contribution to the total gas flux hence the dominant part of this balanced gas flux was still from the central region where most bubbles occurred and where the predicted and experimental data were close to each other additionally the realistic random motion of a single bubble is essentially difficult to be represented by the applied eulerian eulerian method with a rans model also resulting in the constrained gas phase distribution therefore the large deviation in fig 7b did not mean a failure of the simulation contrarily the simulation results of the conserved gas phase had a peak in the key region and a bubbly pattern comparable to the experimental data still indicating a good agreement 3 3 3 critical validation and further prediction of the flow field considering that the sludge used in the experiment was expected to be a little less viscous than sludge 1 the velocity deviation inside the draft tube requires some further discussion to assess data reliability the flux balance of the liquid axial velocity was evaluated as shown in table 3 the simulation results were excellent with a mean imbalanced flux of 0 83 0 75 but the experimental data showed a large value of 11 3 9 4 the only measured dataset in fig 7b even got higher imbalanced flux values in parentheses in table 3 also implying that the measured gas holdup may not be accurate enough in addition the velocity data were not consistent in different studies although from the same measurements karim et al 2004 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 as shown in fig 6 the experimental velocity profiles in d showed more discrepancies with a c having peaks closer to the centreline and a different profile above the draft tube moreover fig 6a c shows considerable velocity values at the position of the draft tube at 11 25 cm height which does not obey the theoretical zero velocity assumption on the no slip walls the large standard deviation bars of the velocity at the same height in fig 6d demonstrated strong fluctuations therefore the accuracy and consistency of the experimental velocity data were not good enough which was affected by the strong flow fluctuation and limited resolution inside the draft tube only 4 data points unlike the previous research vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 wu 2010a the validation in this study was not assessed only by the degree of overlap to the experimental data even achieving a high agreement the obtained model may not be optimised if having no well balanced mass flux and some uncertain parameter settings hence adjusting the model to obtain a perfect fit to the experimental data could be risky for any further application of the developed model which must be carried out with care the aforementioned deviation may also be related to the nature of the eulerian eulerian method for the model in the bubble driven process the bubbles concentrated region represented by a high gas volume fraction can have a strong buoyancy effect the generated large velocity difference across the gas liquid interface can then induce strong shear and fluctuation of the liquid velocity hence the positions of the high gas phase fraction α g the high liquid velocity v l and the strong momentum transfer f pi l are correlated on one hand measurements with 4 points may be too limited to characterise the quite localised and unstable bubble induced flow inside the draft tube on the other hand the assumption of a fluid instead of separate bubbles for the gas phase makes the eulerian eulerian with rans model not specific enough to simulate a bubble induced non newtonian flow however the improved two phase simulation presented in this study not only achieved good agreement with the experimental data but also made reasonable corrections and further predictions of the hydrodynamics in detail hence the elaborated scaled down model could be considered for further scale up applications 3 4 mixing evaluation fig 8a shows the typical particle trajectories in the simulation and various paths are obtained in the particles labelled by different colours most formed big loops back into the draft tube which agreed with the experimental data karim et al 2004 shown in fig 8 c as shown in fig 8b the typical instantaneous particle distribution is not homogeneous but confined to form some major paths some regions including the big vortex bottom and corner of the digester showed almost no particles travelling mixing performance and rtd were mainly evaluated using particle recirculation time defined as the time for a particle to return at the released position totally 9063 particles were tracked while applying three gas flow rates and normalised particle number and time θ were applied which referred to the total particle number and theoretical mean recirculation time respectively the ideal models of cstr plug flow reactors pfr and laminar flow reactors lfr were also used for evaluation as shown in fig 9 a the major peaks are almost independent from the gas flow rates however one separated smaller peak over θ 1 was found at 28 32 and 56 64 l h while a much smoother trend was found at 84 96 l h the results of key indicators for rtd and mixing in table 4 showed similar short circuiting indexes θ10 and θp smaller than the ideal models 0 5 for lfr and 1 0 for pfr and a considerable increase in the mixing indexes θ90 θg mo th and σ2 when the gas flow rate increased this indicates the occurrence of short circuiting and dead zones part of which could be mitigated by increasing the gas flow rate as can be seen from the decrease in number of small peaks however the enhancement of mixing and dispersion was limited reflected by the limited change of the major particle recirculation time at increased gas flow rates the mixing behaviour was further characterised using cumulative distribution results combined with the ideal models as shown in fig 9b besides the steep increase in the beginning the curves of 28 32 and 56 64 l h are approaching to the ideal pfr curve after the ideal mean recirculation time θ 1 due to the considerable number of particles unable to recirculate table 4 8 7 and 5 3 respectively however the trapped particles in 84 96 l h were much fewer 0 7 and the curve approached the ideal lfr therefore in the given system the contribution from the gas sparging to mixing enhancement was more related to the convection when the sludge exhibited non newtonian and viscous behaviour the diffusion and dispersion from turbulence became weakened leading to a more plug flow pattern with constrained flow regions short circuiting which was demonstrated by the belt like distributions with condensed particles in fig 8b increasing the gas flow rate could mitigate the problem but could not change the intrinsic poor mixing regions and the enhancement was limited to an lfr pattern that is not designed hence to operate the digester in the desired cstr mode the limitations of the gas sparging strategy should be concerned and improvements for the commonly used gas lance layout are necessary for scaled up systems 4 conclusions bubble size phase interaction forces and liquid rheology significantly impacted the two phase flow hydrodynamics in the studied anaerobic digester predictions of the gas phase dispersion and liquid velocity relied on characterisation of the phase interaction forces which mainly depended on the applied gas sparging strategy accurate model development for scaled up applications requires a critical assessment of experimental data that are used for model validation evaluation of the mixing showed a performance that was approximated with a laminar flow reactor lfr distinctly deviating from the expected cstr design results indicated that the applied gas sparging strategy for mixing is not very effective for reaching a cstr flow regime the results underline the importance of a proper phase interaction description for achieving a reliable hydrodynamic characterisation and mixing evaluation in gas mixed digesters

19137,assessment of viral contamination is essential for monitoring the microbial quality of water and protection of public health as human virus presence is not accurately determined using bacterial indicators currently the time required for conventional viral testing means that water contaminated with human pathogens may be used e g for drinking recreation or irrigation days before results are available here we report a new rapid method for coliphage enumeration the quantiphage qp assay the novelty of the assay is the use of cellulose absorbent pad materials to support coliphage growth and colorimetric detection in place of agar that is used in the plaque assay in addition to saving time associated with agar preparation and tempering the qp assay enabled enumeration of somatic coliphages in 1 5 2 h and f coliphages in 2 5 3 h the assays were highly sensitive with a lower detection limit of 1 plaque forming unit pfu per ml where 1 ml sample volumes were analysed and 1 pfu per 10 ml where 10 ml sample volumes were analysed this is the first rapid culture assay to enable low numbers of coliphages to be reliably detected and to produce directly equivalent results to agar based plaque assays a novel gelatin immobilisation method is also reported that reduces time to prepare bacterial cells from 20 h to 40 60 min depending on the assay format and provides a ready to use form of cells that is compatible with rapid detection and kit formats when applied to analysis of somatic coliphages in wastewater samples and surface water samples mean differences in results of the

analysis of 100 ml samples and the dual agar layer plaque assay dal used for 1 ml samples viral concentrates or isolates apha 2012 us epa 1602 2001 as discussed by joffre et al 2016 the plaque assay is perceived by some as cumbersome the method requires preparation of log phase bacterial host cells autoclaving and tempering of agar inoculation of molten agar with phages sample and bacteria then pouring agar plates followed by incubation of inoculated agar plates for 6 24 h jofre et al 2016 us epa 1602 2001 the dal is perhaps more cumbersome compared to the sal since it additionally requires preparation of bottom agar plates us epa 1602 2001 in the time taken for the plaque assay water contaminated with human pathogens has often been used for drinking recreational activities irrigation or discharged into the environment a rapid assay for enumeration of coliphages that provides results within several hours is thus critically needed to enable timely availability of results rapid assays for detecting coliphages have been under investigation for more than 20 years ijzerman et al 1993 reported a method for detecting somatic coliphages which involved assaying the bacterial enzyme β galactosidase β gal β gal is released from e coli following phage induced lysis and can be detected using a fluorescent or colorimetric substrate fig 1c early mid log phase bacterial host cultures with low rates of inherent cell death are typically used in such β gal assays ijzerman et al 1993 stanek and falkinham 2001 this avoids background signals that may result from non specific cell lysis which occurs at higher rates in later stage bacterial cultures a commercially available format of a liquid β gal assay was approved by the us epa for presence absence somatic coliphage testing in groundwater salter et al 2010 this assay takes between 5 and 8 h to complete and requires 16 h incubation for verification of results more recently means for using this assay for quantitation using a semi automated well dispensing system have been described salter and durbin 2016 although validation of this method for sample analysis has not been reported and false positives for low numbers of coliphages have been indicated a rapid method using genetically modified gm bacterial host cells for reduced background has been reported where high numbers of somatic coliphages can be detected in 1 5 h muniesa et al 2018 however up to 4 5 h was required for reliable detection of low coliphage numbers e g 45 pfu and spot plates were needed for confirmation of results further the use of gm bacteria limits availability and use of the strains and the method is not reported for analysis of f coliphages a liquid assay for 3 h detection of f coliphages was reported yang and griffiths 2014 however this assay was limited by a very small volume of sample analysed 20 μl while the 5 h assay for 10 l samples was not quantitative thus there are no validated studies that have demonstrated rapid methods for enumeration of both f and somatic coliphages for low numbers of coliphages in water volumes relevant for sample analysis 1 ml for viral concentrates or 10 100 ml for un concentrated samples and that are amenable to use in low resource contexts we hypothesised that rapid coliphage methods could be improved by incorporating colorimetric β gal detection methods into paper based assays to assist in reducing current time delays and financial costs different types of paper based assays have been used previously for microbial detection for example phages immobilised on paper have been used for detection of e coli and salmonella sp in combination with quantitative pcr anany et al 2018 in a further example the growth of e coli in filter paper in an antibiotic resistance assay was demonstrated where a viability dye was used to distinguish live and dead cells after 18 h deiss et al 2014 additionally propagation of m13 phage in e coli embedded in paper has been shown although the phages were extracted from the paper and enumerated using the plaque assay funes huacca et al 2012 here we report a novel method that enables coliphages to be rapidly and directly quantified in cellulose pad based assays the quantiphage qp assay we determined cellulose pad materials can have distinct advantages compared to use of paper as an assay support specifically enabling larger sample volumes relevant for water quality testing to be analysed and limited reagent diffusion means to incorporate immobilised preserved e coli cells into the qp assay were also developed to reduce time required for preparing the cells and provides a ready to use format 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial and coliphage strains prototype strains of somatic coliphages φx174 atcc 13706 b1

viral concentrate vc and calculated as follows a detection limit of 1 pfu per ml vc is equivalent to 5 pfu per 5 ml vc 5 ml vc represents 230 ml un concentrated sample thus 5 pfu may be detected per

septic tanks wohlsen et al 2006 spiked and un spiked samples were tested technical replicates n 10 and biological replicates n 3 a high number of technical replicates were used as low levels of indigenous coliphages were detected using the sal plaque assay particulates were removed from the samples by pouring through a disposable 40 μm mesh filter greiner bio one frickenhausen germany poma et al 2012 that was pre treated with 1 ml 1 5 beef extract results of the 10 ml i qp assay format and were compared to the sal plaque assay section 2 1 spot plate tests were used to confirm that positive signals in the i qp assay were due to coliphages to prepare spot plates cfp from localised regions of colour change plaques was extracted with a sterile scalpel blade immersed in 150 μl lb n for 5 min and vortexed 5 μl of the suspension was then pipetted onto spot plates us epa 1602 2001 statistical analyses were performed as described in section 2 7 2 7 statistical analysis the statistical analysis aimed to assess whether there was a significant difference between the mean coliphage concentrations determined using the i qp assay and the plaque assay for isolate analysis wastewater ww viral concentrates inlet and outlet samples and raw surface water sw samples equality of variance was assessed using the levene s test and normality was assessed using the shapiro wilk

outlet biological replicates sw analysis a paired t test was used to assess the significance of differences between the population means p value 0 05 for normally distributed data ww inlet samples replicates statistical package for the social sciences spss version 23 ibm was used for the statistical analyses agreement between the i qp and plaque assay results was assessed using bland altman plots where bias and precision are determined as proportional error bland and altman 1986 hanneman 2008 olofsen et al 2014 the plaque assay was used as the reference method plaque assay mean log10 pfu l or pfu 10 ml was plotted on the x axis against the difference of the paired reading between the plaque assay and the qp assay on the y axis horizontal lines were drawn at the mean difference and error bars indicate 95 confidence limits cl of the mean of differences bland altman plots were constructed using medcalc software version 16 8 4 ostend belgium the priori difference in concentration between the plaque and qp assay determined as acceptable was 0 5 log10 for analysis of wastewater samples in the 1 ml qp assay and 1 5 pfu 10 ml for the 10 ml assay format 3 results this study aimed to develop cellulose pad based assays for rapid coliphage enumeration using a colorimetric substrate cprg to detect the bacterial β gal released due to phage induced lysis fig 1 expression of β gal was induced using iptg and different types of cellulose pad materials were compared rapid assays performed using cellulose pad materials were called quantiphage qp assays qp assays were developed for somatic coliphages and then f coliphages using freshly prepared log phase bacterial cells the l qp assays 1 ml format immobilised bacterial cells were then incorporated into the assays the i qp assays fig 2 the assays were validated by comparing results of qp assays 1 ml format to the double agar layer dal plaque assay for coliphage isolates and wastewater samples viral concentrates means to scale up the qp assay to enable analysis of larger sample volumes were also demonstrated so that a time intensive sample concentration step is not required methods were reported for analysis of 10 ml samples which may be used for analysis of 100 ml samples in future studies i e using 10 x 10 ml assays with the reaction conditions and analysis times described for the 10 ml assay format the qp assay for larger sample volumes was validated by comparing results of qp assays 10 ml format to the single agar layer sal plaque assay for coliphage isolates and raw surface samples freshwater lake samples 3 1 rapid coliphage assays log phase cells 1 ml format 3 1 1 somatic coliphages cellulose fiber pad cfp materials were assessed as supports for the rapid coliphage assays i e qp assays the qp assays were initially established using freshly prepared log phase bacterial cells l qp assay somatic coliphages and m cfsp somatic coliphages were detected by cprg hydrolysis color change from yellow to red purple associated with release of β gal from bacterial host cells following phage induced lysis there was no color change in the negative control in the m cfp assay fig 3 a for higher numbers of coliphages 1000 the color change due to cprg hydrolysis was present across the entire surface of the m cfsp and similar to the clearing of cells seen for high numbers of coliphages in the plaque assay for lower numbers 40 of coliphages discrete zones of red color change due to bacterial lysis and cprg hydrolysis and equivalent to plaques were formed fig 3a and section 3 4 thus 40 plaques could be counted using the 1 ml qp assay format and numbers above this are too numerous to count the discrimination of individual coliphages as localised regions of colour change or plaques was possible due to very limited reagent diffusion with m cfp a property we determined was inherent to the material following application of appropriate assay volumes this is in contrast to use of other assay supports in paper based assays such as filter paper where reagent diffusion is often profuse deiss et al 2014 and would limit quantitation m cfp also enabled analysis of assay volumes relevant for water sample analysis the cfp materials 50 mm circles supported a total reaction volume of up to 1 6 ml which included 1 ml of sample volume equivalent to the sample volume analysed in the conventional dal plaque assay the lower limit of detection for the somatic l qp assay 1 ml format was 1 pfu ml as determined by analysing 1 ml φx174 serial dilutions in the assay fig 3a the highest somatic coliphage concentration assessed was 1 105 pfu ml which also produced a positive result fig 3a similar results were produced in both the somatic l qp assays and dal plaque assays in analysis of 1 ml φx174 dilutions fig 3e where quantitative results were obtained by analysis of lower concentration dilutions in this case 10 pfu ml and 1 pfu ml however much less time was required for the somatic l qp assay compared to the dal plaque assay the somatic l qp assay was completed after a post incubation time of 2 h at 40 c fig 3a although higher numbers of coliphages 100 were reliably detected after 1 5 h fig s1a these optimal conditions were determined following testing of different assay temperatures and incubation times where 30 min longer was required at 37 c fig s1b and log phase culture conditions volume of starter culture and od520 fig s2 in addition to m cfsp where circles were cut from sheets and autoclaved alternative cfp materials supplied pre sterilised in petri dishes were assessed equivalent results were produced for the somatic l qp assay using m cfsp and a cfp while fewer phages were detected using millipore petrislides fig s3 consistency of detection of low levels of coliphages was additionally tested using 1 pfu ml φx174 n 10 replicates in the somatic l qp assay a cfp and the dal plaque assay results confirmed equivalent consistency of detection of 1 pfu ml in both assays table s1 3 1 2 f coliphages the f coliphage l qp assays required different conditions compared to the somatic l qp assays the main differences for the f coliphage l qp assay were the low level and inconsistent signals when m cfsp was used however adequate signal strength and consistency were obtained with a cfp fig s4a different log phase culture conditions were also required for the f coliphage l qp assays as shown in figs s4b c the f coliphage l qp assay required a 2 5 h for high numbers and 3 h for low numbers post incubation period at 40 c fig 4a while 30 min longer was required for the assay at 37 c fig s5 the lower limit of detection for the f coliphage l qp assay was 1 pfu ml as determined by analysing 1 ml ms2 serial dilutions in the assay fig 4 a the highest f coliphage concentration assessed was 1 105 pfu ml which also produced a positive result fig 4a results of the f coliphage l qp assay were in agreement with the plaque assay for analysis of 1 ml ms2 dilutions fig 4c f coliphages produced smaller plaques and required longer incubation compared to the somatic coliphage qp assay this is in agreement with the results from the conventional plaque assay 3 2 rapid coliphage assays immobilised cells 1 ml format 3 2 1 somatic coliphages following optimisation of the somatic qp assay using freshly cultured bacterial cells means to include immobilised bacterial cells in the assay were evaluated the somatic i qp assay the optimised method used a gelatin solution for thermo reversible bacterial immobilisation using gelatin immobilised cells the somatic i qp assay was completed after 2 h at 40 c using either m cfsp or a cfp following a 40 min pre incubation of cells results of the somatic i qp assay immobilised cells were equivalent to results for the l qp assay freshly cultured cells and the plaque assay fig 3a d when dilutions of the φx174 isolate were assessed as with the assay using freshly cultured cells signals were present after 1 5 h at 40 c for higher numbers 100 of somatic coliphages in the i qp assay figs s6a and s6b and performing the assay at 37 c required 30 min longer incubation figs s6c and s6d the lower limit of detection for the somatic i qp assay 1 ml format was 1 pfu ml as determined by analysing 1 ml φx174 serial dilutions in the assay fig 3b the highest somatic coliphage concentration assessed was 1 105 pfu ml which also produced a positive result fig 3b the immobilised cells remained viable and suitable for use in the qp assay for up to 8 weeks the longest time period that was assessed although there was some reduction in signal intensity in 8 week gels compared to 4 week gels fig s7 additional absorbent pad types were assessed for the i qp assay using immobilised cells while m cfsp and a cfp supported consistent detection of the φx174 isolate other types of cfp resulted in inconsistent detection fig s8 the consistency of detection of low levels of φx174 1 pfu ml was further tested using n 10 replicates results were equivalent for the somatic i qp assay a cfp and the dal plaque assay table s1 after a 2 h incubation at 40 c 3 2 2 f coliphages bacterial host cells for the f coliphages were immobilised at 4 c in order to reduce loss of the f pilus which can occur at 25 c novotny and lavin 1971 results for the f coliphage i qp assay 3 h were equivalent to the l qp assay and plaque assay for ms2 dilutions fig 4 the lower limit of detection for the f coliphage i qp assay was 1 pfu ml as determined by analysing 1 ml ms2 serial dilutions in the assay fig 4b the highest f coliphage concentration assessed was 1 105 pfu ml which also produced a positive result fig 4b immobilised e coli 700891 cells used in the i qp assays had been stored for 3 5 days however when stored for 14 days high level background was observed in the negative control indicating an increased rate of cell death upon reactivation and thus viability tests were not continued past 14 days 3 3 analysis of viral concentrates 1 ml format the i qp assays were applied to enumeration of somatic and f coliphages in wastewater viral concentrates and results were compared to the dal plaque assay quantitative estimates of coliphage concentration were determined by analysis of serial dilutions of the viral concentrates in both the i qp assay and dal plaque assay numbers of coliphages in both inlet untreated and outlet treated samples from a waste stabilisation pond were assessed numbers detected in the viral concentrate pfu ml were converted to numbers present in the original sample log10 pfu l which are used practically for assessing efficiency of treatment processes differences in the mean concentration of somatic coliphages detected using the i qp assay and dal plaque assay were not statistically significant p 0 05 for technical replicates for the raw data pfu ml and transformed data log10 pfu l table s2 for the pooled data i e biological replicate analysis the mean concentrations of somatic coliphages detected using the i qp assay and plaque assay were 4 64 0 30 log10 pfu l and 4 65 0 25 log10 pfu l respectively for the inlet samples n 14 and 0 26 0 64 log10 pfu l and 0 41 0 69 log10 pfu l for the outlet samples n 6 the difference in the mean concentrations determined with the two methods was not statistically significant p 0 05 as shown in fig 6 a the somatic i qp assay for inlet samples showed a high degree of accuracy and mean differences 0 01 log10 pfu l 95 cl 0 34 0 35 were less than the a priori determined acceptable difference of 0 5 log10 pfu l a systematic difference positive or negative bias in results between the two methods was not indicated as data points were distributed equally above and below the line of mean difference in the bland altman plot a higher number of inlet samples was analysed due to infrequent detection of somatic coliphages in outlet samples table s2 representative results of the assays are shown in fig s9 f coliphages were not detected in any samples using either the plaque assay or i qp assay which indicated absence of viable of f coliphages in the assessed viral concentrates 3 4 analysis of larger sample volumes 10 ml format the somatic i qp and l qp assays were adapted so that larger sample volumes could be analysed for this assay 115 115 mm m cfsp was used for analysis of 10 ml sample volumes equivalent results were produced for analysis of 10 ml φx174 serial dilutions in the i qp l qp and sal assays fig 5 the lower limit of detection for the somatic qp assays 10 ml format was 1 pfu 10 ml as determined by analysis of 10 ml φx174 serial dilutions in the assay fig 5 consistency of detection of low levels of φx174 1 pfu 10 ml was equivalent for the 10 ml somatic i qp and l qp assays and the sal plaque assay for n 10 replicates table s1 when assaying higher numbers of somatic coliphages approximately 100 coliphages per plate could be discriminated counted using the 10 ml qp assay fig 5 thus numbers greater than this will be too numerous to count this results in a theoretical limit of quantification of 1000 pfu per 100 ml if this assay is used to test undiluted 100 ml samples thus samples with a higher concentration of coliphages would require dilution for quantitation the 10 ml somatic i qp assay format was used to test raw surface water sw samples low levels of indigenous somatic coliphages were detected in the sw samples table 1 providing a suitable matrix for spiking and assessing consistency of detection for low numbers of coliphages the matrix spike 10 pfu per 10 ml n 10 produced equivalent results in both the i qp assay 10 5 2 9 and sal plaque assay 9 4 4 9 where mean differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 for raw un spiked samples differences in the mean concentration of somatic coliphages detected using the different methods were also not statistically significant p 0 05 for technical replicates table 1 or biological replicates sal 0 13 0 15 qp 0 63 0 15 pfu 10 ml although there was a trend for slightly higher estimates using somatic i qp assays figs 6b and s10 the mean difference between the two methods 0 5 pfu 10 ml 95 cl 2 0 1 0 was less than the a priori determined acceptable difference of 1 5 pfu 10 ml all positive signals in the i qp assay 19 19 for the sw samples were confirmed to be due to coliphages using spot plate tests 4 discussion advances in diagnostic technologies including those using paper based devices have enabled complex and cumbersome laboratory procedures to be adapted to inexpensive easy to use and portable formats and may provide rapid results mace and deraney 2014 pelton 2009 this study demonstrated advantages of using cellulose fibre absorbent cfp pad materials as a support for rapid coliphage assays these quantiphage qp assays enabled rapid and sensitive enumeration of both high and low numbers of somatic and f coliphages using methods that do not rely on genetic modification of the host cells using the qp assay somatic coliphages were detected in 1 5 h 100 pfu to 2 h 1 100 pfu and f coliphages were detected in 2 5 h 100 pfu 3 h 1 100 pfu following the re activation of host bacterial cells 40 60 min depending on the assay format for prototype somatic and f coliphage isolates the qp assay enabled detection of 1 pfu ml when a 1 ml sample volume was analysed and 1 pfu 10 ml for the 10 ml assay format results of the qp assay were in agreement with the conventional plaque assay for isolate and sample analysis but more rapidly and with minimal preparation time background issues due to non specific or autolysis of bacterial cells were not observed using the optimised conditions of the qp assays the use of the use of shorter incubation times in the qp assays compared to other rapid coliphage assays that use incubations of 4 5 8 h salter et al 2010 is potentially a contributing factor to absence of background false positives this is because autolysis or non specific bacterial cell death is observed to occur at a higher rates in later stage cultures e g after 5 5 8 h incubations in the qp assay compared to earlier stage cultures e g 1 5 4 h incubations data not shown thus the ability of cfp to support rapid coliphage detection in the absence of background and to maintain low rates of inherent cell death in bacterial cultures for the duration of the assay are important advantages in addition to reducing time for results the use of cfp materials in the qp assay reduced preparation time compared to the plaque assay these materials eliminate the time consuming process of preparing and tempering agar in the plaque assay and in fact the use of cfp which are available pre sterilised in petri dishes does not require any materials preparation time only two additional reagents are needed for the qp assay which can be used with either freshly prepared or immobilised host cells and the assay is exceedingly simple to perform when the qp assay and the plaque assay particularly the dal are performed side by side much less time is required for the qp assay importantly the use of cfp as a platform for rapid coliphage detection also enables the production of localised regions of colour change equivalent to plaques the formation of such plaques supports quantitation in analysis of serial dilutions and also confirms signal production is due to coliphage replication where such plaques increase in diameter over time in the qp assay similarly to plaques in the conventional plaque assay fig s11 for sample analysis observation of increasing plaque diameter when plates are incubated for a further 30 60 min can be used for additional confirmation that signals are due to coliphages and not due to matrix interference since to the best of our knowledge such a pattern would not be caused by matrix interference this simple confirmation procedure is a further advantage of the qp assay compared to liquid based methods muniesa et al 2018 salter et al 2010 that require additional spot plate confirmation and overnight incubation to demonstrate coliphage presence while we maintain that spot plate confirmation is generally not required in the qp assay positive signals from qp assay testing of freshwater samples were confirmed to be due to coliphages using spot plates for 99 1 of 109 isolates data not shown further since low numbers of coliphages are detected by localised regions of colour change in the qp assays it is also possible that false negatives failure to detect coliphage presence may be less likely compared to other liquid assays where a detectable colour change or signal has to be effected throughout a large volume sample such as 10 100 ml thus the ability to detect coliphages by localised regions of colour change which increase in colour and intensity over time in cfp materials provides practical advantages for assessing specificity of signals in the qp assay cfp pads a cfp 47 50 mm are routinely used to provide a media reservoir for bacterial culture on membrane filters while m cfsp is used in lateral flow immunoassay strips among different types of pads assessed only the a cfp and m cfsp provided high sensitivity of coliphage detection in the somatic qp assays importantly the use of a cfp also enabled sensitive detection of f coliphages the f qp assays although poor results were obtained in these f qp assays using m cfsp however the availability of m cfsp in sheets provided increased versatility for the somatic qp assays including the assessment of larger sample volumes thus a cfp is recommended for the 1 ml qp assay format for somatic and f coliphages and m cfp for the 10 ml qp assay format for somatic coliphages investigations into alternative materials and method alterations that support f coliphage detection in a 10 ml qp assay format are currently ongoing following optimisation of the somatic and f qp assays using freshly prepared log phase bacterial cultures immobilised bacteria were incorporated into the assay bacterial host cells were immobilised using a novel thermo reversible gelation method which greatly reduced time for preparing cells and is compatible with a kit format where the cells could be supplied to the end user in a ready to use format further the low impact method of immobilisation enabled fast and efficient recovery of the cells during the reactivation step in contrast other methods for bacterial immobilisation such as freeze drying or the use of dried alginate beads where cellular functions are arrested by the removal of water can require longer periods for cell recovery and expression of β gal salter et al 2010 sinskey and silverman 1970 while there are references to the use of gelatin for immobilisation of pro biotic bacteria annan et al 2008 typically such methods involved chemical cross linking the gelatin to achieve irreversible gel formation this is believed to be the first report to describe the use of gelatin for thermo reversible bacterial immobilisation this simple method for bacterial immobilisation may also have applications in other microbiological techniques requiring ongoing preparation of cultures such as routine cloning further research should evaluate means for achieving longer term viability of gelatin immobilised cells particularly the f coliphage host cells this may involve the inclusion of substances that improve cold tolerance e g trehalose kandror et al 2002 or modifying bacterial culture conditions to promote the intracellular accumulation of such substances e g adding higher concentrations of nacl to the culture media alvarez et al 2009 higher strength gelatin solutions e g 2 5 and or combinations of gelatin with other gel forming agents e g silica sol gels alvarez et al 2009 could also be evaluated in addition to significantly reducing the time for preparing cells the use of immobilised cells means the assays can be used in low resource on site laboratories with minimal equipment a portable incubator would be sufficient the use of the qp assays for sample analysis in low resource settings is also supported by the low cost of the materials the cost per test for the 1 ml format is usd 0 50 a cfp plate 0 41 and cprg iptg 0 09 for the 10 ml format the cost per test is usd 1 44 square plate 0 74 cprg iptg 0 44 m cfp 0 26 for the analysis of 1 ml viral concentrates in the qp assays evaluation of compatible rapid methods for sample concentration e g filtration methods is an area for further research viral concentration procedures are frequently performed for quantitative analyses of viruses in wastewater and other water types costán longares et al 2008 ferrer et al 2015 helmi et al 2011 mcminn et al 2017 this enables analysis of larger sample volumes which is important for accuracy of results and detecting low numbers of viruses harwood et al 2013 in analysis of peg viral concentrates from waste stabilisation pond inlet and outlet samples in this study the i qp assay demonstrated a high degree of accuracy for sample analysis where results of the i qp assay were in agreement with the dal plaque assay mean difference 0 15 log10 pfu l the assays also enabled highly sensitive detection of coliphages where analysis of 1 ml peg concentrates in the i qp assay lod 1 pfu ml resulted in a theoretical overall method sensitivity of 22 pfu l when converted to numbers of coliphages present in the original samples for analysis of 1 ml of viral concentrate in triplicate assays while the analysis of large sample volumes in culture methods is associated with high sensitivity of the overall method inhibitory substances present in such samples can cause assay interference apha 2012 given that enzymatic inhibitors are commonly co concentrated during viral concentration procedures the demonstration of equivalent results for wastewater viral concentrates in both the i qp and dal plaque assay was an important validation indicating resilience of the i qp assay to effects of inhibitors in water samples absence of matrix interference was also indicated by absence of non specific bacterial lysis background for example due to chemical contaminants in the sample importantly the scaled up version of the somatic qp assay for analysis of 10 ml samples may be used for 100 ml samples i e 10 x 10 ml assays without sample concentration in future studies presence absence coliphage testing for 100 ml samples is often advocated in regulatory guidelines such as those for routine monitoring of high quality recycled water qld wqg 2008 preliminary data indicated suitability of the 10 ml qp assay format for analysis of raw surface water sw samples where matrix interference was not indicated in spiking experiments further the preliminary testing indicated low numbers coliphages were reliably detected in raw sw samples using the 10 ml qp assays the robust nature of β gal assays for assessing microbial contamination in minimally processed water samples has previously been indicated for example the enzyme is assayed in colilert tests idexx laboratories westbrook maine that are widely used for detecting coliform bacteria in raw water samples wastewater drinking water and surface water future research should further assess performance of the 10 ml qp assays for analysis of coliphages in a broader range of raw water types e g wastewater recreational and drinking water and confirm results for 100 ml samples i e using 10 x 10 ml assays additional avenues for future research could involve assessing image analysis software in the qp assay which will potentially further reduce the time for required for detecting the coliphage associated colour change i e the qp assay time the qp assays developed in this study could also be readily adapted for detecting other types of bacteriophages multiplex assays for detecting more than one coliphage type in a single assay could be developed by using a combination of phage types and different bacterial host specific chromogenic assays rapid phage assays could also assist in reducing time of other laboratory methods such as phage display screening it is further possible the qp assay could be adapted to a reverse format where bacteriophages are used as a biosensing tool for specific detection of bacteria 5 conclusions the qp assays for coliphage enumeration reported here are rapid low cost and easy to use tools for assessing virological water quality the qp assays developed in this study enabled cultured based detection of somatic and f coliphages after 2 and 3 h respectively following re activation of host bacterial cells 40 60 min depending on the assay format were highly sensitive showing a lower detection limit of 1 pfu ml or 1 pfu 10 ml where 1 ml and 10 ml volumes were analysed respectively demonstrated high accuracy and precision in analysis of wastewater viral concentrates and raw surface water samples could be used with either freshly cultured or immobilised bacterial host cells when used with immobilised cells the time for preparing cells was greatly reduced and provides a ready to use assay format that is compatible with a kit format where cells are supplied ready to use thus the qp assays are amenable to use in low resource and remote site laboratories and can simplify analyses in standard laboratories kit formats for reagents and materials are being developed by the author e r which would simplify performing the method even further further research is needed to determine compatible rapid methods for sample concentration for analysis of 1 ml viral concentrates and to more widely assess the 10 ml assay performance for a broader range of raw water types importantly the rapid qp assays can address the current delays between testing results and water use discharge the rapidity of the assays is a key advantage that can provide industry with improved capability to meet regulatory requirements for routine operational monitoring of viral disinfection removal in the treatment chain for high quality recycled water the qp assays could also be used to facilitate more routine viral monitoring of other water types thus these assays have potential to support improved management of the microbial quality of water for advancing and improving public health outcomes such tools will be of increasing importance in the future when there will be greater demands on water resources and recycled water mara et al 2010 who 2006 acknowledgements we thank maxim scheludchenko and a prof helen stratton for

19137,assessment of viral contamination is essential for monitoring the microbial quality of water and protection of public health as human virus presence is not accurately determined using bacterial indicators currently the time required for conventional viral testing means that water contaminated with human pathogens may be used e g for drinking recreation or irrigation days before results are available here we report a new rapid method for coliphage enumeration the quantiphage qp assay the novelty of the assay is the use of cellulose absorbent pad materials to support coliphage growth and colorimetric detection in place of agar that is used in the plaque assay in addition to saving time associated with agar preparation and tempering the qp assay enabled enumeration of somatic coliphages in 1 5 2 h and f coliphages in 2 5 3 h the assays were highly sensitive with a lower detection limit of 1 plaque forming unit pfu per ml where 1 ml sample volumes were analysed and 1 pfu per 10 ml where 10 ml sample volumes were analysed this is the first rapid culture assay to enable low numbers of coliphages to be reliably detected and to produce directly equivalent results to agar based plaque assays a novel gelatin immobilisation method is also reported that reduces time to prepare bacterial cells from 20 h to 40 60 min depending on the assay format and provides a ready to use form of cells that is compatible with rapid detection and kit formats when applied to analysis of somatic coliphages in wastewater samples and surface water samples mean differences in results of the qp assay and the conventional plaque assay were not statistically significant mean difference 0 15 log10 pfu l and 0 5 pfu 10 ml respectively p 0 05 the qp is a valuable tool for assessing microbial

bacterial host cells e g e coli is indicated by cleared zones plaques in the bacterial lawn there are two different versions of the plaque assay the single agar layer plaque assay sal used for analysis of 100 ml samples and the dual agar layer plaque assay dal used for 1 ml samples viral concentrates or isolates apha 2012 us epa 1602 2001 as discussed by joffre et al 2016 the plaque assay is perceived by some as cumbersome the method requires preparation of log phase bacterial host cells autoclaving and tempering of agar inoculation of molten agar with phages sample and bacteria then pouring agar plates followed by incubation of inoculated agar plates for 6 24 h jofre et al 2016 us epa 1602 2001 the dal is perhaps more cumbersome compared to the sal since it additionally requires preparation of bottom agar plates us epa 1602 2001 in the time taken for the plaque assay water contaminated with human pathogens has often been used for drinking recreational activities irrigation or discharged into the environment a rapid assay for enumeration of coliphages that provides results within several hours is thus critically needed to enable timely availability of results rapid assays for detecting coliphages have been under investigation for more than 20 years ijzerman et al 1993 reported a method for detecting somatic coliphages which involved assaying the bacterial enzyme β galactosidase β gal β gal is released from e coli following phage induced lysis and can be detected using a fluorescent or colorimetric substrate fig 1c early mid log phase bacterial host cultures with low rates of inherent cell death are typically used in such β gal assays ijzerman et al 1993 stanek and falkinham 2001 this avoids background signals that may result from non specific cell lysis which occurs at higher rates in later stage bacterial cultures a commercially available format of a liquid β gal assay was approved by the us epa for presence absence somatic coliphage testing in groundwater salter et al 2010 this assay takes between 5 and 8 h to complete and requires 16 h incubation for verification of results more recently means for using this assay for quantitation using a semi automated well dispensing system have been described salter and durbin 2016 although validation of this method for sample analysis has not been reported and false positives for low numbers of coliphages have been indicated a rapid method using genetically modified gm bacterial host cells for reduced background has been reported where high numbers of somatic coliphages can be detected in 1 5 h muniesa et al 2018 however up to 4 5 h was required for reliable detection of low coliphage numbers e g 45 pfu and spot plates were needed for confirmation of results further the use of gm bacteria limits availability and use of the strains and the method is not reported for analysis of f coliphages a liquid assay for 3 h detection of f coliphages was reported yang and griffiths 2014 however this assay was limited by a very small volume of sample analysed 20 μl while the 5 h assay for 10 l samples was not quantitative thus there are no validated studies that have demonstrated rapid methods for enumeration of both f and somatic coliphages for low numbers of coliphages in water volumes relevant for sample analysis 1 ml for viral concentrates or 10 100 ml for un concentrated samples and that are amenable to use in low resource contexts we hypothesised that rapid coliphage methods could be improved by incorporating colorimetric β gal detection methods into paper based assays to assist in reducing current time delays and financial costs different types of paper based assays have been used previously for microbial detection for example phages immobilised on paper have been used for detection of e coli and salmonella sp in combination with quantitative pcr anany et al 2018 in a further example the growth of e coli in filter paper in an antibiotic resistance assay was demonstrated where a viability dye was used to distinguish live and dead cells after 18 h deiss et al 2014 additionally propagation of m13 phage in e coli embedded in paper has been shown although the phages were extracted from the paper and enumerated using the plaque assay funes huacca et al 2012 here we report a novel method that enables coliphages to be rapidly and directly quantified in cellulose pad based assays the quantiphage qp assay we determined cellulose pad materials can have distinct advantages compared to use of paper as an assay support specifically enabling larger sample volumes relevant for water quality testing to be analysed and limited reagent diffusion means to incorporate immobilised preserved e coli cells into the qp assay were also developed to reduce time required for preparing the cells and provides a ready to use format 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial and coliphage strains prototype strains of somatic coliphages φx174 atcc 13706 b1

dilutions of the viral concentrate were prepared using lb medium for dilution 5 μl of 10 mg ml nalidixic acid or 1 5 mg ml ampicillin and streptomycin was added to each 10 ml dilution for somatic and f coliphages respectively dilutions 1 ml were assayed in triplicate using the i qp assay section 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 and the dal plaque assay section 2 1 i e three technical replicates for each biological replicate n 20 were tested where a biological replicate refers to collection of an individual sample and a technical replicate refers to repeated tests on a biological replicate sample for viral concentrates analysed in this study the detection limit of the overall method 22 pfu l was determined considering an i qp assay detection limit of 1 pfu ml and concentration of a 230 ml sample to 5 ml viral concentrate vc and calculated as follows a detection limit of 1 pfu per ml vc is equivalent to 5 pfu per 5 ml vc 5 ml vc represents 230 ml un concentrated sample thus 5 pfu may be detected per

septic tanks wohlsen et al 2006 spiked and un spiked samples were tested technical replicates n 10 and biological replicates n 3 a high number of technical replicates were used as low levels of indigenous coliphages were detected using the sal plaque assay particulates were removed from the samples by pouring through a disposable 40 μm mesh filter greiner bio one frickenhausen germany poma et al 2012 that was pre treated with 1 ml 1 5 beef extract results of the 10 ml i qp assay format and were compared to the sal plaque assay section 2 1 spot plate tests were used to confirm that positive signals in the i qp assay were due to coliphages to prepare spot plates cfp from localised regions of colour change plaques was extracted with a sterile scalpel blade immersed in 150 μl lb n

outlet biological replicates sw analysis a paired t test was used to assess the significance of differences between the population means p value 0 05 for normally distributed data ww inlet samples replicates statistical package for the social sciences spss version 23 ibm was used for the statistical analyses agreement between the i qp and plaque assay results was assessed using bland altman plots where bias and precision are determined as proportional error bland and altman 1986 hanneman 2008 olofsen et al 2014 the plaque assay was used as the reference method plaque assay mean log10 pfu l or pfu 10 ml was plotted on the x axis against the difference of the paired reading between the plaque assay and the qp assay on the y axis horizontal lines were drawn at the mean difference and error bars indicate 95 confidence limits cl of the mean of differences bland altman plots were constructed using medcalc software version 16 8 4 ostend belgium the priori difference in concentration between the plaque and qp assay determined as acceptable was 0 5 log10 for analysis of wastewater samples in the 1 ml qp assay and 1 5 pfu 10 ml for the 10 ml assay format 3 results this study aimed to develop cellulose pad based assays for rapid coliphage enumeration using a colorimetric substrate cprg to detect the bacterial β gal released due to phage induced lysis fig 1 expression of β gal was induced using iptg and different types of cellulose pad materials were compared rapid assays performed using cellulose pad materials were called quantiphage qp assays qp assays were developed for somatic coliphages and then f coliphages using freshly prepared log phase bacterial cells the l qp assays 1 ml format immobilised bacterial cells were then incorporated into the assays the i qp assays fig 2 the assays were validated by comparing results of qp assays 1 ml format to the double agar layer dal plaque assay for coliphage isolates and wastewater samples viral concentrates means to scale up the qp assay to enable analysis of larger sample volumes were also demonstrated so that a time intensive sample concentration step is not required methods were reported for analysis of 10 ml samples which may be used for analysis of 100 ml samples in future studies i e using 10 x 10 ml assays with the reaction conditions and analysis times described for the 10 ml assay format the qp assay for larger sample volumes was validated by comparing results of qp assays 10 ml format to the single agar layer sal plaque assay for coliphage isolates and raw surface samples freshwater lake samples 3 1 rapid coliphage assays log phase cells 1 ml format 3 1 1 somatic coliphages cellulose fiber pad cfp materials were assessed as supports for the rapid coliphage assays i e qp assays the qp assays were initially established using freshly prepared log phase bacterial cells l qp assay somatic coliphages and m cfsp somatic coliphages were detected by cprg hydrolysis color change from yellow to red purple associated with release of β gal from bacterial host cells following phage induced lysis there was no color change in the negative control in the m cfp assay fig 3 a for higher numbers of coliphages 1000 the color change due to cprg hydrolysis was present across the entire surface of the m cfsp and similar to the clearing of cells seen for high numbers of coliphages in the plaque assay for lower numbers 40 of coliphages discrete zones of red color change due to bacterial lysis and cprg hydrolysis and equivalent to plaques were formed fig 3a and section 3 4 thus 40 plaques could be counted using the 1 ml qp assay format and numbers above this are too numerous to count the discrimination of individual coliphages as localised regions of colour change or plaques was possible due to very limited reagent diffusion with m cfp a property we determined was inherent to the material following application of appropriate assay volumes this is in contrast to use of other assay supports in paper based assays such as filter paper where reagent diffusion is often profuse deiss et al 2014 and would limit quantitation m cfp also enabled analysis of assay volumes relevant for water sample analysis the cfp materials 50 mm circles supported a total reaction volume of up to 1 6 ml which included 1 ml of sample volume equivalent to the sample volume analysed in the conventional dal plaque assay the lower limit of detection for the somatic l qp assay 1 ml format was 1 pfu ml as determined by analysing 1 ml φx174 serial dilutions in the assay fig 3a the highest somatic coliphage concentration assessed was 1 105 pfu ml which also produced a positive result fig 3a similar results were produced in both the somatic l qp assays and dal plaque assays in analysis of 1 ml φx174 dilutions fig 3e where quantitative results were obtained by analysis of lower concentration dilutions in this case 10 pfu ml and 1 pfu ml however much less time was required for the somatic l qp assay compared to the dal plaque assay the somatic l qp assay was completed after a post incubation time of 2 h at 40 c fig 3a although higher numbers of coliphages 100 were reliably detected after 1 5 h fig s1a these optimal conditions were determined following testing of different assay temperatures and incubation times where 30 min longer was required at 37 c fig s1b and log phase culture conditions volume of starter culture and od520 fig s2 in addition to m cfsp where circles were cut from sheets and autoclaved alternative cfp materials supplied pre sterilised in petri dishes were assessed equivalent results were produced for the somatic l qp assay using m cfsp and a cfp while fewer phages were detected using millipore petrislides fig s3 consistency of detection of low levels of coliphages was additionally tested using 1 pfu ml φx174 n 10 replicates in the somatic l qp assay a cfp and the dal plaque assay results confirmed equivalent consistency of detection of 1 pfu ml in both assays table s1 3 1 2 f coliphages the f coliphage l qp assays required different conditions compared to the somatic l qp assays the main differences for the f coliphage l qp assay were the low level and inconsistent signals when m cfsp was used however adequate signal strength and consistency were obtained with a cfp fig s4a different log phase culture conditions were also required for the f coliphage l qp assays as shown in figs s4b c the f coliphage l qp assay required a 2 5 h for high numbers and 3 h for low numbers post incubation period at 40 c fig 4a while 30 min longer was required for the assay at 37 c fig s5 the lower limit of detection for the f coliphage l qp assay was 1 pfu ml as determined by analysing 1 ml ms2 serial dilutions in the assay fig 4 a the highest f coliphage concentration assessed was 1 105 pfu ml which also produced a positive result fig 4a results of the f coliphage l qp assay were in agreement with the plaque assay for analysis of 1 ml ms2 dilutions fig 4c f coliphages produced smaller plaques and required longer incubation compared to the somatic coliphage qp assay this is in agreement with the results from the conventional plaque assay 3 2 rapid coliphage assays immobilised cells 1 ml format 3 2 1 somatic coliphages following optimisation of the somatic qp assay using freshly cultured bacterial cells means to include immobilised bacterial cells in the assay were evaluated the somatic i qp assay the optimised method used a gelatin solution for thermo reversible bacterial immobilisation using gelatin immobilised cells the somatic i qp assay was completed after 2 h at 40 c using either m cfsp or a cfp following a 40 min pre incubation of cells results of the somatic i qp assay immobilised cells were equivalent to results for the l qp assay freshly cultured cells and the plaque assay fig 3a d when dilutions of the φx174 isolate were assessed as with the assay using freshly cultured cells signals were present after 1 5 h at 40 c for higher numbers 100 of somatic coliphages in the i qp assay figs s6a and s6b and performing the assay at 37 c required 30 min longer incubation figs s6c and s6d the lower limit of detection for the somatic i qp assay 1 ml format was 1 pfu ml as determined by analysing 1 ml φx174 serial dilutions in the assay fig 3b the highest somatic coliphage concentration assessed was 1 105 pfu ml which also produced a positive result fig 3b the immobilised cells remained viable and suitable for use in the qp assay for up to 8 weeks the longest time period that was assessed although there was some reduction in signal intensity in 8 week gels compared to 4 week gels fig s7 additional absorbent pad types were assessed for the i qp assay using immobilised cells while m cfsp and a cfp supported consistent detection of the φx174 isolate other types of cfp resulted in inconsistent detection fig s8 the consistency of detection of low levels of φx174 1 pfu ml was further tested using n 10 replicates results were equivalent for the somatic i qp assay a cfp and the dal plaque assay table s1 after a 2 h incubation at 40 c 3 2 2 f coliphages bacterial host cells for the f coliphages were immobilised at 4 c in order to reduce loss of the f pilus which can occur at 25 c novotny and lavin 1971 results for the f coliphage i qp assay 3 h were equivalent to the l qp assay and plaque assay for ms2 dilutions fig 4 the lower limit of detection for the f coliphage i qp assay was 1 pfu ml as determined by analysing 1 ml ms2 serial dilutions in the assay fig 4b the highest f coliphage concentration assessed was 1 105 pfu ml which also produced a positive result fig 4b immobilised e coli 700891 cells used in the i qp assays had been stored for 3 5 days however when stored for 14 days high level background was observed in the negative control indicating an increased rate of cell death upon reactivation and thus viability tests were not continued past 14 days 3 3 analysis of viral concentrates 1 ml format the i qp assays were applied to enumeration of somatic and f coliphages in wastewater viral concentrates and results were compared to the dal plaque assay quantitative estimates of coliphage concentration were determined by analysis of serial dilutions of the viral concentrates in both the i qp assay and dal plaque assay numbers of coliphages in both inlet untreated and outlet treated samples from a waste stabilisation pond were assessed numbers detected in the viral concentrate pfu ml were converted to numbers present in the original sample log10 pfu l which are used practically for assessing efficiency of treatment processes differences in the mean concentration of somatic coliphages detected using the i qp assay and dal plaque assay were not statistically significant p 0 05 for technical replicates for the raw data pfu ml and transformed data log10 pfu l table s2 for the pooled data i e biological replicate analysis the mean concentrations of somatic coliphages detected using the i qp assay and plaque assay were 4 64 0 30 log10 pfu l and 4 65 0 25 log10 pfu l respectively for the inlet samples n 14 and 0 26 0 64 log10 pfu l and 0 41 0 69 log10 pfu l for the outlet samples n 6 the difference in the mean concentrations determined with the two methods was not statistically significant p 0 05 as shown in fig 6 a the somatic i qp assay for inlet samples showed a high degree of accuracy and mean differences 0 01 log10 pfu l 95 cl 0 34 0 35 were less than the a priori determined acceptable difference of 0 5 log10 pfu l a systematic difference positive or negative bias in results between the two methods was not indicated as data points were distributed equally above and below the line of mean difference in the bland altman plot a higher number of inlet samples was analysed due to infrequent detection of somatic coliphages in outlet samples table s2 representative results of the assays are shown in fig s9 f coliphages were not detected in any samples using either the plaque assay or i qp assay which indicated absence of viable of f coliphages in the assessed viral concentrates 3 4 analysis of larger sample volumes 10 ml format the somatic i qp and l qp assays were adapted so that larger sample volumes could be analysed for this assay 115 115 mm m cfsp was used for analysis of 10 ml sample volumes equivalent results were produced for analysis of 10 ml φx174 serial dilutions in the i qp l qp and sal assays fig 5 the lower limit of detection for the somatic qp assays 10 ml format was 1 pfu 10 ml as determined by analysis of 10 ml φx174 serial dilutions in the assay fig 5 consistency of detection of low levels of φx174 1 pfu 10 ml was equivalent for the 10 ml somatic i qp and l qp assays and the sal plaque assay for n 10 replicates table s1 when assaying higher numbers of somatic coliphages approximately 100 coliphages per plate could be discriminated counted using the 10 ml qp assay fig 5 thus numbers greater than this will be too numerous to count this results in a theoretical limit of quantification of 1000 pfu per 100 ml if this assay is used to test undiluted 100 ml samples thus samples with a higher concentration of coliphages would require dilution for quantitation the 10 ml somatic i qp assay format was used to test raw surface water sw samples low levels of indigenous somatic coliphages were detected in the sw samples table 1 providing a suitable matrix for spiking and assessing consistency of detection for low numbers of coliphages the matrix spike 10 pfu per 10 ml n 10 produced equivalent results in both the i qp assay 10 5 2 9 and sal plaque assay 9 4 4 9 where mean differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 for raw un spiked samples differences in the mean concentration of somatic coliphages detected using the different methods were also not statistically significant p 0 05 for technical replicates table 1 or biological replicates sal 0 13 0 15 qp 0 63 0 15 pfu 10 ml although there was a trend for slightly higher estimates using somatic i qp assays figs 6b and s10 the mean difference between the two methods 0 5 pfu 10 ml 95 cl 2 0 1 0 was less than the a priori determined acceptable difference of 1 5 pfu 10 ml all positive signals in the i qp assay 19 19 for the sw samples were confirmed to be due to coliphages using spot plate tests 4 discussion advances in diagnostic technologies including those using paper based devices have enabled complex and cumbersome laboratory procedures to be adapted to inexpensive easy to use and portable formats and may provide rapid results mace and deraney 2014 pelton 2009 this study demonstrated advantages of using cellulose fibre absorbent cfp pad materials as a support for rapid coliphage assays these quantiphage qp assays enabled rapid and sensitive enumeration of both high and low numbers of somatic and f coliphages using methods that do not rely on genetic modification of the host cells using the qp assay somatic coliphages were detected in 1 5 h 100 pfu to 2 h 1 100 pfu and f coliphages were detected in 2 5 h 100 pfu 3 h 1 100 pfu following the re activation of host bacterial cells 40 60 min depending on the assay format for prototype somatic and f coliphage isolates the qp assay enabled detection of 1 pfu ml when a 1 ml sample volume was analysed and 1 pfu 10 ml for the 10 ml assay format results of the qp assay were in agreement with the conventional plaque assay for isolate and sample analysis but more rapidly and with minimal preparation time background issues due to non specific or autolysis of bacterial cells were not observed using the optimised conditions of the qp assays the use of the use of shorter incubation times in the qp assays compared to other rapid coliphage assays that use incubations of 4 5 8 h salter et al 2010 is potentially a contributing factor to absence of background false positives this is because autolysis or non specific bacterial cell death is observed to occur at a higher rates in later stage cultures e g after 5 5 8 h incubations in the qp assay compared to earlier stage cultures e g 1 5 4 h incubations data not shown thus the ability of cfp to support rapid coliphage detection in the absence of background and to maintain low rates of inherent cell death in bacterial cultures for the duration of the assay are important advantages in addition to reducing time for results the use of cfp materials in the qp assay reduced preparation time compared to the plaque assay these materials eliminate the time consuming process of preparing and tempering agar in the plaque assay and in fact the use of cfp which are available pre sterilised in petri dishes does not require any materials preparation time only two additional reagents are needed for the qp assay which can be used with either freshly prepared or immobilised host cells and the assay is exceedingly simple to perform when the qp assay and the plaque assay particularly the dal are performed side by side much less time is required for the qp assay importantly the use of cfp as a platform for rapid coliphage detection also enables the production of localised regions of colour change equivalent to plaques the formation of such plaques supports quantitation in analysis of serial dilutions and also confirms signal production is due to coliphage replication where such plaques increase in diameter over time in the qp assay similarly to plaques in the conventional plaque assay fig s11 for sample analysis observation of increasing plaque diameter when plates are incubated for a further 30 60 min can be used for additional confirmation that signals are due to coliphages and not due to matrix interference since to the best of our knowledge such a pattern would not be caused by matrix interference this simple confirmation procedure is a further advantage of the qp assay compared to liquid based methods muniesa et al 2018 salter et al 2010 that require additional spot plate confirmation and overnight incubation to demonstrate coliphage presence while we maintain that spot plate confirmation is generally not required in the qp assay positive signals from qp assay testing of freshwater samples were confirmed to be due to coliphages using spot plates for 99 1 of 109 isolates data not shown further since low numbers of coliphages are detected by localised regions of colour change in the qp assays it is also possible that false negatives failure to detect coliphage presence may be less likely compared to other liquid assays where a detectable colour change or signal has to be effected throughout a large volume sample such as 10 100 ml thus the ability to detect coliphages by localised regions of colour change which increase in colour and intensity over time in cfp materials provides practical advantages for assessing specificity of signals in the qp assay cfp pads a cfp 47 50 mm are routinely used to provide a media reservoir for bacterial culture on membrane filters while m cfsp is used in lateral flow immunoassay strips among different types of pads assessed only the a cfp and m cfsp provided high sensitivity of coliphage detection in the somatic qp assays importantly the use of a cfp also enabled sensitive detection of f coliphages the f qp assays although poor results were obtained in these f qp assays using m cfsp however the availability of m cfsp in sheets provided increased versatility for the somatic qp assays including the assessment of larger sample volumes thus a cfp is recommended for the 1 ml qp assay format for somatic and f coliphages and m cfp for the 10 ml qp assay format for somatic coliphages investigations into alternative materials and method alterations that support f coliphage detection in a 10 ml qp assay format are currently ongoing following optimisation of the somatic and f qp assays using freshly prepared log phase bacterial cultures immobilised bacteria were incorporated into the assay bacterial host cells were immobilised using a novel thermo reversible gelation method which greatly reduced time for preparing cells and is compatible with a kit format where the cells could be supplied to the end user in a ready to use format further the low impact method of immobilisation enabled fast and efficient recovery of the cells during the reactivation step in contrast other methods for bacterial immobilisation such as freeze drying or the use of dried alginate beads where cellular functions are arrested by the removal of water can require longer periods for cell recovery and expression of β gal salter et al 2010 sinskey and silverman 1970 while there are references to the use of gelatin for immobilisation of pro biotic bacteria annan et al 2008 typically such methods involved chemical cross linking the gelatin to achieve irreversible gel formation this is believed to be the first report to describe the use of gelatin for thermo reversible bacterial immobilisation this simple method for bacterial immobilisation may also have applications in other microbiological techniques requiring ongoing preparation of cultures such as routine cloning further research should evaluate means for achieving longer term viability of gelatin immobilised cells particularly the f coliphage host cells this may involve the inclusion of substances that improve cold tolerance e g trehalose kandror et al 2002 or modifying bacterial culture conditions to promote the intracellular accumulation of such substances e g adding higher concentrations of nacl to the culture media alvarez et al 2009 higher strength gelatin solutions e g 2 5 and or combinations of gelatin with other gel forming agents e g silica sol gels alvarez et al 2009 could also be evaluated in addition to significantly reducing the time for preparing cells the use of immobilised cells means the assays can be used in low resource on site laboratories with minimal equipment a portable incubator would be sufficient the use of the qp assays for sample analysis in low resource settings is also supported by the low cost of the materials the cost per test for the 1 ml format is usd 0 50 a cfp plate 0 41 and cprg iptg 0 09 for the 10 ml format the cost per test is usd 1 44 square plate 0 74 cprg iptg 0 44 m cfp 0 26 for the analysis of 1 ml viral concentrates in the qp assays evaluation of compatible rapid methods for sample concentration e g filtration methods is an area for further research viral concentration procedures are frequently performed for quantitative analyses of viruses in wastewater and other water types costán longares et al 2008 ferrer et al 2015 helmi et al 2011 mcminn et al 2017 this enables analysis of larger sample volumes which is important for accuracy of results and detecting low numbers of viruses harwood et al 2013 in analysis of peg viral concentrates from waste stabilisation pond inlet and outlet samples in this study the i qp assay demonstrated a high degree of accuracy for sample analysis where results of the i qp assay were in agreement with the dal plaque assay mean difference 0 15 log10 pfu l the assays also enabled highly sensitive detection of coliphages where analysis of 1 ml peg concentrates in the i qp assay lod 1 pfu ml resulted in a theoretical overall method sensitivity of 22 pfu l when converted to numbers of coliphages present in the original samples for analysis of 1 ml of viral concentrate in triplicate assays while the analysis of large sample volumes in culture methods is associated with high sensitivity of the overall method inhibitory substances present in such samples can cause assay interference apha 2012 given that enzymatic inhibitors are commonly co concentrated during viral concentration procedures the demonstration of equivalent results for wastewater viral concentrates in both the i qp and dal plaque assay was an important validation indicating resilience of the i qp assay to effects of inhibitors in water samples absence of matrix interference was also indicated by absence of non specific bacterial lysis background for example due to chemical contaminants in the sample importantly the scaled up version of the somatic qp assay for analysis of 10 ml samples may be used for 100 ml samples i e 10 x 10 ml assays without sample concentration in future studies presence absence coliphage testing for 100 ml samples is often advocated in regulatory guidelines such as those for routine monitoring of high quality recycled water qld wqg 2008 preliminary data indicated suitability of the 10 ml qp assay format for analysis of raw surface water sw samples where matrix interference was not indicated in spiking experiments further the preliminary testing indicated low numbers coliphages were reliably detected in raw sw samples using the 10 ml qp assays the robust nature of β gal assays for assessing microbial contamination in minimally processed water samples has previously been indicated for example the enzyme is assayed in colilert tests idexx laboratories westbrook maine that are widely used for detecting coliform bacteria in raw water samples wastewater drinking water and surface water future research should further assess performance of the 10 ml qp assays for analysis of coliphages in a broader range of raw water types e g wastewater recreational and drinking water and confirm results for 100 ml samples i e using 10 x 10 ml assays additional avenues for future research could involve assessing image analysis software in the qp assay which will potentially further reduce the time for required for detecting the coliphage associated colour change i e the qp assay time the qp assays developed in this study could also be readily adapted for detecting other types of bacteriophages multiplex assays for detecting more than one coliphage type in a single assay could be developed by using a combination of phage types and different bacterial host specific chromogenic assays rapid phage assays could also assist in reducing time of other laboratory methods such as phage display screening it is further possible the qp assay could be adapted to a reverse format where bacteriophages are used as a biosensing tool for specific detection of bacteria 5 conclusions the qp assays for coliphage enumeration reported here are rapid low cost and easy to use tools for assessing virological water quality the qp assays developed in this study enabled cultured based detection of somatic and f coliphages after 2 and 3 h respectively following re activation of host bacterial cells 40 60 min depending on the assay format were highly sensitive showing a lower detection limit of 1 pfu ml or 1 pfu 10 ml where 1 ml and 10 ml volumes were analysed respectively demonstrated high accuracy and precision in analysis of wastewater viral concentrates and raw surface water samples could be used with either freshly cultured or immobilised bacterial host cells when used with immobilised cells the time for preparing cells was greatly reduced and provides a ready to use assay format that is compatible with a kit format where cells are supplied ready to use thus the qp assays are amenable to use in low resource and remote site laboratories and can simplify analyses in standard laboratories kit formats for reagents and materials are being developed by the author e r which would simplify performing the method even further further research is needed to determine compatible rapid methods for sample concentration for analysis of 1 ml viral concentrates and to more widely assess the 10 ml assay performance for a broader range of raw water types importantly the rapid qp assays can address the current delays between testing results and water use discharge the rapidity of the assays is a key advantage that can provide industry with improved capability to meet regulatory requirements for routine operational monitoring of viral disinfection removal in the treatment chain for high quality recycled water the qp assays could also be used to facilitate more routine viral monitoring of other water types thus these assays have potential to support improved management of the microbial quality of water for advancing and improving public health outcomes such tools will be of increasing importance in the future when there will be greater demands on water resources and recycled water mara et al 2010 who 2006 acknowledgements we thank maxim scheludchenko and a prof helen stratton for

19138,electrochemical sulfide removal can be attractive as a zero chemical input approach for treatment of waste streams such as spent caustics coupled to caustic recovery a key concern is possible decline in catalytic activity due to passivation from deposited elemental sulfur s0 on the anode surface and stability limitation due to sulfide oxidation under highly alkaline conditions in this study six commercially available electrode materials ir mixed metal oxide mmo ru mmo pt irox pt pbox and tio2 irtao2 coated titanium based electrodes were tested to investigate the impact of the electrocatalyst on the process efficiency in terms of sulfide removal and final product of sulfide oxidation as well as to determine the stability of the electrocatalyst under high sulfide concentrations 50 mm na2s and high alkalinity ph 12 short term experiments showed that the catalyst type impacts the anode potential and the sulfide oxidation reaction products longer term experiments under current densities up to 200 a m 2 showed a high differentiation in stability performance among the catalysts ru mmo was the most active towards sulfide oxidation with a coulombic efficiency of 63 2 0 5 at an average anode potential of 0 92 0 17 v vs she ir mmo was the most stable preserving 100 of its original catalyst loading during the tests the results demonstrated that ru mmo and ir mmo were the most suitable electrode materials for sulfide oxidation under highly alkaline conditions while the need for establishing a good trade off between activity stability and cost still persists

industrial wastewaters such as geothermal brines el sherif et al 2010 and spent caustic streams scs ateya et al 2005 dutta et al 2008 pikaar et al 2015 the high alkalinity 5 12 wt naoh and sulfidic content 0 1 4 wt sulfide s of scs limit the feasibility of biological treatment consequently treatment of scs mostly relies on chemical dosing which incurs large caustic consumption and operational costs vaiopoulou et al 2016 in this context an interesting and chemical free alternative method is electrochemical sulfide oxidation in addition to its chemical free nature another advantage of the electrochemical method is the sulfide recovery in the form of elemental sulfur s0 along with the recovery of hydrogen gas h2 as potentially high value compound dutta et al 2008 rabaey et al 2006 vaiopoulou et al 2016 electrochemical sulfide oxidation includes a variety of both direct and indirect sulfide oxidation reactions that can simultaneously take place under a wide potential range in the case of indirect oxidation sulfide is oxidized through intermediate oxidants oh o2 cl2 that are anodically produced pikaar et al 2011a the final products of oxidation can be a mixture of s0 polysulfides sulfate so4 2 and thiosulfate s2o3 2 mao et al 1991 miller and chen 2005 pikaar et al 2011b the oxidation products depend on the electrode material used and the operational conditions such as the sulfide concentration the ph the convection and the potential of the anode dutta et al 2009 song et al 2008 vaiopoulou et al 2016 when s0 is produced through direct sulfide oxidation i e a 2 electron process it is deposited on the anode surface vaiopoulou et al 2016 as s0 is an excellent insulator with a high resistivity 1015 ω m its deposition results in a decrease in the active electrode surface area fornés and bisang 2017 this results in an increase of the anode potential thus increasing the power requirements of the system and ultimately results in complete anode passivation dutta et al 2009 this phenomenon is typically illustrated during galvanostatic experiments where a punctual and dramatic increase of the anodic potential reflects the start of o2 evolution co occurrence after a threshold loss of the anode active surface area for sulfide oxidation a wide variety of electrode materials has been tested for anodic sulfide oxidation common carbon based materials such as graphite plates anani et al 1990 and carbon felt ateya et al 2005 have low cost and although they mainly produce s0 that can be recovered suffer from electrode passivation requiring surface regeneration dutta et al 2009 a major disadvantage of carbon based electrodes is that carbon can thermodynamically be oxidized to co2 from potentials as low as e0 co2 c 0 207 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she fabbri et al 2014 this can result in dissolution of the electrode itself simultaneously with the onset of oxygen evolution at increasing levels of electrode passivation yi et al 2017 non carbon based electrodes such as titanium ti oxide ceramic el sherif et al 2010 platinum kharafi et al 2010 ramasubramanian 1975 and nickel behm and simonsson 1999 electrodes have been investigated in industrial wastewater treatment applications in particular for geothermal brines or white liquor from the pulp and paper industry the reported drawbacks of the aforementioned electrodes include activity loss due to s0 particles accumulation on the electrode surface reduced kinetics towards sulfide oxidation lawrence et al 2002 waterston et al 2007 and catalytic surface poisoning due to the formation of metal sulfide films behm and simonsson 1999 kharafi et al 2010 miller and chen 2006 considering the above limitations ti based electrodes coated with a thin active layer of mixed metal oxides mmo comninellis and vercesi 1991 have been proposed for treatment of sulfide containing sewage since they possess high stability cherevko et al 2016 pikaar et al 2011a and a good performance towards sulfide oxidation pikaar et al 2011b vaiopoulou et al 2016 a consideration when using mmo electrodes is their high manufacturing costs as they employ rare metals as catalysts nevertheless these electrodes present excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability compared to the so far examined carbon and pt based electrodes katsounaros et al 2014 in alkaline electrolytes and the alternative catalysts investigated at present have not yet been proven stable under real life conditions song et al 2018 so far different noble metal coated and mmo electrodes such as pt ir pbo2 pdo co3o4 and rhox tio2 coated ti based electrodes were tested for the electrochemical treatment of tannery wastewater with sulfide concentrations ranging between 5 and 10 mm szpyrkowicz et al 2005 depending on the electrode material more than 90 sulfide removal was achieved in a 15 40 min electrolysis time with indirect sulfide oxidation through oxygen being the most probable oxidation mechanism the feasibility of electrochemical sulfide removal from sewage i e 0 3 mm sulfide using 5 different mmo coated ti based electrodes ta ir ru ir pt ir sno2 and pbo2 was investigated at a current density of 100 a m 2 higher than 70 sulfide removal and coulombic efficiencies ce were achieved through indirect sulfide oxidation and without anode passivation pikaar et al 2011b continuous sulfide oxidation in alkaline wastewater 300 mm sulfide was achieved at 200 a m 2 with ir mmo anodes vaiopoulou et al 2016 the sulfide removal reached 80 and the ce was higher than 68 with so4 2 or s2o3 2 as main products of indirect sulfide oxidation the above described studies highlight that several aspects drive the selection of the electrode material including i activity for sulfide oxidation in a specific alkaline stream ii required electrode service life iii concentration range of the sulfide and iv targeted product s while most studies on alkaline sulfidic waste streams have focused on proof of concepts for sulfide removal anani et al 1990 behm and simonsson 1997 mao et al 1991 selvaraj et al 2016 vaiopoulou et al 2016 limited knowledge exists on the catalytic activity and stability of the proposed electrodes certainly in relationship to each other they do not provide a stability assessment or comparison of the performance of different electrodes monitoring of the sulfide oxidation side products has not been conducted except for the study of vaiopoulou et al but the electrochemical response to these e g anode potential shifts and evolution of anode coating is not reported a study on electrochemical sulfide oxidation from white liquor with high sulfidic content and high alkalinity was provided by behm and simonsson where limited stability of an iridium tantalum oxide coated titanium based electrode was reported under operation at high current densities nevertheless no surface analysis was conducted and only a single electrode material was tested therefore this study aimed to investigate the performance of different electrode materials under these harsh conditions a series of batch and continuous tests were conducted to study the behaviour of the catalytic material ir mmo ru mmo pt irox pt pbox and tio2 irtao2 in highly alkaline ph 12 concentrated sulfidic solutions 50 mm the electrodes were selected based on their high activity towards either the sulfide oxidation or the oxygen evolution reaction depending on the catalyst employed proven in previous studies the different sulfide oxidation products were analysed to assess the activity of these materials the stability of the electrodes was evaluated as the effect of operation at high current density 200 a m 2 high alkalinity and sulfide concentration on the catalyst loading of the electrodes through the combination of the above described tests the impact of the catalyst choice on the sulfide oxidation and the impact of the sulfide oxidation in alkaline conditions on the catalytic layer were established 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrochemical reactor setup all electrochemical experiments were performed at ambient temperature 25 c in a two compartment custom made glass reactor fig s1 guo et al 2014 the reactor was closed by a circular teflon cap 14 cm diameter 1 cm thick where influent and effluent connections enabled continuous inflow and outflow of the anolyte and allowed for sampling the cathode compartment was not sealed to avoid pressure build up due to the formation of h2 between the plastic cap and the glass anode compartment a circular rubber sheet was used to seal the reactor and maintain anaerobic conditions the anodic chamber with a working volume of 700 ml accommodated three independent plate electrodes as working electrodes we the cathodic compartment was equipped with a cylindrical stainless steel mesh counter electrode solana belgium 2 cm diameter 8 cm height the anodic and cathodic compartments were separated by a peek reinforced anion exchange membrane type fumasep fab pk 130 with a thickness of 130 μm fumatech bwt gmbh germany all reported potentials refer to standard hydrogen electrode she but were measured with an ag agcl 3 m kcl reference electrode als japan 0 210 v vs she at 25 c and a calomel saturated kcl reference electrode bio logic sas france 0 244 vs she at 25 c located in the anodic compartment uncompensated resistances between each we and the reference electrode were assessed by a current interrupt technique ci s1 bard and faulkner 2001 the uncompensated resistances are reported in tables s3 and s5 for the activity and stability tests respectively and were considered for the correction of the obtained anode potentials during the activity tests s4 the obtained potentials during the stability tests were not ohmic drop corrected since continuous recording of changes in the ohmic drop during the long term experiments was not possible the anolyte was continuously mixed at a rotation speed of 100 rpm using a magnetic stirrer model f203a0160cr s n 318450 carl roth italy to create sufficient mixing 2 2 electrode materials the ir mmo ru mmo pt irox pt pbox magneto special anodes an evoqua brand the netherlands and tio2 irtao2 by yixing entrustech environmental co ltd china were all made on ti based flat plates support with a surface area of 20 20 mm and 1 mm thickness since the catalyst loadings were all in the range of 5 15 g m 2 except for pbox which had a loading of 150 g m 2 we consider that the electrocatalytic properties are not affected by the loading but rather by the catalyst composition and electrochemical surface area ecsa the electrical connection of the electrodes was prepared for operational use as previously described zhang et al 2017 by using an insulated copper wire as current collector the wire 1 5 mm single core copper wire with pvc coating was glued with silver paint rs components ltd uk europe to the one 20 20 mm side of the plate electrodes the latter was subsequently completely insulated with water proof epoxy glue ts10 thorlabs europe as well as the 1 mm thick sides thereby restricting the active electrode surface to only one 20 20 mm side all parameters taking into account the surface area will be related to this 400 mm2 geometric surface area 2 3 electrolyte preparation and sulfur species measurement an aqueous solution of 50 mm na2s 50 mm naoh at a ph 12 and 30 ms cm conductivity was used as anolyte and a 50 mm naoh solution as catholyte a gas bag filled with n2 was connected to the anolyte storing bottle to preserve anaerobic conditions through the course of the experiment periodic anolyte samplings were performed every 2 h during operation the samples were treated with sulfide antioxidant buffer saob keller lehmann et al 2006 and sulfide sulfite so3 2 and thiosulfate s2o3 2 concentrations were analysed as previously described vaiopoulou et al 2016 the sum of s0 and polysulfides was calculated as the difference between the initial sulfide added in the electrochemical reactor in moles and the soluble sulfur species i e sulfide so3 2 s2o3 2 and so4 2 in this study polysulfides arising from dissolution of the formed s0 in the alkaline sulfidic anolyte mao et al 1991 were not measured separately and the difference of the mole balance was regarded as the sum of elemental sulfur s0 and polysulfides vaiopoulou et al 2016 the sulfide removal rates rhs and the coulombic efficiencies cehs were calculated based on the equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 r h s n h s t

this study polysulfide formation occurring via chemical dissolution of s0 in the sulfide containing solution is expected nevertheless the cehs here was calculated according to the direct oxidation of hs to s0 that would give a recoverable product which is a 2 e process cehs higher than 100 observed for some of the materials of this study are attributed to the formation of polysulfides since the latter necessitates less than 2 e per sulfide removed behm and simonsson 1997 mao et al 1991 vaiopoulou et al 2016 2 4 experimental procedures activity and stability tests were performed through electrochemical techniques with a galvanostat potentiostat vsp 300 bio logic sas france cyclic voltammetry cv linear sweep voltammetry lsv and ci were recorded for each electrode before and after the activity and stability tests fresh electrodes were used for both the activity and the stability tests prior to the activity tests the apparent geometric capacitance of the electrodes was measured by means of cv in a supporting electrolyte in absence of sulfide fig s2 a first cv allowed to quantify the geometric double layer capacitance of each electrode in 50 mm naoh solutions in a potential window from 0 to 1 2 v vs she 0 2 1 v vs ag agcl at 5 mv s 1 scan rate s2 a second cv was recorded in a sulfide containing electrolyte 50 mm na2s 50 mm naoh to identify the sulfide oxidation onset potential batch activity tests were performed over a period of 24 h for each electrode the potential of the electrodes was recorded by chronopotentiommetry cp at a constant current density of 50 a m 2 specific focus was given to the we potential since the anodic sulfide oxidation was the main interest in this study stability tests were performed with a total duration of 305 h in a continuous mode at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 h under continuous mixing of the electrolyte i e 8 8 mmol s per h the anolyte was prepared and kept anaerobic in a 5 l schott bottle from where it was pumped into the anodic compartment using a peristaltic pump of the type 520 s watson marlow usa a constant current density of 125 a m 2 was applied for a period of 278 h this constant current density value was reached after a stepwise increase of 25 a m 2 increments every 1 h time starting from 50 a m 2 current density as a first step this stepwise current density increase of 25 a m 2 increments was conducted a second time at t 278 h starting from 50 a m 2 and increasing to 200 a m 2 this 200 a m 2 step lasted 19 h resulting in a total continuous test period of 305 h the duration of the experiment was determined by the first apparent increase in the anode potential of one of the electrode materials tested an electrode material was considered unstable when the we potential experienced a fast increase at least 3 v in less than 5 h or when the cell voltage reached 10 v shao et al 2014 the instability of the electroactivity of the electrodes was characterized by a relative mass loss of the catalyst from the electrode surface vide infra 2 5 characterization of physical and chemical properties of the electrodes the surface composition of the electrode catalyst was measured using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx prior and after the stability tests by comparison of the initial catalyst to titanium base material onto which the catalyst layer is coated ratio with the final ratio for each of the electrode materials provided by magneto the catalyst layer of the electrodes was analysed using x ray fluorescence xrf prior and after the long term electrochemical oxidation process stability tests an xrf calibration curve was available for the catalyst loading this calibration curve was used to express the remaining catalyst loading after the end of the stability tests as percentage of the initial loading the calibration curve was adjusted for the different loadings therefore a relative evolution of the catalyst loading of the electrodes was assessed with an accuracy of 0 2 g m 2 2 dependent on the electrode coating the sem edx analysis was performed in a feg sem jsm 7600f jeol and the xrf in a fischerscope xray xan fischer technology inc us images before and after the experiments were taken at a magnification of 100 and 400 using 20 kev in 3 points 1 located at the centre and 2 at the edges of each electrode 3 results and discussion 3 1 activity analysis of the electrodes clear differences in surface roughness were observed between the electrode materials when the sem edx images fig 1 were linked with the results of the capacitance measurements fig s2 and table s1 the surface of the electrodes showed the characteristic mud cracked structure except for the tio2 irtao2 electrode material in the case of mmo electrodes the formation of mud cracks is providing a large surface area available for direct electron donor oxidation and at the same time it provides a high durability under the oxidative environment of gases evolution takasu and murakami 2000 higher surface area has been reported to contribute to a higher double layer capacitive current during potentiodynamic measurements apart from the faradaic current arising from the sulfide used as electron donor and or oxygen evolution song et al 2008 the comparison of the capacitance between materials is an important aspect to consider for electrodes with the same projected surface area but differences in electron donor removal efficiencies the double layer capacitance has been proposed before as a possible method for estimation of the electrochemically active surface area of an electrode aromaa and forsén 2006 mccrory et al 2013 the capacitance measured by cv table s1 is an apparent geometric capacitance capp since it can simultaneously arise from two different processes i the double layer capacitance and ii the pseudocapacitance from the oxidation reduction cycle of some elements faradaic process such as the metal oxides in mmo anodes amatore et al 1998 high capp was calculated for the ir mmo and ru mmo with values of 19 4 and 27 2 mf cm 2 respectively followed by the pt irox anode with 7 6 mf cm 2 table s1 the capp linked with the sem images fig 1 can suggest a higher specific surface area for ir mmo and ru mmo compared to the rest of the electrode materials tested in this study related to the mud cracked structure that these electrodes present the lower capp of 3 1 mf cm 2 calculated for the pt anode can be linked to a low specific surface area when compared to mmo anodes within the potential range tested song et al 2008 the same capp value with pt irox 7 6 mf cm 2 was calculated for the tio2 irtao2 anode for the pbox electrode two oxidation peaks were observed at 0 7 and 1 0 v vs she on the cyclic voltammogram fig s2 two distinctive oxidation peaks have been reported in alkaline electrolytes 0 05 1 5 m naoh the first one attributed to pbo formation and the second to the oxidation of pbo to pbo2 in a potential range from 0 8 to 1 0 v vs she rehim et al 1997 in this light due to the peak shaped cv produced by the pbox electrode the capp was not calculated n a 3 2 catalyst choice impact on the final product of sulfide oxidation during the 24 h activity tests the species formed varied from s0 to other sulfur oxyanions and polysulfides with an increase of products variation over time fig 2 the sulfur species produced from sulfide oxidation differed with the anode materials starting at a low anodic potential of 0 5 v vs she direct sulfide oxidation to s0 is typically the first reaction to take place miller and chen 2005 followed by s2o3 2 so3 2 and so4 2 mao et al 1991 this can be seen in fig 2 with the production of s0 as main sulfide oxidation product within the first 10 h of the experiments in the case of the pt and pbox electrodes after 10 h either s2o3 2 or so4 2 depending on the catalytic coating are the main sulfide oxidation products observed as final products within the electrode materials as seen by the chronopotentiograms in fig 3 the production of sulfur oxyanions during the sulfide oxidation can be associated to high anodic potentials reached in the activity tests at different time points for each of the electrodes the presence of so4 2 as final sulfide oxidation product can be explained by substitution of the produced so3 2 by the more thermodynamically stable so4 2 mao et al 1991 with the ratio of so4 2 over so3 2 increasing after 6 h different shifts of we potential towards higher potential values were observed for all of the electrode materials during the 24 h activity tests fig 3 for all electrodes except for the tio2 irtao2 the sulfide oxidation process started with direct sulfide oxidation to s0 at anode potentials in the range of 0 2 0 8 v vs she after initial direct sulfide oxidation to s0 at the beginning of the activity tests the anode potential increased for all the materials to values higher than 1 v vs she where simultaneously oxygen evolution and sulfide oxidation are being conducted a typical onset potential for electrochemical sulfide oxidation in alkaline wastewater is 0 065 v vs she mao et al 1991 vaiopoulou et al 2016 direct anodic sulfide oxidation results in formation of insulating s0 on the surface of the electrode the presence of s0 leads to a decrease of the effective surface area of the anode available for sulfide oxidation which jointly with the consumption of the electron donor will contribute to a certain increase of the anode potential wang et al 2015 the increase in anode potential also leads to the formation of different products from sulfide oxidation miller and chen 2006 either through direct sulfide oxidation towards more energetically demanding sulfur oxyanions or through indirect oxidation driven by oxygen evolution potential oscillations were observed for ru mmo and ir mmo during the first 10 11 h of the activity tests oscillations during electrooxidation of sulfide on metal oxide electrodes have been reported as a result of a passivation layer formed by s0 particles deposited at the surface of the catalytic layer of the electrode chen and miller 2004 fornés and bisang 2017 this is followed by a deflaking of the s0 and periodic evolution of oxygen chen and miller 2004 for ru mmo and ir mmo the oscillation amplitude varies with an average of 0 2 1 5 v vs she extensive study of potential oscillations in electrochemical sulfide oxidation on pt electrodes has been conducted by miller and chen 2006 according to their findings the upper zone of the oscillation can be attributed to oxygen evolution reaction and oxidation of sulfide to sulfur oxyanions such as so4 2 while the lower areas can be attributed to the oxidation of sulfide to s0 or polysulfides but without o2 evolution in this study gas bubble formations coinciding with the upper part of the oscillations were visually observed following after the deposition of s0 particles on the surface of the electrode after consumption of the sulfide as electron donor the production of s0 is replaced by production of sulfur oxyanions which limits the oscillation phenomena and results in a stabilized 1 v vs she anode potential similar for both the ir mmo and ru mmo electrodes the oscillatory behaviour of the potentials over time did not result in abrupt changes on the evolution of the sulfur products fig 2 a sulfide removal rate of 0 5 0 0 mmol h was achieved by the ir mmo electrode at a low average anode potential of 0 81 0 30 v vs she and a cehs of 43 9 0 2 the change in the anode potential corresponds to the shift from an exclusive direct sulfide oxidation reaction to simultaneous sulfide oxidation and oxygen evolution reactions fig s2 among all anodes tested ru mmo was the most energetically efficient material for sulfide oxidation with a starting anode potential of 0 41 0 04 v vs she to a final of 1 07 0 03 v vs she after 24 h and an average of 0 92 0 17 v vs she table 1 the sulfide removal rate achieved by the ru mmo electrode for the total 24 h of the activity test was 0 8 0 0 mmol h with a cehs of 63 2 0 5 this is also depicted by the formation of more oxidized products such as s2o3 2 in the final hours of the activity tests the pt irox pt and tio2 irtao2 electrodes were considered the least suitable of the materials due to their high average anode potential the high anode potential of 1 42 0 14 v vs she observed in the beginning of the oxidation process for the tio2 irtao2 electrode was attributed to the oxygen evolution reaction taking place for the most part with limited sulfide oxidation this also explains the low cehs of 41 1 4 2 obtained for this material the lowest obtained among all the materials tested this high average anode potential was expected for the pt electrode due to its relatively low catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution song et al 2008 which contributes to the high final anode potential of 1 74 0 10 v vs she obtained by this electrode in the case of pt and ru mmo the s0 produced was visually observed either with deposition of the particles on the surface of the electrode fig s7 or with the changing of the electrolyte colour to yellow which is associated with polysulfides formation after reaction of the produced s0 with the remaining sulfide in alkaline solutions moo et al 2018 selvaraj et al 2016 the pbox electrode achieved high sulfide removal rate 0 8 0 0 mmol h with 64 7 0 3 cehs and a low average 0 86 0 37 v vs she anode potential however environmental concerns raised by the dissolution of this material might hinder further application of this electrode for sulfide oxidation 3 3 continuous evaluation of material stability 3 3 1 electrochemical measurements continuous tests for material stability evaluation were performed on the electrode materials for 305 h the current density was increased stepwise from 50 to 200 a m 2 with 25 a m 2 increments to monitor the evolution of the anodic potentials in every current density step to be able to compare the stability within the electrode materials the tests were all stopped at the same time when one electrode pt irox in this case reached a cell voltage of 10 v anode potential of 5 v vs she at current densities of 50 200 a m 2 the ir mmo anodic potential remained stable with an average of 1 82 0 02 v vs she at the 200 a m 2 step the ru mmo showed stable and low operational potentials which were repeatable at the two stepwise increments of current density up to 125 a m 2 fig 4 at the last current density step of 200 a m 2 the initial potential of ru mmo anode was 1 54 v vs she and increased to a final potential of 1 59 v vs she with an average of 1 56 0 02 v vs she fig s8 and table s4 this was the lowest average anode potential achieved among all the electrode materials the pbox electrode showed also a repeatable performance at the two stepwise increments of current density with an average potential of 2 04 0 04 v vs she obtained during the 200 a m 2 step both pt and tio2 irtao2 catalysts showed an increase of their potential at the repeat of the current density stepwise increment among all the tested materials pt and tio2 irtao2 exhibit a higher average potential at 200 a m 2 of 2 60 0 01 and 2 48 0 01 v vs she respectively both materials preserved a stable anode potential in the last step on the contrary the potential of the pt irox anode was continuously increasing from 2 93 to 6 60 v vs she at 200 a m 2 fig s8 and table s4 this potential increase of more than 3 v over only 14 h suggested that the electrode either lost most of its catalyst layer or was largely and increasingly covered with insulating s0 3 3 2 electrode surface characterization the passivation or loss of the catalyst layer at the electrode surface was assessed using sem edx and compared with the results obtained from xrf analysis in the first case the surface composition was determined with a spectrum of the elements present on the electrode surface in depth of a few μm in this way remaining sulfur compounds on the electrode surface can also be detected which indicates either s0 that has permanently covered the catalytic surface of the electrode presence of sulfur ions or metal sulfide bonds created during sulfide oxidation for the exact nature of sulfur x ray photoelectron spectroscopy can be conducted in the case of xrf the catalyst loading before and after use of the electrodes was recorded to give a relative percentage change with respect to the original coating the results are displayed in table 2 due to the complexity of the electrochemical phenomena taking place during sulfide oxidation the catalytic surface changes can be attributed not only to s0 deposition but also to a selective leaching and metal dissolution cherevko et al 2016 hamilton and woods 1983 martelli et al 1994 the xrf results showed 100 remaining coating for the ir mmo while the sem edx showed a decrease of the catalyst to base metal ratio from 26 67 0 53 to 19 73 0 60 this decrease could suggest s0 deposition that covers part of the catalytic surface of the ir mmo rather than a loss of catalyst the ru mmo catalyst layer change correlated well with the stability tests results the xrf results suggested that after the stability tests 92 of the catalytic coating remained intact likewise the sem edx results showed a rather limited decrease of 17 of the initial ru ti catalyst relative to total surface composition table 2 this reduced catalyst over base metal ratio can be explained by s0 deposition but in part also by the catalyst leaching due to corrosion table 2 the xrf results for pt and pbox electrodes showed 89 and 66 of the catalyst loading respectively still coated on the ti surface after the stability tests in the literature pb or pbox electrodes dissolution phenomena have been reported where anodic pb dissolution and film formation complex processes were taking place in alkaline wastewaters rehim and mohamed 1998 rehim et al 1997 van hege et al 2004 yang et al 2016 a brown reddish colour was observed in the anolyte after the batch and during the continuous sulfide oxidation test fig s6 that can be associated with dissolved pbo2 in the alkaline electrolyte vatistas and cristofaro 2000 it is important to note that the mechanisms through which the pbox electrode participates to sulfide removal can bring a negative rather than positive environmental effect on the industrial sulfide containing wastewater streams the results of sem edx and xrf of the pt irox electrode showed no remaining catalyst layer which is in good agreement with the fast and large increase in the anode potential at the end of the stability tests the sem edx combined with the xrf results can be associated with the potential changes during the stability tests the full catalyst loss for the pt irox electrode corresponds to the decrease of the catalytic activity at high current density increase of the anode potential of 3 v in 14 h at 200 a m 2 fig s8 on the contrary the most stable electrode ir mmo preserved intact catalytic coating during the stability tests 3 3 3 implications and future perspectives one of the implications of this study is the unknown oxidation mechanisms that are governing the sulfide oxidation steps on the electrode surface in table s1 the oxygen evolution onset potential oep and the sulfide oxidation onset potential sop are given it can be assumed that indirect sulfide oxidation via o2 evolution will be favoured for the electrodes with low oep which was the case for the mmo electrodes ir mmo pt irox and tio2 irtao2 oep 0 80 0 77 0 75 v vs she respectively the oep differences dictated by the morphological differences and the catalyst composition will result in different operational sulfide oxidation performances in contrary the electrodes with high oep such as pt and pbox in our study 1 01 and 1 06 v vs she respectively will mainly undergo direct sulfide oxidation this is supported by the high cehs achieved by the pt and pbox electrodes 58 9 and 64 7 respectively and the lower of the mmo electrodes the ru mmo constitutes an exception which although presenting a low oep 0 75 v vs she achieved a high cehs of 63 2 this indicates that the oep cannot be considered as sole indicator of the oxidation mechanisms at different electrodes and both oep and sop in combination with mechanistic studies are needed to determine the oxidation mechanisms at different electrodes further research is needed to establish the impact of phenomena such as the oscillations produced by sulfide oxidation and provide a quantitative assessment of how they affect the products of the oxidation and also the electrode lifetime monitoring of metal leaching should be considered in further studies in order to establish corrosion rates e g amount of catalyst leaching per surface per time with respect to the specific catalytic materials and current densities applied the 8 catalyst loading loss of the ru mmo electrode in these 305 h of continuous operation raises concerns about its performance on future long term applications considering the high price of this catalyst on the contrary the five times higher price of the more stable ir mmo suggests that a determination of a good balance between activity and stability of the electrode materials will be key for a future scale up of the system longer term field studies of the electrode performance operated with real scs are needed to quantify the electrode lifetime further work should be implemented to compare the sulfide removal efficiencies lifetime and price of the different electrodes to assess practical application of electrochemical sulfide treatment with the ir mmo and ru mmo electrodes 4 conclusions we investigated the impact of the catalyst choice on the activity of the ir mmo ru mmo pt irox pt pbox and tio2 irtao2 electrodes towards sulfide oxidation and on their stability under operation at high sulfidic i e 50 mm sulfide and highly alkaline conditions i e ph 12 the key findings of this work are the ru mmo was an active material towards sulfide oxidation with a ce of 63 2 0 5 and an average anode potential of 0 92 v 0 17 v vs she for a constant current density of 50 a m 2 among all materials the most stable electrode for sulfide oxidation was ir mmo with no catalyst loss observed and only a small increase in potential 0 5 v during the 305 h of continuous operation the tio2 irtao2 electrode was not a suitable material towards sulfide oxidation as it was unable to operate at the low anodic potential that is desired for direct sulfide oxidation the instability of pt irox with an increase of 3 v and total loss of the catalytic coating made this material not

19138,electrochemical sulfide removal can be attractive as a zero chemical input approach for treatment of waste streams such as spent caustics coupled to caustic recovery a key concern is possible decline in catalytic activity due to passivation from deposited elemental sulfur s0 on the anode surface and stability limitation due to sulfide oxidation under highly alkaline conditions in this study six commercially available electrode materials ir mixed metal oxide mmo ru mmo pt irox pt pbox and tio2 irtao2 coated titanium based electrodes were tested to investigate the impact of the electrocatalyst on the process efficiency in terms of sulfide removal and final product of sulfide oxidation as well as to determine the stability of the electrocatalyst under high sulfide concentrations 50 mm na2s and high alkalinity ph 12 short term experiments showed that the catalyst type impacts the anode potential and the sulfide oxidation reaction products longer term experiments under current densities up to 200 a m 2 showed a high differentiation in stability performance among the catalysts ru mmo was the most active towards sulfide oxidation with a coulombic efficiency of 63 2 0 5 at an average anode potential of 0 92 0 17 v vs she ir mmo was the most stable preserving 100 of its original catalyst loading during the tests the results demonstrated that ru mmo and ir mmo were the most suitable electrode materials for sulfide oxidation under highly alkaline conditions while the need for establishing a good trade off between activity stability and cost still persists

industrial wastewaters such as geothermal brines el sherif et al 2010 and spent caustic streams scs ateya et al 2005 dutta et al 2008 pikaar et al 2015 the high alkalinity 5 12 wt naoh and sulfidic content 0 1 4 wt sulfide s of scs limit the feasibility of biological treatment consequently treatment of scs mostly relies on chemical dosing which incurs large caustic consumption and operational costs vaiopoulou et al 2016 in this context an interesting and chemical free alternative method is electrochemical sulfide oxidation in addition to its chemical free nature another advantage of the electrochemical method is the sulfide recovery in the form of elemental sulfur s0 along with the recovery of hydrogen gas h2 as potentially high value compound dutta et al 2008 rabaey et al 2006 vaiopoulou et al 2016 electrochemical sulfide oxidation includes a variety of both direct and indirect sulfide oxidation reactions that can simultaneously take place under a wide potential range in the case of indirect oxidation sulfide is oxidized through intermediate oxidants oh o2 cl2 that are anodically produced pikaar et al 2011a the final products of oxidation can be a mixture of s0 polysulfides sulfate so4 2 and thiosulfate s2o3 2 mao et al 1991 miller and chen 2005 pikaar et al 2011b the oxidation products depend on the electrode material used and the operational conditions such as the sulfide concentration the ph the convection and the potential of the anode dutta et al 2009 song et al 2008 vaiopoulou et al 2016 when s0 is produced through direct sulfide oxidation i e a 2 electron process it is deposited on the anode surface vaiopoulou et al 2016 as s0 is an excellent insulator with a high resistivity 1015 ω m its deposition results in a decrease in the active electrode surface area fornés and bisang 2017 this results in an increase of the anode potential thus increasing the power requirements of the system and ultimately results in complete anode passivation dutta et al 2009 this phenomenon is typically illustrated during galvanostatic experiments where a punctual and dramatic increase of the anodic potential reflects the start of o2 evolution co occurrence after a threshold loss of the anode active surface area for sulfide oxidation a wide variety of electrode materials has been tested for anodic sulfide oxidation common carbon based materials such as graphite plates anani et al 1990 and carbon felt ateya et al 2005 have low cost and although they mainly produce s0 that can be recovered suffer from electrode passivation requiring surface regeneration dutta et al 2009 a major disadvantage of carbon based electrodes is that carbon can thermodynamically be oxidized to co2 from potentials as low as e0 co2 c 0 207 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she fabbri et al 2014 this can result in dissolution of the electrode itself simultaneously with the onset of oxygen evolution at increasing levels of electrode passivation yi et al 2017 non carbon based electrodes such as titanium ti oxide ceramic el sherif et al 2010 platinum kharafi et al 2010 ramasubramanian 1975 and nickel behm and simonsson 1999 electrodes have been investigated in industrial wastewater treatment applications in particular for geothermal brines or white liquor from the pulp and paper industry the reported drawbacks of the aforementioned electrodes include activity loss due to s0 particles accumulation on the electrode surface reduced kinetics towards sulfide oxidation lawrence et al 2002 waterston et al 2007 and catalytic surface poisoning due to the formation of metal sulfide films behm and simonsson 1999 kharafi et al 2010 miller and chen 2006 considering the above limitations ti based electrodes coated with a thin active layer of mixed metal oxides mmo comninellis and vercesi 1991 have been proposed for treatment of sulfide containing sewage since they possess high stability cherevko et al 2016 pikaar et al 2011a and a good performance towards sulfide oxidation pikaar et al 2011b vaiopoulou et al 2016 a consideration when using mmo electrodes is their high manufacturing costs as they employ rare metals as catalysts nevertheless these electrodes present excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability compared to the so far examined carbon and pt based electrodes katsounaros et al 2014 in alkaline electrolytes and the alternative catalysts investigated at present have not yet been proven stable under real life conditions song et al 2018 so far different noble metal coated and mmo electrodes such as pt ir pbo2 pdo co3o4 and rhox tio2 coated ti based electrodes were tested for the electrochemical treatment of tannery wastewater with sulfide concentrations ranging between 5 and 10 mm szpyrkowicz et al 2005 depending on the electrode material more than 90 sulfide removal was achieved in a 15 40 min electrolysis time with indirect sulfide oxidation through oxygen being the most probable oxidation mechanism the feasibility of electrochemical sulfide removal from sewage i e 0 3 mm sulfide using 5 different mmo coated ti based electrodes ta ir ru ir pt ir sno2 and pbo2 was investigated at a current density of 100 a m 2 higher than 70 sulfide removal and coulombic efficiencies ce were achieved through indirect sulfide oxidation and without anode passivation pikaar et al 2011b continuous sulfide oxidation in alkaline wastewater 300 mm sulfide was achieved at 200 a m 2 with ir mmo anodes vaiopoulou et al 2016 the sulfide removal reached 80 and the ce was higher than 68 with so4 2 or s2o3 2 as main products of indirect sulfide oxidation the above described studies highlight that several aspects drive the selection of the electrode material including i activity for sulfide oxidation in a specific alkaline stream ii required electrode service life iii concentration range of the sulfide and iv targeted product s while most studies on alkaline sulfidic waste streams have focused on proof of concepts for sulfide removal anani et al 1990 behm and simonsson 1997 mao et al 1991 selvaraj et al 2016 vaiopoulou et al 2016 limited knowledge exists on the catalytic activity and stability of the proposed electrodes certainly in relationship to each other they do not provide a stability assessment or comparison of the performance of different electrodes monitoring of the sulfide oxidation side products has not been conducted except for the study of vaiopoulou et al but the electrochemical response to these e g anode potential shifts and evolution of anode coating is not reported a study on electrochemical sulfide oxidation from white liquor with high sulfidic content and high alkalinity was provided by behm and simonsson where limited stability of an iridium tantalum oxide coated titanium based electrode was reported under operation at high current densities nevertheless no surface analysis was conducted and only a single electrode material was tested therefore this study aimed to investigate the performance of different electrode materials under these harsh conditions a series of batch and continuous tests were conducted to study the behaviour of the catalytic material ir mmo ru mmo pt irox pt pbox and tio2 irtao2 in highly alkaline ph 12 concentrated sulfidic solutions 50 mm the electrodes were selected based on their high activity towards either the sulfide oxidation or the oxygen evolution reaction depending on the catalyst employed proven in previous studies the different sulfide oxidation products were analysed to assess the activity of these materials the stability of the electrodes was evaluated as the effect of operation at high current density 200 a m 2 high alkalinity and sulfide concentration on the catalyst loading of the electrodes through the combination of the above described tests the impact of the catalyst choice on the sulfide oxidation and the impact of the sulfide oxidation in alkaline conditions on the catalytic layer were established 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrochemical reactor setup all electrochemical experiments were performed at ambient temperature 25 c in a two

a circular rubber sheet was used to seal the reactor and maintain anaerobic conditions the anodic chamber with a working volume of 700 ml accommodated three independent plate electrodes as working electrodes we the cathodic compartment was equipped with a cylindrical stainless steel mesh counter electrode solana belgium 2 cm diameter 8 cm height the anodic and cathodic compartments were

reported in tables s3 and s5 for the activity and stability tests respectively and were considered for the correction of the obtained anode potentials during the activity tests s4 the obtained potentials during the stability tests were not ohmic drop corrected since continuous recording of changes in the ohmic drop during the long term experiments was not possible the anolyte was continuously mixed at a rotation speed of 100 rpm using a magnetic stirrer model f203a0160cr s n 318450 carl roth italy to create sufficient mixing 2 2 electrode materials the ir mmo ru mmo pt irox pt pbox magneto special anodes an evoqua brand the netherlands and tio2 irtao2 by yixing entrustech environmental co ltd china were all made on ti based flat plates support with a surface area of 20 20 mm and 1 mm thickness since the catalyst loadings were all in the range of 5 15 g m 2 except for pbox which had a loading of 150 g m 2 we consider that the electrocatalytic properties are not affected by the loading but rather by the catalyst composition and electrochemical surface area ecsa the electrical connection of the electrodes was prepared for operational use as previously described zhang et al 2017 by using an insulated copper wire as current collector the wire 1 5 mm single core copper wire with pvc coating was glued with silver paint rs components ltd uk europe to the one 20 20 mm side of the plate electrodes the latter was subsequently completely insulated with water proof epoxy glue ts10 thorlabs europe as well as the 1 mm thick sides thereby restricting the active electrode surface to only one 20 20 mm side all parameters taking into account the surface area will be related to this 400 mm2 geometric surface area 2 3 electrolyte preparation and sulfur species measurement an aqueous solution of 50 mm na2s 50 mm naoh at a ph 12 and 30 ms cm conductivity was used as anolyte and a 50 mm naoh solution as catholyte a gas bag filled with n2 was connected to the anolyte storing bottle to preserve anaerobic conditions through the course of the experiment periodic anolyte samplings were performed every 2 h during operation the samples were treated with sulfide antioxidant buffer saob keller lehmann et al 2006 and sulfide sulfite so3 2 and thiosulfate s2o3 2 concentrations were analysed as previously described vaiopoulou et al 2016 the sum of s0 and polysulfides was calculated as the difference between the initial sulfide added in the electrochemical reactor in moles and the soluble sulfur species i e sulfide so3 2 s2o3 2 and so4 2 in this study polysulfides arising from dissolution of the formed s0 in the alkaline sulfidic anolyte mao et al 1991 were not measured separately and the difference of the mole balance was regarded as the sum of elemental sulfur s0 and polysulfides vaiopoulou et al 2016 the sulfide removal rates rhs and the coulombic efficiencies cehs were calculated based on the equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 r h s n h s t

this study polysulfide formation occurring via chemical dissolution of s0 in the sulfide containing solution is expected nevertheless the cehs here was calculated according to the direct oxidation of hs to s0 that would give a recoverable product which is a 2 e process cehs higher than 100 observed for some of the materials of this study are attributed to the formation of polysulfides since the latter necessitates less than 2 e per sulfide removed behm and simonsson 1997 mao et al 1991 vaiopoulou et al 2016 2 4 experimental procedures activity and stability tests were performed through electrochemical techniques with a galvanostat potentiostat vsp 300 bio logic sas france cyclic voltammetry cv linear sweep voltammetry lsv and ci were recorded for each electrode before and after the activity and stability tests fresh electrodes were used for both the activity and the stability tests prior to the activity tests the apparent geometric capacitance of the electrodes was measured by means of cv in a supporting electrolyte in absence of sulfide fig s2 a first cv allowed to quantify the geometric double layer capacitance of each electrode in 50 mm naoh solutions in a potential window from 0 to 1 2 v vs she 0 2 1 v vs ag agcl at 5 mv s 1 scan rate s2 a second cv was recorded in a sulfide containing electrolyte 50 mm na2s 50 mm naoh to identify the sulfide oxidation onset potential batch activity tests were performed over a period of 24 h for each electrode the potential of the electrodes was recorded by chronopotentiommetry cp at a constant current density of 50 a m 2 specific focus was given to the we potential since the anodic sulfide oxidation was the main interest in this study stability tests were performed with a total duration of 305 h in a continuous mode at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 h under continuous mixing of the electrolyte i e 8 8 mmol s per h the anolyte was prepared and kept anaerobic in a 5 l schott bottle from where it was pumped into the anodic compartment using a peristaltic pump of the type 520 s watson marlow usa a constant current density of 125 a m 2 was applied for a period of 278 h this constant current density value was reached after a stepwise increase of 25 a m 2 increments every 1 h time starting from 50 a m 2 current density as a first step this stepwise current density increase of 25 a m 2 increments was conducted a second time at t 278 h starting from 50 a m 2 and increasing to 200 a m 2 this 200 a m 2 step lasted 19 h resulting in a total continuous test period of 305 h the duration of the experiment was determined by the first apparent increase in the anode potential of one of the electrode materials tested an electrode material was considered unstable when the we potential experienced a fast increase at least 3 v in less than 5 h or when the cell voltage reached 10 v shao et al 2014 the instability of the electroactivity of the electrodes was characterized by a relative mass loss of the catalyst from the electrode surface vide infra 2 5 characterization of physical and chemical properties of the electrodes the surface composition of the electrode catalyst was measured using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx prior and after the stability tests by comparison of the initial catalyst to titanium base material onto which the catalyst layer is coated ratio with the final ratio for each of the electrode materials provided by magneto the catalyst layer of the electrodes was analysed using x ray fluorescence xrf prior and after the long term electrochemical oxidation process stability tests an xrf calibration curve was available for the catalyst loading this calibration curve was used to express the remaining catalyst loading after the end of the stability tests as percentage of the initial loading the calibration curve was adjusted for the different loadings therefore a relative evolution of the catalyst loading of the electrodes was assessed with an accuracy of 0 2 g m 2 2 dependent on the electrode coating the sem edx analysis was performed in a feg sem jsm 7600f jeol and the xrf in a fischerscope xray xan fischer technology inc us images before and after the experiments were taken at a magnification of 100 and 400 using 20 kev in 3 points 1 located at the centre and 2 at the edges of each electrode 3 results and discussion 3 1 activity analysis of the electrodes clear differences in surface roughness were observed between the electrode materials when the sem edx images fig 1 were linked with the results of the capacitance measurements fig s2 and table s1 the surface of the electrodes showed the characteristic mud cracked structure except for the tio2 irtao2 electrode material in the case of mmo electrodes the formation of mud cracks is providing a large surface area available for direct electron donor oxidation and at the same time it provides a high durability under the oxidative environment of gases evolution takasu and murakami 2000 higher surface area has been reported to contribute to a higher double layer capacitive current during potentiodynamic measurements apart from the faradaic current arising from the sulfide used as electron donor and or oxygen evolution song et al 2008 the comparison of the capacitance between materials is an important aspect to consider for electrodes with the same projected surface area but differences in electron donor removal efficiencies the double layer capacitance has been proposed before as a possible method for estimation of the electrochemically active surface area of an electrode aromaa and forsén 2006 mccrory et al 2013 the capacitance measured by cv table s1 is an apparent geometric capacitance capp since it can simultaneously arise from two different processes i the double layer capacitance and ii the pseudocapacitance from the oxidation reduction cycle of some elements faradaic process such as the metal oxides in mmo anodes amatore et al 1998 high capp was calculated for the ir mmo and ru mmo with values of 19 4 and 27 2 mf cm 2 respectively followed by the pt irox anode with 7 6 mf cm 2 table s1 the capp linked with the sem images fig 1 can suggest a higher specific surface area for ir mmo and ru mmo compared to the rest of the electrode materials tested in this study related to the mud cracked structure that these electrodes present the lower capp of 3 1 mf cm 2 calculated for the pt anode can be linked to a low specific surface area when compared to mmo anodes within the potential range tested song et al 2008 the same capp value with pt irox 7 6 mf cm 2 was calculated for the tio2 irtao2 anode for the pbox electrode two oxidation peaks were observed at 0 7 and 1 0 v vs she on the cyclic voltammogram fig s2 two distinctive oxidation peaks have been reported in alkaline electrolytes 0 05 1 5 m naoh the first one attributed to pbo formation and the second to the oxidation of pbo to pbo2 in a potential range from 0 8 to 1 0 v vs she rehim et al 1997 in this light due to the peak shaped cv produced by the pbox electrode the capp was not calculated n a 3 2 catalyst choice impact on the final product of sulfide oxidation during the 24 h activity tests the species formed varied from s0 to other sulfur oxyanions and polysulfides with an increase of products variation over time fig 2 the sulfur species produced from sulfide oxidation differed with the anode materials starting at a low anodic potential of 0 5 v vs she direct sulfide oxidation to s0 is typically the first reaction to take place miller and chen 2005 followed by s2o3 2 so3 2 and so4 2 mao et al 1991 this can be seen in fig 2 with the production of s0 as main sulfide oxidation product within the first 10 h of the experiments in the case of the pt and pbox electrodes after 10 h either s2o3 2 or so4 2 depending on the catalytic coating are the main sulfide oxidation products observed as final products within the electrode materials as seen by the chronopotentiograms in fig 3 the production of sulfur oxyanions during the sulfide oxidation can be associated to high anodic potentials reached in the activity tests at different time points for each of the electrodes the presence of so4 2 as final sulfide oxidation product can be explained by substitution of the produced so3 2 by the more thermodynamically stable so4 2 mao et al 1991 with the ratio of so4 2 over so3 2 increasing after 6 h different shifts of we potential towards higher potential values were observed for all of the electrode materials during the 24 h activity tests fig 3 for all electrodes except for the tio2 irtao2 the sulfide oxidation process started with direct sulfide oxidation to s0 at anode potentials in the range of 0 2 0 8 v vs she after initial direct sulfide oxidation to s0 at the beginning of the activity tests the anode potential increased for all the materials to values higher than 1 v vs she where simultaneously oxygen evolution and sulfide oxidation are being conducted a typical onset potential for electrochemical sulfide oxidation in alkaline wastewater is 0 065 v vs she mao et al 1991 vaiopoulou et al 2016 direct anodic sulfide oxidation results in formation of insulating s0 on the surface of the electrode the presence of s0 leads to a decrease of the effective surface area of the anode available for sulfide oxidation which jointly with the consumption of the electron donor will contribute to a certain increase of the anode potential wang et al 2015 the increase in anode potential also leads to the formation of different products from sulfide oxidation miller and chen 2006 either through direct sulfide oxidation towards more energetically demanding sulfur oxyanions or through indirect oxidation driven by oxygen evolution potential oscillations were observed for ru mmo and ir mmo during the first 10 11 h of the activity tests oscillations during electrooxidation of sulfide on metal oxide electrodes have been reported as a result of a passivation layer formed by s0 particles deposited at the surface of the catalytic layer of the electrode chen and miller 2004 fornés and bisang 2017 this is followed by a deflaking of the s0 and periodic evolution of oxygen chen and miller 2004 for ru mmo and ir mmo the oscillation amplitude varies with an average of 0 2 1 5 v vs she extensive study of potential oscillations in electrochemical sulfide oxidation on pt electrodes has been conducted by miller and chen 2006 according to their findings the upper zone of the oscillation can be attributed to oxygen evolution reaction and oxidation of sulfide to sulfur oxyanions such as so4 2 while the lower areas can be attributed to the oxidation of sulfide to s0 or polysulfides but without o2 evolution in this study gas bubble formations coinciding with the upper part of the oscillations were visually observed following after the deposition of s0 particles on the surface of the electrode after consumption of the sulfide as electron donor the production of s0 is replaced by production of sulfur oxyanions which limits the oscillation phenomena and results in a stabilized 1 v vs she anode potential similar for both the ir mmo and ru mmo electrodes the oscillatory behaviour of the potentials over time did not result in abrupt changes on the evolution of the sulfur products fig 2 a sulfide removal rate of 0 5 0 0 mmol h was achieved by the ir mmo electrode at a low average anode potential of 0 81 0 30 v vs she and a cehs of 43 9 0 2 the change in the anode potential corresponds to the shift from an exclusive direct sulfide oxidation reaction to simultaneous sulfide oxidation and oxygen evolution reactions fig s2 among all anodes tested ru mmo was the most energetically efficient material for sulfide oxidation with a starting anode potential of 0 41 0 04 v vs she to a final of 1 07 0 03 v vs she after 24 h and an average of 0 92 0 17 v vs she table 1 the sulfide removal rate achieved by the ru mmo electrode for the total 24 h of the activity test was 0 8 0 0 mmol h with a cehs of 63 2 0 5 this is also depicted by the formation of more oxidized products such as s2o3 2 in the final hours of the activity tests the pt irox pt and tio2 irtao2 electrodes were considered the least suitable of the materials due to their high average anode potential the high anode potential of 1 42 0 14 v vs she observed in the beginning of the oxidation process for the tio2 irtao2 electrode was attributed to the oxygen evolution reaction taking place for the most part with limited sulfide oxidation this also explains the low cehs of 41 1 4 2 obtained for this material the lowest obtained among all the materials tested this high average anode potential was expected for the pt electrode due to its relatively low catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution song et al 2008 which contributes to the high final anode potential of 1 74 0 10 v vs she obtained by this electrode in the case of pt and ru mmo the s0 produced was visually observed either with deposition of the particles on the surface of the electrode fig s7 or with the changing of the electrolyte colour to yellow which is associated with polysulfides formation after reaction of the produced s0 with the remaining sulfide in alkaline solutions moo et al 2018 selvaraj et al 2016 the pbox electrode achieved high sulfide removal rate 0 8 0 0 mmol h with 64 7 0 3 cehs and a low average 0 86 0 37 v vs she anode potential however environmental concerns raised by the dissolution of this material might hinder further application of this electrode for sulfide oxidation 3 3 continuous evaluation of material stability 3 3 1 electrochemical measurements continuous tests for material stability evaluation were performed on the electrode materials for 305 h the current density was increased stepwise from 50 to 200 a m 2 with 25 a m 2 increments to monitor the evolution of the anodic potentials in every current density step to be able to compare the stability within the electrode materials the tests were all stopped at the same time when one electrode pt irox in this case reached a cell voltage of 10 v anode potential of 5 v vs she at current densities of 50 200 a m 2 the ir mmo anodic potential remained stable with an average of 1 82 0 02 v vs she at the 200 a m 2 step the ru mmo showed stable and low operational potentials which were repeatable at the two stepwise increments of current density up to 125 a m 2 fig 4 at the last current density step of 200 a m 2 the initial potential of ru mmo anode was 1 54 v vs she and increased to a final potential of 1 59 v vs she with an average of 1 56 0 02 v vs she fig s8 and table s4 this was the lowest average anode potential achieved among all the electrode materials the pbox electrode showed also a repeatable performance at the two stepwise increments of current density with an average potential of 2 04 0 04 v vs she obtained during the 200 a m 2 step both pt and tio2 irtao2 catalysts showed an increase of their potential at the repeat of the current density stepwise increment among all the tested materials pt and tio2 irtao2 exhibit a higher average potential at 200 a m 2 of 2 60 0 01 and 2 48 0 01 v vs she respectively both materials preserved a stable anode potential in the last step on the contrary the potential of the pt irox anode was continuously increasing from 2 93 to 6 60 v vs she at 200 a m 2 fig s8 and table s4 this potential increase of more than 3 v over only 14 h suggested that the electrode either lost most of its catalyst layer or was largely and increasingly covered with insulating s0 3 3 2 electrode surface characterization the passivation or loss of the catalyst layer at the electrode surface was assessed using sem edx and compared with the results obtained from xrf analysis in the first case the surface composition was determined with a spectrum of the elements present on the electrode surface in depth of a few μm in this way remaining sulfur compounds on the electrode surface can also be detected which indicates either s0 that has permanently covered the catalytic surface of the electrode presence of sulfur ions or metal sulfide bonds created during sulfide oxidation for the exact nature of sulfur x ray photoelectron spectroscopy can be conducted in the case of xrf the catalyst loading before and after use of the electrodes was recorded to give a relative percentage change with respect to the original coating the results are displayed in table 2 due to the complexity of the electrochemical phenomena taking place during sulfide oxidation the catalytic surface changes can be attributed not only to s0 deposition but also to a selective leaching and metal dissolution cherevko et al 2016 hamilton and woods 1983 martelli et al 1994 the xrf results showed 100 remaining coating for the ir mmo while the sem edx showed a decrease of the catalyst to base metal ratio from 26 67 0 53 to 19 73 0 60 this decrease could suggest s0 deposition that covers part of the catalytic surface of the ir mmo rather than a loss of catalyst the ru mmo catalyst layer change correlated well with the stability tests results the xrf results suggested that after the stability tests 92 of the catalytic coating remained intact likewise the sem edx results showed a rather limited decrease of 17 of the initial ru ti catalyst relative to total surface composition table 2 this reduced catalyst over base metal ratio can be explained by s0 deposition but in part also by the catalyst leaching due to corrosion table 2 the xrf results for pt and pbox electrodes showed 89 and 66 of the catalyst loading respectively still coated on the ti surface after the stability tests in the literature pb or pbox electrodes dissolution phenomena have been reported where anodic pb dissolution and film formation complex processes were taking place in alkaline wastewaters rehim and mohamed 1998 rehim et al 1997 van hege et al 2004 yang et al 2016 a brown reddish colour was observed in the anolyte after the batch and during the continuous sulfide oxidation test fig s6 that can be associated with dissolved pbo2 in the alkaline electrolyte vatistas and cristofaro 2000 it is important to note that the mechanisms through which the pbox electrode participates to sulfide removal can bring a negative rather than positive environmental effect on the industrial sulfide containing wastewater streams the results of sem edx and xrf of the pt irox electrode showed no remaining catalyst layer which is in good agreement with the fast and large increase in the anode potential at the end of the stability tests the sem edx combined with the xrf results can be associated with the potential changes during the stability tests the full catalyst loss for the pt irox electrode corresponds to the decrease of the catalytic activity at high current density increase of the anode potential of 3 v in 14 h at 200 a m 2 fig s8 on the contrary the most stable electrode ir mmo preserved intact catalytic coating during the stability tests 3 3 3 implications and future perspectives one of the implications of this study is the unknown oxidation mechanisms that are governing the sulfide oxidation steps on the electrode surface in table s1 the oxygen evolution onset potential oep and the sulfide oxidation onset potential sop are given it can be assumed that indirect sulfide oxidation via o2 evolution will be favoured for the electrodes with low oep which was the case for the mmo electrodes ir mmo pt irox and tio2 irtao2 oep 0 80 0 77 0 75 v vs she respectively the oep differences dictated by the morphological differences and the catalyst composition will result in different operational sulfide oxidation performances in contrary the electrodes with high oep such as pt and pbox in our study 1 01 and 1 06 v vs she respectively will mainly undergo direct sulfide oxidation this is supported by the high cehs achieved by the pt and pbox electrodes 58 9 and 64 7 respectively and the lower of the mmo electrodes the ru mmo constitutes an exception which although presenting a low oep 0 75 v vs she achieved a high cehs of 63 2 this indicates that the oep cannot be considered as sole indicator of the oxidation mechanisms at different electrodes and both oep and sop in combination with mechanistic studies are needed to determine the oxidation mechanisms at different electrodes further research is needed to establish the impact of phenomena such as the oscillations produced by sulfide oxidation and provide a quantitative assessment of how they affect the products of the oxidation and also the electrode lifetime monitoring of metal leaching should be considered in further studies in order to establish corrosion rates e g amount of catalyst leaching per surface per time with respect to the specific catalytic materials and current densities applied the 8 catalyst loading loss of the ru mmo electrode in these 305 h of continuous operation raises concerns about its performance on future long term applications considering the high price of this catalyst on the contrary the five times higher price of the more stable ir mmo suggests that a determination of a good balance between activity and stability of the electrode materials will be key for a future scale up of the system longer term field studies of the electrode performance operated with real scs are needed to quantify the electrode lifetime further work should be implemented to compare the sulfide removal efficiencies lifetime and price of the different electrodes to assess practical application of electrochemical sulfide treatment with the ir mmo and ru mmo electrodes 4 conclusions we investigated the impact of the catalyst choice on the activity of the ir mmo ru mmo pt irox pt pbox and tio2 irtao2 electrodes towards sulfide oxidation and on their stability under operation at high sulfidic i e 50 mm sulfide and highly alkaline conditions i e ph 12 the key findings of this work are the ru mmo was an active material towards sulfide oxidation with a ce of 63 2 0 5 and an average anode potential of 0 92 v 0 17 v vs she for a constant current density of 50 a m 2 among all materials the most stable electrode for sulfide oxidation was ir mmo with no catalyst loss observed and only a small increase in potential 0 5 v during the 305 h of continuous operation the tio2 irtao2 electrode was not a suitable material towards sulfide oxidation as it was unable to operate at the low anodic potential that is desired for direct sulfide oxidation the instability of pt irox with an increase of 3 v and total loss of the catalytic coating made this material not applicable for sulfide oxidation in the experimental conditions of this study acknowledgements kr is supported by the sbo groundbreaking extraction technology for critical metals and metalloids from

applied to predict the occurrence of massive cyanobacteria proliferations in the present study this tool was further used to explore the factors responsible for maintaining picocyanobacterial dominance aiming to increase the understanding of factors that promote dominance of picocyanobacteria in tropical reservoirs we chose two reservoirs used for water supplies located in different regions of brazil and subjected to climate changes such as warmer winters that intensify water column stratification and prolonged dry seasons that cause water level decreases this study focused on the diagnosis of the relationships among picocyanobacteria 1 2 μm zooplankton and environmental variables using evolutionary computation the integrated data analysis performed here was very successful in elucidating the dynamics of picocyanobacterial density variation influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors by the modeling approach relative water column stability rwcs and electrical conductivity were highlighted as the most important environmental drivers for picocyanobacterial peaks hybrid evolutionary analysis hea models for the two reservoirs indicated for the first time in the literature that rotifers small sized cladocerans and copepods mainly nauplii can directly or indirectly control picocyanobacteria in tropical mesotrophic reservoirs depending on rwcs conditions and electrical conductivity however this control is modulated by ph water transparency and water temperature thresholds graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacteria hybrid evolutionary analysis hydroelectric reservoir rwcs 1 introduction major global concerns about climate changes are the increase of air and water temperatures and the hydrological alterations due to changes in rainfall seasonality or availability marengo et al 2013 nobre et al 2016 in some countries these have become major concerns due to either their continental dimension or their diversity of aquatic ecosystems brazil is noteworthy in that it is the largest tropical country in the world and has a rich network of river basins that support more than sixty percent of domestic electricity demand by power generation in hydroelectric reservoirs aneel 2017 ubiquitous throughout the country and constructed for such multiple uses as power generation agriculture industry and domestic water supply brazilian reservoirs have been widely studied in the last decades especially regarding the biodiversity of aquatic communities eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms silva et al 2014 soares et al 2013 a current challenge has been the prediction of the consequences of ongoing climate change on these systems paerl and paul 2012 climate related hydrological alterations and the increase of water temperature in brazilian reservoirs has led to the expansion of the distribution of cyanobacteria brasil et al 2015 cyanobacteria can dominate most tropical lakes due to their low requirements and high adaptability in addition to increased water temperature reynolds 2006 yan et al 2017 factors such as high nutrient concentrations high intensity of underwater light and water column stability usually trigger cyanobacteria dominance low predation pressure by zooplankton buoyancy capacity due to favorable conditions in the water column and their potential to produce toxins are additional factors that allow cyanobacteria dominance anabaena spp microcystis spp and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii have been the most frequently observed cyanobacteria in brazilian reservoirs the latter being an invasive species that has thrived in these environments gomes et al 2013 these microorganisms pose risks to human health because the mechanisms that produce cyanotoxins are not yet very well understood elucidating the triggering factors of cyanobacterial blooms is mandatory for the prevention and control of safe water supplies whereas cyanobacteria forming blooms are well known from an ecological and taxonomic point of view the main components of the so called picocyanobacteria are often neglected in tropical freshwater the dominance of planktonic picocyanobacteria has been recorded in tropical and subtropical lakes and reservoirs in africa australia and south america baraúna et al 2013 silva et al 2014 stenuite et al 2009 colonial and single cell picocyanobacteria are ubiquitous in lakes of different trophic states but their ecology and dynamics as well as conditions favoring their occurrence are not yet clear callieri et al 2012 however the number of reports concerning the presence of picocyanobacteria in waters of different trophic status and parallel information on their toxicity has increased bláha and marsálek 1999 furtado et al 2009 jakubowska and szeląg wasielewska 2015 śliwińska wilczewska et al 2018 picocyanobacteria are also known to synthesize geosmin journey et al 2013 a secondary metabolite that can cause problems of taste and odor that especially impair drinking water modeling approaches are recognized as essential tools for a comprehensive integrated management of water quality and cyanobacterial blooms in reservoirs recknagel et al 2018 evolutionary computational methods have adopted algorithms based on principles of biological evolution by natural selection genetic variation and survival of the fittest evolutionary algorithms as an adaptive method for finding problem solutions models for complex economic and engineering problems evolutionary computation has been used in ecology and zoology to solve high complexity problems bäck et al 1997 recknagel 2008 boone 2017 the development of these models has been included in reservoir water quality research in several countries such as south korea japan south africa israel china the netherlands germany and brazil cao et al 2016 chan et al 2007 kim et al 2007 li et al 2015a b recknagel et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 2015 among these studies models that aim to predict and elucidate the blooms and the spread of cyanobacteria have been considered a priority for research in hydroelectric reservoirs that are also sources of drinking water although evolutionary computation has been applied to predict the occurrence of massive cyanobacteria proliferations in the present study this tool was used to explore the factors responsible for picocyanobacterial persistence in a more accurate way with this approach we hope to unveil the main drivers of the dynamics of picocyanobacteria in addition to those factors previously investigated by recknagel et al 2015 by hybrid evolutionary algorithm nutrient enrichment and temperature we included zooplankton in the modeling in this study considered as indicators of ecological conditions branco et al 2002 zooplankton exert important top down control on phytoplankton in temperate and subtropical environments and some are known to graze on picocyanobacteria callieri and stockner 2002 callieri et al 2004 2012 horn and horn 2008 however the role of zooplankton predation pressure on picocyanobacteria is largely unknown in tropical environments and they have seldom been included in evolutionary computation from these systems aiming to understand the factors that promote picocyanobacterial dominance in tropical reservoirs we chose two reservoirs used for water supply located in different regions of brazil and subjected to climate changes we focused on the relationships among colonial and single cell picocyanobacteria zooplankton and environmental variables using evolutionary computation we considered picocyanobacteria genera with cell sizes between 1 and 2 μm see methods section because it has been recognized that the prediction of outcomes at the phytoplankton species level is difficult reynolds et al 2014 we considered picocyanobacteria altogether in this study picocyanobacteria have similar adaptations such as small surface to volume ratios which have advantages of lower costs for maintenance metabolism callieri and stockner 2000 rapid responses to nutrient addition in lakes schallemberg and burns 2001 and better competition for nutrients than larger autotrophs less affected by phosphorus limitation than other components of phytoplankton wehr 1989 in addition they have a greater competitive ability under low light levels callieri and stockner 2002 callieri et al 2012 stenuite et al 2009 two mesotrophic reservoirs that show picocyanobacterial dominance were studied to test the following hypotheses i picocyanobacterial abundance in tropical mesotrophic reservoirs in the two regions is explained by both autochthone drivers and seasonality ii picocyanobacterial dominance in tropical mesotrophic reservoirs is not subject to bottom up control by phosphorus and iii evolutionary computation identifies thresholds for picocyanobacterial increases in the reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area ribeirão das lajes reservoir fig 1 herein lajes reservoir was constructed in 1905 for energy production it is surrounded by protected area and exhibits various remnant of atlantic rain forest it is also currently used for domestic consumption for approximately 1 million people industrial supply beer industry sport fishing and fish cage culture descoberto reservoir was created in 1974 for domestic supply agriculture and cattle breeding are the most important activities within its drainage basin starling 2000 and it currently supplies 62 of the drinking water for the city of brasília approximately 1 9 million people lajes and descoberto reservoirs have been considered as mesotrophic and monomictic and the water used for domestic supply receives simple chlorination lajes or direct downward filtration descoberto prior to use although approximately one thousand kilometers apart the local climates of both reservoirs present two well defined periods the rainy season october to march and the dry season april to september the climate in the region of lajes reservoir is subtropical humid köppen cwa with rainfall between 1000 and 1700 mm per year table 1 seasonality is sharper in the region of descoberto reservoir which is a tropical savannah climate köppen aw with rainfall between 1100 and 1800 mm per year table 1 the expected effects of ongoing climate changes on the two reservoirs are also different while warmer winters might prevent total mixing in deeper parts of lajes reservoir branco et al 2009 which causes prolonged stratification over a period longer than one year and thus maintains an anoxic hypolimnion the threat in descoberto reservoir is related to prolonged dry seasons that cause a sharp decrease in water level menezes et al 2016 regarding the planktonic communities in terms of abundance picocyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community of both lajes recknagel et al 2015 and descoberto reservoirs caesb unpublished data with the common presence and almost constant high abundance of the genera synechocystis aphanocapsa aphanothece and cyanodictyon other larger sized cyanobacteria nano and micro were comprised mostly of filamentous and colonial forms such as planktolynbya pseudanabaena limnothrix and microcystis for the zooplankton community high richness of rotifers characterized the zooplankton community of the two reservoirs lopes et al 2017 starling 2000 with 50 of the samples having the presence of collotheca spp conochilus unicornis hexarthra mira keratella americana polyarthra vulgaris and ptygyra sp there was also a similarity between the composition of microcrustaceans with the constant presence of the cladocerans bosmina hagmani ceriodaphnia cornuta and c paradoxa the large daphnia gessneri and d laevis were found in both reservoirs but with a lower frequency of occurrence copepod composition was also similar and the most abundant cyclopoid species was thermocyclops decipiens whereas notodiaptomus cearensis was the most abundant among calanoids in both reservoirs naupliar forms dominated in terms of abundance among the microcrustaceans 2 2 sampling and sample analyses data were from a monitoring program performed in descoberto reservoir by the environmental sanitation company of the federal district caesb and from research projects supported by light energia s a in lajes reservoir data comprise 241 monthly samplings near the dam area of both systems taken from 2005 to 2014 water transparency was measured by the secchi disk sd extinction depth water temperature wt ph dissolved oxygen do turbidity turb and electrical conductivity ec were measured by multiparameter probes vertical profiles of wt were taken from the surface to the bottom the relative water column stability rwcs was calculated according to padisák et al 2003 as the ratio of the density difference of the innermost layer db to the most superficial ds of water and the density difference of the water between 4 c d4 and 5 c d5 using the formula rwcs db ds d4 d5 high differences between temperature at the bottom and the surface indicate stronger stratification unfiltered samples were taken to analyze total phosphorus tp by the ascorbic acid method apha 2005 phytoplankton and zooplankton samples were fixed with lugol s solution and formalin final concentration 4 respectively zooplankton was sampled with a plankton net of 68 μm mesh phytoplankton cyanobacteria algae populations were enumerated in random fields uehlinger 1964 using the sedimentation technique utermöhl 1958 in this paper we analyzed picoplankton colonies and picoplankton single cells from samples fixed in lugol using the same settling technique under an inverted microscope zeiss oberkoche axiovert 10 where the tiny synechococcus 0 8 1 5 2 0 μm and synechocystis cells 1 5 μm diameter were easily recognized zooplankton densities were enumerated in a sedgwick rafter counting chamber and at least 200 individuals were counted in each of five sequential subsamples 2 3 modeling analysis hybrid evolutionary algorithm hea the modeling approach was conducted using the hybrid evolutionary algorithm hea cao et al 2006 2014 2016 which was designed for inductive reasoning of fit test if then else models from multidimensional data patterns in a spiral like boot strap scheme recknagel et al 2014a when hea is applied to complex ecological parameters it generates a logical formula represented by if then else rule models where if conditions reveal thresholds that indicate outbreaks of population densities recknagel et al 2014b then conditions show which variables are more sensitive to the output and develop less and else conditions indicate the most sensitive variable for the increase of population density in the output considering outputs the amount of single cells or colonies the output for both reservoirs was picocyanobacteria composed of the genera aphanocapsa aphanothece epigloeosphaera and merismopedia for descoberto and by the same genera plus coelosphaerium gomphosphaeria cyanogranis cyanodictyon merismopedia and synechococcus for lajes reservoir input variables were rainfall water temperature wt secchi depth sd electrical conductivity ec total phosphorus tp ph relative water column stability rwcs copepods cladocerans and rotifers considered mostly associated with picocyanobacterial densities 3 results 3 1 limnological features of the dam area in lajes and descoberto reservoirs despite similar oligo mesotrophic conditions both reservoirs presented differences in some of the limnological variables considered in the present study table 2 lajes reservoir showed higher average values of sd wt ec and tp whereas descoberto had higher maximum ec tp average values confirmed the reservoirs as mesotrophic despite presenting maximum values that indicated eutrophic conditions picocyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community in the two reservoirs in lajes reservoir this group corresponded on average to 64 of total phytoplankton density attaining mean density of 44 001 cells ml 1 table 2 the percentage was higher in descoberto reservoir 89 where they had lower average density 41 174 cels ml 1 other cyanobacteria othcyan comprise the second group in importance in both reservoirs rotifers dominated in numbers in both lajes and descoberto reservoirs with 51 and 82 of the total density respectively copepods mostly nauplii comprised on average 39 and 10 whereas cladocerans contributed on average 10 and 7 of the total zooplankton density in lajes and descoberto reservoirs respectively 3 2 modeling picocyanobacterial dynamics in the two reservoirs model equations model validation and model thresholds for picocyanobacteria in lajes and in descoberto reservoirs are illustrated in fig 2 the if then else yes or no model showed a good correspondence between measured and forecasted picocyanobacterial densities in lajes reservoir coefficient of determination r2 0 40 and descoberto reservoir r2 0 74 rwcs ec and the density of all zooplankton groups were key explanatory variables in the prediction of picocyanobacterial density variation in the two reservoirs as shown by the model followed up by if then else that included abiotic variables and zooplankton model thresholds for lajes showed that rwcs was the main driver for picocyanobacteria in this reservoir in the then branch if rwcs was lower than 249 5 namely a strong stability picocyanobacteria tended to increase if ph ec cladocerans and rotifers increased however in the else branch if rwcs was higher than 249 5 picocyanobacteria then mostly depended on abiotic variables ec ph and sd the model predicted well almost all annual density increases the validation model showed some peak mismatching mainly in intensity but model thresholds highlighted stratification as a key trigger to picocyanobacterial development in that environment the descoberto reservoir model suggested that rwcs or ec were associated with picocyanobacterial density and well predicted peaks from 2009 to 2011 rwcs was important for picocyanobacterial development although at a lower intensity than in lajes reservoir the then branch of the descoberto model comprised of ec 19 4 μs cm 1 or rwcs 20 8 showed that picocyanobacteria depended on sd and copepods in contrast in the else branch if ec 19 4 μs cm 1 or rwcs 20 8 picocyanobacterial density was related to sd wt ec and rotifers the sensitivity analysis of the best models developed by hea is shown in fig 3 in lajes reservoir picocyanobacteria decreased in the then branch when ph was low otherwise picocyanobacterial density increased when ec ranged from 25 29 to 34 85 μs cm 2 the importance of abiotic variables in the else branch was also revealed by the sensitivity analysis picocyanobacteria decreased when sd ranged from 2 to 5 m and ph from 5 45 to 7 95 whereas picocyanobacteria increased with increasing ec the sensitivity analysis for descoberto reservoir highlighted the importance of sd ranging from 0 1 to 2 71 m to the increase of picocyanobacteria in both branches picocyanobacteria decreased with rotifer increases in the else branch picocyanobacteria increased with rwcs values between 4 1 and 96 5 4 discussion 4 1 limnological features and the maintenance of picocyanobacteria dominance our study aimed to understand the thresholds for dominance of picocyanobacteria in two tropical reservoirs used for water supply in different regions of brazil and subjected to climate changes the results highlighted the importance of the water column conditions and zooplankton in explaining the persistent numerical dominance of picocyanobacteria throughout the years in lajes and descoberto reservoirs variables such as relative water column stability rwcs electrical conductivity and water temperature related to the physical condition of the water column had higher explanatory power than total phosphorus to predict picocyanobacterial dynamics in both reservoirs moreover picocyanobacterial dynamics were also related to herbivory by rotifers cladocerans and copepods at higher densities our results supported the first hypothesis since picocyanobacterial dynamics was mostly explained by seasonality influence on rwcs and by autochthone drivers due to different climatic and geographical features the physical dynamics of the water column in the dam area of the two reservoirs were not similar in lajes reservoir rwcs was completely dependent on water temperature which indicates an important influence of the weather conditions on maintaining thermal stratification and the consequent persistence of picocyanobacteria and other cyanobacteria the absence of wind influence on water column mixing in the dam area was already shown for lajes reservoir branco et al 2009 and can be explained by the protected location between mountains allied to the high water retention time this feature helps to explain long lasting stratification of approximately nine months which surely favors picocyanobacteria since they are usually more abundant during peak thermal stratification and nutrient depletion in mid summer padisák 1997 horn and horn 2008 and outcompete other phytoplankton differently from lajes rwcs was not related to water temperature in descoberto reservoir which points out the existence of other forces that act on water column mixing in this system the completely level landscape that favors wind action see in lors et al 2014 a shallower water column 20 m in the dam area than at lajes reservoir 40 m and two bottom outlets at 9 and 16 m could favor total mixing independently of water temperature in addition there are six tributary creeks that enter the reservoir and cause high turbidity and a well oxygenated bottom moreover the withdrawal of water supply even in periods of drought causes approximately 6 7 m of annual variation of the water column 4 2 evolutionary computation and thresholds for the density increase of picocyanobacteria our modeling approach highlighted rwcs and electrical conductivity as key abiotic environmental drivers of picocyanobacterial dynamics in accordance with our third hypothesis in addition the modeling showed trophic relations between some zooplankton groups and picocyanobacteria in both reservoirs evolutionary computation learns inferential models from data recknagel et al 2014a and is able to identify thresholds for shifts in community composition that are otherwise difficult water temperature has been recognized as a dominant factor that influences the seasonal dynamics of picocyanobacteria in lakes malinsky rushansky et al 2002 as well as sensitivity to nutrient enrichment schallemberg and burns 2001 while our modeling approach with hea has not indicated a direct relationship between tp availability and picocyanobacteria in both reservoirs water temperature indirectly influenced the dynamics of picocyanobacteria since it clearly influenced rwcs although the effect was stronger at lajes reservoir water column stability has been pointed out as one of the factors that promote picocyanobacterial growth callieri et al 2012 stockner et al 2002 although few studies have quantified this effect li et al 2015a b in this study we showed that dissimilar rwcs threshold values were established for the two reservoirs 249 38 lajes reservoir and 20 78 descoberto reservoir different forces drive water column stability in the two reservoirs in lajes reservoir due to a permanent stratification that occurs most of the year favored by low wind influence and high retention time branco et al 2009 rwcs was stronger when the temperature difference between surface and bottom was intensified during summer however lower retention time and surface area a higher input from tributaries and possible mixing by wind are the main drivers that influence water column dynamics in descoberto reservoir where rwcs values were considerably lower water column stability was of utmost importance in the models in explaining picocyanobacterial density in both reservoirs although at lajes reservoir a comparatively stronger and persistent stratification favored their dominance at higher numbers throughout the year however we must stress that the relationship between picocyanobacteria and stratification involves other factors mainly related to features of the stratified water column such as turbidity conductivity ph and transparency according to the hea best performing model for lajes reservoir two situations were displayed for picocyanobacterial peaks that depended on rwcs intensity strong water column stability rwcs 249 most common in the middle of summer secchi disk thresholds electrical conductivity and ph predicted picocyanobacterial peaks sensitivity analysis revealed that picocyanobacterial density in this situation was negatively correlated with the secchi disk maximum rwcs in summer which correspond to high secchi disk extinction depths and high radiation intensity may have impaired picocyanobacterial peaks by photoinhibition irradiance is one of the major factors that control the growth and photosynthetic activity of picocyanobacteria callieri and stockner 2002 jasser and callieri 2017 most cyanobacteria prefer low light intensity and high irradiance has been shown to have negative effects on synechococcus strains jodłowska and sliwinska 2014 one of the most common taxa found in lajes reservoir the hea model further showed that picocyanobacterial growth during strong stability can be directly associated with electrical conductivity increases electrical conductivity can reflect the presence of several ionic species that can positively influence picocyanobacterial growth growth rates of marine picocyanobacteria can be limited by nh4 po4 3 fe or light callieri et al 2012 de wever et al 2008 demonstrated a high positive response of picocyanobacteria to fe addition in experiments on lake tanganyika phytoplankton unfortunately we cannot discriminate which ion or ions were positively related to picocyanobacterial increases during lower water column stability rwcs 249 in lajes reservoir common in most parts of the year thresholds of electrical conductivity ph and density of cladocerans and rotifers predicted picocyanobacterial peaks those last increases were negatively related to ph probably during winter column mixing and positively related to zooplankton these findings demonstrate the importance of modeling tools to elucidate the dynamics of cyanobacteria growth influenced by nonlinear relationships of abiotic and biotic factors recknagel et al 2008 2015 regarding zooplankton the negative interference of cyanobacteria on zooplankton populations has already been noticed by several studies regardless of whether the cyanobacteria were small or large fulton and paerl 1988 ger et al 2014 in addition due to their potential toxicity nutritional inadequacy and difficulty in handling and digestion cyanobacteria are usually a nonpreferential food ferrão filho and kozlowsky suzuki 2011 on the other hand cyanobacteria populations can diminish as zooplankton density increases studies indicate that some species of zooplankton are active consumers of larger or filamentous cyanobacteria e g kozlowsky suzuki et al 2003 and also of picocyanobacteria e g motwani and gorokhova 2013 controlling their density e g kozlowsky suzuki and bozelli 2002 and increasing their photosynthetic activity callieri and stockner 2002 callieri et al 2004 2012 the sensitivity analysis for lajes reservoir showed an inverse relation between rotifers and picocyanobacteria which suggests that those organisms may directly control picocyanobacterial populations rotifers as well as heterotrophic and mixotrophic nanoflagellates and small ciliates are recognized as important picocyanobacteria grazers callieri and stockner 2002 according to callieri et al 2012 rotifers in particular among zooplankton seemed to feed preferentially on picocyanobacteria a direct influence of daphnids daphnia gessneri ceriodaphnia spp on picocyanobacteria was expected in lajes reservoir since this group may exert a great impact on autotrophic picoplankton callieri and stockner 2002 horn and horn 2008 however a direct relation between cladocerans and picocyanobacteria was not detected despite their inclusion in the model this suggests either the existence of nonlinear relationships between picocyanobacteria and some of their grazers or that cladoceran grazing pressure on other algae such as diatoms and chlorophyceans favored picocyanobacteria despite similar mesotrophic conditions and plankton composition different models were produced for descoberto and lajes reservoirs nonetheless rwcs and electrical conductivity were the main variables from the best hea models to predict picocyanobacterial density in descoberto reservoir the thresholds for picocyanobacterial peaks were mostly related to secchi disk extinction and were in turn dependent on the two previous variables the riverine contribution mixing by winds and water outlets at two depths 9 and 16 m may explain the lower secchi disk value observed in this reservoir which seems to be an important factor for picocyanobacterial growth control in addition the low secchi disk value can be associated with the rainy season which transports solids of the tributaries from farming areas in the watershed and the consequent increase of turbidity despite uncertainties that could affect light penetration in the water column rigosi and rueda 2012 ecological models open new perspectives for several possible dynamics that may take place simultaneously in the water column such dynamics were for example revealed by hea for descoberto reservoir peaks of picocyanobacteria in this reservoir were dependent on sd and copepod densities when ec 19 4 μs cm 1 or rwcs 20 8 winter column mixing when ec 19 4 μs cm 1 or rwcs 20 8 rainy season with summer stratification the peaks would not only depend on sd and copepods but also on wt and rotifers naupliar forms accounted for most of the copepod density in descoberto reservoir and once more rotifer grazing pressure predicted picocyanobacterial dynamics as corroborated by sensitivity analysis the importance of microzooplankton namely rotifers and copepod nauplii for the planktonic food web dynamics was shown in our study stockner and shortreed 1989 previously related rotifers and nauplii to marked declines of algal picoplankton horn and horn 2008 studying reservoirs with different trophic conditions showed that autotrophic picoplankton dynamics during summer stratification is mainly top down controlled mainly by daphnids but also by rotifers and protozoans picocyanobacteria are being recognized as one of the major links to carbon flow especially in tropical oligotrophic waters stenuite et al 2009 in this study we registered their persistent numerical dominance throughout the years as verified in other tropical lakes which highlights their importance for plankton dynamics of two mesotrophic reservoirs our modeling approach emerges as a useful method to improve the explanation prediction and understanding of picocyanobacterial peaks as discussed by recknagel et al 2017 our results corroborated the hypothesis that evolutionary computation identifies thresholds for density peaks of dominant picocyanobacteria evolutionary computation performed well for a single output variable driven by multiple or single predictor variables the next step will be to enable hea to predict multiple output variables by improving the multiobjective parameter optimization by differential evolution that optimization will add a new dimension to the forecasting capacity for hea by for example considering competition for nutrients and light among cyanobacterial species 4 3 climatic change and picocyanobacterial dominance in mesotrophic reservoirs two simultaneous extreme climatic events have been affecting tropical south america during recent years severe droughts in some regions and intense rainfall and floods in others marengo et al 2013 as has been recently shown those opposite extreme events can affect the two reservoirs of the present study in 2015 a sharp drawdown in reservoirs from southeast brazil where lajes reservoir is located led to water supply scarcity and rationing nobre et al 2016 high air temperatures and low rainfall caused this situation in the previous year in 2017 the central plateau region in brazil where descoberto reservoir is located experienced the most prolonged dry season in fifty seven years with serious consequences for domestic water supply including water rationing in brasília city until the beginning of 2018 according to menezes et al 2016 the city has suffered from heatwaves in recent years that have contributed to the decrease in relative humidity intensified forest fires and caused agricultural emergencies and a lack of water for domestic supply our results suggest that long lasting stratification influenced by high air temperatures favors the persistence of picocyanobacteria in the lajes reservoir water column the prevalence of picocyanobacteria in a warmer nutrient depleted and strongly stratified surface layer has been previously suggested callieri and stockner 2002 stockner et al 2002 callieri 2017 in addition branco et al 2009 discussed the tendency of warmer winters in preventing total mixing in lajes reservoir lack of mixing means further phosphorus depletion for other algae which also favor picocyanobacteria two alternative scenarios can be suggested for descoberto reservoir subject to climate driven drawdowns the first could be a lower water level associated with less rainfall meaning a lower total phosphorus input which would negatively influence other algae that benefit picocyanobacteria alternatively a lower water level can also be associated with less dilution of incoming nutrients from agricultural areas causing a rise in total phosphorus this effect could shift the dominance to other algae or even larger sized cyanobacteria as has been anticipated for other aquatic ecosystems elliott 2012 the role of picocyanobacteria in aquatic ecosystems is expected to become more relevant as a result of global changes flombaum et al 2013 śliwińska wilczewska et al 2018 because they attain maximum growth rates at higher temperature than other cyanobacteria and endure conditions predicted for climate change callieri and stockner 2002 paerl and huisman 2009 further studies on aquatic environments that are used directly for domestic supply such as lajes and descoberto reservoirs which have persistent dominance of picocyanobacteria are mandatory especially since many species of this group can potentially produce harmful toxic metabolites including allelopathic substances and microcystins domingos et al 1999 jasser and callieri 2017 the occurrence of those compounds is increasing in aquatic ecosystems śliwińska wilczewska et al 2018 which threatens both water and food consumption as toxic compounds enter aquatic food webs via zooplankton that reach higher trophic levels 5 conclusions the data analysis by hea modeling performed here was very successful in elucidating picocyanobacterial dynamics influenced by abiotic and biotic factors rwcs and electrical conductivity were key environmental drivers of picocyanobacterial peaks the hea models highlighted for the first time in the literature that rotifers small sized cladocerans and copepods mainly nauplii can directly or indirectly control picocyanobacteria in tropical mesotrophic reservoirs this was however dependent on rwcs and electrical conductivity and modulated by thresholds of ph secchi disk extinction and water temperature acknowledgments the authors would like to thank

applied to predict the occurrence of massive cyanobacteria proliferations in the present study this tool was further used to explore the factors responsible for maintaining picocyanobacterial dominance aiming to increase the understanding of factors that promote dominance of picocyanobacteria in tropical reservoirs we chose two reservoirs used for water supplies located in different regions of brazil and subjected to climate changes such as warmer winters that intensify water column stratification and prolonged dry seasons that cause water level decreases this study focused on the diagnosis of the relationships among picocyanobacteria 1 2 μm zooplankton and environmental variables using evolutionary computation the integrated data analysis performed here was very successful in elucidating the dynamics of picocyanobacterial density variation influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors by the modeling approach relative water column stability rwcs and electrical conductivity were highlighted as the most important environmental drivers for picocyanobacterial peaks hybrid evolutionary analysis hea models for the two reservoirs indicated for the first time in the literature that rotifers small sized cladocerans and copepods mainly nauplii can directly or indirectly control picocyanobacteria in tropical mesotrophic reservoirs depending on rwcs conditions and electrical conductivity however this control is modulated by ph water transparency and water temperature thresholds graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacteria hybrid evolutionary analysis hydroelectric reservoir rwcs 1 introduction major global concerns about climate changes are the increase of air and water temperatures and the hydrological alterations due to changes in rainfall seasonality or availability marengo et al 2013 nobre et al 2016 in some countries these have become major concerns due to either their continental dimension or their diversity of aquatic ecosystems brazil is noteworthy in that it is the largest tropical country in the world and has a rich network of river basins that support more than sixty percent of domestic electricity demand by power generation in hydroelectric reservoirs aneel 2017 ubiquitous throughout the country and constructed for such multiple uses as power generation agriculture industry and domestic water supply brazilian reservoirs have been widely studied in the last decades especially regarding the biodiversity of aquatic communities eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms silva et al 2014 soares et al 2013 a current challenge has been the prediction of the consequences of ongoing climate change on these systems paerl and paul 2012 climate related hydrological alterations and the increase of water temperature in brazilian reservoirs has led to the expansion of the distribution of cyanobacteria brasil et al 2015 cyanobacteria can dominate most tropical lakes due to their low requirements and high adaptability in addition to increased water temperature reynolds 2006 yan et al 2017 factors such as high nutrient concentrations high intensity of underwater light and water column stability usually trigger cyanobacteria dominance low predation pressure by zooplankton buoyancy capacity due to favorable conditions in the water column and their potential to produce toxins are additional factors that allow cyanobacteria dominance anabaena spp microcystis spp and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii have been the most frequently observed cyanobacteria in brazilian reservoirs the latter being an invasive species that has thrived in these environments gomes et al 2013 these microorganisms pose risks to human health because the mechanisms that produce cyanotoxins are not yet very well understood elucidating the triggering factors of cyanobacterial blooms is mandatory for the prevention and control of safe water supplies whereas cyanobacteria forming blooms are well known from an ecological and taxonomic point of view the main components of the so called picocyanobacteria are often neglected in tropical freshwater the dominance of planktonic picocyanobacteria has been recorded in tropical and subtropical lakes and reservoirs in africa australia and south america baraúna et al 2013 silva et al 2014 stenuite et al 2009 colonial and single cell picocyanobacteria are ubiquitous in lakes of different trophic states but their ecology and dynamics as well as conditions favoring their occurrence are not yet clear callieri et al 2012 however the number of reports concerning the presence of picocyanobacteria in waters of different trophic status and parallel information on their toxicity has increased bláha and marsálek 1999 furtado et al 2009 jakubowska and szeląg wasielewska 2015 śliwińska wilczewska et al 2018 picocyanobacteria are also known to synthesize geosmin journey et al 2013 a secondary metabolite that can cause problems of taste and odor that especially impair drinking water modeling approaches are recognized as essential tools for a comprehensive integrated management of water quality and cyanobacterial blooms in reservoirs recknagel et al 2018 evolutionary computational methods have adopted algorithms based on principles of biological evolution by natural selection genetic variation and survival of the fittest evolutionary algorithms as an adaptive method for finding problem solutions models for complex economic and engineering problems evolutionary computation has been used in ecology and zoology to solve high complexity problems bäck et al 1997 recknagel 2008 boone 2017 the development of these models has been included in reservoir water quality research in several countries such as south korea japan south africa israel china the netherlands germany and brazil cao et al 2016 chan et al 2007 kim et al 2007 li et al 2015a b recknagel et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 2015 among these studies models that aim to predict and elucidate the blooms and the spread of cyanobacteria have been considered a priority for research in hydroelectric reservoirs that are also sources of drinking water although evolutionary computation has been applied to predict the occurrence of massive cyanobacteria proliferations in the present study this tool was used to explore the factors responsible for picocyanobacterial persistence in a more accurate way with this approach we hope to unveil the main drivers of the dynamics of picocyanobacteria in addition to those factors previously investigated by recknagel et al 2015 by hybrid evolutionary algorithm nutrient enrichment and temperature we included zooplankton in the modeling in this study considered as indicators of ecological conditions branco et al 2002 zooplankton exert important top down control on phytoplankton in temperate and subtropical environments and some are known to graze on picocyanobacteria callieri and stockner 2002 callieri et al 2004 2012 horn and horn 2008 however the role of zooplankton predation pressure on picocyanobacteria is largely unknown in tropical environments and they have seldom been included in evolutionary computation from these systems aiming to understand the factors that promote picocyanobacterial dominance in tropical reservoirs we chose two reservoirs used for water supply located in different regions of brazil and subjected to climate changes we focused on the relationships among colonial and single cell picocyanobacteria zooplankton and environmental variables using evolutionary computation we considered picocyanobacteria genera with cell sizes between 1 and 2 μm see methods section because it has been recognized that the prediction of outcomes at the phytoplankton species level is difficult reynolds et al 2014 we considered picocyanobacteria altogether in this study picocyanobacteria have similar adaptations such as small surface to volume ratios which have advantages of lower costs for maintenance metabolism callieri and stockner 2000 rapid responses to nutrient addition in lakes schallemberg and burns 2001 and better competition for nutrients than larger autotrophs less affected by phosphorus limitation than other components of phytoplankton wehr 1989 in addition they have a greater competitive ability under low light levels callieri and stockner 2002 callieri et al 2012 stenuite et al 2009 two mesotrophic reservoirs that show picocyanobacterial dominance were studied to test the following hypotheses i picocyanobacterial abundance in tropical mesotrophic reservoirs in the two regions is explained by both autochthone drivers and seasonality ii picocyanobacterial dominance in tropical mesotrophic reservoirs is not subject to bottom up control by phosphorus and iii evolutionary computation identifies thresholds for picocyanobacterial increases in the reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area ribeirão das lajes reservoir fig 1 herein lajes reservoir was constructed in 1905 for energy production it is surrounded by protected area and exhibits various remnant of atlantic rain forest it is also currently used for domestic consumption for approximately 1 million people industrial supply beer industry sport fishing and fish cage culture descoberto reservoir was created in 1974 for domestic supply agriculture and cattle breeding are the most important activities within its drainage basin starling 2000 and it currently supplies 62 of the drinking water for the city of brasília approximately 1 9 million people lajes and descoberto reservoirs have been considered as mesotrophic and monomictic and the water used for domestic supply receives simple chlorination lajes or direct downward filtration descoberto prior to use although approximately one thousand kilometers apart the local climates of both reservoirs present two well defined periods the rainy season october to march and the dry season april to september the climate in the region of lajes reservoir is subtropical humid köppen cwa with rainfall between 1000 and 1700 mm per year table 1 seasonality is sharper in the region of descoberto reservoir which is a tropical savannah climate köppen aw with rainfall between 1100 and 1800 mm per year table 1 the expected effects of ongoing climate changes on the two reservoirs are also different while warmer winters might prevent total mixing in deeper parts of lajes reservoir branco et al 2009 which causes prolonged stratification over a period longer than one year and thus maintains an anoxic hypolimnion the threat in descoberto reservoir is related to prolonged dry seasons that cause a sharp decrease in water level menezes et al 2016 regarding the planktonic communities in terms of abundance picocyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community of both lajes recknagel et al 2015 and descoberto reservoirs caesb unpublished data with the common presence and almost constant high abundance of the genera synechocystis aphanocapsa aphanothece and cyanodictyon other larger sized cyanobacteria nano and micro were comprised mostly of filamentous and colonial forms such as planktolynbya pseudanabaena limnothrix and microcystis for the zooplankton community high richness of rotifers characterized the zooplankton community of the two reservoirs lopes et al 2017 starling 2000 with 50 of the samples having the presence of collotheca spp conochilus unicornis hexarthra mira keratella americana polyarthra vulgaris and ptygyra sp there was also a similarity between the composition of microcrustaceans with the constant presence of the cladocerans bosmina hagmani ceriodaphnia cornuta and c paradoxa the large daphnia gessneri and d laevis were found in both reservoirs but with a lower frequency of occurrence copepod composition was also similar and the most abundant cyclopoid species was thermocyclops decipiens whereas notodiaptomus cearensis was the most abundant among calanoids in both reservoirs naupliar forms dominated in terms of abundance among the microcrustaceans 2 2 sampling and sample analyses data were from a monitoring program performed in descoberto reservoir by the environmental sanitation company of the federal district caesb and from research projects supported by light energia s a in lajes reservoir data comprise 241 monthly samplings near the dam area of both systems taken from 2005 to 2014 water transparency was measured by the secchi disk sd extinction depth water temperature wt ph dissolved oxygen do turbidity turb and electrical conductivity ec were measured by multiparameter probes vertical profiles of wt were taken from the surface to the bottom the relative water column stability rwcs was calculated according to padisák et al 2003 as the ratio of the density difference of the innermost layer db to the most superficial ds of water and the density difference of the water between 4 c d4 and 5 c d5 using the formula rwcs db ds d4 d5 high differences between temperature at the bottom and the surface indicate stronger stratification unfiltered samples were taken to analyze total phosphorus tp by the ascorbic acid method apha 2005 phytoplankton and zooplankton samples were fixed with lugol s solution and formalin final concentration 4 respectively zooplankton was sampled with a plankton net of 68 μm mesh phytoplankton cyanobacteria algae populations were enumerated in random fields uehlinger 1964 using the sedimentation technique utermöhl 1958 in this paper we analyzed picoplankton colonies and picoplankton single cells from samples fixed in lugol using the same settling technique under an inverted microscope zeiss oberkoche axiovert 10 where the tiny synechococcus 0 8 1 5 2 0 μm and synechocystis cells 1 5 μm diameter were easily recognized zooplankton densities were enumerated in a sedgwick rafter counting chamber and at least 200 individuals were counted in each of five sequential subsamples 2 3 modeling analysis hybrid evolutionary algorithm hea the modeling approach was conducted using the hybrid evolutionary algorithm hea cao et al 2006 2014 2016 which was designed for inductive reasoning of fit test if then else models from multidimensional data patterns in a spiral like boot strap scheme recknagel et al 2014a when hea is applied to complex ecological parameters it generates a logical formula represented by if then else rule models where if conditions reveal thresholds that indicate outbreaks of population densities recknagel et al 2014b then conditions show which variables are more sensitive to the output and develop less and else conditions indicate the most sensitive variable for the increase of population density in the output considering outputs the amount of single cells or colonies the output for both reservoirs was picocyanobacteria composed of the genera aphanocapsa aphanothece epigloeosphaera and merismopedia for descoberto and by the same genera plus coelosphaerium gomphosphaeria cyanogranis cyanodictyon merismopedia and synechococcus for lajes reservoir input variables were rainfall water temperature wt secchi depth sd electrical conductivity ec total phosphorus tp ph relative water column stability rwcs copepods cladocerans and rotifers considered mostly associated with picocyanobacterial densities 3 results 3 1 limnological features of the dam area in lajes and descoberto reservoirs despite similar oligo mesotrophic conditions both reservoirs presented differences in some of the limnological variables considered in the present study table 2 lajes reservoir showed higher average values of sd wt ec and tp whereas descoberto had higher maximum ec tp average values confirmed the reservoirs as mesotrophic despite presenting maximum values that indicated eutrophic conditions picocyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community in the two reservoirs in lajes reservoir this group corresponded on average to 64 of total phytoplankton density attaining mean density of 44 001 cells ml 1 table 2 the percentage was higher in descoberto reservoir 89 where they had lower average density 41 174 cels ml 1 other cyanobacteria othcyan comprise the second group in importance in both reservoirs rotifers dominated in numbers in both lajes and descoberto reservoirs with 51 and 82 of the total density respectively copepods mostly nauplii comprised on average 39 and 10 whereas cladocerans contributed on average 10 and 7 of the total zooplankton density in lajes and descoberto reservoirs respectively 3 2 modeling picocyanobacterial dynamics in the two reservoirs model equations model validation and model thresholds for picocyanobacteria in lajes and in descoberto reservoirs are illustrated in fig 2 the if then else yes or no model showed a good correspondence between measured and forecasted picocyanobacterial densities in lajes reservoir coefficient of determination r2 0 40 and descoberto reservoir r2 0 74 rwcs ec and the density of all zooplankton groups were key explanatory variables in the prediction of picocyanobacterial density variation in the two reservoirs as shown by the model followed up by if then else that included abiotic variables and zooplankton model thresholds for lajes showed that rwcs was the main driver for picocyanobacteria in this reservoir in the then branch if rwcs was lower than 249 5 namely a strong stability picocyanobacteria tended to increase if ph ec cladocerans and rotifers increased however in the else branch if rwcs was higher than 249 5 picocyanobacteria then mostly depended on abiotic variables ec ph and sd the model predicted well almost all annual density increases the validation model showed some peak mismatching mainly in intensity but model thresholds highlighted stratification as a key trigger to picocyanobacterial development in that environment the descoberto reservoir model suggested that rwcs or ec were associated with picocyanobacterial density and well predicted peaks from 2009 to 2011 rwcs was important for picocyanobacterial development although at a lower intensity than in lajes reservoir the then branch of the descoberto model comprised of ec 19 4 μs cm 1 or rwcs 20 8 showed that picocyanobacteria depended on sd and copepods in contrast in the else branch if ec 19 4 μs cm 1 or rwcs 20 8 picocyanobacterial density was related to sd wt ec and rotifers the sensitivity analysis of the best models developed by hea is shown in fig 3 in lajes reservoir picocyanobacteria decreased in the then branch when ph was low otherwise picocyanobacterial density increased when ec ranged from 25 29 to 34 85 μs cm 2 the importance of abiotic variables in the else branch was also revealed by the sensitivity analysis picocyanobacteria decreased when sd ranged from 2 to 5 m and ph from 5 45 to 7 95 whereas picocyanobacteria increased with increasing ec the sensitivity analysis for descoberto reservoir highlighted the importance of sd ranging from 0 1 to 2 71 m to the increase of picocyanobacteria in both branches picocyanobacteria decreased with rotifer increases in the else branch picocyanobacteria increased with rwcs values between 4 1 and 96 5 4 discussion 4 1 limnological features and the maintenance of picocyanobacteria dominance our study aimed to understand the thresholds for dominance of picocyanobacteria in two tropical reservoirs used for water supply in different regions of brazil and subjected to climate changes the results highlighted the importance of the water column conditions and zooplankton in explaining the persistent numerical dominance of picocyanobacteria throughout the years in lajes and descoberto reservoirs variables such as relative water column stability rwcs electrical conductivity and water temperature related to the physical condition of the water column had higher explanatory power than total phosphorus to predict picocyanobacterial dynamics in both reservoirs moreover picocyanobacterial dynamics were also related to herbivory by rotifers cladocerans and copepods at higher densities our results supported the first hypothesis since picocyanobacterial dynamics was mostly explained by seasonality influence on rwcs and by autochthone drivers due to different climatic and geographical features the physical dynamics of the water column in the dam area of the two reservoirs were not similar in lajes reservoir rwcs was completely dependent on water temperature which indicates an important influence of the weather conditions on maintaining thermal stratification and the consequent persistence of picocyanobacteria and other cyanobacteria the absence of wind influence on water column mixing in the dam area was already shown for lajes reservoir branco et al 2009 and can be explained by the protected location between mountains allied to the high water retention time this feature helps to explain long lasting stratification of approximately nine months which surely favors picocyanobacteria since they are usually more abundant during peak thermal stratification and nutrient depletion in mid summer padisák 1997 horn and horn 2008 and outcompete other phytoplankton differently from lajes rwcs was not related to water temperature in descoberto reservoir which points out the existence of other forces that act on water column mixing in this system the completely level landscape that favors wind action see in lors et al 2014 a shallower water column 20 m in the dam area than at lajes reservoir 40 m and two bottom outlets at 9 and 16 m could favor total mixing independently of water temperature in addition there are six tributary creeks that enter the reservoir and cause high turbidity and a well oxygenated bottom moreover the withdrawal of water supply even in periods of drought causes approximately 6 7 m of annual variation of the water column 4 2 evolutionary computation and thresholds for the density increase of picocyanobacteria our modeling approach highlighted rwcs and electrical conductivity as key abiotic environmental drivers of picocyanobacterial dynamics in accordance with our third hypothesis in addition the modeling showed trophic relations between some zooplankton groups and picocyanobacteria in both reservoirs evolutionary computation learns inferential models from data recknagel et al 2014a and is able to identify thresholds for shifts in community composition that are otherwise difficult water temperature has been recognized as a dominant factor that influences the seasonal dynamics of picocyanobacteria in lakes malinsky rushansky et al 2002 as well as sensitivity to nutrient enrichment schallemberg and burns 2001 while our modeling approach with hea has not indicated a direct relationship between tp availability and picocyanobacteria in both reservoirs water temperature indirectly influenced the dynamics of picocyanobacteria since it clearly influenced rwcs although the effect was stronger at lajes reservoir water column stability has been pointed out as one of the factors that promote picocyanobacterial growth callieri et al 2012 stockner et al 2002 although few studies have quantified this effect li et al 2015a b in this study we showed that dissimilar rwcs threshold values were established for the two reservoirs 249 38 lajes reservoir and 20 78 descoberto reservoir different forces drive water column stability in the two reservoirs in lajes reservoir due to a permanent stratification that occurs most of the year favored by low wind influence and high retention time branco et al 2009 rwcs was stronger when the temperature difference between surface and bottom was intensified during summer however lower retention time and surface area a higher input from tributaries and possible mixing by wind are the main drivers that influence water column dynamics in descoberto reservoir where rwcs values were considerably lower water column stability was of utmost importance in the models in explaining picocyanobacterial density in both reservoirs although at lajes reservoir a comparatively stronger and persistent stratification favored their dominance at higher numbers throughout the year however we must stress that the relationship between picocyanobacteria and stratification involves other factors mainly related to features of the stratified water column such as turbidity conductivity ph and transparency according to the hea best performing model for lajes reservoir two situations were displayed for picocyanobacterial peaks that depended on rwcs intensity strong water column stability rwcs 249 most common in the middle of summer secchi disk thresholds electrical conductivity and ph predicted picocyanobacterial peaks sensitivity analysis revealed that picocyanobacterial density in this situation was negatively correlated with the secchi disk maximum rwcs in summer which correspond to high secchi disk extinction depths and high radiation intensity may have impaired picocyanobacterial peaks by photoinhibition irradiance is one of the major factors that control the growth and photosynthetic activity of picocyanobacteria callieri and stockner 2002 jasser and callieri 2017 most cyanobacteria prefer low light intensity and high irradiance has been shown to have negative effects on synechococcus strains jodłowska and sliwinska 2014 one of the most common taxa found in lajes reservoir the hea model further showed that picocyanobacterial growth during strong stability can be directly associated with electrical conductivity increases electrical conductivity can reflect the presence of several ionic species that can positively influence picocyanobacterial growth growth rates of marine picocyanobacteria can be limited by nh4 po4 3 fe or light callieri et al 2012 de wever et al 2008 demonstrated a high positive response of picocyanobacteria to fe addition in experiments on lake tanganyika phytoplankton unfortunately we cannot discriminate which ion or ions were positively related to picocyanobacterial increases during lower water column stability rwcs 249 in lajes reservoir common in most parts of the year thresholds of electrical conductivity ph and density of cladocerans and rotifers predicted picocyanobacterial peaks those last increases were negatively related to ph probably during winter column mixing and positively related to zooplankton these findings demonstrate the importance of modeling tools to elucidate the dynamics of cyanobacteria growth influenced by nonlinear relationships of abiotic and biotic factors recknagel et al 2008 2015 regarding zooplankton the negative interference of cyanobacteria on zooplankton populations has already been noticed by several studies regardless of whether the cyanobacteria were small or large fulton and paerl 1988 ger et al 2014 in addition due to their potential toxicity nutritional inadequacy and difficulty in handling and digestion cyanobacteria are usually a nonpreferential food ferrão filho and kozlowsky suzuki 2011 on the other hand cyanobacteria populations can diminish as zooplankton density increases studies indicate that some species of zooplankton are active consumers of larger or filamentous cyanobacteria e g kozlowsky suzuki et al 2003 and also of picocyanobacteria e g motwani and gorokhova 2013 controlling their density e g kozlowsky suzuki and bozelli 2002 and increasing their photosynthetic activity callieri and stockner 2002 callieri et al 2004 2012 the sensitivity analysis for lajes reservoir showed an inverse relation between rotifers and picocyanobacteria which suggests that those organisms may directly control picocyanobacterial populations rotifers as well as heterotrophic and mixotrophic nanoflagellates and small ciliates are recognized as important picocyanobacteria grazers callieri and stockner 2002 according to callieri et al 2012 rotifers in particular among zooplankton seemed to feed preferentially on picocyanobacteria a direct influence of daphnids daphnia gessneri ceriodaphnia spp on picocyanobacteria was expected in lajes reservoir since this group may exert a great impact on autotrophic picoplankton callieri and stockner 2002 horn and horn 2008 however a direct relation between cladocerans and picocyanobacteria was not detected despite their inclusion in the model this suggests either the existence of nonlinear relationships between picocyanobacteria and some of their grazers or that cladoceran grazing pressure on other algae such as diatoms and chlorophyceans favored picocyanobacteria despite similar mesotrophic conditions and plankton composition different models were produced for descoberto and lajes reservoirs nonetheless rwcs and electrical conductivity were the main variables from the best hea models to predict picocyanobacterial density in descoberto reservoir the thresholds for picocyanobacterial peaks were mostly related to secchi disk extinction and were in turn dependent on the two previous variables the riverine contribution mixing by winds and water outlets at two depths 9 and 16 m may explain the lower secchi disk value observed in this reservoir which seems to be an important factor for picocyanobacterial growth control in addition the low secchi disk value can be associated with the rainy season which transports solids of the tributaries from farming areas in the watershed and the consequent increase of turbidity despite uncertainties that could affect light penetration in the water column rigosi and rueda 2012 ecological models open new perspectives for several possible dynamics that may take place simultaneously in the water column such dynamics were for example revealed by hea for descoberto reservoir peaks of picocyanobacteria in this reservoir were dependent on sd and copepod densities when ec 19 4 μs cm 1 or rwcs 20 8 winter column mixing when ec 19 4 μs cm 1 or rwcs 20 8 rainy season with summer stratification the peaks would not only depend on sd and copepods but also on wt and rotifers naupliar forms accounted for most of the copepod density in descoberto reservoir and once more rotifer grazing pressure predicted picocyanobacterial dynamics as corroborated by sensitivity analysis the importance of microzooplankton namely rotifers and copepod nauplii for the planktonic food web dynamics was shown in our study stockner and shortreed 1989 previously related rotifers and nauplii to marked declines of algal picoplankton horn and horn 2008 studying reservoirs with different trophic conditions showed that autotrophic picoplankton dynamics during summer stratification is mainly top down controlled mainly by daphnids but also by rotifers and protozoans picocyanobacteria are being recognized as one of the major links to carbon flow especially in tropical oligotrophic waters stenuite et al 2009 in this study we registered their persistent numerical dominance throughout the years as verified in other tropical lakes which highlights their importance for plankton dynamics of two mesotrophic reservoirs our modeling approach emerges as a useful method to improve the explanation prediction and understanding of picocyanobacterial peaks as discussed by recknagel et al 2017 our results corroborated the hypothesis that evolutionary computation identifies thresholds for density peaks of dominant picocyanobacteria evolutionary computation performed well for a single output variable driven by multiple or single predictor variables the next step will be to enable hea to predict multiple output variables by improving the multiobjective parameter optimization by differential evolution that optimization will add a new dimension to the forecasting capacity for hea by for example considering competition for nutrients and light among cyanobacterial species 4 3 climatic change and picocyanobacterial dominance in mesotrophic reservoirs two simultaneous extreme climatic events have been affecting tropical south america during recent years severe droughts in some regions and intense rainfall and floods in others marengo et al 2013 as has been recently shown those opposite extreme events can affect the two reservoirs of the present study in 2015 a sharp drawdown in reservoirs from southeast brazil where lajes reservoir is located led to water supply scarcity and rationing nobre et al 2016 high air temperatures and low rainfall caused this situation in the previous year in 2017 the central plateau region in brazil where descoberto reservoir is located experienced the most prolonged dry season in fifty seven years with serious consequences for domestic water supply including water rationing in brasília city until the beginning of 2018 according to menezes et al 2016 the city has suffered from heatwaves in recent years that have contributed to the decrease in relative humidity intensified forest fires and caused agricultural emergencies and a lack of water for domestic supply our results suggest that long lasting stratification influenced by high air temperatures favors the persistence of picocyanobacteria in the lajes reservoir water column the prevalence of picocyanobacteria in a warmer nutrient depleted and strongly stratified surface layer has been previously suggested callieri and stockner 2002 stockner et al 2002 callieri 2017 in addition branco et al 2009 discussed the tendency of warmer winters in preventing total mixing in lajes reservoir lack of mixing means further phosphorus depletion for other algae which also favor picocyanobacteria two alternative scenarios can be suggested for descoberto reservoir subject to climate driven drawdowns the first could be a lower water level associated with less rainfall meaning a lower total phosphorus input which would negatively influence other algae that benefit picocyanobacteria alternatively a lower water level can also be associated with less dilution of incoming nutrients from agricultural areas causing a rise in total phosphorus this effect could shift the dominance to other algae or even larger sized cyanobacteria as has been anticipated for other aquatic ecosystems elliott 2012 the role of picocyanobacteria in aquatic ecosystems is expected to become more relevant as a result of global changes flombaum et al 2013 śliwińska wilczewska et al 2018 because they attain maximum growth rates at higher temperature than other cyanobacteria and endure conditions predicted for climate change callieri and stockner 2002 paerl and huisman 2009 further studies on aquatic environments that are used directly for domestic supply such as lajes and descoberto reservoirs which have persistent dominance of picocyanobacteria are mandatory especially since many species of this group can potentially produce harmful toxic metabolites including allelopathic substances and microcystins domingos et al 1999 jasser and callieri 2017 the occurrence of those compounds is increasing in aquatic ecosystems śliwińska wilczewska et al 2018 which threatens both water and food consumption as toxic compounds enter aquatic food webs via zooplankton that reach higher trophic levels 5 conclusions the data analysis by hea modeling performed here was very successful in elucidating picocyanobacterial dynamics influenced by abiotic and biotic factors rwcs and electrical conductivity were key environmental drivers of picocyanobacterial peaks the hea models highlighted for the first time in the literature that rotifers small sized cladocerans and copepods mainly nauplii can directly or indirectly control picocyanobacteria in tropical mesotrophic reservoirs this was however dependent on rwcs and electrical conductivity and modulated by thresholds of ph secchi disk extinction and water temperature acknowledgments the authors would like to thank
